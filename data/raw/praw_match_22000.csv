0,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, because its still an ongoing investigation at my work. Sorry for discretion, don't want to disclose too much info

I (24M) Work as a retail associate, about a week ago I was taking my lunch break with one of my friends (26F), and we were just talking and sharing laughs, she told me that she had a weird lump on her thigh and told me to touch it, obviously I said no, but she kept insisting how strangely big it was, eventually I succumbed to her wish and tried to feel for the lump, when she then started moaning as a joke. I chuckled and thought nothing of it, but another female coworker (35F, Typical Karen tbh) started to yell at me that this was not the place to be touching each other, and if we  wanted to do that we should get a room. My friend coworker was visibly embarrassed, and I apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. Karen didn't let it go, she told me she would be contacting HR so that 'We could learn our lesson'.

We got in to a full on argument which lead to Karen saying while looking at coworker friend 'How would you like it if you saw me touching somebody like this while you ate?', she then proceeded to rub my leg in a mocking way.

HR and I had a meeting, and told me she was completely right, and that the touching violated one of their policies. I told them that I would like to file a complaint countering hers because she had rubbed my leg as well. The HR representative, who also happens to be your typical Karen told me to 'stop being ridiculous' and 'quite frankly, you're being an asshole because you're just trying to justify what you did. She's a girl, do you feel harassed?'

Obviously the legalities are not up to me, and its up to HR to set it in stone, but AITA for counter claiming? I feel like I have every right to claim harassment from a coworker even if she is a girl.

Edit- I should also add, HR told me that I instigated the whole situation, and that none of the events would have occurred if we maintained a 'professional relationship' w/ everyone",34,44,0.83
1,Asshole,"
My partner is seriously overweight. We are trying to eat healthy and shed some lbs together. 

Partner absolutely doesn’t believe in ‘diet’ versions of anything, due to the thought that it disrupts blood sugar levels etc and ‘will make you fatter in the long run’. Despite me showing them there are no conclusive studies that prove this, my partner prefers normal sprite, coke, etc. It isn’t a taste thing either, as I’ve noticed they can’t tell the difference UNTIL it’s pointed out that the soda is sugar free. Sadly due to this, my partner wasn’t dropping any weight as easily in a day they’d consume at least 2 litres of full fat soda. 

My partner is very reliant on soda to get through their day. They’ve asked me if I’ll take over in the kitchen in terms of cooking and planning out meals. I’ve agreed to do it but for the past few weeks I’ve been subbing in the zero soda and they’ve been none the wiser and also they’ve lost a few more lbs than anticipated. Obviously, we’re both over the moon.

This leaves me in a moral conundrum- do I keep up the charade, or come clean? I really am concerned about my partners health as the doctor has advised that they are prediabetic, and I love my partner more than anything. I’m just concerned that if I tell my partner, they’ll revert back to the full sugar stuff and it will be impossible to get them to come round a second time.

CONFESSION EDIT: I came clean to my wife. She was very surprised, called me a sneaky asshole, but overall surprised that she wasn’t able to tell the difference and she’s still lost a good amount of weight. I’ll be continuing meal prep for her and she has said off her own back she may as well continue drinking the diet stuff, although both of us have agreed we should start to look towards alternatives such as seltzer water etc. Thank you everybody for your input.",459,2046,0.94
2,Not the A-hole,"Our doctor said that if we can avoid toddlers for the first 6-8 weeks then we may as well avoid them as they can carry a lot of germs which would be a cold for them but a hospital visit for a new born. 

We’re not people that get caught up in the fear factor internet blogs about babies but being that our doctor said this - we obliged. 

No one that has a toddler had an issue with this. Most of our friends said they weren’t going to bring them anyway for that exact reason and if not they were very sweet about it and totally fine. My sister in law though has taken it personally. She thinks we’re stopping them meeting their niece and stopping the cousins from meeting. I’ll add that we said they can come see her and we’d love them to but she thinks that’s not possible without their daughter (who had a bad cough just last week). She is always creating false drama and she’s so good at it that me and wife starting thinking are we crazy? Are we the assholes?

3,Not the A-hole,"Most of the story is in the title but I'll still give some background info. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. So my boyfriend has been estranged from his family since he was 16, he moved out of state and has been on his own since. We've known each other for years but started being romanticly involved a 1 1/2 years ago. I honestly never realized how much you could love someone and even if things moved a bit fast we were in love. We made a decision to start a family together but unfortunately life doesn't really follow a set plan. 

He has been in a comma for 4 days now and the doctors have declared him brain dead. It's been a rough few days but we have finally gotten everything squared away and arrangements for taking him off of life support and the funeral have been made.  His parents have been really amazing through all of this, we've cried together and talked about what I want to do about the pregnancy. Things have seemed easy going. 

He doesn't have a lot of stuff, he was a kind of minimalist so most of the things in our room have been added by us as a couple. His mom has now expressed interest in coming to our home to ""go through things"" and ""make sure all of his affairs are in order."" He and I are introverted af and the thought of someone just going through things deciding what they want to take or what they want to do doesn't sit well with me. 

This all happened so suddenly but before we had a plan see a notary and meet with a lawyer to get our will set so we would be each other's decision maker in the event something happened. The appointment was set for the Friday after everything happened so we didn't have anything in order for me to take over. I was worried about what that would mean going forward but his parents were willing to listen to my input and things have gone well I would say. 

My biggest issue with her going through stuff is she has no idea who he is now or the things he was into. He's an amazing man but there are parts of his life that I think would be better kept from family. I have given her things that I thought would be comforting or sentimental to her but she still wants to go through stuff. I feel like maybe I'm being bit standoffish but something about being told ""I need to come over and go through his things,"" didn't sit well with me. So, WIBTA if I tell her that I don't want her to go through our stuff but if she has anything in mind she wants I'll look for it and more than likely give it to her but need to process and think it all over

*Update

His parents, mom mostly, we're emotional when the items were dropped off but have somewhat calmed down. I have an appointment to meet with a lawyer tommorow and my family is here with me for support. I have heard some information about the funeral but they are now wanting to sell his items to pay for it. My plan is to not allow them into the house until I talk with a lawyer so I can have a better understanding of my rights. Thank you everyone for you advice and support. If there is anything worth updating after the meeting I will.",82,583,0.96
4,Asshole,"Throwaway for reasons.

Context: My parents have been married for 40 years, and while they've always been amazing and involved parents to me (29) and my sister (35), they haven't exactly been the shining example of an old couple in love. It's not that they get in particularly bad fights or anything disturbing/violent/traumatizing like that, but I think that at this point, while they still love each other, they have long fallen out of love. It doesn't really bother us. These things happen and we have no complaints about our relationship with our parents, individually and as a couple.

Recently, my dad and I went on a trip. I'm a light sleeper, and almost daily, I'd wake up at like 3am or so to my dad on the phone in the next room. It wasn't anything indecent, just him recounting his day, etc. But one phone call he ended with ""I love you"", which isn't really something my parents do. This isn't the first time my sister and I caught my dad though (seen texts on his phone, etc.), so we're both convinced that he's cheating on our mom.

To be honest, while I still think this is a dick move by our dad, I also kinda get why he does it. My mom and dad are such opposites that it's a wonder they even ended up together. My dad is one of those former golden boys. Alpha male, a total extrovert, and in constant want of emotional attention. My mom is this intellectual lady boss who pours her life and soul into three main areas: her children, her siblings, and her work. My dad is a far fourth, and she isn't affectionate at all toward him. Obviously, my dad's needs aren't met by my mom, but he's still a douche for going this route instead of dealing with it like an adult. Plus we're pretty sure that if my mom found out, most of her hurt/anger will not be because of a broken heart, but rather a wounded ego.

My sister and I agreed not to tell our mom about it. We think that literally no one would benefit from us doing so. They're both semi-retired now, and mom still gets fulfillment from her advocacy work while dad might get fulfillment from this. The result is a peaceful and fun family. I don't even think my dad actually meets up with the woman, as he's always driving mom around or at home. He's a devoted father and a very present husband, so I have no resentment toward him for letting his cheating get in the way of his family responsibilities.

Our parents have always been great parents to us, and never left us wanting emotionally, economically, etc., and as such, it isn't our place to throw this wrench onto their marriage. But I recently confided in a friend about this and they said it's an asshole move to not tell my mom this as she deserves to know the truth. Still, like I said, I honestly don't think anything is to gain from it, PLUS a part of us (my sister and I) think my mom already knows anyway, and as such, we don't want to force her to confront something she doesn't want to.

8,Asshole,"So I’m a girl, in second year uni, and I’ve been getting tutored in biochem by this medical student for the past semester. He’a really helpful, and also super hot and nice. Exactly my type.

A month ago, I met up with him to do a final review before my exam. After our session, we started talking about our personal lives, like what we were doing in the summer. He said he will be doing a research job at the hospital which I will also be interning at. I thought it was such an awesome coincidence and said, “So, maybe we can hang out a bit during the summer then?” He replied, “Yeah, that’d be great.” So I felt very confident and said, “If you’re free tonight, maybe we can go for a drink or something?”

He then said, “I’m actually engaged.” There was an awkward silence. We said goodbye and left. Now it’s the summer, and I just started interning at the hospital. I saw him last Friday doing an orientation. I went over and said Hi to him, and he said hello back. We had a short conversation, and I asked him if he wanted to do lunch on Monday. He said he will “get back to me” by the weekend.

Well the weekend passed and he didn’t say anything. I figured his fiancee didnt let him attend. Kind of controlling but whatever. I saw him again this morning, and asked about lunch. He said he can’t make it because of a “prior commitment”. I laughed and joked, “Your fiancee doesnt have to know.” He did not find it funny. He then made an excuse to leave and was kind of rude about it.

I felt really awkward afterwards. Also a bit annoyed that he responded so weirdly to an innocent joke. AITA? Or is he overreacting?",73,48,0.63

11,Not the A-hole,"A little background: I’ve been working at this small engineering company for about seven years. I started as a tech and now I’m “production manager” (because my boss micromanages everything so I don’t really “manage” much).  But I am the guy that has been working there the longest and I know how to do everything. We usually have a staff of about seven but three guys quit on us in the past eight months, with the last two guys quitting a couple of months ago. The turnover is all thanks to my definitely-an-asshole boss. 

So now he hired two new guys and they are completely clueless... I’ve been training them on very basic tech skills which are starting to affect my responsibilities.

Having said that, I’m in the convenient position of being the ONLY guy that knows how to do everything. I’m sure they would be fucked if I gave them a 2 week notice even a 3 week. But I just want to go elsewhere... 

BUT for a price and I’ll put up with his bullshit and train his noobs for $20k more a year. 

Aside from my shitty current job situation, WIBTA for flat out giving him basically an ultimatum on my salary? Of course I wouldn’t demand it, I would ask for the raise politely and if he refuses I would turn in my notice the next day.

Edit:  Hey everyone! This was one of my first posts and and didn’t expect to get this much feedback.. sorry it took so long but I’m very superstitious and paranoid about speaking too soon...

12,Asshole,"This happened a while ago and I felt conflicted. I was eating at a somewhat expensive restaurant with my friend and I needed to keep some money for the train ride back home and anything else I would need.

The food ended up costing about 40 dollars and I thought weather or not I should tip or not considering the fact I didn’t have much money left. I decided not to tip in the end and when the waiter came he said

Waiter: “The price doesn’t include the service you know.”

Me: “Yeah I’m not tipping sorry.

Waiter: “You know it’s rude to not tip 10% of the meal.

Me: I can tip you 2 dollars. (It was the most I felt I should use)

Waiter: “Whatever just forget it! Tips are my income you know!

Then the waiter left and I felt kind of bad but I thought it was kind of rude of him to sort of guilt me into tipping him.

So AITA?

14,Not the A-hole,"So I'm a 40 year old man. I've been in the gym for over 20 years. Ita a huge part of my life but I dont bring it up to people I'll answer questions but only of asked and I try to change the subject. I'm a very introverted person. I only have 2 real friends and they are from childhood. I always workout alone. I enjoy it. Ita my time. I get any anger out or frustrations.

My time at the gym is sort of my sanctuary.

15,No A-holes here,"I (27M) grew up in an apartment without ever having any pets. I'm not used to their presence - for example, when one of my co-workers occasionally brings their dog to work, my productivity goes down and I do my best to avoid it. Of course, I can handle them when I'm visiting someone (it's their place, after all) though it's hard for me to fall asleep with a cat moving around.

My girlfriend (29F) is a complete opposite - she loves animals, grew up in family house with pets (2 cats inside, 1 dog outside) and now that we live together (50m² / 540ft² apartment with 30m² / 323ft² terrace), she misses the presence of pets a lot and asked me if we could get one (kitty or a puppy) several times.

So far, I rejected it every single time for a variety of reasons:

* I don't like their presence (which means extra stress while at home where I want to relax and recharge).
* I'm worried that something would happen to my belongings (e.g. new TV, multiple LEGO sets on display) or those that belong to the apartment (sofa).
* I don't want to spend time and money to take care of them. I understand that many people get some kind of emotional support in exchange for it but for me it'd be just an extra stress and waste of time and money.

Today, her co-worker asked if we could take care of their dog (*Cane Corso* which seems like a bigger breed) for 3 weeks in summer. She would gladly accept it in a heartbeat but the decision is up to me.

Normally I'd reject it. I would consider a smaller breed but this one feels too big for our apartment. On the other hand, it's only short term, I don't want to be selfish and maybe I should try to compromise. At the same time, I don't want to be pressured into something which I'm 100% certain I don't want.",47,35,0.87
16,Asshole,"I've been dating my finance (Jane) for more than two years now. She has become my life. She saved me from a dark time in my life, and honestly I owe her everything for dealing with me. We have a lot of shared interests: hiking, movies, road trips, and we occasionally disagree on certain things like any other couple. It never amounts to anything. 

However, she is vehemently against the recreational and/or medicinal use of cannabis. Personally, I think it's due to her having a strict adherence to the law that her VERY strict father taught her. She is the kind of person to drive BACK to Walmart and pay for an item if she doesn't find it on the receipt. 

I, on the other hand, have a long history of cannabis use that began with some trauma from my teenage years (in therapy, getting better every day). For years I smoked very regularly and worked at a cannabis-friendly job (I live in an illegal state next to a legal state) before I met Jane. I actually quit smoking for about our first 9 months of dating for my college internship. But last year after I finished College, I lost faith in my career options and returned to my previous pot-friendly job. Soon after, I was smoking pot again. I have now been smoking this entire past year. Usually it adds up to 60 dollars a month in expenses.

All the smoking has been done in secret. Which really makes me feel shitty. But I like to end my nights with some pot, I've never really thought that it hurts anyone. I smoke with a high quality air filter that basically neutralizes the dank pretty quickly; also I've started using a vape pen recently, which has no smell. 

Usually I smoke when she takes a nap, I get home from work (in my car with filter), she's at the gym, or when I walk the dog. I put in some eye drops to get the dry eye fixed and I'm good to go. She doesn't know the wiser because I'm not getting torched and acting stupid, and I get to relax a bit and let some anxiety go. 

Is this bad? I love Jane, and I know I'm lying to her by not telling her, but I really feel like cannabis isn't just something people use to get high, it really does help me. Only my therapist knows, and I don't plan on telling anyone else.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. I'll respond to as much as I can starting at 3pm ET when I get off work.

Edit 2: Thanks for the help everyone. I have a problem, and am still pain from my past. That much is clear. I've made a lot of mistakes and it just seems like cannabis is an escape from all of it. I hope one day I can know that I don't need it. But for now I'll be formulating a plan to tell her. Wish me luck. Even though I don't deserve any.",118,220,0.88

I (female) own a small-ish business (8 staff) with other 2 partners in a niche field. We're recruiting for a new senior staff member and have been for quite some time, it's a difficult post to fill.


We've interviewed someone who is perfect for the job, I've actually worked with him before and he's great, ideal for the job and our future plans. He would bring skills and knowledge to our business that would be extremely beneficial. However, I have since discovered that he is engaged to a very unsavoury lady (how or why, baffles me).


Based on this, I dont want to hire him.


She has actually physically attacked me in the past with a bottle (at random), to the point I was actually pressing charges against her (which were eventually dropped by myself), it affected me so much that I didn't want to go out in my home town for several months. Another friend of mine has had a similar experience with her too so it's not an isolated event. She's violent and unpredictable. I still have a scar on the back of my head from the attack.


The culture of our company involves partners quite regularly for lunches, dinners, weekend retreats etc so avoiding her would be impossible and quite frankly I dont want anything to do with this person, ever. 


Ultimately, I'm responsible for day to day management and the final decision is my call, but my partners feel I'm being unreasonable and I should let bygones be bygones for the sake of the business, but I'm threatened and intimidated by this individual and being the co owner of this business, I dont think I should put myself in that situation.

20,Asshole,"I’m a woman. As usual, the line for the women’s restroom was 8-10 women deep, but there was only one doorway leading to the both single person restrooms, one for each gender. As such, both men and women were standing in a single file line waiting to get in.

I’m next up, with one man and multiple women behind me. Well a guy walks out of the men’s restroom and the woman before me had JUST walked in, so I knew it’d be a minute before that one opened up. In the interest of keeping the line moving, I went into the men’s even though there was a man in line right behind me. I didn’t want to hold him up though (again, I just wanted to keep the line moving, and I *was* in front of him so I should get to go first), so I did my business quickly, and fwiw I was out before the woman who went into the other before me.

The guy looked a little disgruntled, but didn’t say anything. In my mind, if the bathrooms didn’t have gender markings then it would have made total sense for me to just go in to the next available one. But I ask if I’m TA because I now realize that while it’s not totally socially taboo for a woman to use the men’s restroom, it’d probably be seen as far less acceptable for a man to use the women’s, so he wouldn’t have been able to use the next available if the other lady had gotten out before me.

24,Not the A-hole,"So, I work within a small very close, tight knit team (12 women in their late 20’s). When I say “work brunch” its probably more similar to getting brunch with 10 of your close friends. It’s a very liberal, feminist environment. I genuinely consider all of these women my best friends and family. The coworker of mine that loves showing the dick pics is closest to me than anyone else. 


We all went out to brunch and having a great time as per usual and she was chatting how tinder was going for her and starts showing us these dick pics she has asked for and “collects”. 
Let me be clear. I am no prude. I don’t care about the dicks themselves. A penis is a penis yo. But I was horrified that she was flashing these private pictures to us undoubtedly without the consent of the men to which the dicks belong to. Everyone at the table was laughing and commenting on the best of the dicks etc. but after a while I kind of snapped and said “hey, I don’t think you should be showing us those. I know I wouldn’t want my private pictures flashed to people other than the intended recipient” 


And everyone laughed and said, “oh whatever it’s not that big of a deal. If they send a nude on tinder this is what happens.” And tbh, when I was single it’s the reason I never sent nudes. But I doubled down and said “you don’t have their consent. Put it away” and half my team was like yeah. You right. And the other half was offended. And my friend flashing the pics launched into this whole “men are trash” complaint. 


And then we started arguing in earnest. I’m a huge feminist and said she was trying to hide behind a pseudo shitty feminist agenda to mask her inappropriate behavior. She ASKED for these photos. They were not sent without a warning or expectation. 


She stormed out of brunch mumbling about how I wasn’t even a feminist or a good friend. After she left, my team agreed with me on principle, but thinks I should have kept quiet about it and discussed it with her privately later. 
Now our work environment is tense as hell. 
Should I have tabled this for later? Or was I right to call her out?

28,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend who is in jail.  He's been there less than a year, but will probably will be transferred to a state prison in the near future to serve out a 3-5 year sentence.

I've moved across the country since he was locked up, so I don't have the chance to visit him.  I do write him a couple of times a month, and he reciprocates with lengthy letters.

The last few letters have become increasingly focused on the fact that he has no commissary funds on his account and that he wants money.  That implies that of all his other friends and family, nobody is giving him commissary funds.  He has burned a lot of bridges.  Before he went to jail, I've provided housing, food and transportation for him many times.  The last time he crashed on my couch, my tools disappeared (maybe $1,000 worth of tools).

The way the commissary works in his detention center is that you have a cashier's check written to the facility with his name and inmate number noted in the memo.  They take 10% off the top for processing the check, then apply the rest to his account.  Things he can buy include condiments, chips, soda, beef jerky, pencils, paper and other junk food items.  They charge 4-5x the normal cost of those items if he had the luxury of buying them at Walmart.  In short, it's a tax on prisoners and their friends to provide nonessential comfort items.

He's not looking for a $10 contribution either.  He's hoping I'll place $2-300 on his account, and I'm sure he'll ask for more when that's used up.

In my last letter, I told him that I'm not in a position to provide commissary funds, and he replied in a letter that I'm a ""dick friend"".

Basically, what the title says. One of my friends has been talking to this guy she met on a dating app for a few weeks now, and she seems to really like him a lot. At first when she began talking about him, I was supportive/excited for her. However, a few days ago she showed me a picture of him and it kinda shocked me. 

To put it bluntly, I have a...checkered past, and I used to buy H off this guy (I'm going on five years clean now). I remember back in the day he was an absolute scumbag - perhaps not surprising from a hard drug dealer. He treated any woman he was with like absolute shit. Of course, I know people change, and he may not be like that any more but I'm skeptical. I've asked around with old friends and they've confirmed he's still selling drugs. He's also the kind of guy who always comes across very charming at first and reveals his true colours later. Obviously, I don't want my friend getting mixed up with something like that. She's a couple years younger than me, and has confided in me before that she views me as an older brother figure. I really want to look out for/protect her, but at the same time, I don't want her to tell her this shit and then find out that he's a changed man and I've thrown a spanner in the works for no reason. WIBTA if I told her? Should I leave it and see what happens? Very conflicted rn.",56,90,0.89
31,Not the A-hole,"MIL is 94. My spouse and I have been together for 25 years, married for 22 of those. My MIL fits the criteria for a narcissist, and my spouse and I have discussed this at length; she will lie, dismiss, deflect, andf gaslight anyone she pleases to fit her own narrative. Mind, this is not new behavior for her, at all.

&#x200B;

My MIL has despised me from day one, to the point where my spouse cut off contact with her except for major holidays; MIL didn't recognize our marriage for nearly two years. In a house full of pictures of relatives, it's been only the last five or so that she's deigned to include one with my face.

&#x200B;

We currently live with her, for her benefit. She's in failing health after a combination of strokes, falls, and other illnesses common in the very elderly. She's continued her behavior to the point where one of the visiting nurses she had after a fall told her straight out that my spouse and I aren't legally **required** to help her at all, and she needed to straight up her act or she'd end up very alone.

&#x200B;

My spouse and I divide the labor; she deals with her mother's personal needs, I deal with the seemingly-endless laundry, cooking, and kitchen work.

&#x200B;

The final straw had happened. She was talking to my spouse about her last trip to the hospital, where she blames their lack of care to her on me, because I was in the room, implying that the nursing staff thought I was a pervert because I didn't leave when they worked on her. Mind, never has this been a problem; either I'm asked ot leave, do so on my own volition, or visibly turn away when they're working on her.

&#x200B;

This is not the first false accusation of abuse from her. I've never lain a hand on her unbidden, do my level best to not make her uncomfortable when she's dealing with personal things (cleaning herself, etc).

&#x200B;

At this point I've retreated from MIL. I still make sure she gets fed, her medications are set up and she's taking them, her clothes and bedding are clean, etc. - but I staunchly refuse to speak to her beyond what's necessary, spend any time with MIL I don't have to nor will I stay in the same room with her alone.

&#x200B;

My spouse thinks I 'need to 'get over it' and let it slide yet again. I see MIL as dangerous; if she gets her  complaints in the right ear it'll make my life hell whether she's found out to be a liar or not.

32,,"My house mate was pretty irritated this morning because I used the blender to make my breakfast around 9am and woke him up.  I’d get it if it were the weekend since people usually sleep in, but 9am is pretty late in the morning for most of the population during the week.  I’m actually pretty lucky I get to set my schedule 10-6 instead of most people who work something like 9-5.  

So, is this too early?

Edit:  This isn’t the USA, so we’re all working today

Info: I’m not sure his exact schedule.  He manages a retail store and is usually home by about 10ish at the latest and sometimes gets home before me on other days",334,1319,0.92

35,Not the A-hole,"Long story but I have the perfect husband, unless he's hanging out with one particular friend group. With this one group, he always gets so drunk that he's frequently sick when he gets home and I have to look after him and ruining my evening. We've had an argument each time this happens as it's ruined our plans before, with me pleading that he just drinks a soft drink or a shandy to slow down - he's old enough to know better.

So yesterday was a bank holiday, I had to work and he went golfing with this friend group. I walked home from work, made dinner and did the housework, including prepping both of our meals for the week as I'm also working tomorrow's bank holiday. Originally he was going to pick me up from work but I said not to worry so he didn't have to rush, and to meet me at home for dinner later. Half nine comes and I've eaten alone and cut him a plate out because I don't want to cramp his fun. Then I've taken off my makeup, got in my chillout gear (standard slob pyjamas, however NSFW) and put my feet up in the lounge.

I hear the key turning in the door and I already know he's drunk, then I hear his friends' voices following him in, his stupid smirk says that he thinks he's being a fun lad continuing the party back at home. I tell them to get out and his friends leave. I am fuming at this point. I have bad facial acne and I CANNOT take off my foundation for anyone except him and I'm also partially clothed - this is me at my most vulnerable.

We don't fight - apart from when these friends are involved.

I've asked him to sleep in the spare room - I can't look at him. There was no point talking to him last night, as he was so drunk, but I am so appalled by his behaviour and this invasion of my personal space that I don't even know how to start this conversation.

In my state you can divorce without a 12 separation as long as you agree to a property split and have no children involved. We check both of those boxes. Yet again, whenever I try to move towards the divorce she has a fit and says I’m rushing her.

I knew she wouldn't take my advice as I've never worked in that industry, so I lied and passed on the experiences had by another friend of mine as my own. I didn't make up anything, the only deceit is that I've never stepped foot in there but my friend worked there for 9 months.

38,Asshole,"About 1.5 years ago I found out my (now ex) wife had several affairs. We we're married for about a year when I had to make a backup of her Phone. I had a hunch and went through the her chat history.. and found out everything. All in all she had 4 affairs in the year that we we're married. One starting 2 weeks after our marriage and 3 others starting 4 / 5 months later.

What made this complex was the fact that she had been suffering from Postpartum depression ever since the birth of our first daughter. She had delusions as well, believing that the child was swapped during childbirth and not hers, being abused by day care employees (or grandparents), that the child was autistic.. etc

She went into therapy, citing extremely dark thoughts and urges and was unable to be in the same room with me. Or talk with me without becoming enraged.

**Long story short**

She blamed me for everything, walked out of mediation.. made the divorce hell and told everyone that *""DutchDad did something so evil and terrible that she couldn't stay with me anymore. But due to the fact that DutchDad was the father of her children she couldnt tell what it was""*

To this day I haven't found out what ""the evil thing"" was..  I refuse to fight with her and have gone ""grey rock"" as every response triggers her.

Since about a month I'm officially divorced from her and I'm  strict ""no contact'. But our oldest is blaming herself and is in therapy. The therapists think our oldest is suffering from ADHD or has an attachment disorder.

What I do think is that keeping the reason for the divorce a secret is negatively impacting her. Her life was ripped apart without any clear reason. ""Mommy and Daddy don't like each other anymore but will always love you"" is met with anger. Even at age 7 she understands that I'm keeping secrets from her.

So I've decided to tell her the next time she asks questions about this. But in an age appropriate way.

**\[Update - Guess IWBTA\]**

Looking at the responses the consensus is YTA. But to be honest most of the responses lack any explanation, experience or are just plain assholes themselves. Somehow people are missing the point that I'm not trying to punish my ex. I'm seriously worried about what the constant lies are doing to my daughter. But.. there are some responses from people who experienced this situation as a kid.  Some are YTA, some are NTA. But the experiences of people who were told as a kid had a \*lot\* more negative impact than the ones who weren't told. So I guess the best course of action is to just keep it neutral and refuse to answer her. She will get mad (again).. but so be it. I'd rather have her mad with me than hurt her.",496,1383,0.95

40,Everyone Sucks,"Hi.

So there was quite the important paper for Philosophy to be handed in today. The whole class thought it was for next week, and when a girl asked the teacher yesterday about the date and he said it was for today everyone scrambled and started doing it Sunday afternoon.

That includes my group of friends, who I was grouped with for this paper, there are five of us in the group and we stayed from 1pm until 2am yesterday doing this thing. All throughout that time two of the five guys did absolutely nothing. So around 1:30 am we are finishing up and the guy responsible for formatting the whole thing doesn’t put those dudes’ names in the paper. I asked him about it and he said it was because they didn’t do anything, and I agreed without a battle because well, they really didn’t help at all.

Come this morning, we print out the paper, go to class, and hand it in. We didn’t tell the two guys that they weren’t included as authors of it. Though we did send pictures of the paper in our WhatsApp group, including one of the cover, where their names aren’t present, so if they had bothered to even check the group chat they would notice this. It’s mid-class right now and the teacher is talking and these guys have no clue they are left out of a paper that is worth something like 40% of our grade for this subject.

So, AITA?

EDIT: So the teacher said that because of the confusion about the dates all groups could hand their paper in on Wednesday for full marks if we wanted to tidy it up or something since it was so sudden. Me and the two others who actually did something talked to the other two, and told them we had cut them from the paper because they didn’t do anything. They were angry as you’d expect, and the reason for not helping that one of them gave literally made me want to punch him, dude said “you know I don’t like philosophy and it was Sunday, I thought you guys could handle it”. Anyhow, seeing as we can hand it in again on Wednesday for full marks we told them that they need to come up with three good questions for each philosopher, or we would turn in the paper without their names on it again on Wednesday.",404,2417,0.97
41,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend (20M) is not out of the closet to anyone in his family and he always said he intended to keep it that way until he was 100% independent. I (20M) respect and understand that and I never felt bad about him keeping his sexuality and our relationship a secret. We both live in a college town away from home so we can be ourselves and it's not a problem.

A couple of weeks ago, he went to his parents' home for a week. He started feeling anxious about going home a few days before and said how they always get political just to provoke him, always make him go to church with them, and ask him about girlfriends and whatnot, basically they do a lot of things that make him feel like crap. So I got the idea to write him a bunch of cute notes and hide them in his backpack, wallet, socks, for him to find and maybe feel a bit better. It was stuff like ""I love you, I miss you, I can't wait to see you again, When you read this I'll be thinking about you"", you know just lame cutesy stuff. Except, I accidentally signed my name on one of them without thinking. And it's a very male-sounding name, nothing that could be a nickname for a female name.

One thing that I didn't know was that my boyfriend's mom has a habit of going through his stuff to find if anything needs to be washed. He hates it so he stopped bringing dirty clothes home at all, except he didn't know she still went through his stuff every time, despite never finding anything to wash.

The first few days he found several of the notes and he called me and I could tell he was very happy. But then, his mom found several of the others, including the one with my name on it in his clothes and the whole family freaked out on him. They sat him down and had a ""family meeting"" of 4 hours, during which they just kept telling him what a disappointment he was and that he must get help and they will get help for him. They even considered him dropping out and going to a different college but his sister cleverly concluded that if he was gay in one town, he'd be gay in another too. So nothing horrible has happened yet, but it might.

When he came back, he told me all about it and didn't seem like he was angry at me in particular. Then he shared what had happened with our friends, and they were the ones that thought I was the fucking devil for doing it. They were all personally offended (saying I should have known better, I knew where he was going etc.) and they've been so persistent about me being the person to blame here, that they kind of swayed my boyfriend as well, and now he's upset with me too. We haven't seen each other in a couple of days, but whenever we talk, he just cries on the phone and tells me how horrible he feels, not knowing how his parents will punish him for this, and every time I say how sorry I am, he gets angry because me being sorry won't fix things.",211,933,0.93
42,Not the A-hole,"Guys this has started bothering. I'm a 27 year old female who has worked since 15 years old, still struggling financially and suffering from chronic pain and chronic depression. 

The thing is, the older I get the more I blame my parents for my life now. I was set up to fail!

My parents are deeply religious. From a young age I was indoctrinated with Christian views of us vs them, separated from 'worldly' children, and isolated from the pop culture of my childhood.

I was homeschooled and went to grade 10 only. All science was creationism. I grew up believing scientists were all willingly believing a lie, namely, evolution. Because I didn't go to school, I never had the opportunity to win scholarships or participate in clubs. My mother insisted that uni was a one way ticket to hell - she talked me out of it over and over again. 

My parents don't believe in contraception. They had 12 children! I'm the eldest. My parents also never *dah da da dahh* vaccinated any of us, ever. 

At 16 I realised I was gay. I was told I was depraved and sinful, and that I'd grow out of it. My mother introduced me to a Christian group. The cult fucked with my head. It took years for me to undo that damage, and another 10 yrs to walk away from that religion altogether.

My parents are terrible with money. We never talked about money objectively and never once spoke about how to save money. My father told me at 18 years of age to stop freeloading because I was still at home and working and studying. 

I had no year 12 and no financial or emotional support to try for uni, so I did a trade course and got into a low paying but very reliable trade which I've been in for the last 10 years. My parents paid for it thankfully. They haven't helped set me up in any other way.

My father quit his job *just* before his long service, for no reason. Right now, they live on government aid. 

I've helped support them at times. I've had to support 2 of my siblings with housing/money.

Now my parents have isolated themselves in the middle of the country where there is no cell signal.

T top it off, my 16 year old sister was in abusive relationship and got pregnant. She insists she wanted to keep it, but honestly, she had no choice.

Why AITA? Because they love me, gave me life. They are beautiful, loving people who have worked hard (not in productive ways, but still) for their family. My mum knew better coming from a well off respectable family, but my father grew up in foster homes. How can I be angry at him? The reason he left his job is because I suspect he has undiagnosed PTSD. 

AITA for feeling so much resentment at the way they raised me and failed to set me up in education, skills, money or even healthwise and how it's *still* affecting me?

TLDR: parents never set me up with finances or a decent education, fed me bad religion, never vaccinated me or my 11 other siblings, use government welfare, and insist on my baby sister being a mother to an abusive boyfriend (not still with bf, but keeping baby).",32,68,0.76
43,Not the A-hole,"I might be the asshole and I am prepared to take whatever the judgement.

I am married and have a daughter and a step daughter. I love them both dearly. But I am having a small problem when it comes to their birthday parties.

The arrangement for the last few years has been that for my step-daughters birthday party, we go halves for it with her mother. Her birthday also happens to fall on a month where my partner and I get large bonuses (we work for the same company and together we get approx 4K extra on this month). Our salaries are not extravagant and this money always goes straight away on a holiday or to pay off student loan or something we need for the house.

Over the last few years I have noticed my step daughters parties have really taken a ramp up. A few years ago we paid 70, and her mother paid 70. This year we paid 200 and her mother paid 200. I also feel it’s important to add that her mothers half gets paid for by her parents as she is a trainee nurse and lives at home with them. So personally, she sees no issue with making the parties as expensive as she can.

Now half of the problem is that I do feel that 400 on a birthday party for a six year old is just ridiculous- however that was organised the mother and my partner just paid what she told him too.

But the other half of the problem, is that my daughters birthday falls a few months before the bonus, straight after Christmas. So we are always feeling very tight for money. This year we had a few of her friends over to our house, spent approx 40 on food and drink and it was lovely. 

However when it came to my step-daughters birthday this year, my daughter got upset and asked why she couldn’t have such a big party. I explained that because of the situation she has two sets of parents paying for it and that she just has me and daddy.

But I am starting to feel resentful about it and don’t want to make my daughter sad next year when 10x as much is spent on her step-sisters party than hers.

So WIBTA if I mentioned to my husband that I feel like he should be more firm with his daughters mum on the limit of the cost of the party? I think it should be more in line with what we paid the first time (70ish), because there’s a lot we could do with the spare money and also it will feel more fair towards my daughter.",242,1569,0.97

There were a few women with the baby and they all started laughing. The baby would then become quiet for a little bit however every 20-30 seconds the baby would make a noise. On top of this the women would talk about what ever they wanted.

I tend to need silence in a movie so I became annoyed and about 15 minutes into the movie I said ""Take you baby outside. This is rude for everyone else.""

54,Not the A-hole,"I  (25f) work in a big boxed retail store and have for about 5 years now, our company does have a dress code, but not one that has ever been heavily pushed by our HR or Management in regards to some atire ( logos on shirts, athletic pants etc) 

About 3 weeks ago, I was pulled into the office by my direct manager in regards of my choice of pants (I usualy wear either Jeans or Yoga pants, depending on the ammount of physical work I'll be doing that day) and was told by him that it was no longer acceptable for me to be wearing yoga pants. 

Now, seeing as how we recently had a change up in management, I just assumed that they were finally pushing dress code policy, and letting people know individualy, I was totaly fine with it, apologized and said it  wouldn't happen again, and moved on with my day.

After a week had gone by, I mentioned it to one of my friends who was wearing yoga pants that day (as well as other girls/ guys wearing athletic gear)  and she said no one had mentioned anything to her, and that she hadn't heard anything about it from anyone else. Confused, I casually mentioned it to a few other people, and all of them confirmed that nothing had been said to them.

Annoyed , I went to our HR manager and asked her about the whole thing,  she flat out told me the new rule was just for me. She said there had been complaints from female customers about my wearing yoga pants (That it was unprofessional) , as well as comments from both female associates (saying I wore them for attention) and males (disgusting and derogative comments about my ass) and that they decided to enforce dresscode on me to protect myself, and how customers saw our business. 

Disgusted and horribly embarrassed, I told her that  singling me out would not make the situation better, and that as it is a company policy , it should apply to everyone. She told me she discussed that with management, but because they have allowed it for so long, staff would push back, and that it is not a hill they want to die on. 

My next shift at work, I showed up again in yoga pants, and was pulled in again by management. They reminded me about our conversation from the previous week, and threatened to send me home. I told them about the conversation I had with HR, and refused to change my choice of clothing  until it was mandatory store wide. They told me this was only about me and not to concern myself with anyone else, I disagreed, said what they were doing was highly sexist, and that if they continued to enfore that rule on just me, I would take it to our area HR manager. 

A few days ago, we received a store wide communication stating that as a store, they would now be enforcing the dresscode, and anyone not follwing would be sent home, without pay.

I work at a smaller grocery store as a cashier, nothing huge like Walmart we usually only have 3-5 employees in at a time. So, anyways, today we were a little low on staff, right in the middle of a shift change, and its the Sunday before memorial day so everything is already a little hectic.

I have a lady in line who has 4 children with her, One of her children (roughly 9/10yrs old) Had a box of ice cream sandwiches  He asked his mom if it would be okay if he could go put them back in the freezer to which his mother said ""Nuh-uh! just give them to her, she'll put them back."" This bothered me a bit. but i didn't really think too much of it.

So the kid hands me the ice cream and, I say something along the lines of ""Thanks, bud. If you did really want to take it back for me that would be super nice, and helpful! We have a pretty long time, so I don't know when the next chance I'll have to put it up!"" I said that in a calm friendly manner,  and the kid replied ""sure, no problem!"" also in a calm friendly manner. His mom got really upset and exclaimed ""It's her job! You don't have to do anything. because she's to lazy to do it herself!"" and went on to ask me who I thought I was trying to maker her kid to do my work for me, and why I think it's appropriate to ""parent"" her child. The woman is totally irate. I tell her that I'm sorry if I offended her, that it wasn't my intention, and just explain that we had lost a lot of product today because we were unable to take it back, because lines had been so long. I was calm, professional, and (I think) fairly rational. She, of course, just got angrier and demanded a manager.

Like i know that people kinda just suck. I've done customer service for 8 years, but nothing that really made me question if I was the asshole in the situation until now.

The point of the game is that each senior is assigned a target by the host of the game. Once given your target, you must find them and shoot them with a water gun and move on in the game. You have to secretly and anonymously kill your target. 

&#x200B;

I was assigned my girlfriend (ironically). She was doing well in the game as she had 3 kills, and I haven't. I decided to let her have her fun then shoot her the next day. I told her to come out to the front of the school, and I did a ""drive-by"" with a water gun, shooting her with a sniper water gun. Once I come drive back to the school, she avoids me. She yells at me, and ignores me. 

&#x200B;

She said I humiliated her, made her look stupid, and was being unfair. She got upset and started questioning me. She started saying what I did was unfair and ""suspicious"" how the host made her my target. She also created a conspiracy that I paid the host to make her my target. She yelled at me in front of my friends, and pushed me aside and walked away from me. I felt guilty and felt stupid.

58,No A-holes here,"A little background: I’m a private duty pediatric nurse to a medically fragile child. We’ll call him Danny (10M). I’ve been with this patient for about 2 years. His parents are incredibly wealthy and can afford 24/7 nurses and or nannies for this kiddo. 

The relationship between myself and my patient’s mom has always been friendly but professionally distant. I like that way. Recently she commented on how well I work with Danny and  asked me if I had kids his age. Even though I felt a little uncomfortable I shared some basic information. I have 2 girls 13 and 11 years old. She got super excited and said, “You should bring them over so they can play in the pool or arcade room!”  The pool has waterfalls and slides. I know my kids would love it. 
Now Danny doesn’t have many friends because of his medical limitations and enjoys when he has family over with kids around his own age.  So I’m torn.  I don’t want my personal life tangled with my professional life. I don’t want to be the asshole either.

From everyone else, the general consensus is, “You don’t have to, but it might be a good experience for all.” 
Thank you all for the advice and different perspectives.

59,Not the A-hole,"I went out to breakfast with a couple friends this morning, and had a little argument with them that I'd love y'all to help settle.

I ordered a really simple meal of bacon, eggs and pancakes. We got our orders and I noticed that my pancakes had banana in them, I didn't order banana pancakes but I like bananas and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of sending them back, so I ate them. When the waitress brought our checks, she handed me mine and said something along the lines of

""I accidentally gave you banana pancakes instead of plain and unfortunately that's a dollar extra and we are going to have to charge you for them"" 

I was a little taken aback, being charged for the waitress's mistake, but it was just a buck and I didn't want to throw a fit over a dollar. I did eat them instead of sending them back, and I figured she was probably trying to save herself from getting in trouble with the manager by having me pay for her mistake. I kinda just laughed and jokingly said ""oh that's fine, I'll just take the dollar out of your tip."" She was very clearly offended by this, and didn't laugh at my admittedly dumb joke or say anything, just quickly gathered up our plates and left.

After she left, both of my friends (one of whom is a waiter at Olive Garden) started ripping into me, saying that making a joke about her tip is really demeaning and makes me seem like I'm on a power trip. AITA? Maybe I shouldn't have made the joke, but I feel like a lot of people would have thrown a fit over being charged extra in my situation.

My wife was in the backseat trying tic alm him down but it wasn't working. My mother in law basically started having a shit fit at my wife to calm him down b/c ""crying so much could give him a hernia"" and guilting her about being a bad mother. My wife took him out of the seat while I basically couldn't pull over anywhere (we were on a bridge). I got really upset and told her not to take him out of the seat. I was not really yelling but on the verge saying he's a baby, they cry, we can all be adults and stay calm for 10 more mins until we get home.

I finally was able to pull over and she tried to calm him down outside the car. When he's calm we get him back in the seat and start driving again. But of course he's upset (teething it turns out), and they force me to pull over again bc my MIL can't cope with him crying so loud and starts yelling at my wife again. At this point I blew up and told her she needs to act like an adult and just remain calm and stop stressing my wife out and forcing her to be unsafe with our child.

I feel like a shitbag for escalating this, but it's not the first time it's happened. I've talked to my wife about it, but she always says we just have to deal with it bc her mom has stress/anxiety issues.

62,Not the A-hole,"Hey r/AmItheAsshole community, here's my issue:

I (29M) work in the TV industry. Recently, I temporarily joined a crew: A weird circumstance meant that someone of my skillset and union affiliation was needed ASAP, and I'm a friend of a producer, so— that's how I got the job.

On set, I ended up quickly befriending a crewmate— we'll call her Amanda (27ishF). Over the few days I was present, she seemed genuinely interested in me— even getting a little physical with a playful jostle or a hug.

On my last day on set, I asked Amanda for her number, which she gave me.

I already could have gotten it off of the call sheet, (a document given to film crews with the day's schedule and crew contact info) ...but I figured asking her specifically would make it consensual, not a creepy misuse of a professional document.

I tried texting her the next day and got a message delivery failure. I was pretty disheartened, but also confused— did she give me a fake number, or was something else at play? I checked the call sheet and found the number was accurate except for a single digit— the last one. So I figured it was probably just an error on my part when I typed it in, as I hadn't even read it back to her.

I texted the correct number, and reached her! We spoke on the phone, she laughed when I explained the one-number-off thing, all seemed well. She suggested we go out later in the week. She ended up picking a place that was already a favorite spot of mine.

The night of the date rolled around, she didn't show up, even after confirming she would in the morning.

I had texted her 20 minutes after she was meant to arrive, just a quick ""Hey I'm here! You running late?"" to no response. I figured I had been ghosted and that was the end of it... and was surprised to get a text the next morning, when she told me she totally forgot about our plans and her phone died... but was willing to make it up to me, drinks on her! (I turned her down at first, saying she didn't need to do that... but she insisted.)

Attempted to meet for drinks... no dice. Didn't even get an excuse, just... no further contact. At this point I decided I was done— no apologies, no more meet-up attempts. I had given her plenty of outs, but she insisted on drinks... only to not show up. I blocked her number and figured that was the end of it.

Friday night I was catching up with my producer friend, as well as two of his female friends— who he also had brought on to the production.

One of them asked about Amanda and I, noting our chemistry on set, and the other friend immediately shot her a wide-eyed, clenched look. So I pressured her ***[EDIT: the other friend. Not Amanda.]*** to tell me what was up, which she reluctantly did.

Apparently, Amanda intentionally gave me a fake number because she didn't want me to contact her, and then told other crew mates I asked her out and joked about me thinking I had a chance with her.

I explained what happened on my end— and showed the relevant texts of her confirming plans, apologizing, and making new plans. My producer friend was particularly frustrated by this, calling it unprofessional... and soon after, he fired her.

My producer's friends disagreed with the choice to fire her— as did I— and further told me I was culpable in that I shouldn't have brought these personal dating issues to the attention of a producer, especially a male producer. I argued that once Amanda was brought up and there was clearly something going on, it was only natural for me to ask about it— and to show my side of the story. 

But I didn't expect him to fire her! She doesn't even report to him! Am I still culpable? Did I make a poor choice, anywhere in this? AITA? Or is she?

After 10 minutes of his mum telling him he needs to apologise he finally did with a weak ""Sorry"" so I told him. ""I don't accept your apology. You're not sorry because you did it you're only sorry because you got in trouble for it.""

not sure if it makes a difference but to the people telling me to make him work it off it's only 30 dollars. He was meant to be getting picked up today before I got home from work.

64,Everyone Sucks,"
So I work at a local brewery as a bus boy basically, and there was a family spanning ages 80+ to teenagers. 

Throughout the day they had been using a  gated pathway marked “THIS AREA IS OFF LIMITS TO CUSTOMERS, PLEASE USE THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO ENTER AND EXIT”  all day to return to their cars and grab things. This message is posted on a plaque clear to see on both ends of the pathway,  you’d have to be blind to miss it. It’s very frustrating to me when customers use this path way as it shows blatant disregard for the rules of the establishment as well as an inconvenience for the staff, as this is the path we use to stock the kitchen. 

Eventually the group leaves, and I move a garbage can in front of the gate so that it blocks the gate and sends a clearer message that we don’t want this path being used. One of the adults in the group returns to their table to grab a coat that was left behind, using the same off limits path and notices the garbage can. He then says to me

“Did you move this garbage can here just to block off the path? Why didn’t you just tell us to stop using it?” 

I said back to him

“We’ll sir I’m assuming you can read, and since you ignored the signs posted on both ends of the path, I assumed that me verbally telling you not to use the path wouldn’t make any impact either.” 

The man got upset and wanted an apology which I refused to give, and left after bitching to my manager who was then annoyed with me. I don’t blame my manager at all, just wanna know if I went too far.

65,Not the A-hole,"I realize this post may sound like I’m complaining about having the most loving mother in the world. And I realize that many people do not have a loving parent like this and my not understand my situation. But this is causing real problems in my life so read on if interested...

My mom’s whole life revolves around her children. Growing up she has been the most supportive person in my life and has always told me how we are her sole purpose in life. Now that we’re all adults and have moved out, she’s struggling with not having people around who constantly need her. 
She texts me baby pictures of myself almost daily, and every single day I get a shower of text messages that include lots of heart emojis and loving messages. 

She massively overprotected me from the world growing up so I had trouble adjusting to adulthood and especially manhood. I have felt like a child for most of my adult life because she unintentionally (maybe a little intentionally) made me feel guilty about growing up because she would have preferred I stay a child forever. 

These issues almost completely destroyed my 7 year relationship with my partner, but luckily I was able to save it after realizing how serious this was. 

It took me a lot of time, work, and introspection to get where I am now but I finally feel like a man, at age 30. 
However, she hasn’t changed and still sends me these messages daily.  

Whenever I see her in person she treats me like a child and baby talks to me and hugs me constantly, awkwardly rubs my back in the company of other people etc. Other people, including my partner, have commented on how weird it is. 

Honestly, I feel suffocated. But she’s not the kind of person who could handle hearing all of this. I don’t even know what she would do. She has a history of severe depression and anxiety. I’ve never told her any of this but it’s silently straining our relationship to the point that I don’t want to see or talk to her anymore.

Not sure what to do at this point, any advice?

66,Not the A-hole,"I love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. I moved into my current house last year after I got a dog, specifically because I wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. I bought her doggy door, and she loved it A few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. He eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. That was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. So then the chickens had monitored outside time. Then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. He keeps her locked in her cage all day when I'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. She can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. He's even started scolding me even when I let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if I'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200B;

It's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. He doesn't even pay rent on my house. He refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. When I remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. When I suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

At this point I think the only thing I can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. I know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. WIBTA if I asked him to move out?

67,Asshole,"My wife and I have been together for 8 years, married 4. We have one child with one on the way. We have always said we wanted two kids, but after many difficulties the first time around she only very reluctantly came around to having the second. We had discussed me having a vasectomy while she was pregnant, as things would only get more difficult around the house to have me out of commission for a few days. I agreed that it made the most sense, and we would do that.  My dad and several colleagues have gone through it, and it seems to be what people do when they are done having kids.

&#x200B;

Now she is 16 weeks along and she recently asked me to consider it again and when I would get it done. Having it just around the corner has made it FAR scarier to me in ways I had not fully appreciated at a distance. I started researching it more and really thinking about it. What if my family died in a tragic car accident? What if, god forbid, we ended up divorced? Would I regret my infertility later in life (I am 33)?

&#x200B;

Everyone seems to generally comment that ""his body, his choice"" on this subreddit in general about vasectomies. However, she says that she has gone through permanent changes to her body twice in order to have children, and that she only agreed to have this second child because I agreed to the vasectomy.

Her mother and I have been married 5 years.

She told me that I shouldn't talk about my daughter fondly when I'm responsible for her death. Her reasoning is that since my daughter caught SARS from me that I'm responsible, which I don't think is fair at all. Anyone that lived through the SARS outbreak knew how hectic it was here.

I don't know where this was coming from because I've obviously talked fondly about my first daughter in the past and she hasn't said a thing. I demanded she apologize, and when she refused and her mother didn't back me up, I left to stay the night at my brother's house. The following day she only doubled down and would reaffirm it was my fault whenever I asked her to apologise and take it back.

 I'm a bearded, bald muscular 28 year old dude and I politely refused everyone and kept it to myself. I even asked the kid if he was alright.

As a result I picked up a fairly large rock in an attempt to defend myself just to be safe. The owner comes out yelling ""They're friendly!"" I yelled back ""I'm not!""

I told my mom this and she thinks I was being mean. As far as i'm concerned I don't care. Past experiences lead me to believe this man's dogs aren't friendly and with the kind of money he has he could easily avoid this by just buying a shock collar fence.",34,26,0.85
82,No A-holes here,"So I have wanted to go on a trip to Japan since I was 5. It is my dream destination. My best friend and I had been planning to go in 2021 for quite some time. It was going to be just the two of us, celebrating turning 30 together and our many years of friendship.

Then my husband got upset because I initially said he couldn't come because this was for my best friend and I. We all talked it over and decided to just invite whoever wants to come and appease everyone. 

Well now my best friend isn't sure she can afford it then. My husband said we are still going. I figured, that's fine since I still want to go for my 30th.

Now my husband says we are only staying a week. He's given reasons from 'we will have a mortgage' to 'we can always go back'. 

I refused and said I am going for 2 weeks.

He said "" think its a  little demanding of you seeing as this will likely come out of my pocket. and i hope at the time we have a mortgage, and that will be the thing that dictates how long we spend there""

Now it's important to note that due to where we currently live I am not working, but long before the 2 year mark comes up I most certainly will. Yes he will likely be making more than me but this ' I not we' mentality is killing me.

I put my foot down and said that if money is an issue we can push the trip back a year or two but that life isn't a garuntee and I won't sacrifice the time I spend on the trip I have been dreaming of my whole life.

 Now he is mad about me not being flexible and I'm mad because I think he's being a controlling selfish asshole over a trip he wasn't even initially supposed to be a part of.

86,Asshole,"Hi Reddit. Sorry if the grammar is bad (I type the way I speak unfortunately), so I hope you guys end up understanding anyway. :)

So today my family and I went to this parade, and the temperature was supposed to hit about 100°F or so. Honestly I think it did.

I decide to pack two bottles of water in my bag, and hope for the best (I completely underestimated this heat and the length of this parade). 
After standing on the side of the road for about 20 minutes, my cousin begins to feel faint. She sits down on the ground and asks me for my water. I pretend that I didn't hear her, because I didn't want to outright say no. 
The reasons that stopped me from giving her my water:

-The packet of water that we had in the car was a free for all. She could have taken any amount of water that she would have wanted or needed, but didn't. She didn't pick up not one.  So now she's asking for mine? 

-If I ran out of water, what was I supposed to use if I started feeling faint (which I did soon after her)? I only had two, and I was running out quickly at that point. I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the car, and I didn't want to spend money on buying more water just yet.

-She didn't listen to any advice given to her that would have probably avoided this situation:

-She wore a heavy back, straight wig. Something everyone in the house told her not to do.

-She wore an all black, full-body jumpsuit 

-She decided to donate her blood (or maybe it was plasma?) THE DAY OF the parade to make extra money for said wig and the vendors on the route. Something that both her and my mom warned her not to do.

Basically I felt like she made a bunch of bad decisions that led to this situation and I didn't want to give her my water because 
of it.
AITA?

Edit: Okay, so it was implied in the comments that I was the only one with water, and I was the only one who could save her. I want to make it straight that I was NOT the only one to take water out of the car. Everyone else except her picked up at least one bottle. My mother give her hers. I mean according y'all's consensus, I'm still an asshole, but it's not like I was the only who could've given her water. My mother give her water to my cousin.",65,86,0.8

90,Not the A-hole,"For context, I’m 15 years old, and my brother is 18 years old, almost 19. He’s currently home from college for summer vacation. This weekend, my parents were on vacation in Las Vegas.

My brother (let’s name him kev) told me that he was having friends over so I would need to get a ride from a party I was at, no alcohol, and I was okay with that. My friend drove me home, but the first thing I saw as we drove past was one of kev’s friends sitting on top of the roof, letting people in and out of the house. As I got out of the car, he waved at me and yelled “Who are you?” and I told him my name. He shouted it down to everyone in the backyard and they said it was Kev’s brother. He let me in, and I thought everything would be fine after that.

The first thing I see as I walk into my room is that literally everything is trashed. I decided to start cleaning, and I exited my room and put my clothes in the hamper. I then texted my mom about the roof situation, and she told me to get them off of her roof, so I told Kevin that, and he got them off the roof. I put my phone down, and I see multiple of Kevin’s friends drinking alcohol. All of his friends are 18 and 19, and drinking at that age is illegal in our state. I texted my mom about this, and she said she didn’t really care. I then came out of my room again to grab a snack, and there was a gigantic box of beer on the counter. Multiple people were yelling, and it sounded like a massive fight was about to break out. I soon texted my friends and asked them if I could come over to their house, and they came over to pick me up at 9:30. I was so uncomfortable to even be in my own home and I couldn’t stand being there.

I went to my friend’s house, and their older sister and mom agreed that I should call the police department, not 911, as I explained this to them all, instead the non-emergency number. I did exactly so. We did stuff around the house, and we didn’t get another call until midnight, from my mom. She asked if I called the police, I told her that I didn’t, and she told me that four cop cars came to the house, and everyone was gone. My friends’ mom drove me home, and I thought that was that.

My parents came back from Las Vegas at around 5:00 AM last night, so they didn’t wake up until around noon. She told me that we needed to have a talk. I sat down, and she basically told me the story. The cops came, and half of all of the people there were drunk. All of those drunk people were charged with misdemeanors, and are going to court. This includes my brother. I apparently forgot to tell the police that I wanted to remain anonymous, as I denied it multiple times until she told me that the police said that someone with my name called. She told me that I should’ve called her first, even though I texted her, and blamed everything on me. She didn’t give me any punishment, she is just really pissed at me, along with my dad.

93,Not the A-hole,"“Was I the asshole” might be a better title, cause this actually happened a couple months ago. At my high school, there’s been an **enormous** amount of fighting/bullying/drama/smoking going on in the main boy’s bathroom. My school’s not some horribly violent/crazy place, but it seems like a disproportionate amount of the bad behavior tends to take place in that very spot. 

Recently, there was a very disheartening incident in the bathroom that took place and received schoolwide attention; a special needs student got beaten up very badly by a couple punks. Just a couple days later, plaques were put up on multiple walls (by the sinks, stalls and urinals) notifying us that this bathroom is being monitored by cameras.

It created quite an uproar on campus. A lot of guys were really freaked out the principal could potentially be watching us piss; & a general feeling of discomfort became evident in the bathroom. But everyone noticed a dramatic decrease in all types of bad conduct in the bathroom - no longer always smelled of smoke when we went in, no fights went on, no graffiti, etc.

I am very certain there are **not** actually cameras in the bathroom, though. The cameras that are found all over the rest of campus are big, blocky & very noticeable, & a thorough scan around the bathroom reveals nothing. I **suppose** they could have installed microscopic state-of-the-art cameras, but why would they go to that much trouble when they want students to know they’re being filmed? Also, my mom is close friends with a teacher at my school, & my mom says this teacher knows firsthand that there are **not** any cameras; she says the principal has admitted to staff he’s just bluffing with those signs.

The whole thing still bothered me though. Most other guys on campus still thought there were cameras, & were discomforted by it. I felt that what they were doing falls under the umbrella of sexual harassment, as they are creating an uncomfortable environment for boys when they are going to the bathroom/changing. It may sound dramatic, but imagine if our male principal did the same thing in the **girls’** bathroom? Everyone would definitely call it harassment. Male students are 100% as entitled to privacy & protection from sexual harassment as female students. It’s undeniable that the signs decreased misbehavior, but the ends don’t justify the means.

After about two weeks of the signs being up, I called the local sheriff’s office, told them that my school put up signs in the bathroom stating that we’re being filmed, & that it’s making people uncomfortable. He thanked me and promised to look into it; and very, very soon afterwards, the signs had vanished.

I personally feel proud of what I did, but not everyone would agree with me. In the 2 months since the signs were removed, bad behavior has spiked in the bathroom once again; thus, I’ve kept it very secret from the staff at my school that I was the one who ratted them out. AITA?",119,431,0.92
94,Not the A-hole,"It all started when she asked me if I wanted to get lunch. I said yes, but that I couldn’t make it due to existing obligations. She seemed upset and ended up going without me. We talk later that night and she says that her friend she went with is hilarious. I ask who and she says she went with guy X. Before this point I’d never heard of him before.

I wouldn’t care, and hadn’t cared in the past about similar situations because I had thought I’d known all of her guy friends. The fact that I had never heard of X though before this made me feel meh.

Told her I’m ok with her having guy friends, and gave examples of other guys she had hung out with that I was cool with. 

However, I told her that my personal boundaries are not comfortable with her going on “date” like things (coffee, movies, etc.) with guys that I don’t know. You can tell we’re not on the same page, and she insists they’ve been friends forever, but she reluctantly agrees.

A few weeks later she starts telling me that she wants to go see a movie with a guy friend, because her girlfriends will not go with her. She hadn’t asked me to go with. I ask who she wants to go with, and she says X. I felt like my boundaries were being tested, but I didn’t want to come across as insecure. I told her fine, as long as she’s open. 

We go out of town together and X is texting her constantly and she’s always checking her phone. I guess he was watching her cat while we were out for the weekend. I briefly expressed my discontent, she dismissed it, and we moved on. 

At this point I just have a bad feeling about their relationship. Regardless of what’s actually going on, I just didn’t like how it made me feel. Up to this point I’d gotten zero reassurance that he was just a friend, as all I knew of him is they went to lunch and movies alone together, and that he texted her a lot (not typical behavior with her other guy friends).

We’re hanging out and I tell her hey, This has been bugging me a lot lately and I want to get it out of my head. Since they’re always texting, I ask if she can show me their text conversation, and if it’s friendly in nature, I’ll give it up for good.

She freezes up and nervously tells me sure, then discovers that the messages between them were deleted off her phone.

109,Not the A-hole,"&#x200B;

My husband and I have been married for 10 years. For our entire relationship, I have brought the majority of the money into the home. I contribute 75% of that. I don't mind, really. It's not something I think about and I have always considered it ""our"" money. Our country (Switzerland) is really expensive and I grew up not in a large city, and rather poor. When I had the chance to go to university, I studied hard, learned 3 languages, got 2 degrees, and was able to secure a good position in finance. Years later, I make a very good salary and we don't have to worry about money.

We decided that my husband would handle all of the money and finances for the home. I would check on the accounts every once in a while but, I haven't been checking regularly. A few weeks ago, I was thinking about buying a Model 3, since it has recently come to our country and I've fancied it for some time. I played with the numbers and while figuring out if I can afford it or not, I realized that there was a weird mistake in our accounts. There was 300k CHF/USD missing.

When my husband got home, I showed him the accounts and after some pushing, he admitted that he lost 200k in cryptocurrency in 2018. This is about 25% of our savings. Besides being shocked and angry, I cannot help to feel that he stole from me. He put money into something stupid without talking to me and then tried to hide it. I was thinking about this for a week and talked to my friends and family about it. They think we should see a doctor and talk about it, try to work out the problem. But I honestly just want to get divorced. If he is capable of doing this, how can I trust him ever again? AITA for not wanting to talk about it or go to therapy? AITA for thinking about divorce?

&#x200B;

Edit: To clear a few things. We always talked about where the money should go. What things to invest in, etc. I always thought he was really open about it and I trusted him... because he is my husband. I work in finance but, my husband knows just as much about personal finances as I do. After going to work every day, making more decisions about money when I came home wasn't something I wanted to do. That's why I wasn't involved but, that was a mistake. Also, he sold all of the bitcoin for a 200k loss. I don't think that was clear above. So we are not going to buy more and hope for the best like some suggested.

I don't feel ok with him going off to do that alone when I'm there to do it for him/with him. I get it if I'm not there in the house, but isn't that partly what a girlfriend is for?

I feel like an asshole for it, but I asked him to come to me first if he's in the mood for that. If it was just masturbation I wouldn't mind, but he knows porn stars by name and the thought of him choosing another woman's videos over me is rather uncomfortable.

114,Not enough info,"Wow, that title alone gives the wrong idea.

Allow me to contextualize: I am incredibly uncomfortable around children in general, as they cause my anxiety to go through the roof and I find them, well, gross. I don't like being near me or touching me, but I try my best to be polite and as friendly as I can be. I have made it repeatedly clear that I have absolutely zero interest in any children, regardless of who they belong to. Even the idea of me and my own s/o having children makes me incredibly anxious and uncomfortable.

As a follow up to that, it is notable that me and my brother have an incredibly strained relationship. I despise him for a lot of childhood abuse and bullying by his hand and I make sure he knows it. He's made no attempt to reconcile, and I never will try to, full stop. This makes my disdain for his daughter stronger, but I try my damndest to not let that affect my view on the kiddo.

He has a young daughter, whom I dislike, for obvious reasons. I refuse to babysit her, be left alone with her or have extended interactions with her. I am not rude to her, of course, after all, I understand she's just a toddler. As stated above, I do try to be amicable and friendly to her, but I do my best to avoid her if I can.

My mother brought up the topic, and says I should 'step up and be present in her life' as well as demanding to know why I 'treat her like garbage'. I countered with the fact that my brother having a child cannot and will not change my views on children, I have no obligation to be close to her and that I do not treat her like garbage. She called me an asshole.

Reddit, AITA for disliking and avoiding my brother's daughter? It's a genuine question, is it unreasonable for me to think I can avoid her as much as possible? I am not and do not want to be close to my family, so that isn't why I am asking. I just want to know if I am an ass.

&#x200B;

EDIT: As a few people have asked,  around her I try my best to be friendly and do what my friends recommend with babies. I will not hold her, but I try my best to play with her until I can remove myself from the situation or my anxiety makes it difficult to breathe. It's mostly awkward attempts of me talking to her and her toddler talking to me and occasionally playing with dolls until I leave. I try to appear warm and friendly, but I fear it's not incredibly convincing. I am in therapy and in the process of getting proper medication and coping skills.",125,158,0.87
115,No A-holes here,"So this happened a few years ago, but my girlfriend was making fun of me for it yesterday and thought Id put the issue to rest by asking you guys. Me and my girlfriend were visiting my family, she had to work so I stayed an extra few days but would have to take a charter bus back. Its a 8 hour drive from the town to my city, and I know the bus kind of sucks I had taken it a lot when I was a kid.

Anyways, I get on and right before we leave this person gets on last. They smelt like they had never bathed, I need some benefit of the doubt from you guys here, it was easily one of the worst smells I had ever smelt, like boiled eggs wrapped in moldy cheese left in a moldy towel for a few weeks. I retched a few times, it burnt my nose and for the entire trip every time I thought I became nose blind Id get another good whiff and it would all come back. I honestly couldn't believe what I was smelling. Also I don't want this thread to devolve into fat people hate and get the thread locked, but they clearly were not homeless just large.  

So when we got to the destination I was furious, I couldn't even sleep the entire trip, the whole thing was torture. I went to the front desk and asked for a refund. I wasn't alone though, a few other passengers saw what I was doing and all started complaining about it as well. This was the only time in my life I went full Susan, eventually spoke to manager and ended up having to make multiple complaints to get a refund.

Anyway, yesterday, my 8 y/o had a friend (9) over, and she asked me how come, if I'm gay, I had a girlfriend before (i.e. my kids' mum). I explained to her that I'm not gay, I'm bi, which means I like both men and women. She just responded ""oh cool I didn't know that was a thing"" and then they went back to playing. No big deal. Or so I thought. 

Got a phone call this morning from this kids mother and she was *furious* with me for explaining something so ""sexually explicit"" to her daughter, and stating that they don't talk to her about ""these things"" and now she's asking uncomfortable questions. I apologised and said that I didn't actually tell her anything explicit, just that some people like both men and women.

123,No A-holes here,"The very last semester in my school was going great regarding my GPA, until one of my (female) teachers decided to ruin it. We were given assignments that were extremely important for our grades and thus I tried my best to write a good essay. She graded it as 7 points, a C- (15 being the best in German schools), even though I was certain that it should've been above 12 points/B+. I showed my essay to several other teachers to see if I might've gotten overconfident, but they agreed that it should've been at least a B.
I asked if she was willing to talk about the grades in a one-on-one conversation and she agreed. On that day, I was very well prepared and gave her clear evidence why it couldn't have been a C-. She stood right there in shock and might've understood that she was too harsh. Nevertheless, she got extremely angry and told me how disrespectful and rude I was.
What was anger at first turned to tears in seconds and she started crying. I was very confused and asked if she was okay, however she left without clarifying whether she would change the grade or not. While I have to admit my voice is deep and can be loud at times (especially in that situation since I was in a rather bad mood), I wasn't trying to be disrespectful.

First, I don't think I am the right person for that since I no longer identify myself with Christianity. I have stopped going to church for a while now though still celebrate Christmas and Easter for their festivities

Second, being a godfather/godmother is such a huge responsibility that requires you to also be responsible in shaping the kid's spiritual growth by providing them with guidance and teachings in accordance with Christian belief, well at least that's how it is in my family. And I am pretty sure I can not do that. 

My brother was kind of upset when I suggested that he pick someone else. I even recommended my cousin who is a very religious person. But according to my family's tradition, you are expected to choose a sibling to be your children's godfather/godmother as opposed to asking someone else outside the main family circle. 
I could tell that he is so disappointed in me but I told him that I am honored and touched that he chose me, but I don't think I am the right person. 

My mother rang me up this morning to tell me that I am such an asshole for letting my brother down. And that I should call him and just go for it anyway because it is how it is done in the family just for the sake of it. I wouldn't have to be involved in his daughter's spiritual growth because of course 'You are an atheist now' according to her. She wants me to accept it as a mere formality as opposed to not only being an uncle but also a spiritual mentor or someone she looks up to spiritually. 

But I personally think that is so wrong and against the tradition and Christian belief, which even though I no longer identify with, but still have respect for. So I said no to her. Now everyone in the family is upset and disappointed in me. Am I The Asshole?",82,236,0.93
125,Not the A-hole,"Last Friday night, my neighbor was having a small, but very loud party with a few of his friends.  In our building we have an informal agreement that we will keep things to a dull roar after 10 PM on working days and midnight on weekends or holidays.  1 AM rolled around, and the party (which was about 5 people - I have no idea how they could make so much noise) was still going full steam, so I knocked on their door and asked them to keep it down.  Around 2 AM they were still making a lot of noise, so I called the cops to make a noise complaint.  

I thought the cops would just come around and tell him to knock it off so I could get some sleep.  Turns out that he that his papers/visa had expired 2 years ago, and that he'd been in the country (Taiwan) living/working illegally as an English teacher since then.  Since he didn't have the papers, he ended up getting arrested and is now in police custody.  He could end up getting deported, but depending on a number of factors might just have to pay a fine and leave and come back in.

The thing is I didn't really have anything personal against him other than the fact that he tended to be loud and obnoxious from time to time.

I found out that quite a few things like clothes, collectibles, and small trinkets that mean a lot to me have been missing from my old room. I confronted my younger sister, and she said that she didn’t know where they were. About a week later I looked through her room and found all of them. I checked her social media and found pictures of her wearing my missing clothes. I confronted her again, and she got upset and said that she just forgot.

They also claim that my leaving has been so hard on her. I call bs. Am I right to be mad at her?

Edit: she’s 15. The reason I believe she lied is because she has a history of stealing small things and lying about it. She’s even blamed a lot of it on me.

First, she started to lecture me about the dangers of dating. Not dating someone older than me. Dating, period. I tell her I'm old enough to make my own decisions about who I date, which I am. I don't even live with her anymore. I just wanted her to meet him before she judged him. Seeing that she wasn't getting through to me, she decides to take matters into her own hands.

She cursed him out and threatened to call the police on him without cause. She then called my extended family to tell them what happened, overexaggerating details. I had to call them back to make sure they didn't end up traveling half the country to fight somebody.

What she did was uncalled for. She actually scared my boyfriend, who was looking forward to meeting her but postponed it.

131,Not the A-hole,"I'm not sure about this situation but I will not be surprised if AITA .

So, yesterday, I was home alone when I discovered that a pipe from the water tank was leaking and needs to be fixed.
I called my dad and he told me to call a plumber and he will pay me later.
Not thinking much of it, I cut off the water supply and started browsing the internet for some plumbers in my area and found three companies in the nearby city and two independent ones.
I thought about it and said it would be nice if I hired one of the independent ones to show some support for independent workers, plus, they are cheaper. (I honestly don't know if that is a good reason or not, that is the first time I deal with something like this)

Anyways, after I called the plumber (let's call him Mario), he arrived relatively quickly and started to immediately inspect the situation while writing down some spare parts on a  piece of paper.
Then, he told me that there might be something stuck in the pipe which caused it to bust and he will need some parts while giving me the piece of paper. Here are some of the exchanges I had with him in no particular order:

> Mario: ""I will need these parts.""
> 
> Me: ""I'm sorry, I'm alone and can leave the house alone.""
> 
> Mario: ""well, your community doesn't have a plumbing shop and you are the one with the car, right?"" (I'm 18)

> Me: ""isn't that your job?""
> 
> Mario: ""well, of course but we need to help each other out to fix the problem.""

> Me: ""but I don't know anything about plumbing and I'm afraid I might get the wrong part.""
> 
> Mario: ""don't worry. You can't call something like the other. And I couldn't be more specific with the names.""

> Me: ""just go get them from *insert shop name here* and I will pay you.""
> 
> Mario: ""I'm trying to give you the chance to choose the brand you would like to install in your system."" (Really?)

This kept on for a while and at this point I was trying not get angry because I don't want to look stupid. Is that what plumbers usually do?
He then told me before storming off that he will never come here again because ""I'm not taking it seriously and being an uncooperative asshole."".

Only seconds later, my parents and sister arrived and my dad said that he pumped into him. Naturally, he asked what happened. 
After I explained everything, my dad sighed and told me to get the tool box. When I asked what is wrong, he simply told me ""I will look into it"" without specifying what he means which got me worried.

So, AITA here? Again, I won't be surprised if I am.

Edit 2: Well, shit. That got quite popular. First, thanks to everyone for saying that I did the right thing and I'm VERY sorry for my naivety.

At an indoor playground my 2 kids (4 and 2 year old) were playing on a trampoline. This other kid (estimate 6 or 7 year old) came in and started bumping them and jumping through them.Mind you this was 1 out of 4 trampolines. The other 3 were all empty

We were just packing up to leave but my 2 year old was to scared to leave on his own and just sat there crying. My 4 year old already told the other kid to away. (huge for him as he is totally not a kid that confronts others he rather just goes away). But other kids simply just didn't listen.I asked the other kid to go away but no response. I noticed that his dad came over and stood next to me, but he didn't do anything. Eventually I just got up and got my 2 year old out of there. saying ""That isn't very nice of the other kid""

The conversation went like this:

Dad: ""well if you want to play in peace without other kids you should go to the other trampolines in the corner""

me: ""Well I don't agree on that. There are 3 other trampolines so your kid could go easily to any of the other 3.""

Dad: ""Yeah well he is mentally handicapped so there is that""

now I blurted out: ""Soooo handicapped means everybody must move away when he comes over?""

The dad went silent for a while then stuttered a bit, I feel like this was the first time someone spoke up to, what I feel like, is a ""getting out of jail free card""

Dad: "".... Wha?... I... do you... did you not hear me? My kid is handicapped you inconsiderate a-hole""

Me: ""wow watch your language! It doesn't mean he gets to act like a bully without consequences""

Dad: ""HE IS HANDICAPPED! I can't follow him around all day!""

me: ""I understand that,""  (well I don't tbh but I wanted to try and de-escalate ) ""but you just stood next to me for a few minutes and did not intervene""

Dad: ""Your an A-hole! GTFO Or I am going to hurt you, you D\*\*\*""

My wife came over from the seating area and stepped in here ""Both of you shut up, there are kids here don't use that language""

The “thing” about this game is that everyone gets a secret objective they must complete in addition to the main objective. There’s a possibility one player can be a “betrayer,” whose goal is to basically make the group lose. 

During our game I had my secret objective in my hand and she looked at it. I’m not sure how she did - either I let my cards in my hand go to low or she got up behind me and saw. Regardless, I didn’t do a good job of keeping my “secret card” secret. My fault completely. 

The issue I am miffed about is that she then proceeded to text everyone at the table that I was the traitor. This in essence ruins the game and removes a huge feature. 

I’m not sure if I’m being too sensitive (it’s really just a board game in the long run,) or have a reason to be frustrated here.

P.S: I did not know she knew, or texted everyone at the table, until they all admitted it after the game. My friends were good sports about it and said they didn’t see me acting like a traitor so they didn’t react to her text.",39,49,0.86

141,Not the A-hole,"So, I know this is not exactly a life or death situation, but I'm asking out of curiosity because I've had very different reactions from my friends and wanted to hear some more.

&#x200B;

There's a pizza place near my house (about 5 mins by walk) that also does deliveries through an app. I had ordered from them a couple of times, always on Sunday, and the delivery was late most of the times.   
I never made a fuss about that, since I know they're very busy in the weekend, but I thought I would start ordering the pizza for an earlier time to offset the expected ""lateness"".

&#x200B;

So one sunday I was having some friends over and, just to be sure, we ordered pizza for 8 pm. ( where I am from, this is considered an earl-ish dinner,  8:30-9pm is more common).

At 7:20 pm the doorbell rings...it's the delivery guy. I didn't know what to do so I just took the pizza and payed for it, but my friends were still at their own homes so the food was cold by the time they arrived.

The next week, same thing happened: the doorbell rang 45 minutes early. This time I was prepared, so I kindly told the delivery guy that I couldn't accept the delivery because the order I had placed was for a totally different time. The guy said to call the restaurant so they could make another pizza and sent it at the right time.  I felt bad doing it, but I went ahead and this time they delivered in it on time. They did seem pretty annoyed about it though.

&#x200B;

AITA for sending the pizza back and asking them to make another one?

Some of my friends say that you can't complain about getting an early delivery, and that I should be happy about it instead, even though it disrupted my dinner plans.

&#x200B;

Other useful info:

\- I always placed the orders well in advance

\- the restaurant has my number, so they could always call me if there's a problem with the order",149,475,0.93

144,Not the A-hole,"So I (f27) have been with my boyfriend (m27) for two years and we are both very busy people. We have jobs and have creative pursuits which we want to be our careers in the end, so finding time to meet isn't always easy. 

This being said I don't think my boyfriend realises how much I do to ensure we have the time to meet.

We are going to be moving in together at the end of the year and I want him to meet me in the middle

Here are three examples i I gave to him:

1- From 9am -12pm for a week we didn't have time off together. I asked if he was still free on Monday, he replied he was busy in the morning and free from the afternoon. So I cancelled my shift at work. I would stay at his the night before and wait for him to hang out in the afternoon. But then a he reveals he is busy until 6pm? And now I have already cancelled my shift at work and I live paycheck to paycheck. 

&#x200B;

2- I was working a 12 hour shift finishing at 10pm. That day he invites me to a party at his work. I thanked and declined as I was tired. He said he really wanted me to go and so I agreed to meet him when I finished work. He said great, now he just needed to check if I could go. I told him to let me know as I would need to know if I should travel to his work or home. At 9.30pm I was told I could go home early but I waited at work for his reply that came at 10.20pm telling me that I can't come.

&#x200B;

3- We know each other from meeting in the city we live now but are both from the other end of the country from places about an hour and a half apart. I went up for a wedding and a few days later on Sat he was being best man at a wedding near his mum's. He met me at my parents on the Tue, and we traveled to his mum's on the Thur early in the morning so we could help prep the wedding venue. Before this I had expressed that I was sad that I couldn't stay an extra day at my parents as I don't get to see them much but it was my choice to travel earlier with him as it was going to be a stressful time for him.  When we got there on the Thur he doesn't call his friend until it is too late for us to go and help, and only after I asked him to call him. He knew I had come up early for that reason. We ended up not helping till the next day and I could have stayed home with my parents longer.

&#x200B;

What I am asking him is that he tells me 'I have a meeting in the morning and I have no idea when it will end.' or 'There is a party tonight I am not sure if you can get in or when I can let you know. So you might not want to wait around' or 'I am not sure if we will start helping on the Thursday or Friday.' then I can choose for myself what I want to do, with all the info. 

We ended up arguing till 4am about it, he thinks situations changing is not his fault and I was trying to explain it wasn't the situations but how we dealt with them, that wasn't working.

I am starting to wonder if I am asking too much.",14,38,0.83

146,Asshole,"Long story short, my best friend got married last year. I was asked to be co best man and had to share duties with one of his former coworkers because said coworker had asked my best friend to be his best man a few years beforehand. 

My best friend and I had been friends years before this coworker came into the picture but I was fine with sharing duties. Coworker lives across the country now so I was tasked with planning the bachelor party and paid for everything. Coworker never attempted to help with planning or financially.

Best friends wedding comes around and I’m relegated to 2nd best man. I have to give my speech after “coworker” and even though I was told I’d be the one to do it, coworker signed best friends marriage certificate.

I’m getting married next year and my fiancé brought about the idea of not doing a wedding party (groomsmen and bridesmaids) as to not make people feel like they had an obligation so they could just enjoy the wedding. I agreed but only to spite my friend and not have him be my best man. If the events that played out hadn’t happened, I would have fought to have him be my best man. I’m also planning on having another friend sign my marriage certificate. Am I being an asshole?",676,7255,0.96

148,Everyone Sucks,"This is more controversial then it first sounds. Please let me know. I would like to know and make the best possible decision. Throwaway and on mobile.


Two years ago, as a teenager, I was diagnosed with cancer. I have seen children from the age of 10 days old sick, wish for death, cry out in pain and die. It’s shit. 

That’s why I made a vow to help out with as many charities as possible, when I beat this  illness. 

My little sister has also (obviously) been impacted by her big sibling waste away before her eyes and scream out whenever she was in pain that she wanted to die, and actually mean it. 

One thing about my little sister is she always copies me. I join a drama group, she joins the same drama group. 

I learn an instrument, she learns an instrument. 

I cook some cupcakes, she cooks a cake, which tastes better.

I draw a picture, she draws a self portrait.

I make some friends, she becomes friends with my friends. 

She always ends up one upping me as well. She got a better part then me in the play, she is better then me at music, and my (ex)friends like her more. (I heard them. That’s why they aren’t my friends anymore.)

She even came out as gay before I could. (I’m bi) 

I gained a lot of weight on treatment, and recently, I have been working out and have gone on a diet. I have lost 2lbs and am preparing to do a charity ‘mud run’ next year. (I will be ready by then). 

I said this to my parents at dinner and my little sister said ‘ I’ll do it too.’ 

I have spent months planning and have been training and trying to make myself a fitter person to be able to do this.

I want his to be something, just I can do. So I can have something I can say ‘I have done this, all by myself’. But, if She does this with me, she will get more money and it could be seen as selfish. 

When I said this to her, she called me selfish, and said I can’t stop her. She told me she could get more money to find cures for cancer and we might save more lives sooner if she does this. And I guess, after all, that the whole point of charity runs is to bring people together, but I really don’t want to do it with her. 

So, WIBTA if I don’t let her do a charity run with me. And am I over reacting?

Edit: I wrote this post in a moment of rage. And whilst I was seeing red, I forgot a piece of information. I know I published this less then an hours ago, but since then, I she’s been debating where to put it in or not, as I don’t want it seem like ‘ you are trying to get us to say NTA,’ when, in actual fact, I forgot about it. I’m outing it in anyway. Shortly after I was diagnosed, my little sister did a charity run for a different cause (physical therapy for a classmate who couldn’t afford it) with the rest of her class. She raised £50. I think that may be part of the reason I am/was apprehensive to let her do it with, she has done it before.

Another edit: I realised now that I was a bit of a dick. Well, a lot. I’m currently making it up to her and hope our relationship as sister and brother can continue. I shouldn’t feel angry or jealous about her coming out, I should be happy that she has the courage to do it before I can, and I shouldn’t be resentful of her achievements, because, I would want her to be happy when I achieve them. I am sincerely sorry for seeing red and acting out in this way and I hope I can become a better person, as I have learnt this lesson. I’m sorry, and thank you all for the input.",42,36,0.83
149,Not the A-hole,"So, my coworker just asked if we could hang out after
work because she's lonely. I said sure why not... I mean
I'm up until 3 am on reddit anyway, so why not actually
do something tonight. So we're having fun, we're
laughing, telling old stories; getting along like friends,
but I can tell that she has something on her mind.

She told me several stories throughout the night about
her loneliness and asocial personality. I know where
she's going, so I told her a few stories about how I enjoy
being out of a relationship, tryna drop hints that I ain't
lookin for love, we're just friends hanging out

So at around 3 Am I drew the line and said, ""this has
been super fun, I would've said this earlier if it weren't
but I need to get home and sleep."" She tells some story
about how she doesn't want to go home and be alone,
but I say tough luck pal, you're shit outta luck.

So I stop in front of her house and let her out, and she
gives me a tight hug, not at all a coworker hug. Then
she kisses me on the cheek, and I tell her ""never do that
again."" I friend zoned her.

I feel like an asshole though after what she said to me
about her anxiety, that was bold of her and I respect it,
but I don't know if she understands. I have my reasons
for being an asshole though, because I don't want
her getting any ideas. As I said, I don't want to be in a

My dads girlfriend, she’s cool. I don’t really like her but I also don’t not like her. She’s been with my dad for 3 years. I live with my mom mostly and prefer it that way but every weekend I’ll go over to my dads. 

Last month she rescued a new puppy from her friend who was giving them away. She is in love with it and my dad is in love with it. It’s whiny, loud, jumps all over me which I HATE, pees everywhere, whines so freaking loudly to come into my room because I keep my door shut, I hate it. My dads girlfriend got sad with me last week because I don’t interact with the dog at all. She asked me to make an effort with ‘the new family member’ I said I would rather not. She said what if I was pregnant with a baby, would you still not want to interact with a new family member? I told her I would love a baby brother or sister but I am really really not nuts over a dog and it’s a stupid comparison to make. My dad tried to be all ‘dad’ on me and came in my room, looked all serious, and awkwardly said ‘hey buddy think you could try a little more just for girlfriends sake?’ I told him no. I’m not scared of the dog. I just don’t like it. He wants me to bond with the dog by feeding it sometimes or taking it out. I said no to that too.

151,Not the A-hole,"My husband has decided he'd like to visit his family next month and wanted me to come. His family lives across the country so he doesn't get to see them often and I encouraged him to go. When he asked me about coming I told him no and explained that I didn't want it to go as bad as it went last time. The last time I went I was bored to tears trapped in the house watching TV with his mom and sister for a WEEK while they made snide remarks about pretty much everyone they know.

After that visit I decided that I never wanted to visit unless there was a big event that required me there. So this time instead of going there to visit with his family I decided to book a flight to see an aunt who lives a state over. I don't usually visit my aunt and thought this would be a great vacation that coincidentally overlaps my husband's. Also, I figured my MIL shouldn't be too hurt because after all I'm seeing my family. 

The issue I'm having now is that MIL has become hyper sensitive and thinks I don't like her when in reality I just don't want to go visit somewhere and stay in watching TV. I'd rather get out and do something with my oh so limited time off work. She's promised it'll be a  ""fun"" vacation this time but she made those same promises last time and it was anything but fun. She even got offended previously when I tried to go out and do my own thing.

152,Not the A-hole,"A friend asked me to look after her puppy for 3 weeks. I said no at first. I love dogs but they're a lot of work especially at 7 months. She said he was easy. I asked how many hours hes awake & how often she walks him. She said at 7 months dogs sleep 18 hours & he has 2 short walks. That sounded ok.

It's not. He wakes at 5am no matter what. I tried walks at 12am. He still wakes early. Its not a toilet break he's awake wanting to play. He barks constantly if he's alone in the room & has separation anxiety. If I leave to shower he howls & won't stop until I return. He chews everything including rocks. Hours go into taking them so he doesn't choke; he's a very small dog. He has so much energy; 2 walks isn't enough. I tried but now it's 20mins when he wakes, 30 at lunch, 60 at 5pm, 10 before bed. 

Yesterday I had a job. My friend leaves him for 6-8 hours & said he'd be fine. I've left 20mins to go to the store etc. I walked him first. Then left him in a room with low music & a toy. When I got home he was still loud. My neighbour said he barked the whole time. He'd gone to toilet in the house. He knows to go outside or sit by the door & barks if its closed so it isnt a lack of training. It must have been anxiety. I felt so guilty but I couldn't leave the door open. The yard isn't that secure.

I'm struggling with a lack of sleep & time to myself as an introvert. He needs so much attention. The yard is open when I can watch him, he has toys, I walk him. But it isn't enough. He sometimes sleeps on the sofa but never for long. If you sneak out of the room to shower or have a minute alone he wakes & follows. It sounds dumb but sometimes I like to be alone in an empty room. And I can't nap in the same room. He bites if you're asleep.

I'd never neglect an animal. I'll keep providing for him this last week. I just resent him & my friend for misleading me about his energy level. I'm tired. I want some peace without the guilt of leaving an anxious dog.",36,22,0.81

My friends and I have been planning a trip for my senior year for the last year now. The trip started off with three people and the third flaked and now it's just me and my friend. My friend's mom is SUPER protective, and felt really uncomfortable sending my friend on the trip, but my parents really wanted me going so they tried to work on a compromise that would make the trip work.

The agreement we came to was that my parents join my friend and I on the trip and they let us do our thing and they do their thing.

160,No A-holes here,"Tl:dr - long term partner’s drug addicted daughter is losing her baby, we’re the only family members who can take him, but I feel like I’m too old to raise an infant

Backstory: I’m a woman in my 50s.  Never married, but have been with my partner for 10 years.  We own a beautiful home, travel frequently, and have built a nice life together.  He has three adult children from his previous marriage (ended years before we met), who I’m on good terms with.  His youngest daughter has been in and out of trouble since she was young - dropped out of high school, got into drugs, got pregnant at 24 (she has no idea who father is).  She didn’t tell anyone she was pregnant until she was at the hospital to deliver.  By some miracle, her son is healthy (born addicted, but came through the withdrawal and hospital stay) and is a sweet little 6 month old.  

We’ve been very worried about him - and her - although she had assured everyone she’s clean.  When the baby got out of the hospital, his maternal grandmother (her mom, my partner’s ex) took the baby, but only for a week (she has serious mental and physical health issues, and can’t take care of him).  Last week, the daughter was arrested for driving under the influence and child endangerment, because he was in the car.  Apparently, this wasn’t the first brush with the law or social services, and they removed the baby from her care, and she’s not fighting it.  

The social worker called my partner on Thursday morning and informed him that if he doesn’t take the baby, the baby will go into the foster system and likely be adopted out.  My partner immediately told them that he would take the baby and when his daughter relinquishes her parental rights (or has them terminated), he will formally adopt the baby.  Social worker dropped the baby off on Thursday night.  

It’s been two days, and I’m exhausted.  I don’t think I can do this.  I never wanted kids, never liked babysitting, and selfishly, I really like my life as it is.  My partner has taken two weeks of family leave, and we’re now trying to figure out childcare for when he goes back to work.  He keeps assuring me that it will get easier, but I just keep thinking ahead - I’ll be in my 70s when this kid is in high school.  We’re financially comfortable, but for two adults without dependents - the cost of day care alone is going to be significant, and retirement seems impossible.  He has made up his mind that this is the only solution.  I think adoption by a young, healthy family that can devote themselves to this kid should be an option.  He blames himself for his daughter’s problems and I think he sees this as a second chance.  I love him, I thought we would be together well into old age, and I feel like leaving now would put him in a very bad position, but I never thought we would be raising a young child and honestly, I don’t want to.

I have over a dozen bites, all big and red, I’m itching like crazy, I’m stressed all our luggage has bedbugs, and I’m in fear our kids were bitten but just have delayed reactions. I’m the only one with bites, thankfully I guess. 

I do not wish this on any future guests and I think it’s doing a disservice not warning future guests about this. I assume the managers will try to get rid of the bedbugs but I am not confident they will do a good job. 

Because the second night I suspected they had bedbugs and told them the next morning, they said they don’t think they do but would clean the apartment while we were out to make sure. When we came back they assured us the apartment was cleaned and they did not find anything. That night I saw bedbugs on the bed running around and took photos and videos and we wound up staying awake the whole night to avoid sleeping on the beds. 

This was after they said they had made sure they didn’t find any bed bugs. When my husband talked to them later, they confessed they actually didnt know what they really were since they never ran into this problem. 

I am not confident they know how to properly clean their apartment up. And think we should warn future guests.",82,162,0.91
163,No A-holes here,"so our school held the annual poem/short story week where you could submit and read your poem/short story to the school. 
the only rules that they had was no going into detail into anything gross. 

so I decided to do a poem on my abuse, it was mainly about the PTSD side and said nothing about what my actual abuse was as I figured it was not allowed. 

after I wrote it I submitted it and it was not allowed, they gave me no reason so I fought it, they decided to allow it. a decent amount of people at my school have agreed with the school in banning the poem.

We were waiting for our Uber outside a restaurant and my boyfriend was playing a video on his phone (iPhone 7+) and suddenly this guy walking up the block approaches us and asks my boyfriend if he can borrow his phone to make a call.

He goes into a whole tangent about how he had a fight with his girlfriend and his phone had died and he needed to call her. He offered to hand us his phone (a shattered Android phone) and his wallet (stuffed to the gills) as insurance for us so he could make the call.

My boyfriend and I shoot him down and he says my BF can make the call and starts giving us his GF's name and going into a story about his argument with her and pleadng.

My BF and I still say no and I suggest to ask someone in the restaurant.

Eventually the guy gives up and walks away, cursing at both of us.

168,Asshole,"My current dining room table was originally given to my sister by our mom. This table isn't fancy, just a sturdy round oak table. It was our dining room table growing up so I have a lot of happy memories surrounding it. 3 years ago my sister moved into a small apartment that didn't fit the table. When I found out that she and my BIL weren't going to use it and put it in storage, I asked if I could borrow it to use in my house. They agreed on the understanding I'd give it back if they were to ever move.

Fast forward a year and my sister is now pregnant with my nephew and they're still living in the same place. It's a 3 bedroom house owned by our dad that was created into 2 apartments. My sister and BIL lived in the smaller apartment to save money. My dad decided to gift them the house & their plan was to live in the studio apartment for a few years so they could collect the bigger rent check by renting out the 2 bedroom apartment. So knowing this, one day in passing I was talking to my BIL about it and I asked if they planned on using the dining room table in the 2 bedroom apartment when they eventually move into it, he said probably not and I could just keep it. I thanked him and for the past 2 years have been living under the impression that this table was now mine

My dad and sister had falling out in January and my sister and family moved out. They just recently bought a house for themselves and are moving into it next month. Yesterday I get a text from my sister telling me that they plan on picking up the dining room table in a few weeks and are giving me a heads up. Lol what? I text her back saying ""This is awkward but you guys gave me this table"" Then starts a text fight where my BIL and sister swear they never gave me the table, if I refuse to give it back then I'm basically a thief and this will ruin any relationship I have with them. I wanted to tell my sister flat out that it's mine and to leave me alone but I don't want to lose access to my nephew whom I adore. I offer to look for a new table for myself but tell them it will take me awhile to save up for it since I'm disabled and on a fixed income from SSDI for \~$800 a month. She continues to deny ever giving me the table and won't accept my compromise. Eventually she says if I give her $100 to put towards a new table then she'll drop it and will ""let"" me keep the old one. I agreed just to stop the fight.

The reason I think I might be TA is I don't remember the conversation with my BIL word for word but I'm pretty sure it happened, however I have been on high dose steroids for awhile and they've really fucked with my head so brain fog is a problem I'm dealing with. My sister also got really mad at me and thinks I should have just given them back the table and not fought with her on it and her argument the whole time was that it doesn't make sense for them to give me the table so therefore it never could have happened. So AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: A little more info... Both of our parents, especially our mom actually back me up in my claim to the table. And the reason I can't get a new table right now is I only just got disability payments after having no income for the past 5 months, so I literally have $10 in my bank account and am actually borrowing the $100 from my mom to pay my sister and then I'll pay my mom back over time. Also, my sister and BIL honestly believe that everything got combined when they got married and what was once ""theirs"" is now ""ours"" which is why I didn't second guess only talking to my BIL about it because at that point, they both viewed the table as belonging equally to both of them.",39,34,0.86

170,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been happily married for about three years. We both live in the U.S. I (30f) am American born and raised, while my husband (32m) is originally from an Asian country. He immigrated to the US for graduate school, and he now has permanent residence here. We intend to live in the US for the foreseeable future.

Because all of my husband’s family is still back in his home country, we try to go visit them once every year or two. I love to travel so it’s mostly a fun and eye-opening experience for me, and I enjoy learning about other cultures, etc. When we go, we stay with his parents, as is customary in their culture (and because they live in a major metropolis where paying for a hotel for two weeks would be prohibitively expensive). 

The problem is that his parents abide by VERY traditional gender roles - as do most people of their generation in this country. Both his dad and mom had full-time jobs, but his mom was responsible for ALL the cooking (making three meals from scratch every day for the entire household), cleaning, and laundry (which also has to be done everyday). Even when his dad retired and his mom was still working, she did 100% of the housework and he did essentially none.

That certainly is their choice and I would never comment on that or look down on their way of life. The issue is that back in the US, my husband and I share all the housework duties pretty much 50/50. We both have the same graduate degree, and we both even have the same kind of job at the same exact institution, and we each make pretty much the same salary. This equal sharing of housework is important to us, since we both are very professionally ambitious and want to prioritize our careers.

When we are staying with his family in his home country, his parents constantly make comments and jokes and ask questions about my doing the cooking, cleaning, etc. Even though we’ve explained that we share the responsibilities back home, they can’t seem to fathom this. So I feel VERY pressured to do the cooking, cleaning at their house for them. In their society, when two people get married, the couple moves in with the husband’s family, and the new wife takes charge of all the household duties so that the mother-in-law can “retire” from them.

Because his parents’ English is really rough (my husband often has to translate between us), I generally play the ignorant American and pretend not to understand that they seem to want me to do some of the cooking and cleaning when we’re at their house. That’s not to say I don’t help - I always help clear the dishes after dinner and I do my own laundry in their house. I basically do slightly more than my husband does - enough to be a polite guest but definitely not enough to fulfill the expected role of the typical daughter-in-law.

So AITA for pretending not to understand that my in-laws expect me to conform to their traditional idea of a daughter-in-law which would mean doing the housework when we stay with them?",99,327,0.93

175,Not the A-hole,"Where I (26f) am working for the summer they want us to be very inclusive as we'll be working with teenagers who aren't all straight and identifying as the gender they were born. So one of the first things they had us do was introduce ourselves by name and what pronouns we use and prefer.

 Pretty much all of us went with the standard ones (one they/them), except for one we'll call Lee.
Lee refused to give pronouns, and when pressed made this snotty face and said ""It should be obvious."" Lee has long hair braided back, wears lip gloss, has painted nails, and wears tank tops that are tight enough to show off a generous bust.

Because Lee wouldn't give pronouns I started using they/them and so did a few other coworkers. After a day or so Lee got mad and snapped at me that they're 'not an 'it'' and not to use those pronouns.
I asked what ones to use, and Lee repeated the 'it should be obvious' remark.

I'm now on day four of referring to Lee as he/him, and Lee's seething. Lee called me an asshole today after I used 'his' in front of our biggest boss who is now using it as well.
 My brother says I'm being a complete asshole about it, as does my mom, but my girlfriend thinks it's very fitting 'if a little petty'.

 So Reddit, AITA for deliberately going with other pronouns when I can assume just what Lee wants to be called based on the 'it should be obvious' remark, or is it fine because Lee won't follow the whole 'tell us what you want to be called' rule?

Edit: Lee is my coworker, my age, not one of the teenagers.

Edit 2: The reason this has gone on for four days (since I saw someone mention it) is that Lee hasn't told me not to use he/him yet, and just glowers at me for it. If Lee said stop, I would, and I'd switch to something else.
Also I'm a girl, using she/her. Not a guy, if that changes anything.",778,1745,0.89
176,Not the A-hole,"TL; DR pretty much above, am I wrong in not wanting to live with my mother at (nearly 40).

I am a 36 year old lass, living in the UK working a job with wild and extreme shift patterns. I moved back home a few years ago because of relationship break-up, and any attempt to move out it met with pouting and emotional blackmail (""I'll be lonely!"" ""I can't afford this place!"" ""You would see your mother thrown onto the streets?""), Yet none of this applied to my older brother.

My relationship with my mother growing up wasn't great, she has a number of mental health issues as well as physical problems, and an almighty hair trigger temper. I wasn't allowed friends growing up, and going out and about was a massive no-no, she once called the police to report me as missing because I was ""uncharacteristically late home from school..."" Yet forgot she asked me to get something for her on the way home and missed my bus. She still calls me demanding when I get home, and leave Passive aggressive texts when I tell her I am trying to sleep (because, I need to be very well-rested at work).

My older brother has recently moved out, and left so much of his stuff behind, but I am not allowed to move it, nor try and clean up around it, so we have a lot of clutter (including gym equipment he hasn't used since his 20's, he's 42, now), so any planned decoration, and new furniture purchases are on hold until his stuff gets moved. Again, this is causing more arguments between me and my mother, while my brother is blissfully unaware.

My mum, since his move has made it less than subtle that she wishes for me to buy our home, I earn a very decent salary in a very stable job (despite the crazy shift patterns).

Just to clarify, in the UK, we have Right to Buy where you can purchase your government-owned rented out home after living there for a number of years. You get a discount depending on how long you have lived there.

Her big plan is for her Right To Buy Discount to be used as a deposit, for me to then take out a hefty mortgage (in my name, the property will still be in her name), and when she dies, my older sibling and I will inherit half of the property each.

So she wants me to be tied to and pay for a home to give half of it to my brother, and she cannot understand why I am not okay with this. I have made it clear that I wish to move out again, and live in my own space, but it is causing no end of arguments and it ends with her giving me the silent treatment (he favourite tactic since I was a small child).

She has now resorted to telling everyone she knows how I plan on making her homeless.

After a week she asked if I could come over for a dinner date and a walk (sounded very nice). I was happy but also did feel a bit weary of how long the day would be if I drove back and forth. I said “let’s assume I’m coming unless I don’t feel up to the drive” so not a hard commit but sounded like I was in. Next morning I woke up feeling shitty and honestly didn’t want to make the drive. I texted her (about an hour before we were supposed to meet) and apologized and said I didn’t feel up to the drive.

She hasn’t responded all day (I know she’s seen it because we’ve been texting all the time) which isn’t normal. After waiting all day I felt so bad that I might have hurt her feelings and sent a long apology telling her I’m genuinely sorry (which I am) and let her know that I still want to meet up (which I do).

182,Not the A-hole,"Some back story: My best friend, we’ll call her Kim, lives across the country from me. We met when we studied abroad, and have been best friends since, and see each other when we can. I visited her in her city last year, and the one night we stayed at a hotel we split the room. 

Fast forward to this year, and Kim is planning on taking a 5 day trip out to see me. Because we don’t get to see each other often, we decided that we would go away to a nearby city for a few nights. 

Kim works for a large corporation - at her company, they have a point reward system. When you do someone a favor, do a good job, etc, you get points, and these points can be redeemed for a bunch of different things. So, Kim told me that she had a ton of points saved up, and that she could use them to pay for our hotels and save us a ton of money. Obviously, I was excited about this, because I was concerned about money for the trip. She booked much nicer hotel rooms than we would’ve had we been paying ourselves, so I was excited. I expressed my gratitude and she goes “you owe me dinner!” and I say “of course!!!”

We had a great time, and enjoyed our hotel stays. On the last night, she says to me “Ok, so you owe me $200 for the rooms.” I was taken aback and didn’t know what to say. From my understanding, I wasn’t going to pay any money for the hotels. She was able to get them for free - yes, with her points, but at no cost to her (other than not using them on something else). I did pay for dinner at some point during the trip, which I had thought was our original agreement. 

Now, it’s been a few months since the trip and we haven’t really talked. She’s reminded me of the money a few times, and I just haven’t been able to get the courage to tell her my point of view, because I genuinely don’t know IITA. I think ITA probably at this point because it’s been months, but I don’t think I’m in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the rooms. 

Had we not had this conversation and she didn’t use her points, we would’ve of course split the rooms equally as we did on our previous trip.

183,Not the A-hole,"So I suspect I messed up but I’ll accept my judgment here. 

I have two younger siblings, twins, who just turned 20 last weekend. They both live with my parents because my sis has been attending a local community college (leaving for state school this fall) while my bro is just hanging around. 

Over the years I’ve found myself disliking my brother more and more. He’s jobless and lazy. He spends his days playing video games, surfing reddit on his niche political subreddits, and smoking. He also frequently gets into yelling matches with whoever’s around (usually my parents and sister, occasionally me if I’m staying the weekend.) Give it another 1-2 years and I can see him transforming into a full basement neckbeard if you know what I mean. 

But he’s still my brother, so I tolerate him and I help my parents out financially when I can. The best I can phrase it is that while I love him, I don’t actually like him. People with toxic siblings probably know how that feels. 

So on their bday last weekend I took my sis out for half a day and bought her a new MacBook to prepare for her new school. Her current laptop is falling apart. Well apparently when she got home that night all hell set loose. My brother saw the present and flipped his shit since I only got him some clothes. He terrorized my parents and demanded they sell her laptop and split the money between them to make it “fair.” 

I got extremely angry/frustrated calls from my mom later that week, blaming me to setting my brother off. She tells me in the future to not give anymore presents to my sister if I can’t afford to give the same one to my brother. On one hand I did feel really bad for instigating him and causing more trouble for my parents, but on the other I’m just like fuck it, she’s moving out soon and I can give her all the gifts I want. I’m certainly not going to start buying two of everything. 

AITA? Or WIBTA if I just ignored my mom’s advice completely and kept favoring my sister?

**Edit:** to add some more context on why I feel a little guilty. I’m 7 years older than them and so my parents have always tasked me to be like a “3rd parent” to my twin siblings. So I think in a way they expect me to be unbiased like a real parent. 

But honestly I truly do not like my brother as a person. He was troubled as a teen and I tried everything to help but now he’s genuinely disturbed, prone to acts of destruction, and I suspect has mental illness of some sort but my parents (and him) refuse to seek any kind of help. 

My mom accused me of making life that much harder for them with this gift. She says I overstepped my bounds and should ask her first next time before giving any gifts. I really do see her point but I still told her I would never buy two MacBooks just so my sister can have one.",122,408,0.96

A few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. Her husband is a light black man. Of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. The skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

I pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. She didn’t even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. I reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. Neither has spoken to me since.

I’ve always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they’re still married and sometimes I feel bad about what happened. I just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because I would be devastated if I wasn’t confident that I was the father of my future children. Was I an asshole for asking privately?

Edit- okay I get it I’m an asshole. I want to make it clear that I didn’t think the triplets had different fathers. I’m not an idiot.

They rely on their parents, and the parents don't like just handing out money like that. So, its less on their financial status as a family, and more on their own specific set of circumstances. Plus, they have been pretty open about their financial status, so my calling out of their finances wasnt out of the blue.

189,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I am a girl in high school, and one of the only female friends of the host. His younger brothers are around 12 or 13, twins, and both on the autism spectrum, one more severe than the other. One of the twins, Tom is completely nonverbal, and I guess not really cognizant of his own behavior (I guess this is where my ignorance about how Autism really works shines through). The other twin, Gavin does speak, and functions with less behavioral issues. 

I'm certain both boys are really sweet and mean well, and Tom doesn't really know any better, But I can't help but feel uncomfortable around him. My friend John is great, and his mom is one of the nicest ladies I know. She always tries to make me feel included because I'm usually the only girl in attendance at parties. Tom on the other hand, although I know in my mind he doesn't know any better, is constantly invading my personal space. 

I have a big thing about space, and I get really uncomfortable when anyone touches me unwarranted. The twins will usually hang out and watch us all play video games, but Tom will seek me out, sit near me, scootch closer and try to grab my hair, poke me, grab my hand, tap me with his foot, stare, etc... He only does this to me, and not our other female friend, or any of the guy ones. I try just smile and brush it off, but he always persists, even when I subtly move away or walk somewhere else, he will move closer, or follow me to entirely different spot. This time was worse than usual. At one point he grabbed my wrist really hard, and he kept leaning really close to me. Their mom usually laughs and  makes a joke about him having a crush on me or whatever. 

Obviously he doesn't know any better or doesn't have the ability to learn any better, but I was just feeling really uncomfortable, and didn't feel up to playing Mortal Kombat while my personal space was being violated. I know I'm too sensitive to that, and I feel really bad like I should have just sucked it up because he doesn't know any better, which is why I feel like I may be the asshole. I don't want my friend to feel bad, or his mom. Instead of doing what should have been the right thing, I made up an excuse and left super early.

190,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: baby is 10 months

When I got pregnant I had a super stable well paying job as a beautician, but since moving to California I have not been able to obtain a California license to practice and won't become eligible for reciprocity until August. So I was working part time at a shop close to our apartment and we were doing okay. My MIL was watching baby as I worked because I can't afford childcare. My MIL ended up getting a teaching position in the district so I had to quit my job to stay with baby and we started to get behind on bills.

After a lot of thought my boyfriend and me and his family agreed it would be best for me to stay in Missouri to work at my old job over the summer and send my boyfriend money for bills until I can legally work as a beautician in Cali. Also, my credit is very bad. I've been running from debt for years and want to start paying it off to get a decent credit score. Since my MIL is a teacher, she will be off this summer and offered to take care of my daughter while I take care of my business.

I trust my MIL and all my in-laws a lot, they are all really good with my daughter and my daughter always comes home super happy after spending a day with them. They are all super active people who will take her out to do fun things all summer, I'm so jealous of how much fun I know they will have.

This decision has been super hard on my family, my mom wants my daughter to stay with us and my whole family has been trying to get me to make arrangements to have my daughter stay with us this summer, but that would require me to find childcare here because everyone here is working. I've considered working this summer in Cali, but its hard to find a job out there, especially one that pays as well as my job in Missouri. I think it will be more effective if I just work hard to build credit. I plan on getting a second job here and stacking up money. My family is adamant that my baby needs her mother, I'm about to cry typing this out now. I will miss my baby but I am 100% confidant she will be in good hands with my in laws...also, my mom and step dad are borderline just no's...I caught my step dad giving my baby COFFEE the other day, and gatorade today...my mom is always wanting to give my baby unhealthy crap like mac and cheese and french fries and they always try and get her to watch tv and download games for her to play on the phone even though I really don't want her to have screen time. I really don't want to deal with them while I'm trying to get my life in order...My mom and I plan on going to counseling together this summer because lord knows I need it. We both do.

I'm just scared my baby will forget me, I'm crying now, She's going to make her first steps without me around, She's going to celebrate her first birthday without me with her. I'm an absolute wreck whenever I think about it but I'm convinced its for the best. WIBTA for leaving her?",69,78,0.92

193,No A-holes here,"Tl;dr"": my cousin wants one of the 2 basement suite rooms, instead of upstairs with my parents, shes lived here like a year and I've been living here getting the short end of the stick for 19 years now. WITBTA if I cited, among other reasons, that I've lived here longer and am the kid, and I should get it? 


Please excuse formatting. 

So my(19F) and my sisters(20F) cousin(22F) D moved into the house our parents and us rent around August last year and, while its a lot to get into, shes been kind of hard to live with


 Currently, in a 2 story house w/ unfinished basement, my parents have a room upstairs, and my cousin D and I are on either side of their room. This is hard for us, she thinks it is more so for her because shes lived on her own and likes freedom, but really it's as annoying for me as well. My sister A is downstairs in the unfinished basement, which shes gotten used to and doesn't want to give up. 


We've just gotten accepted to rent a new house, a 1 story w/ finished basement suite, with 2 rooms upstairs  and 2 downstairs, along with a second kitchen, bathroom, and living room. We've decided that, because shes the oldest sister and used to it(and stubborn so the fight wasnt even brought up) that A would get a basement room regardless. 


D thinks she should get the other room, citing that shes used to living on her own, and that sleeping next to my parents(her aunt/uncle) is difficult and she shouldn't have to because shes older than me. She and my sister also want the ability to bring boys over and not have to explain to my parents who/why there were there.

 Shes also said that if shes upstairs, then shes going to be working harder on moving out, and not staying as long, but I dont really know how long she planned to stay in the first place. 


I feel I should get the other basement room for many other reasons to:  I cook more than either of them, as well as bake and own a lot of kitchen stuff, and I'm more likely to clean the easily ignored things. I've got a boyfriend of 2 years who stays over while working sometimes, and would like the privacy. 

Now, onto the AITA  part. It sounds blunt, but I'm the actual daughter, I've lived here longer, I've gotten the smaller room in pretty much every house I've lived in so far, I don't think it's fair that she thinks shes more deserving of the freedom than I am. I dont want to say this, because I'm afraid shell be offended and I'll sound like an asshole 

D thinks that because I stay at my boyfriends house on average 4-6 scattered nights a month, and that I've got 2 jobs, that I'm ""never home"" and that being upstairs shouldn't matter to me.  

I think that, because I'm the daughter, I cook and use the kitchen more than her, as well as keep my space cleaner and more organized than her, that I should get the room in the basement suite. 



So, WITBA if I cited ""because I'm the actual daughter and I've gotten the short end of the stick too many times"" as one of my reasons for wanting a more private bedroom?",28,28,0.86

The rest of the family are pissed as hell claiming their children have a right to those things. That those are ecuadorian history hence it should not leave ecuadorian land.  And that it belongs to them.

195,Not the A-hole,"Our school has a monthly magazine made by submissions of poetry, photography, and art from students. I'm the editor for the magazine, part of the committee that helps put everything together. The committee decided to put out another edition this month for the end of school with just photography of diverse people at our school, to show that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. They'd all be taken by a really good photographer at our school and this time not open for submissions. 

There were different categories people could sign up for of traits that weren't always considered conventionally attractive, and one of the categories happened to be freckles. 

Here's where my friend, fake name Melissa, comes in. Melissa has been faking freckles for awhile now. Not just like subtle freckles but all over her face and very noticable. She won't admit that they're fake but I've seen her wash her face and no freckles will be there afterwards. I've also seen her applying them (with a brown eyeliner pencil) and then when she sees me she quickly hides it. She posts selfies on Instagram a lot and you can see inconsistencies between the placement of the freckles from picture to picture. She always vehemently denies that they are fake, which I thought was weird but didn't confront her because I don't really care. 

She applied to model for the freckles category. There was only one person who signed up besides Melissa, a boy named Josh who had real freckles all over his face, arms, and legs. I knew he had been bullied for having them when he was younger, and this was a major blow to his self esteem. For a long time he would use his mom's makeup to try to cover them up. I didn't really know him well but he had been in my classes throughout middle and high school. 

When it was time for the committee to decide who to pick for each category, everyone was quick to vote for Melissa for freckles since she is very popular and Josh isn't that well-known. I decided to speak up, because I thought doing this magazine could be really good for Josh. I told them that Melissa'a freckles were fake and listed some of the things I mentioned above as proof of that. They were all shocked, which surprised me because I thought her freckles were very obviously fake from the beginning, a face covered in freckles doesn't just appear overnight. They asked me if I was sure they were fake, and I said yes and even pulled up her Instagram to show them the inconsistencies. 

After that, the consensus was unanimously that Josh should be the model for that category, and I was happy and thought nothing of it. Everything was great until someone told Melissa why she wasn't picked. 

Melissa got very angry with me and called me berating me for telling the whole committee that she's a liar (I didn't explicitly say that she was) and telling me I ruined her reputation. I'm starting to think I stepped out of line and should've kept my mouth shut. AITA?",296,3351,0.96
196,Asshole,"I am a guy who works at a restaurant, and one of my duties is breaking down the hundreds of boxes we discard each week, and putting them into the cardboard compactor. We have one of those big, industrial cardboard compactors that crushes huge numbers of boxes. This happens to be one of my (and my coworkers’) least favorite duties, because the compactor is a complete and utter piece of shit.

It it **super** finicky and jams over the slightest thing; malfunctions like crazy, and is just a general pain in the ass to use. Breaking down boxes has become a long, arduous chore for employees, and multiple people (myself included) have complained to management about it again and again and requested they replace it, which they continue to ignore. 

People have started regularly just throwing boxes in the big garbage compactor since it takes 0.000001% of the time, which management doesn’t care too much for (since they think it decreases space for other garbage, and they are somewhat more environmentally conscious/pro-recycling than normal as a whole). The rational response to this would be to get a new compactor, but do you think they responded this way? Nope. Instead, they respond by writing up people who throw boxes in the garbage and putting out all these bitchy, angry PSAs about how we’re not allowed to throw boxes away.

The other day, the box compactor was acting up, worse than usual. I was already in a bad mood about something else, and this certainly didn’t help. In a fit of rage, I **slammed** the door shut with all my might. And I mean **slammed** it shut, like with the amount of force I’d give the face of someone trying to kill my firstborn child. And that’s quite a bit of force, since I’m a pretty big guy. The second after the gunshot-like noise of the slam subsided, I heard a shrill & sickening creaking, whirring and putting sound coming from the machine. Just a minute in, it became clear that I’d broken it, probably for good. I got the fuck out of there, and kept 100% quiet about the whole thing, not telling a soul of what had happened.

The machine was roped off the next day, and later that week my manager told me we’re getting a new machine (with a totally different design) within the next couple weeks. From his explanation of it, I can tell that thinks the machine just died a natural death; he has no clue it was due to someone’s rough handling/rage. I said absolutely nothing to correct his ignorance, and honestly am **relieved** by the ultimate outcome of this. No punishment, new functional machine **finally** being installed...what a good turn of events.

Now if someone straight-up asked me “\[OP\], did you break the box machine?” I would **not** lie. But as long as they’re ignorant of my culpability, why go out of my way to rat myself out? The new box machine costs thousands, and that could potentially be taken out of my paycheck/bonus if they found out. AITA?",31,42,0.87

My husband and I were picking up our youngest from my MIL’s after work. We stayed to visit for a while and ended up on the topic of how we want to raise our son to be confident in himself and discover who he is. We talked about how we want him to try different styles, haircuts, and we want him to understand that there are no “boy” or “girl” colors. 

My MIL then chimes in with “As long as you teach him that boys should like girls.”

I was really taken aback by this and brought it up to my husband later after we left. He said, “I knew that that comment bothered you,” and proceeded to tell me that his mom was just raised in a different culture, different times. 

Regardless. I don’t want him exposed to that kind of homophobic thinking so young. I’m well aware he’ll encounter plenty of those opinions out in the world - I believe family should offer support and not additional judgment. 

Right now he’s a baby. He doesn’t care about anything other than food, play, and sleep. I’m thinking further down the line when he has his first crush and other romantic feelings - what if he DOES like boys? What will MIL say/think then? What if he does like girls? I still wouldn’t want my MIL to say things like that around him because it enforces homophobic thinking. 

I told my husband that if she makes another comment like that I wouldn’t be comfortable having my MIL watch him. My husband thinks that that would be too harsh. WIBTA?

We get him primarily on weekends, and a few odd days during the week here and there, but my husband is definatly in his life. His ex's husband has been in my stepsons life since he was about 1, and had started calling him daddy after they had another child together (he was just over 3 when his baby brother was born), I had just started dating my husband at the time and it had always bothered me that he called this other guy ""daddy"" as well as my husband (he would tell people he had 2 dads) 

I told his mother that I thought it was wrong for him to call his step dad ""daddy"" and should be calling him by his name, and she got defensive and said no one forces her son to call him that, it was just something he started doing on his own accord after they had another baby, I told her she needs to enforce on him that, that is not his Daddy, and it's rude to be calling him such. She told me her son could make that choice when he wants to and to mind my own business. I asked her how she would feel if he started calling me mommy, and she said she wouldnt care (fat liar) and put out this BS saying him calling me mom doesnt take away from her being his mom as well.

Fast forward a few years and my stepson is now 9, and still refers to him as dad (as well as my husband) and he does it when we are at school events, and just  confuses everyone and still bothers me (and my husband, he's just not as vocal about it as I am) 

I decided to have a conversation with my stepson about no longer calling his stepdad ""dad"" and why it was wrong and hurtful to his real father, he got  upset, and said he liked having 2 dads, but agreed not to do it anymore. 

After we dropped him back off with his mom, my husband gets a phone call from her, screaming at him for the conversation I had with him, telling him it was petty of me to do so, and that their son was upset. He told me I probably shouldnt have done that, but I only did was should of been a long time ago. That other man is not his dad, just like I am not his Mom, and my husbands Ex should of been more thoughtful of my husbands feelings on the matter when it started years ago

EDIT- My husband DID have this conversation with his Ex years ago, and she put out the same BS she told me, and he chose not to bring it up again because he didnt want to start a fight, but it has bothered him this whole time.

EDIT- wow, I knew I would get some backlash from this, but I honestly thought there would be more people that would think the title of ""Mom and Dad"" should be more sacred and special, not to just be thrown around on anyone, I get that he has been in my SS life nearly the whole time, However, 3 is such an impressionable age, and his mother should of known better, and nothing is going to change my mind about that, she says she didnt force him, but not correcting him is disrespectful to my husband.

And LOL to all the people saying I'm mad he doesnt call me mom, I love him, but I'm not selfish enough to  take that title on myself, Im okay with being his Step mom and him calling me by my name,

I point out he has 26 other days a month to “get to know them”. I think he shows off our son so they can see what a good dad he is.
He told me about the latest one, a week after he met her online. 37 (wow, the oldest by far besides me), just got fired from her job, lives at home sleeping on the couch, and has a 16 year old daughter.

But they freaked out and said they pay half the rent so they can do as they please. However, about 6 months, we found our lost cat (been missing for a year, prior to moving in with them).

Not too sure what that is but I think it's a license you need if you're renting out a house to 3 or more people who aren't related. Anyway, along with the post, the students union also gave a list of all properties in the area that have this license, as well as saying that if your house isn't on it, you may be able to claim back the years rent. 

Now, for the moral dilema: all my housemates jumped at the chance, but I'm feeling bad about it. Our landlords never given us grief, though he's never really shown his face or contacted us at all. For a student house though, no contact with your landlord is only a good thing.

This man had fought to get to uni and I was at the same uni. The three months leading up to his dissertation I was heavily involved helping him develop a programme, staying up in the uni library until 3am ect. 

He did it! He made good grades. He didn't want to walk in his graduation but his mother (who he doesn't have a good relationship with anyway) really wanted him to. He and I discussed it and he said he would do it, he got two tickets as that was all he could get. 

Now a few months before he's due to walk we are discussing the tickets and I say if both his mother and father want to be there I will happily wait outside and no watch him walk. But then his mother decides that she and his grandmother get the tickets. That my partner gets no say. 

Basically she wanted to ensure her own mother saw that she hasn't totally fucked up one kid. My partner was this woman maybe once a month at most and wasn't at all close. 

He, his father and I discuss it and his dad says that he doesn't mind me taking a ticket at all. My partner says he wants me there.

Now here is where I may have been an asshole. I put my foot down with his mother and said I'm going to this graduation, she has a ticket and is welcome. She kicked off at me and she even went to my partner and said ""you said she could come?!"" We all lived together at this point as well. Well she tried to talk me out of it and I basically said I was the one person he actually wanted there, he is doing it for you so sit down and shut the fuck up and watch your son graduate.

214,Asshole,"To make a long story short, a club at my university was doing this ""blind date"" program where you enter preferences via their website and they have a ""matchmaking team"" that finds the best potential date. It's in their beta phase so normally it would cost something but they want feedback, so they actually offer gift cards for doing it. My friends did it and got the gift cards and I figured hey, whatever. I'll go have dinner with someone for basically free (when you factor in the gift card).

I entered my preferences and the key thing to note is that I put down I'm into fitness and healthy lifestyles.....you cant put what you dont like, you just put what you like. I basically let them know I was looking for someone that enjoyed living healthy like I do.

So basically, I submitted my form and they told me what restuarant I would be going to, and we both confirmed, and we showed up at the designated time. I show up to the restaurant a few minutes early and I see an obese woman sitting at the table.

My heart sunk. I was completely and utterly disgusted. I'm not talking ""thicc"" or a tad overweight, or out of shape. No, this woman had an eating disorder.

I immediately walked out of the restaurant and sent a text to her saying last minute, I couldnt go to the restaurant. I didnt tell her why or follow up with anything else. She never responded. I felt horrible. I didnt turn my survey in and I didnt collect my $20 gift card. When they asked me why I didnt want to do the feedback and get my gift card, I simply told the dude ""you guys set me up with an obese woman"" and I walked out. I was mostly embarrassed but also angry, disappointed, and overall exhausted with the whole situation.",391,7393,0.88
215,Not the A-hole,"Throw-away account.

I'm a 30M living with my 28F wife. My MIL has fallen on hard times, we had a spare bedroom and agreed that she could stay with us.

I don't really want to get into the dynamics of all of our relationships, sometimes things are good, sometimes we want to be left alone, sometimes things are aggravating. She doesn't work, but sometimes she gets a bit of money here and there that she gives us. I'd say about 100USD a month. I believe she cooks and cleans as a way to show appreciation, but I never tell her to cook or clean anything and I always help when I can. I'm 30, not 3. I know how to take care of myself.

My MIL does homecookin' type meals. Fried chicken, potatoes, pork chops, velveeta mac and cheese, potatoes, bacon, potatoes, I've probably bought more butter in the first month she was here than I have in my entire life. She does these meals without much of our input and every meal is 1 main course and 4 sides. Every evening. This means I'm now eating this for lunch every day too because she makes too much and I really hate waste. With all that said, the food is tasty, but not really the types of food I eat.

I have high bloodpreasure. I am medicated for it, but these foods and the quantity isn't doing me any favors. She was out with her son for several days and I had a killer meal plan while she was out. Every meal, breakfast, lunch, dinner was delicious and healthy. Was really looking forward to continuing this when she got back. But first thing this morning, huge sausage patties, bacon, a ton of eggs, and six slices of buttered toast. She poked in the master bedroom to tell us breakfast was ready. I refused to eat it. I didn't really say anything or make a show about it, but I ignored the food that was on the table. I feel like she was insulted. She started talking about how I need to eat, how she cooked this lovely meal for us, and how I'm just wasting food.

We've told her multiple times before to ask us before cooking breakfast. Now, I got about 3 eggs, 3 pieces of toast, 2 serving sizes of sausage and 3 strips of bacon that are going to waste because I'm not going to eat it. My wife is exceptionally picky on leftovers. I don't think I've ever seen my MIL eat leftovers ever. And I don't really want the bacon, sausage, or toast, but would eat some eggs if I knew there wasn't a heaping scoop of butter in them. To add insult to injury, I did cook my own breakfast after I worked out.

So, AITA for not eating what my MIL cooked for me?",42,161,0.95
216,Not the A-hole,"I’m going to be honest with you guys, I don’t think that I’m wrong in this situation but enough people are mad at me over this I’m starting to question myself. I’m hoping that, if I’m in the wrong, you can explain why. 

I am a special education teacher and I also had a mild learning disability when I was a kid, so I’m particularly sensitive to the r-word. I don’t lecture people when I hear them say it but I don’t use it and I have told people close to me that I think using the word is inappropriate and hurtful. 

My in-laws use the r-word a lot. It seems like they drop it every 2-3 minutes in casual conversation. I have never said anything about it to them (edit: about using it around me, I have definitely said something about using it around the kids) because our relationship is already a little strained but my husband has asked them not to say it around me. They consider this to be an infringement on their first amendment rights and refused to stop saying it around me. I have learned to just deal with it. 

My husband and I have two kids, a five-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl. My in-laws have been otherwise respectful of our rules and parenting choices (like no soda except for special occasions, limited tv time, etc.) but they refuse to not use that word around our kids. It’s weird because they make an effort not to use swear words around them, but if it’s that word it’s suddenly an “infringement on their rights” and we’re “too sensitive.”  

I’ve tried to handle this maturely and explain to them why I don’t want them using it around our kids but this hasn’t worked. Earlier this week, however, I lost it on them. My kids came back from their grandparents house and my son was using the r-word. When I explained to him why it’s not an ok word for him to use he said “grandpa said that you’re the PC-police and that I can say whatever I want.”  I called my in-laws and went off on them. I don’t remember exactly what I said, but I know I was less than respectful and I definitely remember calling them ignorant. 

Since then, my phone has been blowing up with messages from my husband’s family saying that I have been extremely disrespectful and that I have no right to tell people what they can and can’t say. Even my husband thinks I overreacted and that “it’s not that big of a big deal” if they use that word around our kids, though he agrees that he would prefer that they don’t. 

Am I the asshole here? I feel like this is a fairly simple rule and that I have been over-accommodating already, but it is possible that I am overreacting.",333,1042,0.89

He is also a fanatic about his lawn.  He picks up stray leaves one by one.  He sprays it with chemicals all the time.  He mows it within an inch of its life.

218,Not the A-hole,"I am a woman. FH and I are getting married in October. I have two licensees to practice law in two different states, and I’m building a professional reputation with my last name. I don’t want to give it up entirely, but I want my family to have the same last name. I asked FH to take my name instead, he said no. Then I asked if we could both hyphenate. He said no. So far I haven’t really gotten any good reasons why.

Finally I said if we kept our last names that was fine, but I wanted any children we might have to have my last name, either as their only last name or as a hyphenated name. This is kind of where it gets hairy. He doesn’t seem to want to do that either, again for no reason that has been well articulated to me.

I think it’s totally unfair that I should be the only one to change, especially given the added hassle of my licenses. AITA for sticking to my guns about at bare minimum wanting to pass my last name onto my child?

Edit: FH and I talk about it, but he is never really able to articulate a reason other than it feels icky or he doesn’t want to. I just wish there were some other reason, because I feel mine are logistically pretty valid and I think it’s pretty unfair that if we both keep our names I wouldn’t be able to pass my name to our future family.

Edit: For clarity. I DO NOT CARE if he changes his name or keeps it. But if we both keep our names, I want to hyphenate our kid’s name so we are both represented. Of course I’d love it if he took my name or if we both hyphenated now, but I would also be happy keeping our names and hyphenating a kid.

Edit: FH and I have talked about the issue more, and he was able to tell me better what his reasons are. He is feeling to social pressure, and pressure from his family to be traditional, but we are still talking about that because he also recognizes that it’s important to me and wants to find a solution that makes us both feel good.",609,737,0.92

This girl who I volunteer with is having a Sweet 16 in a few days. I really don't know her that well or like her, but our moms have been friends for a few years, so I can't really say I don't want to go. The girl(or maybe the mom) invited all of us, and everyone invited is meant to bring their families also.

So my mom and I go shopping for her and my mom ahead of time looked for something to get, and decided on buying a necklace with interchangeable pendants that was about $40-50. I asked my mom what her budget was for her gift and said she wanted to keep it under $60.

I was bothered by this. I don't really know or like the birthday girl and personally, I don't think my mom should spend this much on her. My best friend's birthday(turning 16) was a few months ago, and when I wanted to spend $30, my parents were hesitant. I had to do a good amount of convincing to get them to buy a $30 gift. I feel like this isn't very fair.

AITA for feeling this way?

227,Not the A-hole,"This happened last night and so I'm confused if I'm the TA.

Earlier in the week my (30) boyfriend (32) (together 6 months) told me that was going out with an old friend after work on Friday night because he was in town and they hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to catch up on life. 

We usually hang out on Fridays and get dinner, so it's more of an assumed date night. So we really didn't have plans or anything exciting going on so of course hanging out with a friend is fine. 

Because he was going to be busy Friday night, I made my own plans to hang out with my girlfriends, which was go out to a bar, eat food and just hang out. Which I told him on Wednesday night. 

On Friday (yesterday) morning my boyfriend sent me a text and said that he decided he didn't want to hang out with his friend because he'd rather hang out with me so he canceled his plans. I told him that he should go because I had made plans. He refused and just kept saying that he'd rather spend the night with me. 

We ended up in this huge fight because although he wouldn't come out and say it, he was asking me to cancel my plans because he canceled his. I thought this was incredibly unfair and a bit controlling. He never approached me prior to canceling his plans, he just assumed that since he changed his plans that I should change mine. 

I did offer to come over afterwards but all he could say is he canceled his plans to spend the night with me not to just sleep with me (I would be leaving my friends pretty late). 

He has gone radio silent on me and we ended up not spending the night together.

229,Not the A-hole,"So I was dating a girl off and on over the past year and a half. She lives about 500 miles away and so it was a long distance thing, we had been off again for most of last year and sparked things up in November when she offered to fly me to a friend's wedding in Texas. That was good and she made the effort a few more times to see me, so I saw some possibility in us being a ""thing"".

My biggest fear in a relationship is getting a girl pregnant too soon. I've always been a fan of using condoms even if it kills the vibe. When I brought it up this time, she said not for me to worry because she had her tubes done and it was ""literally impossible"" for her to get pregnant. 

I should also add that she is a medical doctor so when she makes a claim about her body, I tend to trust her expert opinion.

Fast forward a couple months and we have some over the top fight and she says she can't do this anymore. I say ok and we part ways in what I think is a civil break up, despite the break up period (over the weekend of Valentine's day, no less) being absolute soul bending torture. I couldn't say or do a damn thing right and any action or word I did use ended up getting twisted into something that was the opposite. Last thing she says to me is ""don't ever contact me again""

I'm a bit of a sensitive dude and know that this was out of character for her so I feel something is wrong. I text a few times to get nothing back, just to make sure she's ok and that she's not got bigger issues.

She finally texts me telling me she's got an ectopic pregnancy and needs to get an injection to terminate. Im a bit blown away because she told me it was impossible to get pregnant and sure enough it happens. 

I try my best to say supportive things like ""you got this"" and ""I'm sure you'll be well taken care of"" and try to cheer her up to no avail. 

The next few weeks were hell with her constantly harassing me and saying extremely mean things about myself and my character. She says that when we broke up she was obviously hormonal with the pregnancy and I should have thicker skin, and a ""real man"" would have been supportive to her through this difficult time.

I and a few other people aren't even sure if she did get pregnant and maybe wonder if it was a tactic to try and get me back.

Anyway I ended up blocking her and she moved to email, sending hate filled messages about me not rising to the occasion to take responsibility for my part in the pregnancy.

I just kept ignoring her.

234,Not the A-hole,"The title is off but let me explain a crap ton of information to you.

My sister takes upwards of 3 hours in the bathroom when showering and just using it like a normal human being. I can hear her iPod through the door and laughing so I know she's not using it but just sitting there.

My parents have told her multiple times to stop taking so long because it's our aunt's bathroom, not ours. Even though it's our aunt's bathroom she has the audacity to yell at her saying ""IM GOING!"" like she's annoyed at her for wanting to use her own restroom.

I can't tell you how many times It's been 12 am and me having a full bladder going to my parent's bathroom inside their room and waking them up with the old ass door we have. I understand we got shitty bathroom locations but Jesus Christ my parents need sleep. Let's say it's 2 am she finally leaves the bathroom, I've been holding my piss in for 2 hours and I'm greeted to the smell of a fish market. I know exactly why and it's because she doesn't flush or wipe her waste till after she's decided she's had enough time in there or when my aunt wants to get in.

Today made me think of this horrible plan. I just got my braces done and it took me like maybe 10 minutes to clean my whole teeth, she kept coming back and forth trying to get me to come out but I just told her to use the other one since that's what she tells me. When I came out and told her she could have used the other one she gave me the dirtiest look I have ever seen, and to be honest it pissed me off way more than it should of.

I want to take as much time as possible in the bathroom to make sure that she learns a lesson. I know as a girl she has personal hygiene and stuff but whenever I ask nicely to get her to come out she yells at me, the same thing with my aunt.

&#x200B;

I wanted to be the bigger person but I can't anymore, I need something to be done. Does she have a bathroom problem that maybe I don't know about and I should respect that and let her take the time she needs?

update - 6/2/2019 Not much to update on, she still takes long as hell but I've been able to use the other bathroom in my parent's room with no problem. I'm not sure what to do at this point, right now I just want answers as to why she decides to take so long in the bathroom.",99,304,0.95
235,Not the A-hole,"My sister in law is an extreme couponer and has so much extra she sells it to make more money.  Yesterday she had some 24 packs of water selling for $2.75. I passed and said I would just wait because Walmart has them for $2.75 for the 40 pack.  She told me I was rude and should be supporting her and not the big companies and it’s people like me who make it hard for her and other “small business” owners to make money.  I bit my tongue from telling her exactly what I though of her “small business” and just shrugged.

I buy from her All the time (detergent and soaps and other things) but I am a teacher and mother of three with two in daycare and summer starting so a third to pay for child care too (I work all summer) and am currently pinching pennies.  I feel totally justified for choosing to get the cheaper stuff else where (esp when she pays pennies for everything and sometimes gets money back from the store for her stuff).  She tried to guilt me into “think about the children” and I reminded her I was, “my” children and she got mad.

I give her stuff for free all the time.  Mostly hand me downs but new stuff too.  She makes me pay for ANYTHING she gives from hand me downs to a drink.  I think she gets money hungry for everything.  But she is my SIL so I buy from her when I can and esp when it saves me money.  She also does raffles for big items she gets for free or buys for cheap.  Ex) She get Victoria Secret lotions and perfumes on clearance.  Then will raffle them for $2 a ticket but make it 60 tickets so she makes $120 off of $10 she paid.  I usually don’t buy raffle tickets.  She tells me the same thing that I am not supporting her.

236,Not the A-hole,"I (20M) have struggled with my weight for a majority of my life, so I would never insult somebodies weight or appearance randomly. I've been dating my current gf (21f) for over a year and at the start of the relationship I was overweight, but now I've gotten into the best shape of my life. I'm not saying I'm super muscular or anything, but I'm definitely proud of the progress I've made. 

One of my gf's close friends has always made snide comments about my looks or what I wear since I met her. It's very strange and random because a good part of the time she's quite normal, but then randomly throws an insult at me. Because of this my gf has limited her contact with this friend, I had no part in this decision and it was 100% my gf's choice. 

Recently my gf's friend group hungout with current SO's and friends of friends, and my gf's friend was there. I didn't mind this because I hadn't seen her in almost 2 months and maybe she wouldn't be rude to me. As we were hanging out the friend made two comments about me, the first being how I looked super pale like a vampire/hermit, and also about my clothes being too big for me(she knows I lost a lot of weight). After insulting my clothes she said ""If I knew any better I'd think you were homeless"", in which I responded ""If I didn't know any better I'd call you a fatass"". This friend is on the ""bigger"" side of the scale so she became super angry at me and yelling. 

Multiple friends in the group said I was out of line, but I think it was warranted and well deserved for her being so rude to me.

My neighbour recently approached me and asked me to stop smoking weed when her daughter is outside. If it's relevant, the daughter looks around 10-12 years old.

My reasoning for not being an asshole is:

- I have a legal right to smoke weed on my property, I feel like this is just as unreasonable as telling an adult to never drink a beer where children can see.

- Our houses are close enough that her kid can see me and possibly smell it depending on the wind direction. But NOT close enough that she's in any danger from secondhand smoke. The only danger is that if she sees an adult doing drugs, it might encourage her to try them too. But I feel like it's her parent's responsibility to talk to her about drug use and keep her away from it, I'm not her parent so it shouldn't be my responsibility to model good behaviour.

- It's summer and the weather is beautiful, so the kid is often outside. In order to not smoke weed in front of her, the only guaranteed safe times to smoke are when she's not home or when she's asleep.",625,1879,0.94

So my next-to-next-door neighbour's kids never shut up. They have a trampoline in the back garden and every day you can count on them waking up early and jumping and screaming well into the night. And the worst part is the screams - it sounds like they're all being operated on without anaesthetic. It's worst at summer but happens year-round. I wouldn't mind if it was occasional - hell, I'd encourage it - kids will be kids, but it's the persistence that gets to me.

I have a pretty big speaker system (A 2004 Panasonic SA-AK520 to be exact) which I've decided to start facing out the window and playing *Death Grips* as loud as possible.

Anyways, I live with my sister and we are both adults. I moved in 1 and a half months ago after my old roommates got us evicted and I had nowhere else to go. I didn't have any savings so she said I could move in and she'd give me a couple months to pay her retroactively for rent and bills. Rent + bills is like 850 a month so I owed her for part of last month, all of this month, and then of course June rent and bills are coming up. I've given her like $800 so far. She also paid the movers so I am paying her back for that too. It's a lot. I've given what I can spare right now but I got a raise at work so we should hopefully be square in a month, or so I thought.

Now she's trying to tell me that I owe her for taking my clothes to the laundromat, the food that I ate, and because I drank a couple bottles of her wine. She is seriously tacking on more to what I owe her and yes she did pay for all of that, but she never SAID I had to pay her for it. I just assumed I'd buy groceries sometimes after I pay her back.

This all came out because I sent her $100 yesterday and I tried marking down that I paid her the $100. She said no, it was only $30 because we went to the grocery store afterwards and we got $100 worth of stuff but $70 of it was mine. I said it was meant to share but she said she didn't want the kind of stuff I bought. To be fair, it isn't really the kind of stuff she gets for herself, but the stuff I ate of hers wasn't the stuff I'd get for myself either.

Then she tells me that if I want to count the whole $100 to what I owe, that she is going to make me pay for everything I had the past month and a half. Like, seriously, two bottles of wine for $80! Lunch meat that is $13/lbs?? I think she is being insane if she expects me to pay that much, especially since I told her she can eat what I got but she doesn't want to because it's ""cheap"" in her words.

I'm sure if I asked my partner to leave with me he would, but he's already said he doesn't want to and that I'm being frustrating staying in the tent. Am I the asshole if I ask him to take me home? Is there any way for me to not be the asshole here?

248,Not the A-hole,"throwaway as my mates use reddit. 

so my friend decided last week to get a tattoo, It was a quote that is quite commonly shared by people who have suffered abuse. 
it was, I'm not a victim I'm a survivor. 

she has never suffered any form of abuse or had any tragedy that would connect to the quote but she got it anyway, a friend did tell her that it's about victims of tragedy but she refused to listen. 

she posted it on a few Facebook tattoo groups and people assumed that she was a victim of somthing and started telling her how sorry they are and someone linked a few Facebook pages that work with DV victims. 

she got mad that people where assuming she was abused and messaged me to vent, I told her that she knew the meaning behind the tattoo and got it anyways, it's her problem to deal with not mine. 

she got mad and blocked me.

249,Not the A-hole,"I’m white and my husband is half caribbean, half white from both sets of parents. However he is completely white passing and has brown hair, hazel eyes, and very light skin. My son who is 5 years old definitely looks mixed race and although he has light hair and eyes, his skin color is much darker than his dads or mine. 

Ever since I had him, I’ve had (and his father has had) a million ‘jokes’ directed at his parentage. ‘Are you sure he’s his fathers?’ ‘Dude you’ve been cucked’ ‘hahaha your wife played played you bro’ ... even a few of my girlfriends pressed me after his birth to ask if my son was ‘really’ his dads. As I was very vulnerable and had just given birth, this really upset me and I insisted on a paternity test for my husbands sake because people were already spreading nasty rumors that I hadn’t been faithful. Even my mom and dad called me up and asked if everything was ok because they’d been hearing people talk about me. Of course, my husband was my sons father but ever since then these comments continue to put me down and I just can’t shake them or take them as a ‘joke’. 

I know it’s natural to be curious especially when your child doesn’t look like you, but at the point where I hear it at every family gathering on either side from someone who gets too drunk, or some nosy aunt who can’t get over it, it’s starting to get tiring and my son is at an age where he will start picking up on these little jabs. 

I’ve also realized from my extended family that there’s a deep element of colorism or ignorance or just plain racism because they really go over and beyond to mention my sons appearance. ‘Woooowww, I can’t believe he’s so dark compared to y’all, it’s just so cute we have a little brownie in the fam’ and stuff like that. 

My aunt made another comment a couple days ago when my son and I went to drop off some cat food for her and she remarked to him that she couldn’t believe he looks so different to daddy and mommy. I was furious and told her privately that she had no right to continuously point out physical differences especially because there’s no context or no need. Predictably, I got called a snowflake and a hissed retort that’s pointing out differences was always going to happen when I chose to marry a black man. 

As a final point, I will say my husband is an incredibly chill guy and he’s never once been bothered about my sons looks or how people perceive our family. Am I the asshole due to my sensitivity?",312,1419,0.88

251,Asshole,"HELLO, so I’m kinda new to Reddit but have become a fan of this sub and am having a problem of my own. I haven’t decided what to do yet, so I wanted other people’s opinions. TL;DR at the bottom.

First of all, a little background. My boyfriend and I had been looking for summer jobs to make a little extra money and I found out about an Art Camp for kids. I applied and, naturally, told him about it. He applied soon after and at first I was excited- it would be fun, right? Well as I thought about it, NOT REALLY because of the obvious “what if he gets the job and I don’t?” Well flash forward, we both end up getting a congratulatory email saying we needed to go pick up our contacts.

This is where my current problem begins. We had plans to go together and pick up the contract today. He doesn’t contact me all day, after I repeatedly called and texted to ask what was happening. He finally replied and told me he was busy shopping and wouldn’t make it. So I just decided to go by myself. As I was reading over the contract, I noticed two important things. 1) It was marked due three days ago, but I assumed that since I was there and they still allowed me to sign it, it would be OK. 2) There is to be a pre-camp meeting four days from now. I signed the contract and left. My boyfriend doesn’t know about the meeting, or that it should have been signed earlier. If he doesn’t sign it soon, the position will likely be given to someone else. WIBTA for not telling him?

To me it feels like he’s been piggybacking off of me since I heard about the job. I don’t want to warn him because it’s his fault for not prioritizing this and canceling the urgent plans to sign the contract. 

TL;DR- My boyfriend and I had plans to sign a contract for a job today and he canceled at the last minute. When signing by myself I found out that the contract was past due (they still allowed me to sign it) AND about a meeting coming up soon. My boyfriend doesn’t know about it. WIBTA for not telling him?

UPDATE 
I called to let him know about it. Looking back I realize that I probably made this a bigger deal than it needed to be (as I tend to do- I’m working on bettering myself). Thank you everyone for your input!",62,82,0.84

253,Everyone Sucks,"My friend (22M) and me (21M) went to the same university. We both were in the same STEM program and had most of our classes together. Including this one stats class with a very attractive prof. Neither of us ever saw her outside of class or said anything much more than hello to her for the entire semester but my friend slowly started to bring her up more and more talking about how much he was into her and how it was obvious she was into him. I thought this was pretty ridiculous and I constantly told him he was full of it. Never thought he was entirely serious.

&#x200B;

Anyway the semester ended and he graduated before I did. He would still bring up this prof occasionally and talk about how he needed to hit her up now that he was out of school. I told him ""you can't be serious"" like I always did, and he dropped it like he always did. Then one day, near the end of my semester,we're at a bar, drinking and he asks me if I will give her a note for him since I'm on campus still and it will save him a trip. I say sure, why not. He gives me a folded piece of paper and I tuck it away without much thought since we were in the middle of a different conversation.

&#x200B;

So the next day I'm home and I read the note. It's like a love letter but it's just this blunt, wildly inappropriate, excruciatingly forward, cringeworthy mess. To give you an idea how bad it is, it contains a sentence about how she soothed his inner demons immediately followed up with how she made him feel sexually. And let me rehash again that we had her for one semester and maybe said 2 dozen words to her between the two of us, mostly hellos and goodbyes.

&#x200B;

I'm completely appalled by this and there's no way I'm delivering it now. At first I think that I'm going to return the note, tell him what a bad fucking idea this is and why he shouldn't do this. But then I start thinking about how delusional he must have been to write this in the first place, how I've been discouraging him for a year now to stop acting like this prof is into him and it has never deterred him once, to the point where he still thought it was a good idea to write this. I thought that if I confronted him, he'd probably just deliver it himself.

&#x200B;

So I decide that it would be both more effective and easier on me if I just act like I delivered it, so that when she doesn't get back to him, he'll assume she rejected him and move on. So far that's pretty much what's happened. So, I feel bad that he thinks she ignored his letter but I feel pretty justified in thinking that's the best case scenario of what would have happened if she DID actually get it.

&#x200B;

I feel it was more about being tactful than dishonest but I'm open to judgment. AITA?

so we wait for our food and its an open kitchen so we can see things prepared. and i see ours is coming up. my wife ordered a rare steak with a side of chips. steak is there but not the chips. my order with chips is completely up. so i wait. and wait. and after 5 minutes its still sitting there while i see the manager standing there talking and another waitress picking up food. i give it another 5 minutes and finally i ask another server why our food is just sitting there he says someone will be over in a minute and steps away. so i get up go over to manager and ask him what is up why is food sitting there under a heat lamp for 10 minutes and he says its not ready. he asks the chefs and they look at each other with no excuse. manager says we will be right over with your food. i go to sit back down and he turns away goes back to talking with another waiter. so i sit and watch as our food just continuess to sit there.

my wife at this point can tell im done. she says lets go and so we get up to leave. soon as they see us leaving they pick up our food and say we are bringing it over right now. i said thats bullshit im not eating food especially a steak thats supposed to be cooked to order thats been sitting under a heatlamp for 10 minutes. finally our waiter comes out and asks if we are leaving. i just said yes and we left.

am i the asshole for blowing up at the restaurant staff? i did swear a couple of times in shocked disbelief they were being so flippant about our food. my wife thinks i kinda overreacted but understands not wanting to stay.",21,117,0.94
255,Not the A-hole,"I’m 18 and have just finished high school. My sister is 7 and goes to the same school I do (the school is from kindergarten to grade 12). My mother is a very busy person and also the main provider for the family so she usually leaves for work at 8am and comes home at 8pm.

My mother asked me to take care of my sister since I stay at home the entire day. My sister is a very picky eater and has mostly been spoon-fed until now so she has very little motivation to eat on her own. She’s 26kg (57.3 lbs) and is not underweight. I drop her off at school, go home, make lunch, deliver it to her, and do something until I pick her up from school. Afterwards I make another meal for her at around 4pm, play with her, and help her do homework until my mom comes home and we all eat dinner. My mom sends me texts with well-balanced diets that I make sure my sister eats and she takes care of my sister during the weekends. 

My sister recently contracted a cold during one of the weekends. For the 4 weeks I’ve taken care of my sis, she’s lost about 1kg (2.2 lbs) and caught a cold. My mother is stressed from work and is angry that I’ve not been taking care of my sis well enough. I’m stressed because I want my sis to eat on her own but she’s getting sick from eating less.

My mom and I have been arguing more and more because of this. My mom won’t hire a caretaker for her because I’m free but I don’t want my sister to be more sick because of me. I want my sister to be an independent eater but she’s getting sick because of it. I just don’t want my sister to be spoon-fed because when I leave for college, she will be even more sick from not eating.  I honestly think I’m not cut out for taking care of my sister but since there is no one else, I don’t really have a choice. Am I the asshole here?

Edit: I was underweight and a VERY lazy eater when I was young and my mother’s been worried about eating habits in general ever since. She was worried that my sister would turn out like me so she spoon-fed my sister since she was small. Over time, my sister just didn’t eat on her own.

My sister has no developmental issues. She is actually taller and in better shape than most of the kids in her grade. Our family’s just worried that she doesn’t eat on her own.",59,42,0.91

We argued back and forth about it, then she had enough of it and told me to give her my iPod and phone. 

I agreed to give her the phone and wanted to take out the SIM card, but I wanted to keep my iPod. I refused to give it to her because

1) She didn’t buy it, nor has she used any of her own money to pay for it. She doesn’t pay the phone bill for my phone either. 
2) My dad bought the iPod as a way to keep in touch because at the time my mom took my phone for nearly a year and stopped paying the phone bill for it. About 7 months after I received the iPod, he bought me a cheap phone and added me to his plan because I still didn’t have my phone back. When I got my original phone back from my mom, I put the new SIM card in my old phone. 

She was furious when I told her that she didn’t pay for any of it and started to rant about how my dad doesn’t pay for anything for me and my siblings (which isn’t true) and it’s all her. Then she tried to grab it by force (and succeeded).

When she was walking away with my stuff I yelled that what she was doing is theft because she didn’t pay for any of it. She told me that anything I own that’s under her roof belongs to her, even if she didn’t buy it herself because I am her child and she’s the adult.

Most recently she asked if I could help her study for her learners exam. She had failed it 9 times previously and my sister refused to help her study and refused to pay for it again (which I understand as its $14 each time). Anyway, after one afternoon of practice exams and book reading she was successful!

She is going to go back to grade 12, bump up her grades and get into a program she actually wants to take. She asked me to help her study and get her into shape as the program she picked was correction studies (RCMP). I work out daily and enjoy spending time with her. So I thought sure, best bet was to move in once she’s done her current year (end of June). I have 3 small kids (under 6) and live on a acreage so I can’t drive until the city to help her with her homework otherwise. 

I contacted the local high school to see if she can attend and figured out if bussing is even an option. And it is! So the next day I call my sister to tell her our plan and ask her opinion.

When I met my wife she already had a son from a previous marriage. Her son is severely autistic and requires constant care. We had to pay thousands of dollars every year to carers and the home that he spends 5 days a week at (he spends weekends at home). I was fine with contributing and helping her out with these costs when we were married. 

Sadly, my wife passed around 3 months ago and last month I decided to stop paying for her son's care. My wife's friends, and even some of mine, have waged a campaign of harassment against me for doing this, but he's not even my kid. I don't see why I should pay for his care. From my POV it was generous for me to pay for all the costs for 2 months after she died. 

I had thought that my wife's family would offer to take over the responsibility, but they have not. They are not a particularly wealthy family and they seem to think I should pay for her son forever because I earn more than they do.

So, AITA for not continuing to financially support my dead wife's severely disabled son?

EDIT - I am not his legal guardian. His aunt is. Welfare stuff is her responsibility. No will was in place. My wife died suddenly and she was in good health. And to clarify, I told my wife's family that I'd cover all of his costs for 2 months after her death. I gave them plenty of time to make arrangements.

Some background: When he got the dog he asked me if I would be ok with it, I told him no because I am afraid of dogs. Later that day he went ahead and got it. Ever since then I don’t go anywhere near the dog. I’m afraid of dogs because I was attacked by one when I was 7 and had to get a lot of stitches done. Ever since then I’ve always kept my distance from them.

He just left for the weekend today for a business trip and asked me yesterday to watch him. I told him no and that he needs to find another dog sitter. Today he left for the trip and his dog is still at the apartment. I texted him asking if he found a sitter and he said no that I needed to watch him and get over my fear. He says that there are no 20 year olds afraid of dogs and this is a good opportunity to bond with it because I always stay away from it.

I don’t know what to do and am very scared. The dog has very sharp teeth and claws and I’m afraid of him attacking me. I plan on giving it good inside its cage and only letting it out to use the bathroom, I’ll put him back in the cage when he’s done.

I feel very bad for the dog but it is not trained well and likes to bite people. I’m afraid that he will attack me when my roommate is gone.

271,Not the A-hole,"Some context. My wife and I are currently long distance as I’m on a 3 month long work assignment in LA. My firm has put me in a fairly spacious serviced apartment for these months.

A few weeks ago my SIL (wife’s younger sister) was sending messages in our extended family group chat about how her and her family might be in California on vacation. They were chatting to each other about what to do and see. At one point she mentioned me and asked about how big my place was. My wife chimed in to say my place is gorgeous and huge. I agreed that it’s pretty big and if they need to stay with me then they’re welcome to, just let me know the dates. Word for word, she responds with “ok sure we’ll think about it after we get our itinerary sorted out. Thanks.” 

That’s it. Nothing else from then on. Over the next few weeks they chat about what they’re going to see in the other parts of the state to others in the chat. Then they’re in California and sending pics. Normal stuff, but nothing addressed to me (after what’s happened I’ve checked and rechecked).

Then this past week out of nowhere I get a call from my wife. She says her sister and her fam will be over in roughly an hour, they just flew down from SF. I tell her no one called me or told me anything, that I’m leaving for a business trip from Thursday-Monday and I don’t feel comfortable having her sister, her husband, and their three kids in my space unsupervised.

My wife gets really upset and tells me to get over it, that she’s not going to call her sister and tell them they have no place to stay, esp when they have kids in tow. I’m mad at this point that no one thought to ask me. I told her that’s really not my problem and if they showed up on my doorstep then I’m not letting them in. 

This whole thing has now blown up. They ended up getting some cheap hotel near the airport and they’re pissed beyond belief because they claim I “promised” them a place to stay. My wife has publicly called me out in front of her whole family, I guess to distance herself and put all the blame on me. Yesterday I found out I’ve been booted from that family chat and my wife has been ignoring all my calls as well. 

WITA for being this uncompromising in my stance to not let them stay with me? I felt really justified at the time but now I wonder if I overdid things and should’ve just let them stay with me. It wouldn’t have been a huge hassle but I guess I just felt disrespected by the lack of communication. At the very least I could have avoided all this.

**edit:** to answer some questions I didn’t want to leave them alone at my place bc I have some extremely expensive equipment around my apartment (I’m a photojournalist) and the open layout means there aren’t that many places I could safely store them in for long periods. But if I had been given prior notice, I could’ve either 1) postponed my business trip, 2) made arrangements to move my things, or 3) made arrangements to get them another free place under my firm’s contract with the building. 

I also keep a lot of general work in the place (papers, books, etc) that I would’ve needed to tidy but would have had no chance to. 

Secondly, I had initially offered to let them stay the first night (I was leaving 1.5 days later) on the stipulation that they would need to find another place to stay when I left, no exceptions. This was immediately shot down as wife basically told me to fuck off. That I can’t expect their whole family to repack their things and move after less than two days (tbh this made sense to me, would’ve been pointless to come for only 2 nights). 

Finally, I’ve tried making my case but they’re intent on claiming I should’ve known about my SIL’s plans. Honestly there was a pretty high chance I wasn’t even going to be in town. I don’t know what they would’ve done then. But they’re all pointing to the one text my SIL sent about “letting me know” and saying that was evidence enough that I should’ve expected them at some point. 

My wife is being unreasonable but she’s always like this when it comes to her family. She’s extremely eager to please them and stresses out if she feels like I’m not giving all that I can bc she thinks it’s embarrassing that her husband isn’t being generous with her family.",372,1688,0.97
272,Everyone Sucks,"3 years ago, I was in a relationship with an abusive guy Tom for 6 months. From the start there were overlooked red flags; one being his **excessive** divulgence of medical details. Our first date, for instance, he gave me long details about some weird heart condition he had as a kid.

Later he told me that he has MS, which he frequently posts very long/graphic details about online. He frequently claimed to have multiple other obscure illnesses, & as things went on I started to doubt him. His behavior worsened; he became emotionally/physically abusive & he heavily rationalized his this on MS and other illnesses.

The last straw was when I found out the MS was fake; I left him & there was a brief period of stalking afterwards. Looking back at my relationship, the only 2 illnesses I believe Tom has are both mental - narcissistic personality disorder & Munchausen Syndrome.

Recently, a friend told me that Tom is posting on Facebook about a new illness & this time trying to get money from people. I looked at his profile & saw a post from him that had received an **enormous** amount of likes/shares/comments. He claims to have been diagnosed with colorectal cancer & has set up a GoFundMe. He received a huge amount of sympathy, and his GoFundMe already had a hefty sum of money.

Seeing all these people being fleeced by him absolutely churned my stomach, & I felt that I had an obligation to do something. Tom & I share many mutual friends; I made a post detailing Tom’s long history of lying about illnesses & abuse towards me. I **also** posted a screenshot of a Facebook message from him, just after we broke up, in which he says multiple times “sorry I lied about the MS” & says “I’m sick with Munchausen Syndrome, I can’t help it”.

This post spread like wildfire, & very fast his GoFundMe, which had been ticking up quickly, came to a halt & was shut down. At first, I felt terrific. Then, I received a number of messages/calls from Tom & several friends. I won’t provide the details as they’re complicated & there’s not enough room, but long story short...Tom **was**, believe it or not, telling the truth this time. He **does** have cancer; I was provided some pretty concrete evidence of it.

Regardless of if he makes this evidence public, his “fund” is pretty screwed. People aren’t going to want to donate to him after this shock; news of his lying spread way too far/fast across the web for him to ever get his campaign back up.

Tom’s now demanding an apology & saying that I owe him $ for sabotaging his GoFundMe. He’s highlighted his tough economic position & the fact that all his family have cut him off financially. I refused both demands. I told him that **he** sabotaged his GoFundMe by lying in the first place & that his tale is a perfect case of “Boy Who Cried Wolf.” I strongly believe that I was just doing my civic duty by warning others of his previous lying; they had a right to know of it before giving him their money.

274,Asshole,"I'd like to first say that I'm close with both my uncle and aunt. My main concern is that I know I could completely destroy their family (they have one son) if I mention my aunt's behaviour but here's the context.

So recently my aunt and uncle have been arguing more as my uncle suspects that my aunt has been unfaithful in some way. They never argue in front of our family but my aunt told me in private that at some point he flipped out while drunk and asked to see her phone because he thought she was texting someone she was having an affair with. She cried to me about the situation saying that how he was being was unfair. She then said something alone the lines of ""When you get accused of doing something like this by your partner, it makes you want to do it"". At the time I thought nothing of it.

Me and my aunt work in the same company which means I see her literally every day of the week. It also means that it's unlikely she can hide something from me because we literally sit in the same room. One day I glance over at her and I see the weirdest thing:

A burner phone.

The minute she caught me glance she tried to slide it under the folder on her desk. I turned away so that she wouldn't know that I had seen it but automatically alarm bells started ringing.

On another day I walked past her while she was using the phone I caught glimpses of texts to someone saying things like ""I love you"" and ""things are good on my end"". 

I've never picked up the phone myself but I know she leaves it at work and never takes it home. I know this because we go home at the same time and take the same route. However yesterday she told me she wouldn't be coming back with me cause she's going out. I asked her where she was off too in a light hearted way and she wouldn't say anything. Normally she's the type of person that would say where she's going and with who. She then messaged my uncle and told him she was going out with ""the girls"" from work. Sounds pretty reasonable right? Except all ""the girls"" had either gone home or stayed behind to do extra work.


WIBTA if I said anything to my uncle? Should I check the phone myself first to see if maybe it's all innocent and I'm blowing things out of proportion? Any advice is appreciated. Also sorry for any grammar/spelling issues I'm dyslexic. Thanks.

TLDR: Caught my aunt using a burner phone and sending affectionate messages to someone after my uncle has accused her of cheating even though she says she's innocent. Should I say anything?",175,259,0.94
275,No A-holes here,"Our dog passed three days ago. She predated my daughter and even my wife, so it was especially hard on me. We had a little burial in our backyard where my daughter (8) said a few words. We put her favorite blanket, and toy in the coffin I made and I buried her.

But, unbeknownst to me, my daughter snuck in another toy. I had a stuffed penguin I've had for nearly 15 years, it was something I bought for my previous dog before she passed, and this new dog played with it a lot, too. I wanted to keep this toy forever because it represented two dogs I've owned, not just the one. I kept it on my home office desk and had no intention of ever getting rid of it.

I guess my daughter thought it should be with her too, so she took it, put it in the coffin, and I buried it. I only found out today after asking her where the penguin went. Obviously I'm not going to get mad at her for this, but this cut deep. No fault of her own, she didn't know, but I'm left with a hard decision.

I think tonight when everyone's asleep, I'm going to dig up the coffin, pry it open, get the penguin back, and then rebury the coffin. I made mention of this to my wife, as a joke to gauge her reaction, and she said it was a dark joke and no sane person would do that. I might have to do it and never tell her or anyone else.

276,Asshole,"So, for the last few months, I've been on kind of a dating kick. But it ended recently because, well, shit got kind of real when a man I was thisclose to sleeping with told me (read: sputtered at me), ""I've never done this before.""

This is how it went:

After amicably ending my relationship with a man I loved deeply, I had to get my sea legs, so to say. But really what I ended up getting was my sea drunkness. And my sea promiscuity. Hello to the Tinder cesspool.

In the midst of mostly-forgettable, problematic men, I met one who was sweet and seemingly well-adjusted. He had a real job and a real house and wasn't sketchy and didn't really seem into bullshitting around. He was cute and we had enough things to talk about, so I was hopeful that, while I wasn’t looking for a relationship, the idea of going out with someone kind and not-weird for a while sounded pretty appealing.

So we did go out a few times. Three times, to be exact. Which, interestingly enough, is the exact number of times it usually takes to go from “Should we sleep together?” to “Yeah, might as well just sleep together.”

That wasn’t how it went at all, though. Oh JFC, it wasn’t. And not for any reason I was even prepared for. Because I don't know if, after a sex bender, you can ever prepare to feel the feelings you feel when the man with whom you're between the sheets tells you he's never had sex. Never. Had. Sex.


In fact, he waited until he was putting on a condom to inform me that he’d “never done this before.”

After the shock, there were two options, really: Do it with the awareness it would not be good for me and potentially emotionally difficult for him, or don’t do it and leave the poor dude still standing with his V card firmly in his shaky hand. So naturally, I went into caring stranger mode.

“Oh, jeez,” I stammered. “OK, we need to stop.”

“I don’t think I can be the person you do this with. I’m not going to be your girlfriend, this isn’t going to be a relationship -- and you probably should do this with someone who is,” I told him as placidly as possible. He just groaned.

For asecond, I did consider another possible plan: Come back at a later date for the mercyfuck. Maybe he just really wanted to get it over with, and I could be the somewhat-slutty lady who could come along and help him get over the hump of virginity. But almost immediately, I realized what a terrible idea that would be, because this did not seem like the kind of guy who could go from zero to 60 and suddenly start having casual sex.

He waited a full week to text again, and when he did, he asked me to come over and watch movies, which, with any other guy, I’d assume was code for “have sex with a movie playing awkwardly in the background.” But with a virgin, it was all new territory.

I didn’t respond, which I don’t think was the right thing to do, though, really I don’t know that there was a good outcome possible. Maybe there was - I’m sure you’ll tell me what I should have done. So, AITA?",307,201,0.82

278,Not the A-hole,"Preface this with I make a little over double her income. 

So before meeting her I would travel internationally every 6 months or so. Once we started dating I felt like the traveling slowed down because I was unsure if she could afford to go since her job didn't pay very well and I didn't want to feel obligated to ""foot the bill"" so I just never said anything about it.

Oneday she brings up my frequent travel pre dating our relationship and instead of coming clean about how I said I felt earlier(I'm an asshole for that part. Honesty is the best policy), I bring up this couples getaway to Thailand proposed by one of my college friends I managed to stay in contact with.

She immediately got excited and started planning out what we'd do there and she started researching places to go and all that jazz. I tell her that it is 7 days hotel and air for $3500/person. Her jaw drops... And I saw the sadness in her face; imagine a child going to the dentist instead of Disney land..

She says she can't afford that, it's 3 months away and she wishes she made more so she could go. I tell her yeah I'm sorry, We can save up for next year. 

She is sad the whole night but I knew something more was bothering her when she didn't want to be held while sleeping later that on.

She usually wakes me up in the morning since we get up around the same time and I'm a very heavy sleeper. I actually once slept through an Earthquake. Knocked my dresser over(invest in the eye screws and wire if you live in quake zones). She didn't bother waking me this morning, luckly the dog was my secondary alarm.

I get ready and we end up in the kitchen together and I ask her what's wrong, explaining to her about last night and not being woken up. She says she's sorry and understands it's petty. She was upset that I didn't offer to pay any portion of her cash for the getaway since I make so much more than she does.

I tell her that I've been burned in the past with letting people borrow money. That I have an ex that still owes me $2k and we dated for 2 years. 

She gets upset and says I don't trust her to pay me back and that she really wanted to go. I told her ok, but as a compromise you have to sign a contract. 

She, get, OFFENDED..... you don't trust me, we've been together so long, I promise I'll pay you back and that she doesn't need a piiece of paper to keep her word. 

It's been three days of the cold shoulder and I'm starting to ask myself if I went too far.


**Edit** I want to make 2 things very clear..


1. I in no way intended on going on this trip without her. My dad would kill me...

279,Not the A-hole,"My brother has been borrowing my car for school since his is currently broken and I’m stuck at home recovering from surgery. I told him this was fine as long as he asked every single day.

This morning, my brother didn’t ask me. I woke up and went outside to find my car missing when I wanted to go walk and do my PT at the park. I finally got clearance to leave and was excited to finally see something else beside my street corner out the window the last 6 weeks and treadmill walking.

He showed up after school.... with 5 friends in my car.  He came inside for some water. They were gonna take my car again to the park for the rest of the day. I told him to take his friends home and bring my car home so I could go walk. He said no, and that I was gonna have to suck it up.

I told him if he walks out the door with my keys I was gonna call the cops. I told him to give me my keys and tell his friends to find a way home.

I feel bad for his friends, but I don’t feel bad for the embarrassment I caused him when he literally just said no to bringing my car back after taking his friends home. I wasn’t gonna let him walk over me when I provided a compromise.

My brother and my parents thought IWTA here, and yelled at me for being so inconsiderate and threatening to call the cops. It’s literally my car he took without permission from me, when I really wanted to get out of the house.


AITA Reddit? Or is my family just insane? Was I overreacting?",68,268,0.95
280,Asshole,"Throwaway account...

Background - I'm in my mid 40s, married with kids. Home life is good, and marriage is good - just typical ups and downs. I've been married almost 20 years.

In college, I took up flying as a private pilot because a friend introduced me to it. It. was. amazing. It gave me a level of confidence I had before - and I've always been an anxious person - being in the air was the most calming thing. Takeoff feels like I'm leaving all my stress and anxiety back on ""earth"". Landing takes precision and focus to get it just right. I love everything about flying.

But, my wife hates flying. She barely tolerates commercial flying (although she's gotten better), and she absolutely \*refuses\* to let me fly myself. Although we never had a formal discussion, it was understood that getting married meant that I'd have to give up flying. So, I did.

And - back then, it was easier. I didn't have time or money. The thing with flying is, most people say when you have time, you don't have money - and when you have money, you don't have time. And that was true for the last \~20 years.

But - over the last decade, I built and sold a company, and we are now financially set for life.

But, my wife has pretty much said absolutely not. I've tried offering her her own lessons so she could get comfortable; I've tried asking her to just sit in a small plane so she can gain some familiarity... just taxi around and come back. But she's having none of it. Every time she sees a small plane crash on TV, she points it out. Any compromise on this issue is a non-starter.

So - WIBTA if I just started flying and didn't tell her?

If I replace ""Want to fly"" with ""want to spend every other thursday with a sex worker"" than I'm clearly TA. If I replace it with ""want to switch the toilet paper from under the roll to over the roll,"" I think I wouldn't be.

So where does ""being a private pilot"" fit in?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks all, for the input. I never really thought I'd go behind her back to fly again, and this just reinforces that I won't do that. I wish I could even broach the subject with her, but it results in an immediate, irrational, strong response. I've considered marriage counseling with her to discuss this, but she's not amenable to that either. I've tried \*everything\* suggested below - discussed the statistics, discussed how much it means to me, etc. But when it comes to flying, she just doesn't care. I don't see a solution - and frankly I'm too scared to do it behind her back. I don't think she'd leave me over it if she found out, but I wouldn't want to take that chance. 

This sucks. I wish I had a solution - but I know that's not the purpose of this forum.",32,28,0.87
281,No A-holes here,"Throw away cuz reasons, posted to r/relationships but kinda wanted more input.

About 18 years ago my sibling was in a terrible accident. The accident left them with permanent physical and nerve damage. The accident caused them to gain a lot of weight due to being immobile for a time. They also have some brain damage, memory loss and seizures. Though if you met my sibling on the street you'd never know, they function very well, and work a regular job.

The issue is my sibling is a black hole of happiness.  They complain about everything. 
If they gain weight they complain about being heavy. If they lose weight they complain about having to buy new clothes cuz the old clothes don't fit. 
They complain about their pain and having to see the doctor, they complain about all the medications they need and then stop taking them and complain about how much harder things are without them.
My sibling has to be the smartest person in the room and will constantly assert that they know everything about everything and then complain about how hard it is to remember all this knowledge with their brain damage.
They constantly finish my sentences when I am talking and occasionally become violent if you criticize them.  They hit me with a cane in public because I went off to speak to a group of friends and didn't help them up the stairs even though they are perfectly capable of walking.

They like to insult me with small put downs about anything at all. They complain that they don't see me enough and then complain because when we are together people think they are my parent. Every time I see them it is emotionally exhausting. It's so hard to be around so much negativity.  They have lost a few close friends due to their negativity.

My mother says I need to have more patience because the accident has done so much damage and taken so much from them. She feels that if I limit any communication with my sibling I'm an unfeeling bitch who is betraying my family.

My thoughts are that the accident was almost 20 years ago and my sibling can't expect me to spend as much time with them if doing so makes me miserable.

So anyway, she came into work late today, and when I made a small joke about our presentation (we have an upcoming meeting) she rolled her eyes and walked off, as if I had offended her. So me, slightly confused, went about my day till about lunch when we met again in her office. She seemed fine, but she told me her toddler had a stroke and was unresponsive when she woke up. Her toddler had been taken to the emergency room, but he was fine. We ate and joked a bit before she up taking my laptop. This caused me to have immediate anxiety, as when I was a kid whenever an electronic was taken away my parents went through my accounts, even if there was nothing bad on my apps I still panicked. So, today, my mind went into panic mode and started grabbing for it, while she laughed and began to look through my stuff. I told her to stop, as her name wasn't on the bill that paid for the laptop, and she said, ""That's unfortunate."" Me, being quick with the shade and not in the mood said, ""What's unfortunate was that your name was on a bill for your son's stroke.""

284,Not the A-hole,"Customary: ""long term lurker, new account"" and ""I'm on mobile"" disclaimers. 

I wanna start off by saying I personally think this situation is fuckin ridiculous and I'm *pretty* sure I'm not in the wrong here, but since it's causing so much fuss I want the opinion of strangers. 

So it goes like this: I'm a guy who likes weird, old shit. I have a pretty extensive collection of antiques and oddities. I'm aware that some of it is kinda creepy stuff to some people; namely, I have a taxidermy fox and quite a number of framed moths and butterflies, a couple of snake bones, as well as one of those teaching skeletons who just hangs out on my sofa (his name is Reginald). It's not everybody's cup of tea and I get that, I don't expect everyone to like it. 

However. Recently, my friend has started dating this new girl. Let's call her June. June *loathes* my taste in decor. It's not just the taxidermy and bones and shit she hates. She complains that she's frightened of getting sick from my antiques, that she always feels ""itchy"" at my place and is convinced that there are dust mites in my furniture (I take great care to make sure I don't). She's constantly suggesting I throw pieces I adore away and buy brand new stuff, and I just don't want to do that. Now, this wouldn't be much of a problem if my house wasn't the go to hangout for all of my friends (friend group ranges from 18-22, everyone else lives at home and/or has flatmates they don't wanna disturb, I just live with my fiancé), and if she didn't make these complaints *every fucking time* she comes over.

Last weekend, we had a night out which started with pre drinks at mine. For all of the ~2hours people were over, I'm not exaggerating when I say there was maybe 45 minutes total that June wasn't complaining. The next day I sent her a message basically saying ""look if my décor bothers you so much it's maybe for the best you don't come over any more."" Apparently she became very upset by this, and went to my friend saying that I was trying to force her out of social situations because she doesn't like the same things I do, and claiming I was ""bullying"" her because of her anxiety (I didn't know she had anxiety and I suffer with it myself, so of course that's not the case). My friend is naturally defending June because of course he's gonna side with his girlfriend if she's claiming she's being bullied, but it's kind of dividing the group. Some are saying it's not my problem if she's freaked out by my stuff, others are saying I was a dick for confronting her like that. I can kinda see both sides, but idk what I'm expected to *do* about her hating my stuff so much. What do you guys reckon? Am I a dick? Is she a dick? Are we all dicks? 

Edit: realised by dust mites I actually mean fleas, maybe termites in wooden things. My bad, I'm a moron. To be clear tho, I *do* make sure to properly clean any furniture I bring into my home thoroughly to rid it of potential pests, regardless of what the pests may be.",93,141,0.9

We have three trash bins for each unit, with mine being the middle one. I've noticed that there's been trash in my bin after they've forgotten to put out their bin for trash day (I'll put mine out and theirs will still be there). 

Each time this has happened I sent a group text politely asking them not to do that next time but deal with it. I live alone while unit 1 and 3 are two bedrooms so I rarely need a full bin but in case I do need the full bin I don't want somebody's trash in mine. Each time somebody apologizes and all is good. 

One time I was leaving my apartment and a dude from unit 1 was in the middle of putting a full bag of trash in my bin. I was polite and just told him please don't do that. I can tell he was embarrassed and later had taken it out. 

Trash day was yesterday and unit 3 did not put theirs out. I don't look into people's bins so have no idea if they forgot or just did not need to. Came back from walking my dog and a full bag of trash with what looked like rotten food and take out containers was in my bin. 

*Each time this has happened its not just a small shopping bag of trash but at least a 13 gallon. 

Our bins aren't huge so that means I'd have to keep it in there for a whole week and not be able to throw much out without overflow. 

Instead of texting them this time I just took it out and checked the other bins. Unit 1 was empty and unit 3 was full so I assumed it was unit 3 and just put the full trash bag on top of their already full bin and stuffed the lid on.

Backstory-My father married someone relatively recently. Maybe I’m just being judgmental, but she’s kinda strict. She said that she wanted my bed time to be at ten (I’m 17). I tried to explain that it would be nearly impossible for me, as I have homework and a part-time job. She...didn’t take it well. She yelled that I was “being disrespectful”. 

What happened-On one particularly busy night, I was working on an extra-credit assignment. My stepmom said “It’s 10, go to bed!” I didn’t listen. I stayed in the dining room, and didn’t move at all, except for when I had to switch papers. She kept on telling me to go to bed (even though I told her that I was doing extra-credit). I didn’t move. I could’ve pretended that I was listening to her, by doing it in my bedroom (she would’ve checked), but I wasn’t going to pretend just to please her. I realized that it was more disrespectful than doing it discreetly, but I didn’t care. Honestly, it was probably because I had too much pride.

First of all, I want to say that I absolutely adore my fiancee (Sarah). Our relationship has been incredible and I truly believed we were on the same page. A united force. I could go on, but you get the idea. 

Sarah is big into natural medicine. I saw nothing wrong with this whatsoever. If it were essential oils, or crystals that would be one thing. I thought it was a bit old fashioned and reminded me of my grangran which wasn't a bad thing. Example: If she had a cough, she'd take a spoonful of honey; mint tea for a stomach ache; for a sore throat she would gargle some concoction. Perfectly harmless. It was always my understanding that if she was truly ill, she would trust modern medical science. 

Well, uh, she made a liar out of me. 

I'm not sure what prompted this discussion, but we were talking about mental health and she was very against medications for mental illness. It became this whole thing and she asked me, kind of ticked off, if I thought she needed to be on medication. Hm? No, of course not, I told her, confused. That's when she told me that she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia among other things when she was younger, had actually spent I think it was six months in our state's hospital which is notorious for being a not so nice place and hadn't been on meds since before we met. She is 27 and I met her right before she turned 24. 

She had never told me any of this before. I was flabbergasted and didn't know how to respond at all. She dropped a bombshell on me that I needed time to process.

The issue was that the weeks were really hard for me. It felt like I was co parenting with his parents and that’s not what I signed up for. I barely felt married with our initial arrangement. It was just way too much for me and I asked him to come home Wednesday or Thursday nights and make the commute 1-2 times per week instead of just coming home on the weekends. He agreed to this and this has been our set up for a few weeks, with his parents still helping me out for the first half of the week.

His parents are really upset with me for asking him to make this change. They have been very vocal about the fact that they think I’m being selfish by asking him to take this commute and that I should’ve been fine with just their help and I should’ve been grateful for the situation we had going before. My husband tells me they’re wrong, but he’s a very selfless person and I’m stressed that I’m bulldozing him into something he doesn’t really want to do for my own benefit, and it’s making me feel really guilty. Am I an asshole for asking my husband to make the change and commute more for my own benefit?

So when I spotted her reading fifty shades of grey of all the novels we have, I told her that she could read some other book and read fifty shades of grey when she came of age because it's an adult book.

300,No A-holes here,"I live in an apartment and one of the walls in my bedroom is shared with my neighbor’s bedroom. I haven't had much interaction with my neighbors, but a young couple lives there and they had a baby about 9 months ago. For the first few months, the baby would cry in the middle of the night, but I would hear one of the parents get up to soothe it after a few minutes. I was annoyed because I was getting woke up, but I never considered complaining during this time. After 3 or 4 months, the crying got better and it would rarely week me up.

About a week ago, the crying started back up and it was worse than ever. The first night, the baby started crying a bit after 11. After a while, the crying sounded worse (the cries were high-pitched and the baby sounded like it was out of breath between sobs). I waited for over half an hour thinking the crying would end soon, but I eventually went to the living room to watch TV. When I went back to bed it was quiet, but later that night, the crying started again, so I ended up sleeping on the couch. When the baby was crying, I didn't hear the parents trying to comfort it. It's possible they did, but in the past, I could hear them getting out of bed or talking through the wall after the baby had cried for a while.

There have been similar long crying episodes most nights since then. Most of those nights, the baby would start crying around 11. There would also usually be another crying episode later in the night. After the crying would go on for a few minutes, I would check the time then either try to sleep or play on my phone. If the crying went on for over half an hour, I went to the living room to watch TV or sleep on the couch for a while. 4 of the last 6 nights, the baby has cried for over half an hour.

Two days ago, I saw the baby's mom in the hallway. I haven't really talked to her besides saying hi, but I told her I've heard a lot of crying the past few nights and asked if everything was okay. I doubt she would have told me if anything was wrong, but I thought I'd be polite. She told me everything was fine, the baby has just been fussy. Then I asked her if she'd mind moving the baby to another room if it cried for a long time because it was loud in my bedroom and she told me yes and sorry.

The night I talked to the mom, there was another long crying episode and I didn't hear the parents getting up or talking. The same thing happened the next night (last night), so after half an hour, I got up and banged on the wall for about 10 seconds. I heard one of the parents get up and the crying stopped soon after, so they must have soothed it or moved it to another room.

When I told a coworker I banged on my neighbor's wall to get them to quiet their crying baby, she said I was an asshole because they can't control their baby's crying and they’re new parents. I think it was justified. AITA?",581,1184,0.95
301,Not the A-hole,"Pretty simple scenario.  My plane had just landed.  I was in an aisle seat maybe 12 rows back and only had a really small backpack.  The people up ahead were moving, giving maybe like 6-7 rows of free space in front of me, but the 2 rows in front of me had not really started getting up.  Nevertheless, since I was traveling light and ready to go, I started making my way towards the front.

&#x200B;

An older gentleman two rows in front of me who had not yet gotten up cut me off as I started making my way up.  Giving me crap about how I should wait my turn to get off just like everyone else and start leaving after the aisle in front of me leaves.

&#x200B;

However, since my things were all together and I was ready to go, I thought it would make more sense for me to move up and give people more room to get to their overhead luggage, rather than stand around just waiting for the people in front of me to get up.  I said something to this effect, like ""I've got my things and am just trying to get out of the way,"" but he was basically like, no you have to wait your turn like everybody else.

&#x200B;

I didn't want to start a conflict with this older guy on a quiet plane, so gave in and waited for his aisle to get up.  It's not like I was in a rush or had a connecting flight, so didn't think it was worth fighting over getting off an extra two minutes early.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless the whole situation bugged me because this guy basically made me out to feel like an asshole.  Maybe I was a bit self-centered wanting to get off sooner, but I didn't think I was doing anything wrong when I wasn't really cutting anyone off or holding anyone up, just walking ahead while other people were still collecting themselves and getting up.

302,No A-holes here,"So, 2 weeks ago there was a party at a local hang out. Maybe 150-200 people attending. In the later hours of the evening, I put 50€ on the bar counter and tell the barkeeper to open up 25 beer and let people around it. i did this because i was drunk and happy because i got the news that i will be an uncle soon. Clara was also among the people that happened to be at the kitchen, when i did this. Later the same night Clara comes to talk to me. Using the my bar stunt as an in to a conversation and asks about my job and income, but quickly comes to the point. She wants to burrow money from me. 200€. I tell her that i dont do that, because we basicly dont know each other. She says thats fine and drops the topic completly.

The next day i got a text from her. she got my number from someone at the party. she said she is sorry that she was so blunt about asking me for money, but she thought that i wouldnt miss 200€ when i lended it to someone. i told her that i wouldnt miss it, but that i dont know if she would ever pay it back. clara than asked if there was something i need. i tell her no, not really. i ask why she dosent ask her family and friends. she says she allready did. and that she is alleady in debt with half of them. like i mentioned earlier she didnt tell what she needed the money for. asked once, she refused to answer. fine. i ask how much she needs in total. clara: still above 700€ after hitting up everyone she knows and taking a small loan from a quick cash bank thingy (i dont know how these work, or why she couldnt get the rest she needed from those as well). the next day i got a text from her. she says she noticed how i had looked at her in the past. that might actually be true since she is atractive. but i would have never made a move since she isnt in my league. then she sends me a nude picture of herself. and tells me that i could buy more if i wanted to. i tell that i dont pay for pictures. she asks what i would pay for. i send: sex. clara asks how much. i send:50€. she sends she would sleep with me 10 times for the 700€. i tell her 3 times for 250€. she agrees. during the next week we have met 3 times at her place. each time we spend some time hanging around in her kitchen talking for a bit than head to her bedroom. every time i give her roughly a third of the 250€. i havent slept with a prostitute before and dont consider her one. i wouldnt say money well spent, but i dont consider it a mistake either. i have been single for a while now, so it was nice to sleep with someone again. one of my flatmates talked to me earlier this day and said i am an asshole for making her whore and taking advantage of someone in need. apperently he knows it from a friend who knows claras best friend or something like that. and now alot of people are mad at me, he told me. since the weekend is comming i will go to the same local hangout, like every weekend. or should i avoid that place for now because i am an asshole?",380,421,0.88
303,No A-holes here,"I'm trying to figure out how best to proceed, so judgement is welcome as is advice.  


My brother has a young kid. I've never been a kid person, and this hasn't changed since having a nephew. But I don't really feel anything for the little guy. He feels like an acquaintance. Somebody I don't look forward to seeing, but don't dread either. I'm just completely neutral towards him.  


But in the same way that I don't really want to hang out with random acquaintances, I also don't really want to hang out with him. I played with him once, and ever since then he started liking me, asking when he will see me, or asking to come to my house. I can't (or I should say am not willing) to make this a regular thing (I see it as much in the same way many people wouldn't be willing to go to church every Sunday just to please their spouse). A rare occurrence I'm okay with, but I also don't want to lead the kid on and have him grow more attached to me, because then it will just snowball to where he wants to play more and more.  


WIBTA for trying to explain this to my brother? Should I just not directly bring it up and just reject the opportunities as they come? I feel like the most assholeish thing I can do is lead the kid on when I know for a fact I can't deal with hanging out with him a lot, it'll just end in disappointment. Better to be somewhat disappointed early than super disappointed later on.  


I'm also thinking the gifts that I buy him for his birthday and other occasions will instead just come from my brother. Ie I will buy them, but my brother can give the gift to him and say it's from him.

304,No A-holes here,"To give you a preface here:

I am a 33 YO F dating a 31 YO F who has a daughter who is 10. My GF is Afro-Latina born and partially raised in Puerto Rico, with Spanish being her first language and English her second. 

Her daughter is 1/2 Puerto Rican and 1/2 Black, with her dad being an Afro-American guy from the East Coast.  I am AA with  a dad from Egypt and mom AA being from San Diego. We are all fairly darker skinned with her daughter having the richest color.

My lady and I have been having a couple of instances where ethnicity has come up and she has made of comments that have rubbed me the wrong way. One night, we were in Downtown San Diego with her daughter trying to grab some dinner. While trying to snag a parking spot, a car behind us got  impatient and pulled up to us trying to cause an argument (white woman). I was not going to argue with her so I started rolling up the window and she threatened to call the cops on us (lol), and yelled ""NIGGER"" out the window before driving off. Now I am never shocked, surprised, and honestly even pressed about that because I am a realist and know that the chance of someone being racist is high, and I am not going to spend my lifetime being angry about other peoples ignorance. However, my girl made a comment along the lines of ""WOW, She doesn't even know that I am not Black"". I was like....whaaa? Now, I am not taking ownership of the word, but I thought it to be weird for her to make that comment, and right in front of her daughter. 

&#x200B;

Another time, we were talking about our backgrounds, and my girl says ""Well \*her daughters name\* has a Black dad"", and then her daughter says ""Wait, I'm Black? I don't want to be Black."". I saw this as a VERY important learning opportunity, and my girl says nothing. nada. zilch. Eventually she just says ""well, you are!"", and I just had to jump in and say there is absolutely nothing wrong with having African lineage and to be proud of who you are no matter what.

305,Not the A-hole,"Am I the asshole? So I've been wondering about this since yesterday. So I went grocery shopping at a main retailer yesterday and had $150 worth of stuff. I went to check out and there was about 2-3 people in each line except the 15 items or less line, which had 0. I pass that line up because who would go into the 15 items or less line with 60+ items? Anyway I stand in line for maybe a minute when the 15 items or less girl calls me over saying she can check me out. There's still 2 people ahead of me so I head over to the next aisle and start loading everything up on the conveyor belt and she starts checking me out. Another lady walks up and starts bagging my things. She seems upset but I'm just checking out so I don't pay any attention. She asks the checker something while kind of side eying me but neither the checker or me hear her. The checker asks for her to say it again and she looks straight at me and says ""did you tell him it's 15 items or less?"" With a sort of grimace on her face. I immediately felt my face get hot with embarrassment/anger and I looked behind me and there were still no customers. I said "" she's the one who called me over to this lane I was over there but thanks..."" I'm sure I sounded upset. I said ""that is so rude... I saw the sign and purposely didn't come here""  she definitely was embarrassed but she started saying how she wasn't being rude she was just making sure the new girl was doing things right. I made the point that you ask those questions after the customer leaves and it seemed to me that she was just trying to passive aggressively say it in front of me to make me feel like I did something wrong. She just said you are right I'm sorry I have to check on my other customers and stopped bagging my groceries and walked away, though she looked like she was almost in tears.

307,Asshole,"My girlfriend (26f) and I (27f) have been dating for a year and a half. We eat the same things, we use the same shampoos, we go to the same places, we watch the same things. We've been inseparable since we met.

I've been doing this remote work web development job for about 6 months now and it allows us to travel around and find work in her field. We finally settled in a location for a bit, but now she works long hours and I just mostly sit around at home or run my own errands. At the start of each week, she cooks us lunches and breakfasts for the whole week, and makes dinner when she comes home. This was fun and good while we were broke and stretched every dollar we could, but now I'm making 1000% more every week than I ever did - and I like to eat.

I'm super active and I just require more calories. On any given day I probably ingest about 5-8 thousand calories. Sometimes her prepped meals aren't enough, and often times I'll pass up her food and just order something huge early to my house, scarf it down and destroy the evidence. That way I eat less times per day and have zero prep.

Anyways, we recently started dieting because all my eating paired with the stay at home job just don't counteract my activity. I shared that I was feeling less than confident. She said the same, and now she's got me on strict caloric intake and a very prescribed diet. As much as I love her, I just don't want to sacrifice delicious and plentiful meals. Where she makes cuts to eating, i want to just increase my activiry. So now I've taken to just throwing away her food and ordering in, and lying about it. 

I feel like I should just tell her I will never diet and give it up. AITA for cheating on the diet or should she just be more aware that we're very different eaters?

Edit: forgot my age, I'm 27. 

UPDATE: Its pretty clear I'm an asshole on the basis of lying. The rest is all sort of negligible and petty (wasting food, etc). But what I'm getting out of this is that I probably have an addiction to food. Having money has only exacerbated that fact. I have no clue where I would start to confront that fact about myself. I am absolutely going to share what I said here and the wisdom I've gained with my girlfriend - there is a lot to unpack but mostly just my own weird habits.

Another Update: you guys are genuinely attacking me for my weight. Numbers can't show you my body type but I am not this obese behemoth you speak of and I think in turn it makes you guys the asshole more so than myself for attacking me for it. 5-8k calories could be an exaggeration, obviously I do not calorie count. It seems like this has run it's course as I have shown this to my girlfriend who just now feels bad for me because I'm getting beaten down for arbitrary facts with no contextual basis.

Another update: I don't know why people assume I am a man. Anyways, since this has turned into being shamed and accused of being a fat person- here is a picture of me minus my face April 24th. [Removed]",116,134,0.79
308,No A-holes here,"About a year ago, I left my wife and needed to move out. We married young and I work retail, so my price range was limited.  


Thankfully, two of my acquaintances, one leaving the military and the other dropping out of college were also looking for a new place to live, so we decided to be room mates. We weren't the best of friends, but we had been involved in the same circle of friends for a long time, so we're not strangers either.  


We both decided on a set budget of 500 a month from each of us, so we figured we could afford something around 1500 a month.  


In our area, that was a pretty hard to find option, especially for something with 3 bedrooms.  


Luckily, my grandpa retired and decided to move to Florida and said I could straight up have his house. The only thing I would need to pay was the tax on it and utilities. All in all, it only costs about 480 a month. I told my friends I had found us a place, and the rent would be 500 a month, I figured the extra 20 to adjust for electric or water being maybe used more.  


So, the first of the month rolls around, we move in, and they hand me 500 dollars *each.*  


So for the last year or so I've just been acting as a landlord in addition to working my normal job. The extra 500 dollars I'm getting a month has changed my life, honestly. I've gotten a new computer, work done on my car that was sorely needed, and have been able to just do things that I haven't ever been able to afford.  


I was out with another friend last night, and she asked if I had been promoted or something at work since my lifestyle had changed so much recently. So, I tell her, and she got super mad and said what I was doing was ""reprehensible"". I told her I was just acting like a land lord, collecting rent. She got so mad she actually left our dinner mid meal.  


I don't see what I'm doing wrong though? Like, its my grandpas house. He bought it, and gave it to me. Charging rent isn't ""reprehensible"" in my eyes.

309,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been having this thought and I really would like to have a closure with myself on this matter. 

My fiancee is an amazing human being. He came from a small, humble family, and everyone in his family always greets me with a warm welcome whenever I visit. He also has a very close and adorable relationship with his mom. 

Over the past two years, I'd notice occasional calls from his mom asking for money to pay some things at home (we live abroad for work). The purpose of asking money ranges from things that are pretty necessary (such as to help with his mom's small business) to things that are not urgent at all (to buy new bags, vacations, etc). This kept happening for months until it culminated six months ago when his mom asked him to invite the family over to our place halfway across the globe. It didn't take long for fiancee to immediately book multiple return tickets (southeast Asia-Europe) and hotels for his family (mom+dad+brother) to stay. This decision pretty drained his savings to a significant extent, so I jumped in to financially support his family's daily expenses during their three-week visit. 

I need to say that our financial situation was quite okay at that time, I just started a stable job here while he's working part-time, and we both tried to save our money (separate accounts) in the best way possible for our future. We were nowhere near the capacity of fully financing an impromptu three-week family trip. A little background info: I make more money than he does, I fully pay for rent and utilities, and during our early discussions, we agreed that once he landed a better job we'd separate the bills equally.

This trip happened six months ago, and despite the financial issue it caused, I understand the sentimental reasons as to why he was willing to spend so much for the family. Yet, earlier today I learned that his savings are apparently more drained than I thought, as there were more occassions during which he had to send some money home, and these numbers are getting bigger and bigger. I plan to sit and talk with him about this, but on the other hand, I feel terrible for being in the way for fiancee to provide for his not-so-well-off family. Furthermore, it's his own money, and it doesn't feel right for me to tell him what he can or can't do with it. So, WIBTA if I ask him not to be too generous to his family?

310,Not the A-hole,"Her daughter is 16, we’re both in our 40s. Her daughter Ashley is from a previous relationship; my wife and I have been married 7 years and together for 10.

To put it bluntly, Ashley’s a huge brat. She always has this horrible attitude, never does the minimal chores we assign her (make sure her room/bathroom is cleaned and wash the dishes; that’s it), she’s always partying coming home drunk at 4 in the morning, and always bringing home different dudes to spend the night.

I don’t really have any parental authority over Ashley at the request of my wife because her father’s still in the picture, but I’m just sick of the way she treats and raises her child. She just brushes off her delinquency with “she’s just a kid.” I’m not against kids having fun, but come on; why is there a stranger at MY house at 2 in the morning?

She thinks because she’s “almost an adult”, that gives her a free ride to do whatever she wants, never mind the fact that she’s just finished her sophomore year in high school. Her mother thinks as long as she’s safe and responsible, we should just let her “find herself”, while I think she’s needs to step up and be a PARENT; enforce rules, give punishments, and actually RAISE her child besides letting her act like a fucking delinquent. We’ve had multiple talks about it, and it always ends with “you don’t get to tell me how to raise my child.” And while that’s true, I want kids and we (were) actively trying for a baby. But my thought process is: if this is the way you’re going to raise *your* child, what’s stopping you to raise our future children like this?

I decided I didn’t want this for myself and I didn’t have the right to parent her child, but I didn’t want my child to be raised like this. So I talked to a divorce attorney and am probably going to proceed in a divorce. 

The reason why I feel like I might be TA she has no house and will probably have to move back with her parents (across the country). I got a prenup because there’s quite an income disparity between us (she works part-time at minimum wage while I work at a fortune 500). Her kid would have to uproot her life and everything she’s known. And I don’t hate the kid; I just think her parent is failing her right now.

315,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I are getting married this July. We've been together for more than 2 years and it is what my parents and hers have always encouraged us being the oldest kids, to do. So, we are getting everything ready and our families have met to talk about the wedding. Our parents have decided to set the day of the wedding on July 19th since it is a long weekend (July 18th is a national holiday in my country) and we want to make sure our family members who live overseas can attend the wedding as well. Besides, my father works for the government abroad and he barely has time to come home except for long holiday like Christmas.

My girlfriend came from a very traditional and superstitious family. And without talking to us first, her parents went to see a shaman and were told that July 19th is not a good day for a wedding. So they told my girlfriend about this and persuaded her to talk me into changing the date. I was confused, dumbfounded, and a little upset when she told me about it. I know we have neither sent out the invitations nor booked the hotel where we want the wedding to be held at, but I found it a little upsetting that her parents would rather listen to a stranger than consider what’s best for everyone. Even her other family members that we have talked to about it feel that it is rather silly to believe in such things.

Because I did not want to offend or hurt my girlfriend’s feelings, I tried my best to be sensitive and told her as gentle as possible to talk to her parents again about it but she said she had and they would not change their mind. I told her about my dad’s job situation and how I used to feel miserable growing up for all the birthdays and happy occasions I had and he was not there. I really don’t want the wedding to be just another occasion that he will have to miss. It’s his job I understand and I respect him for doing it very well. My girlfriend told me that she also understands it is silly to believe in such things her parents believe in, but it’s just how they were raised coming from a small village.

After a long conversation that slowly became heated, I said ‘Fine. But don’t be surprised if my father does not show up at the wedding.’ which may or may not be the truth since he will be away in Australia the whole month. She started yelling at me and telling me ‘My parents may be dumb for believing in those craps. But they’re my parents. I love them and respect them.’

316,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the clickbait title, it's hard to capture this post's content in just a few words.

&#x200B;

I have a daughter who is 16, and she has two friends (let's say Hailey and Brandon) who are also 16. I've met the two of them individually and they are great kids, I would trust them being in my house with my daughter without my wife or I there. My daughter came to me about two months ago telling me that Hailey and Brandon are dating. In addition, she confided in me that Hailey's parents are a little racist, and have explicitly told Hailey that while she's allowed to date, she's not allowed to date ""xyz"" type of people (imagine they said she wasn't allowed to date black people). You've probably guessed by now, but Brandon is of type ""xyz,"" so it is clear that Hailey's parents do not know she is dating Brandon.

&#x200B;

I personally don't agree with the views of Hailey's parents; I think it's immoral to put restrictions on who your child can date with respect to race, gender, etc. Regardless of my political views, it didn't really matter in this situation. Until about a month ago, when my daughter asked me if Hailey and Brandon could stay at our house for a few hours after school, to watch movies or do homework together. It was made very explicit to me that Hailey's parents were not going to know that Brandon was over, and that they would think it was Hailey and my daughter hanging out alone. I was young once, and I know how ridiculous it was to have to keep relationships from my parents, so I obliged. So, for the past month, the three of them have been spending time in my home after school.

&#x200B;

I usually don't get home from work until after they're gone, but my wife picks the three of them up from school every day and then comes home to do housework. She's told me that there's nothing fishy going on - the three of them sit on the sofa and watch TV, or work on homework, or talk about high school gossip. My wife has also told me the most physical intimacy she's seen is Brandon putting his arm on Hailey's shoulder or holding hands with her. There is no sexual intimacy going on in my house between them, and I intend to keep it that way. The problem I see is that the school year is ending at the end of June, and presumably the three of them will want to still hang out at my house. This also means they'd be hanging out without my wife being at home, since she is planning on increasing her work hours during the summer.

&#x200B;

I've been wondering if I've ethically failed in allowing a teenage couple to hang out at my house because Hailey is afraid of retaliation from her parents for dating a specific race. AITA in this situation, and if I am, will I still be the AH if I tell Hailey and Brandon they cannot hang out at my house any longer, but do not disclose their relationship to Hailey's parents?",79,211,0.94

318,Asshole," I am fairly new to Reddit, so sorry in advance if this doesnt fit the theme. 

I just had a big argument with my bf and really can't see if I'm over-reacting or I am in the right. My bf and I have been together for about a year. We're both students, and both live at our parents. My family is very well-off, and I receive a monthly allowance that I use to pay my uni fees, transport, food when I don't eat at home, taxes, etc. I used to do a little bit of shopping / save up for vacations with what was left of it. He, on the other hand, is not as wealthy. His mom pays for his school, has no money from the dad, and also has siblings. They aren't poor, but aren't rich either. 

Since we got together, we made a habit of eating out together a few times a month (nothing crazy expensive). I've been paying almost everytime, because of his situation, and because or that stopped shopping or treating myself with my leftover allowance. Since has been looking for a job for ages, I asked my dad to give him a hand, and he got employed at one of my dad's friends businesses. The other day, he showed me, all proud, the beginning of his Marvel DVD collection (about 80 bucks worth), and I got very angry. The last months, he discovered Magic The Gathering and spent about 200 bucks on packs, and the DVDs really were the last straw for me. 

I told him he wasnt respectful of me for spending so recklessly the money I made it possible for him to earn in the first place, that he should be saving that up. That I was pissed he didnt say anything treating me for dinner for once, instead of buying all this crap. He got mad and said he never said anything about me going shopping, or my huge manga collection, and that the money wan't mine to begin with, and also told me that me buying him dinner wasn't an obligation of mine. I told him he was delusionnal about his finances: I could afford that, he couldn't. 

I do understand that those things are important to him, but I think he really needs ro rethink his priorities about the way he spents his money, especially with his school fees.... Am I the asshole here?",61,36,0.86

For as long as I've had the account (over 12 years at this point), I get emails as a result of other people listing ""CarolineH at gmail dot com"" as their email address - Caroline Harrison's veterinary appointment reminders, Caroline Harper's receipts for buying tickets to see Infinity War, even a thread of messages for some other Caroline H about a personal family matter.

In the beginning, I tried to be nice - if the email wasn't automated, I'd reply to the person saying I wasn't the person it was supposed to be sent to, or I'd just unsubscribe to whatever mailing list I had been put on.  

Eventually I created a new primary account (not just because of this, but it was a part of my reasoning).  I still check CarolineH, but only every 4-5 days.

Last night I checked it and saw an email receipt for a DoorDash delivery for ""Caroline Hutton"".  I logged into the account, hit the ""forgot my password"" button, clicked on the link emailed to me, and changed her password.  (She'd had a credit card saved in the account and everything.  I didn't look to see if I could've nefariously used it to order stuff for myself, or if they would've required the card's security code to complete an order.)

After I did it, I felt a little bit guilty - if I hadn't happened to check CarolineH that day, the notifications would've probably scrolled to the next page of emails and I wouldn't have noticed.  Also, does it *really* make a difference, in the grand scheme of things, if she used that address?  What if she really needs to use it again, and I've locked her out because of my pettiness?

We have experience in blockchain and cryptography but don't  work on one thing for more than a few months at the longest.

We  were contracted in January for a year to work with a Chinese company on  cryptocurrency based gambling apps. This is fine, this is where we're  strongest I think, but our latest project is basically a rip off of ""hot  or not"" type apps and websites but still with a gambling component.

Basically  what we're working on now is gambling on random photos of women in  various states of undress with an audience gauging their ""hotness"". It's  hard to explain because it's so surreal and skeevy.

I  basically have to look at softcore pornography all day and write  gambling focused code and documentation around it. I \_have\_ to, because  this is what I've been told to do. I've expressed to my manager I'm  uncomfortable with it and she basically told me tough shit, get used to  it. I even told my wife this and her sentiments weren't too dissimilar.  I'm a guy so I should be in heaven, I should be happy I get to look at  half naked women all day, etc.

Disclaimer: Psych meds are great!  I'm on them, and they've changed my life for the better.

&#x200B;

My wife (31/f) and I (33/m) have been together for 7 years.  We have a wonderful 1 year old son.

&#x200B;

My wife has a sister who is 32/f.  Growing up, wife was always the pretty one, and sister was the smart one.  I still find my wife gorgeous, as do many other people.  However, through a combination of pregnancy/smoking cessation/anti depressants my wife has gained weight.  She's at the higher end of overweight at the BMI scale and she doesn't look bad, just a little chubby/curvy.  She was always the skinny and hot girl growing up and through college, so i know it bothers her. Our son had serious recurrent ear infections (he's healthy now) so fitness has not been a priority for either one of us the last year, although we plan to get in shape later.

&#x200B;

Sister works a high paying job, and is single/no kids so has time and money to spend getting facials, her hair done, etc.  She's not a bikini model, but she is slim because she has time, money, and energy to go to the gym, yoga, etc. We aren't especially close with sister, but we do see her from time to time, and we are all friends on instagram and facebook etc.

&#x200B;

My wife is obsessed with the idea that Sister should be on anti depressants.  Like...obsessed.  My wife asks me constantly if I think Sister should go on psych drugs. My answer is that i think a lot of people could benefit from them; but I'm not a doctor and so I don't know if Sister has allergies, intolerances, interactions with other meds etc. (my mom is a pharmacist so I am familiar with some of the dangers of medication).  Additionally, we don't live with Sister...it's possible that she's on them and hasn't told us.  My wife won't let it go.  She has enlisted both her parents, and her brother to campaign Sister to go on anti depressants.   Every time sister comes to visit, it's all my wife talks about.  On a recent visit, Wife was telling Sister to go on meds, and asked me to back her up.  I side stepped the question and excused myself from the conversation.  Wife got extremely mad at me for not backing her up and we had a huge fight.  She started to cry and said the meds made her fat and ugly and it's not fair that Sister isn't on them.  I tried to comfort her, but she said I don't understand what it's like to be so competitive with a sibling.

&#x200B;

It crushed me to see my wife so unhappy.  AITA for not siding with my wife?

&#x200B;

EDIT 1:  Some people have asked why Wife thinks SIL needs meds.  SIL is a pretty anxious person, and is a self admitted worry wart.  Wife thinks this is evidence of anxiety disorder and has said it's irresponsible not to treat it.  Also I've seen Sister act somewhat sad/gloomy.  The family history is positive for both anxiety and depression, if that counts.",55,47,0.87
324,Not the A-hole,"First, I ask that you take this situation alone into consideration. I have posted about my boyfriend before and I want to keep this 100% separate so I’m sure if I’m an asshole here specifically. Thank you. 

About 6 months ago, my boyfriend and I planned a 4-day vacation. We’re going to be driving out of state, so I let him know I’d pay for our hotels and tickets for attractions if he paid for gas and food. In total, I’ve spent about $400. He said he would budget for his half and we didn’t talk about it again. Yesterday over the phone, he told me he has saved $160 to pay for “his half of food and gas.” Gas alone will be $150. 

Before I let myself become upset, I asked him to clarify, and he said per our agreement he was going to be paying for his food and gas. At this point I was sad, confused, and angry. I told him that was not what we agreed on and I do have proof of that conversation where I was very clear. I let him know I find it completely unacceptable that we make the same money and have the same bills and somehow he cannot manage his finances because I do find it very easy myself with a budget. Adolescence was not financially kind to me, so I learned quick how to save and when to spend. He also had a “poor” upbringing, so I don’t understand why he would get into the same pattern as our parents. 

Finances have already been an issue. We’ve been together almost a year now, and he has asked me to budget for him, and I have. He never follows the budget he asks me to spend time on. We’ve talked about finding an apartment together, but at this point I would not live with him because I’m afraid of being the only one who can pay my half of the bills, so it’s like we’re back to dating casually. 

I tried talking to him about all this, and he wrote me a long message about how bad his day was yesterday because of work and me making him feel “like a retard.” At the very end he said, “This is my apology and I’m not going to dwell on this situation.” Boy was I mad. And I still kind of am. I let him know that I was extremely upset by this and he told me we need to stop reacting emotionally to each other. Deep breaths...

My solution to this is to tell him he is no longer going on vacation with me, and to invite one of my close friends. Since I’ve already paid for everything and will be taking my car, all I intend on asking is that they cover gas and THEIR OWN food. I do have to act quickly because the vacation is in 3 days, and he just dropped this on me yesterday. 

TLDR: My boyfriend did not budget for his part of our vacation. I want to instead take a friend who can pay their part. WIBTA?",60,89,0.93

328,Asshole,"A week ago my friend called me, she told me she is going on a vacation and she wants me to have her car for the weekend she's away. I said sure, I live far from my family because of college and with her car I'll be able to go back home. All I had to do was drop her off at the airport and pick her up on Sunday. Anyway I drove home on Friday had fun with the family and Saturday morning I was back on the road driving to my apartment. About five minutes in an animal jumped to the road and I swerved to my left to avoid killing it and crushed into a parking car taking off both mirrors I left a note with my phone number and drove straight to an auto repair shop to fix my friend's car it cost me 500 bucks which is a lot but manageable and I thought fixing the other car would cost the same. I didn't tell my friend about the accident because 1. I didn't want her to feel responsible to help me pay 2. I didn't want to disappoint her.
So Sunday comes I pick her up everything goes according to plan but than the other car's owner calls he tells me he got a price offer of 3,000 dollars which I have no way of paying he says (and show me pictures) I hit more than just the mirror. He knows it's a lot so he'll give me a few days to come up with a better offer but he can't wait too long because his mirror is basically shattered.
I felt like my life have been ruined I have no way off paying that amount of money I'll have to drop out of college and I'll probably be homles so as a last resort I call my friend and tell her everything. I say the amount is beyond anything I can do and I practically beg her to activate her insurance telling her I'll obviously pay the damage and the extra the insurance is going to cost her now. She took a few days until answering that she is very sorry but she can't help me because of some impact it might have on her in the future. I was pissed. she would not help me because it might affect her even though I bailed her more than once. Eventually a different friend called me yesterday he said he heard what happened and he can get me a much better offer (almost quarter of the original price) and it all turned out fine. So AITAH for holding a grudge against her?


Edit: thank you all for answering! I couldn't see straight because I had a hell of a week thinking my life is basically over but I can see I'm in the wrong here. I'll apologize to my friend and hopefully this won't wrack our friendship. Again thank you!",61,112,0.92

330,No A-holes here,"I’m writing this from my friend’s basement since I was kicked out of my house for this one a few days ago. My wife and I are in our mid-40’s and no kids and solid jobs in finance here in the US. My wife is from a foreign country, we met and got married in our mid-20’s. However, most of her family is from her home country in Asia including her parents who she flies out to USA once or twice a year and stays for an extended period of time before they go back home. Her parents are in their 80’s.

6 months ago my wife’s mother was diagnosed with a type of colon cancer and in her country there is not the advanced type of care required for this. My wife wanted her parents to come live with us permanently and seek treatment in the US and I agreed because it’s obviously the right thing to do for her family. Her mother’s prognosis was fairly grim and it was found that the disease was spreading; and we were given the options of either aggressive chemotherapy or the latter which is to make her as comfortable as she can in her final months. My wife and family opted for the chemo which I was onboard with even though they have no insurance and each treatment was a huge hit to our savings. After 4-5 months of treatment and piling medical bills in excess of $400,000, the treatments are still ongoing. I plan on calling the hospital and try to negotiate that down to maybe half the amount since I read on reddit on another thread that this might be possible, but as it stands currently if I paid all of this it would wipe out all of our savings, plus about half of my 401k after withdrawal penalties are calculated. 

I’ve been supportive and willing to take on the financial burden although I’ve thought to myself that it is time to give up. I’ve never said this to my wife or her family and have been outwardly supportive, but inside I’ve been struggling and worried about the future.

A few days ago I was at a bar with my friend and discussing my true feelings about the entire situation. The bar was a little loud so I did have to speak up a little bit in order to hold the conversation. I told my friend that I’ve been feeling inundated with these bills ever since the the midpoint of the treatments, and again, although I have put on a smile and want the best for my Wife’s family, internally I wanted the financial bleeding to stop and just wanted my mother in law to die comfortably in hospice care. Unfortunately, my wife’s best friend was sitting behind us at the bar unbeknownst to me and heard all of this. She called my wife right away.

My wife and I had a huge argument when I got home and I guess my argument the entire time was that my actions of supporting the medical treatments should have been enough and, quoting a show I recently watched, that “thoughts are not treason”. None of this went over well and hence why I’m out of the house.

So I have this couple that I've known many years, and I've always been better friends with the husband than the wife. It wasn't until recently though that interactions with his wife have become...very unpleasant and awkward. 

My wife and I bought a house down the street from them, thinking it would be fun to have friends who shared the same interests so close by. At first it was - we went to several events there and they came over to visit us regularly. 

The more time we spent with the two of them, though, the weirder the interactions got. He and his wife have a...combative relationship. Constantly fighting, putting each other down, having oddly heated exchanges about seemingly innocuous things.

We all like to drink, and the more lubricated they get the more handsy and forward his wife is with everyone - sometimes to inappropriate levels.  

Not to mention - whenever we're together as couples she seems to be forever trying to ""out-do"" my wife. No story is left un-topped. She always has a better anecdote. Her family is always crazier. She just bought a better kitchen appliance. It's really making us uncomfortable. 

I still really enjoy spending time with my friend - just not when his wife is around. I feel bad because he's talked about us not hanging out as much any more and I can't bring myself to tell him it's because of his wife. We've just kind of drifted further and further despite being literally five doors down from each other.

332,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20s and have been together for about 2 1/2 years now. I was raised around firearms and hunting which my girlfriend has come to realize is a large part of my life. She does not disapprove of me hunting or owning any rifles but she has formed a vendetta around handguns. My girlfriend also struggles with anxiety which brings us to the other day. We were in a movie theater watching the trailers before our movie started when gunshots from the next theater started going off. Not to worry it was sound effects from the movie but this almost propelled her into a full blown panic attack and to be honest with you for the first couple seconds I too thought that they were real. I managed to calm her down and told her I had seen the sign for the movie playing and everything added up. On the way home I told her, “You know if I had my pistol on me maybe you would’ve felt a lot safer.” This launched us into an argument for the whole ride home. Since the whole point of carrying a handgun is to do it discretely WIBTA for carrying it without her knowledge? We don’t live with each other due to the fact we just moved home from college so I don’t see how an issue would arise until we eventually do move in together.

Edit: Would like to state that we’ve talked to her family about this and they all have responded with, 
“If you should feel safe around someone with a gun it’s (OP).” 
And when I have tried to have discussions with her on the subject she immediately shuts down any idea of a conversation. I’m kinda at a stalemate here and sorry for not adding this in originally.

Edit 2.0: I see a lot of comments tying my girlfriend’s anxiety directly to guns. The gunshot sound effects from the next theater almost gave her a panic attack because she thought there was an active shooter. I have taken my girlfriend to the range with me and we have shot rifles. As I stated in the post she has a vendetta towards handguns she does not have any anxiety stemming from guns or gun related trauma in her past.",436,508,0.86

334,Not the A-hole,"I am from a not very well known part of Asia, and I have narcissistic parents and a brother who is diagnosed with autism

I grew up in this house and (to this day) am not allowed outside save for school (which isn't any better)

I won't go into detail as it would be a pain to read

I never had a good family life, my parents would fight often and me and my brother would be caught in the crossfire

The fights were always for disgusting reasons

dad hated everyone on my mom's side of the family and insulted them, mom would hate that dad was a hoarder and burn his stuff, dad would hire a thugs to keep mom in line, mom would give dad's associates blowjobs to humiliate him and so on. I hate both of them

Now both my parents, being narcissists, would take their frustrations out on me and my brother. My dad exclusively did it to my brother because he couldn't defend himself verbally or physically

Mom on the other hand, took advantage of my brother's condition. instead of hitting him or yelling at him, she manipulated him with false kindness and safety from dad and even before I was born, was teaching him to be her personal servant instead of social skills

She uses him to do all kinds of things, fetch her phone when it rings, open doors for her when she's coming through, get her food and stuff from the fridge etc...

I've called her out on this plenty and tried to explain it to my brother

He doesn't understand the wrong in this, and thinks I'm ungrateful and that mom loves us. despite behind closed doors mom calls him a ""retard"" and that I'm her only ""real"" child. hearing it fills me with disgust

Now... this is why I made this post. sorry it took a while to get to this point

Ever since I can remember, whenever my dad had upset my brother some how, he'd go to mom, and wouldn't do any of the stuff she wanted him to do until he had cheered up

His most favorite and best way of being cheered up?

Having mom compare me to him and degrade me. In his face, mom treated him like a Golden child, had no wrong, false compliments which he didn't understand, berating me about how I couldn't be like him and that I was just a leech and a burden

My brother just loves hearing this stuff... he legit has the widest grin ever and even starts jumping up and down in place like a child while I get insult

This happens plenty, so naturally it doesn't bother me as much anymore

thinking over I know, I wholeheartedly HATE my parents

the question even I don't know is, do I hate my brother?

I certainly don't love him, as guilty as that can make me feel. I can't forget what he's done. nor forgive. His mind was wired to see me as an enemy before I had even been born.

 I know that he isn't who he is by choice, and would be a different person, either better or worse, had he not have his condition.

When confronted, my wife did confess and I further learned that our child is a result of said affair - hence, it's not actually mine. Cheating is an absolute no-go for me and she knows that. So after I had the confirmation, I immediately decided to divorce, for which I will be filing soon.


Now when it comes to ""my"" kid, something in me changed as well. I always wanted to have kids but to me it's important that they are biologically mine. So I decided to not only leave my wife but also her child for good. It will be up to the the court whether I will have to pay alimony and if I have to, I will. But I will cut all contact.

We've been together for about 4 years and I recently decided to propose to him. Since I never ever saw him wear rings, and he mentioned in the past that he is very claustrophobic in all sorts of ways, including wearing jewelry, I assumed he wouldn't want a ring.

We went away for the weekend, I booked an extra beautiful and secluded room in a hotel, on the top floor, with an enormous balcony and pool and an amazing view, we had a delicious candle-lit dinner, some drinks, and while we were cuddling on the couch outside, I had a whole speech about how much I love him and how happy he makes me and I asked him to marry me. He said yes, and that he loves me too and he hugged me and kissed me, and then he sort of stopped, and looked towards my hands and jacket, and said: ""No ring?""

So I had a heart attack and said that no, I didn't get a ring because I was under the impression he wouldn't want it. And he was like: ""Why would you think that???"" I explained the whole claustrophobia business and he said that just because he wouldn't wear the ring, doesn't mean he wouldn't want to have it. I asked him how I was supposed to know that, and I said that I even thought him talking about jewelry claustrophobia was a hint to me, in case I wanted to propose in the future. He got very upset and asked me if it was about the money. I said of course not, I didn't spare any expenses with our weekend getaway and the special room and everything. And then he started crying and said that that is just a two-day experience but a ring is forever, and I said it's just a material thing that he won't wear anyway and why does it matter so much. He didn't say anything, he just went into the bathroom for an hour, then straight to bed. The next day he said he wanted to go home, so we did, and we haven't spoken much since then. 

My friends all think I made a massive mistake and that I'm becoming a bigger and bigger asshole by day, every day I don't get him a ring. I don't know what to think. He won't wear the ring.

340,Asshole,"Alright, this is going to be a long one. To preface this, I moved in with my roommates last year after knowing them for 8 years on the internet. Like any new living situation it takes time to get through the growing pains of living with ""new"" people, but besides that it's been a pretty cozy living situation.

 When I first moved in I didn't have a car or a license, and when I moved in it was my roommate's intentions to help me get on my feet and become a bit more independent. They made sure I got to and from work, appointments, stores, and all the things in between for the most part if it didn't interrupt their schedule. Now roughly 11 1/2 months later I have my own car (not a license though) that I bought with my own money.

 Recently my roommates (who are also married) had their birthdays over the last week, and their plan is to go to Boston (a three hour car trip) and they told me that if I want to come they want to use my car because theirs isn't as in good of shape as mine. When I told them I wasn't sure if I was comfortable having my car make that trip they became aggravated saying, ""We've been driving you around for 10 months, and the potential of damaging your car shouldn't prevent you from being generous"". While they said they would be willing to fix any damages that *could* happen, I still don't really want to use my car to go that trip despite it being for their birthday. AITA?

Edit: It's pretty clear I was in the wrong here. I amended the situation and let my roommate know I didn't mind using my car. Having it be my first car made me a bit possessive of it since I don't want to see it get worn so quickly, but that definitely doesn't seem fair based on what my roommates have done for me so far.",35,25,0.81

342,Everyone Sucks,"I’m pretty sure it’s a strong yes, but hear me out.

So basically, my husband and I made shitty decisions when we were younger (respectively were both 25 m/f now). However, I’ve always managed the money. He claims “cash burns a hole in his pocket” and doesn’t understand the banking app or the bills.

That being said, when we got our first credit card, it was in my name. It was supposed to be for emergencies only. I’m sure this starts out this way for everyone. However, “we” (I’ll admit, I can’t ever say no to him, something I’m working on in therapy) used it so he could go buy a PS4 and video games and this and that and eventually I became bitter because we were still sleeping on a mattress on the floor so I used it on furniture. 

Well it blew up, and unknowingly I found out he had a tool account of several thousand dollars for work that was close to 10k, if I recall right. 

My parents “helped us” by co-signing a loan to consolidate it that ended up making the total payment higher. I found out later this was my dads way of “teaching me a lesson about finances.” 

Over the years I’ve gotten really sick, and it’s gotten hard to work/maintain a full time job. The company I work for now is wonderful and has a great FMLA package, so I can take off the time I need- without pay. 

I found out recently that my husband’s one- ONE- credit card is still getting used multiple times a week for fast food despite me having gotten him in the habit of taking his lunch, eating breakfast at home, etc. Its also $75 from maxed out. It’s only supposed to be when I’m to sick to cook or were short on something. I didn’t realize how bad it was, and our other credit card is maxed out on bills as couldn’t pay that popped up from medical and just, life. 

So. Since I can’t seem to get anything to work, I know with bankruptcy (from all the means test we would qualify for chapter 7), they require you to take finance classes. So WIBTA if I did this without his complete by in? I’m talking to him about it today but I’m pretty dead set on it.

344,Everyone Sucks,"So, i’m 24M. My little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. I moved an hour and a half away when I was 18 and we 
don’t see eachother often, but I make a point to call/text


It was her birthday yesterday and I thought I’d splurge since she’s been going through a rough time. She’s changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won’t talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. I’ve made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



Anyway, I got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called Copics. I’m no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who’s anybody has them and our parents don’t wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they’re about 5$ PER MARKER) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. Whenever we’ve texted recently it’s been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. She barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. I was excited to give her the gift but the second I opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying “See! Even he knows you should’ve got them for me!” Which I awkwardly brushed off. Everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like “Oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite.” “A plaid skirt. WOW. I’m blessed.” 


I was prepared for an angsty teen, but I soon reached my limit. Our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled “I told you both exactly what I wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit I don’t need! Fuck this!” she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



Our parents were a lot less well-off when I was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. Everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, I accepted them like I was the luckiest kid ever. I would’ve never swore and yelled but she’s been very spoiled.


I talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. They think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. I agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. Besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


Sister came back to get the markers, but I took them back. I said that she was ungrateful and I wouldn’t tolerate it. She started screaming at me but I just left the “party” prematurely with the gift in tow.



My whole family is blowing up my phone because I “ruined her birthday”. In my eyes, I spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. This will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. But my family doesn’t want to hear from me until I give it back. Considering I’ve got my entire family shitting on me, I have to wonder if I did make the wrong choice. So, reddit, AITA?",2863,20904,0.93
345,Not the A-hole,"So this happened to me this past weekend and I thought it was a perfect for this sub.

So basically I was at a bar with some friends and my girlfriend. The bar had a dance floor, but it was pretty dead and there was nobody really on it. Sitting near the dance floor at the bar was a small group of girls, one of whom was very clearly upset, had been crying, etc. It felt a little weird but they weren’t in the dance floor and so my friends and I decided to be idiots and start dancing. While we were dancing I still had a full drink so I put it down at bar, relatively near the girls but not in front of them. Next thing I knew the girl threw the entire drink all over my back. 

I was pretty pissed in the moment because I was so shocked, but my immediate reaction was to say “what the fuck.” As I turned around the girl who threw my drink on me was already being ushered out of the bar by a couple of friends and she was sobbing. Two other girls apologized profusely to me and told me she was going threw a divorce and had been talking all night about how guys are evil and she’s done with men. They apologized and I calmed down, but I also added that it definitely sucks she’s going through a divorce but that doesn’t really excuse her behavior. I asked them to buy me a new drink and they had some excuses but basically the answer was no. I sort of stood my ground and said that it’s the right thing to do to buy me a new drink since it was sort of an expensive drink and the girl who wasted mine had already left. The girls once again said no and one of them actually made a comment saying it was rude that I was not being understanding. 

The girls left without paying for my drink and my girlfriend was on my side (she kept calling them bitches) but a couple of my girlfriends friends were saying that I need to calm down and that I’m not being understanding. I was definitely mad, but I never raised my voice. They said I was being rude to her and her friends and that I should have a heart for not considering her feelings. 

So, AITA?

Edit: should probably clarify; when I said my girlfriend was calling them bitches I meant later on after the fact, not to their faces. She was doing it more in a supportive way like “you’re right they were such bitches”",257,426,0.89

So last night I had a date planned to a ice-skating place with this girl I have been seeing. We aren't exactly a couple, but I feel like (and hope) it could go that way. The date was on her initiative. She asked me if I wanted to go with her. From the way she asked it was just us 2 together. 

I got there a bit early ordered a drink from the bar and waited for her. When she arrived she had another guy with her. She introduced him as her close friend who wanted  to join us when she told him where she was going. I replied with saying I thought it would be just us to which she replied that it would be fun anyway. The guy then said something in the lines of ""yeah, I'm here to crash the party haha"", which got me quite annoyed. I picked up my drink and said I was leaving and that they can enjoy the fun.

When I was driving home she called me and asked me what it was about and why I put her in the spotlight like that near his friend. I just told her honestly that I wanted to spend my time just with her and had no intention to spend the night with that friend as well. She told me I overreacted and that she couldn't do anything against it because the guy apparently just decided himself that he was joining us and that she couldn't say ""no"". (I'm aware she's really bad at saying no)

Either way, I don't care. I told her she's free to hang out with anyone she wants, but I'm not gonna force myself to hang around with him while I was excited to only be with her.

 The guy was pissed because he couldn't do his box jumps and asked instead if he could use the pull-up bar on the squat rack, told him no again as I was using the area and that there were other pull up bars empty he could use.

I just finished dropping someone off and was pulling out to try and find my way back to the highway when I stopped at a red light and a woman came out of nowhere on my right by the street and started saying she was just mugged. Apparently it happened right before I got to the light?

She looked a bit disheveled like her clothes were a bit of a mess and she was clutching her bag I think I'm not too sure it was dark and happened pretty quickly.

I cracked my window to ask her what she needed and she said she was just mugged and asked if I'd let her in to chase down the vehicle. She immediately went to start to open my passenger door but it was locked. 

I told her that I don't think I could help her with that and that I was sorry and then the light turned green so I kind of just drove off. As I was in the process of declining her she said something like ""oh, please don't be like that"" which I can't stop thinking about now.

I did pull over at the next light and call 911 and told them her location and what had happened. Her description and what she said happened and what vehicle I saw just before speeding away from the road she was on. They thanked me for the info and said they'd send someone right out to check.

I feel bad that maybe her story was true and I had to reject helping her in the moment to make sure I was protected in case she was just trying to scam me. 

Was I being selfish or too distrusting? What could I have done differently? Should I have just stayed right there with her but inside my car and her outside while I called the police?

I wasn’t sure if it was my right to update this as I’m sure I made a decision most people would think me awful for. But at this point it’s more of a releasing of feelings off my chest. 

As you know my husbands ex is ill and I still feel for her greatly with much sympathy and wil pray for her and her children.

355,No A-holes here,"The title sums it up without adding any of the emotions to the story. 

My high school best friend lives in HI; I live in WA. We haven't seen each other since graduation because our lives took us out of our home state. 

1.)When I thought I was pregnant last October, she was the person I called. When I got a positive test, she was the first person to know. She seemed excited for me, but then she dropped off the face of the earth. I lost the pregnancy in December. She messaged me late January asking about it because I hadn't posted any pictures, and I told her about the miscarriage then. It was your typical ""I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm here for you if you need me"" response. It didn't feel genuine. 

2.) (This is what lead to the downward spiral) When my husband proposed, she was the first person that came to mind when i thought of who i wanted to stand beside me. She seemed excited at first, but as the deadline for submitting an RSVP grew closer, she talked with me less and less. I'd send her details about what my other bridesmaids were wearing or information about the timeline or venue, and she wouldn't open the messages for days. This is when I started feeling like there was a distance growing between us. 

In April, my husband and I decided to get legally married in WA because it saved us the hassle of figuring out how we would get the marriage certificate in TN. For the most part, everyone was super excited for us and very supportive...except for my best friend. She never acknowledged that I got married. No private messages, not a like on a photo.. three days after the second deadline for RSVPs, I had to message her and ask for an update on whether or not they'd make it, she said no. Funds are tight. I get it. The same day she's posting matching tattoos with a girl she met in HI. 

A few weeks later she messaged me to tell me she thought she was pregnant with baby number 2. I thought this was her way of reconnecting the friendship, but over the next two weeks, the only time she messaged me was in regard to her pregnancy. The only time we interacted was when I commented on her photos. I came to the realization that she wasnt going to be emotionally supportive of the highs and lows of my life like I was trying to be for her. It was draining. I decided to unfriend her. 

Our 'wedding' is in 17 days. She just sent me a message on snapchat. I'm not sure if I should open it because I dont know if it's in regards to unfriending her. If I am going to open it, I want to be prepared for whatever judgement she may have, so here i am:

Am I the asshole for unfriending her over this?

Editing to clarify some things: I've unfriended her because it felt like there wasnt a friendship anymore. I didn't block her. We haven't spoken in over a month because I wasnt initiating the conversations anymore. After reading some of the comments, I realize that I was right to feel like this was a one sided friendship. This has been going on over the course of almost 10 months. Maybe I should've messaged her before unfriending her, but to me that seems like I'm trying to guilt trip her into fighting for a friendship she doesn't want. Unfriending her was just cutting the last string that kept us connected.",42,48,0.92

357,Asshole,"Earlier in the day a colleague shared an ER surgery with me:


A patient presented at the ER explaining he put something in his rectum and was unable to retrieve it. Upon further investigation turns out the patient froze a summer sausage (the kind you eat) attached a string to it and ""put it up his butt."" String broke, patient was unable to retrieve said sausage eventually prompting a visit to the ER.


It was funny - the guy had a sausage up the butt. I spent the day, along with the other colleagues who heard the story, making jokes and topping them off by saying, ""put it up da butt"" ""in da butt"" etc.


During a break I walked to a local store and while there the ""in da butt"" jokes continued. A joke was made and I replied, ""just put dat sausage in da butt"" and out of no where a woman appears and tells us to stop making comments because it's triggering her. 


I told her it was a free country and she could ""stick a sausage in da butt."" My colleague told me I was an asshole for saying that to the random woman and refused to interact with me for the remainder of the day.


People are overly sensitive.


Am I the asshole here?


EDIT: I'd like to add a few details. I was with four other people (5 of us total). As we were joking among ourselves the woman approached us, we had our backs to her, and said ""you are triggering me stop saying that."" I turned, looked at her, didn't respond and finished making my selection. One of the guys standing next to me nudged me and said ""you can put the sausage in the butt."" I then said directly to him, ""no you can put the sausage in your own butt."" The woman walked around and stood directly in my face, I took a step back, then aggressively asked, ""what did you say."" I then repeated the statement to her, took a step back, said this is a free country and walked away. One of the other people in the group told me I was an asshole for telling her that and I told my colleague the woman was an asshole for getting in my personal space. Hence the question, was I the asshole for directing the statement to her.


EDIT2: For those who continue telling me I'm a horrible doctor and I should lose my license, seriously stop. Yes we kept joke going because that was the most recent ""happy"" interaction the 5 of us had before we lost four children under age 10 on the operating table because they were not taught the importance of firearm safety.

359,Everyone Sucks,"I've known my friend Jillian since middle school and we've been best friends for the last 6 years. We share everything - we talk about guys, college, our hopes, our college’s tennis team (she’s the captain), and serious things like insecurities, mental illness, eating disorders, and depression. We've both struggled with various mental illnesses and have always been around to support each other.

&#x200B;

I started seeing a therapist a few years ago. My therapist is fantastic and he has really helped me to see life in a different light. Since then, I have been able to manage my mental health better. Since then, whenever Jillian needs to vent about these issues, I try to get her to go see a therapist. She always refuses and when I asked why, she told me that she's not broken and doesn't need a ""fucking paid professional"" to fix her. I've even helped her set up an appointment but she didn't end up going. I know it's not a money issue since our college offers free counseling for students by licensed therapists.

&#x200B;

Right before finals, Jillian went through a major depressive episode. For several nights I stayed up until 3 or 4 in the morning talking to her or driving to her apartment in the middle of the night in order to comfort her and be with her. This resulted in me getting very little sleep and not having the time to study for finals and I ended up doing much worse than I wanted to and I also slipped into a minor depressive period as a result of this, but we are both doing better now.

&#x200B;

A week ago, we met and I told her that she was being too much emotionally for me and that dealing with her mental health issues was too much of a burden. I told her that she should really go see a therapist since her issues haven't gotten any better and that I wouldn't be able to listen to her endlessly since it was a lot of work and I felt like it wasn't helping at all. And I mentioned several issues specifically (like her eating disorder) and told her that these are way more than a friend should be expected to deal with. She exploded and said that dealing with this is part of being a real friend and that maybe we shouldn't be friends at all. And she told me that I was making her issues all about me and just because I was ""privileged"" to have good mental health doesn't mean that everybody can be that way. I was really insulted by this since she knows all about the mental health issues I've had in the past and I left.

&#x200B;

Since then, my phone has been blowing up with texts from our friends calling me heartless and cruel. I've tried explaining but all of them are basically on her side because I think she has told them a version of the story that makes me look like a frigid bitch. We used to hang out a lot and since then I think she has been intentionally excluding me from team events and now like 80% of my friends won't even respond to my texts.

360,Asshole,"My wife has never gone to the gym seriously. Closest thing to it was highschool where girls would hate it and do the bare minimum. Her goal is to gain muscle, mostly in the lower ass and legs. I've been a gym buff ever since highschool, about 6 years. I agreed to help her and go with her. This is already a sacrifice I'm willing to make since teaching can take lots of time out of my workout and I have to accommodate when I go to when she wants to go. The first week went fine. I was perhaps too instructiony and threw alot at once on her but other than that it went well. Today we decided to go kinda separately since my aim isn't on getting my ass bigger but we did do some stuff together. While we were separate I noticed she only did 1 set of lunges so I asked just to make sure how many sets she had already done to which she said 1. I laughed and told her the point is to aim for 3 or 4 sets and to exhaust the muscles. She told me she only did 1 because last time she only did 4 reps for a set and did 3 sets. This time she did 20 reps and 1 set. This led to sets vs reps confusion and me telling her again that the point is not to get the reps out of the way but rather exhaust the muscles. So she does her remaining sets then we do an exercise together. We start doing dumbbell squats. She does her sets but takes very little rest in-between sets. I asked how many reps she's doing and I tell her to take more rest in between sets to allow her to do more reps. She looks at me and laughs and says this isn't the Olympics. That's when I finally ignore her I do the rest of my workout and give her minimal help only if she asks. When we get home we talk about it she tells me I'm overreacting and that it's not that big of a deal. I try to explain why I wanted her to rest more and how it's better my way, given her goal of putting on muscle and she says I don't think so. I tell her to trust me and that I know more than her at this stuff. Honestly, I do. I have 6 years of experience and she just started. She says she'll just do it her way to which I reply well what's the point of me going to the gym with you and helping you if you know just as much? I tell her I don't want to do it if shes not gonna listen. We both try to get our points across and are yelling. My point is basically if you just listen to why I'm telling you to do thingsy way it might make more sense and if you don't want to then I don't see why I need to be there with you. Her point is basically I shouldn't get so worked up over one small detail and to just get over it and not start am argument over it. She gets emotional at me and while she's blending her protein shake in the blender its not blending very good and she storms off into the room and locks it. 

Tldr: wife got annoyed at me telling her what to do at the gym. I got annoyed that she wouldn't listen to what I told her to do. I have 6 years of weight lifting experience and she's just starting.",241,138,0.84
361,Asshole,"Hi!

The last 11 years I've been best friends with a guy we'll call Bob. To a certain extent, we are both very stoic: I need to get him really drunk to find out his emotional state and its just a pain in the ass to talk to him in general. I love the guy, but everbody who also knows him has implied or outrightly stated that he can be difficult to talk to. This is in a literal sense: he's quiet and just doesn't say much, but I do believe to know him extremely well despite of this.

I know that Bob has some issues with the fact that he's 26 and has never been on a date. Talking to women alone is difficult, let alone getting them for some romantic interaction. In the years that I've known him he has never had a date or a girlfriend: he has never kissed a girl and on this age it's becoming a bit awkward (since he wants to, but can't). If it's his decision, then I wouldn't say or do squat, but its his inability and insecurity that prevents him from doing, and I'm worried about his happiness.

So here's where we come in: the last 2 or 3 months (48 actually, this has been a long time coming) I've been thinking of setting him up on a fake date with a friend of mine. She's cool, attractive, and she's more then willingly to assist me as a favor to me. The thing is: the date is really only meant to boost his self-esteem. It's not real, and as his best friend I'm sending him on his first date knowingly that she doesn't think there will be a second time. She has expressed interest in doing this for me, not for him (although she mentioned that a wonderful first date might lead to a second one). I'm only doing this so he can get past that first step and maybe feel a bit better. I've weighted both options and considered the consequences: he might feel bad about not getting the second date or maybe the date will go terrible (unlikely, she has a lot of experience to make it a smooth experience), but the crossing of that first barrier might make him feel a bit more comfortable with going out there and asking women out.

I find myself to be below the average scale of looks and personality, but I've had 13 serious relationships simply on the account that I keep trying and getting rejected and rejected and rejected and rejected and BAM I now have a date. But, am I morally in the right here? Am I the asshole for faking one of his first experiences?

Best way to look at it: I'm setting two close friends (of mine) up for a blind date.Worse way to look at it: I'm making decisions for him and playing with his feelings because I think I know better.

I'm looking for some genuine criticism here,

Thanks.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm setting up my best friend to have a fake first-date so he can learn what it's like. I'm not intending for him to ever find out it was because she did me a favor.

&#x200B;

EDIT: For future commenters and readers: To clarify, I would tell him of the nature of the date if they ever go on a second date, so there's nothing about his relationship being built on lies. Also, this isn't a Netflix teen-drama so it's not written in stone that he will find out. To conceed, I'm considering abandoning this idea and first getting his confidence in general up.

&#x200B;

SECOND EDIT: For anyone who considers doing the same or people reading this later on; I've decided not to go through with it. I thought my intention was good, but the act itself is too risky. Another thing is that his issues can't be solved by a single date. That would be akin to some posts on r/wowthanksimcured . Anyway, thanks everyone for your imput and thoughts, I hope I can help Bob a little better.",60,41,0.86
362,Asshole,"There  was position I’d been been working toward for about a year now. It was one promotion away, but because of the size of the company there weren’t any openings. It’s a middle/upper management type position. Like any company, as you up it becomes like a funnel with fewer and fewer people moving upward. At the time I was a great candidate, however they never had a spot available.

Office politics, coworker relationships, all of that stuff will always come into play no matter what level you’re at. There was one coworker of mine I never liked from the start. Great at his job, charismatic, although incredibly rude to me when I first started. I’d ask him for help and he’d laugh at my weaknesses/lack of knowledge. I was told he has a “dry sense of humor” when I mentioned to others. 

As I became more competent, we became “friends”. More so, I would take him out for beers because I quickly realized he would act like a reasonable human being after a few drinks. Then I found out he was an alcoholic, and we bonded a bit over it because in my past I’d dealt with it myself. Suddenly he was asking me for advice and telling me shit about his life I didn’t want to know and never asked to know. 

It was downhill quick - the more I knew about him the more connections I made. People who had complained about sexual harassment, his problems with HR. His general attitude toward others was terrible, he was a complete asshole who was great at his job. Most of what happened was ignored. He told me about short cuts, shit that was illegal and I wrote it all down. 

I cut the string he was holding onto, his job. I strategically made it public but telling the right people. Part of me regrets it, honestly. However, I was looking out for myself and I convinced myself he was on a course to crash and burn. I’ve dealt with addiction myself, and perhaps that’s why we “bonded”. However, I needed hit rock bottom before I realized how stupid I was. 

I like to justify my decision with this discourse, and honestly I know what I did was both selfish and in my best interest. After he was fired, I was promoted almost immediately. I think about what happened frequently. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Since so many are focused on  “friends” part of my story, we were never close. Shit, he doesn’t even have my phone number. The quotation marks were to denote how he saw me. We had a business relationship, went out to happy hour everything now and then. He told me he has a drinking problem and gave him some advice. I guess he thought this made bros and told me a bunch of personal stuff unprovoked. Shit, I didn’t want to hear it honestly it made me uncomfortable. 

At the time I was genuinely just trying to help, but then he started telling me all these different things about abusing his position and outright fucked up shit about some of my coworkers. And the way he treated me to start... well I quickly was thinking fuck this guy and resented him for being in the position I wanted and getting away with so much bullshit. 

I definitely could have handled it better, but I knew if I tracked his behavior I could get him fired. I think we all agree I am an asshole for what I’ve done, that much is clear. However, think of it from my perspective. You can try to help someone you and others despise and hope for the best, or you can get him fired and promoted into a position you’ve been toward for years. I didn’t want him knowing anything about me because he would probably use it against me too. I’m not a therapist and definitely wasn’t going to provide him any advice. Logically the best route was to cut connections clean. No bullshit, no drama.

364,No A-holes here,"A bit of context here for you. A lot of times my wife and I say, “let’s have sex tonight” like we’re putting the occasion into our calendars. It just happens when you’re married. At least we still have sex. On this particular day, she had just seen Boyz 2 Men in concert, so she was probably pretty fucking psyched to get down. And when she is, I usually am. She’s objectively a total babe and I’m a lucky dude. But only 15-20 minutes before I go lay down in the bed, she’s telling me about how her stomach has been hurting her so much lately and she even sharted today. I went from ready to absolutely not ready. She came into the bed and she started kissing me, but I didn’t fully reciprocate and I told her it was because of the whole sharting thing. It reeeaaally bummed her out and made her feel self conscious, but I was trying to be honest about why I didn’t want to bang.

365,Everyone Sucks,"This is a pretty simple scenario, so I will try and make it short and sweet, at least as sweet as you can make an AITA post.

So about 4 or 5 friends and I were hanging out in our dorm room playing smash bros when my girlfriend texted me, I was the one who was winning rotation so I just waited to open it for a minute or two so I wouldn't have to keep my friends waiting. I didn't end up losing so I ended up just taking a couple of seconds to see what my GF said and at least respond once before continuing. When my friend Susan says

""Oh my god Goon, you're so whipped, all you ever do is give attention to GF"".

I'm not gonna lie that pissed me off a lot,  Susan has a tendency to make fun of me for the slightest acknowledgment of my girlfriend's existence. However, this was the straw that broke the camel's back so I responded

""Listen, Susan, I'm sorry that neither of your boyfriends ever loved you but can you do me a favor and fuck off""

While that enough is probably enough to make me the asshole I feel I should at least give some backgrounds on Susans past BFs so the judges can understand how that may have made her feel and I want as true a judgement as possible. Her 1st boyfriend cheated on her with a 14-year old for which he is now paying the consequences, and her 2nd boyfriend broke up with her just because... like actually he just didn't feel like dating her anymore.

Some of my friends think I was justified with the response while most of them think I was justified in saying something but what I said was too harsh. So I am gonna do what all reasonable people do, ask Reddit.

EDIT: I changed a sentence in the 6th paragraph because it didn't sound right and I posted it early.

EDIT: Some people think that I put the background on Susan's BFs in to help my side of the story but that's not the case. I put them in to help Susan's side.

367,Asshole,"Posting from a throwaway because I want to keep my friend and his glorious penis all to...because I don't want us to be doxxed.

I have been best friends with ""Aaron"" for a really long time, basically long enough for us to go through puberty together. In the words of Dr. Harris ""...that man has the largest penis I have ever seen..."" And it's beautiful, I mean it's such an attractive penis that if I were gay, I would fantasize about Aaron taking me on dates, cuddling with me in the poppy fields while we stare at the stars, laughing about our future, play fighting over which Ikea couch we're going to buy and making love until the sun comes up...you know...if I were gay. 

Aaron is also pretty shy, but he's the type of guy that when get's comfortable he can be very funny and endearing. He kind of has a Chris Pratt thing going on where he's super goofy but very lovable. He will never have the confidence to say it but girls and women have always really liked him. His also like an uber genius who is going to graduate in 3 years and go to med school. 

So we were out for Tuesday night which is one of the biggest nights during the summer in our college town. There were two girls who were clearly checking him out but he was much too shy to go over and talk to them. On my way to the bathroom I passed by them and I leaned in and asked them ""he's pretty cute huh?"" They both asked if I was with Aaron (gee, thanks girls for noticing he had a friend girls) I said yes. They asked if I would introduce them. I said yes as soon as I peed. So I got back and started talking up Aaron while he stood like such a nerd by the bar trying to pretend not to see me. I let it slip about his glorious member and one thought it was ""gross"" (mental illness, I presume) but the other was all game. So I walked them over and introduced them...and in the words of Vince Vaugh ""my baby was money, he was money baby..."" 

So they were talking and after many drinks she let it slip that I told her about his huge dick. He gave me the dirtiest look. It was really close to closing time and the girl grabbed his phone and programmed her number. She said that she had to work early but that she didn't want any games and wanted him to call ""as soon as you want but tomorrow afternoon would be awesome."" This girl was so into him. 

As we were driving home, he was so pissed at me and said I embarrassed him. He also said he's not sure if she likes him for him or as just an object.  I told him flat out if he was just a loser with a huge dick those girls would have been gone in two seconds, she liked him because he was hilarious, because he spilled a drink and wasn't self-conscious, because he was charming and good looking, gets straight-As in pre-med and all the other reasons he's literally ""money.""

369,Not the A-hole,"So my High School graduation is tomorrow, there's a Grad night after party which intertwines with my family dinner and I'm very conflicted.

Every one of my friends is going to the Grad Night after party, it's probably the last time I'll get the chance to see a lot of my fellow classmates for a while. I genuinely wanted to go, however my mom has a dinner planned for me at the same time as the Grad Night after party, this is the problem.

I've been trying to convince my mom to have the dinner earlier, at 5:00 PM instead of 11:00 PM ( So I can go to my Dinner AND the Grad night after party). The graduation ceremony starts at 8:00 PM and presumably ends at 10:00 ( The drive home is about 45 minutes so the family dinner wouldn't start till 11:00 PM).

She however has been extremely stubborn and won't even consider rescheduling it, I told her to give me a reason, a single one and I'd leave her alone, as it benefits literally no one to have the dinner so late. She just keeps quiet and says she doesn't need reasons ( The dinner isn't anything extravagant and it'll be at our home, with relatives invited.)

&#x200B;

So would I be the asshole if I ditched the family dinner for the Grad Night after party, or if I just greeted everyone at the dinner, maybe ate, and went to bed straight after in annoyance of the situation?

Edit: Yeah ditching would definitely be the asshole route, I actually know I probably wouldn't end up ditching the dinner even if she doesn't compromise, i'd just consider it.

371,Everyone Sucks,"So for a bit of background, I live in an apartment building and it’s a small community. I’ve become acquainted with everyone, it’s mainly elderly and disabled people but everyone is friendly. 

I noticed a woman with a large husky when I first moved in. Her name is Daisy and is a total sweetie but very hyper and has endless energy. Her owner is sort of disabled and doesn’t take Daisy on walks, rarely even takes her out potty. I love dogs but work long hours so it wouldn’t be fair for me to get a dog. 

As soon as I saw Daisy and how overwhelmed her owner was by her energy, I offered to walk her for her. I go on long walks nearly every day anyways and thought I might as well take Daisy with me! I want to be clear that I volunteered to do this, I am *NOT* getting paid to walk her dog. 

Fast forward to two days ago, I’ve been walking Daisy for a couple months and we both love our walks. She loves when I come up and get her and we walk along a pond and she stares at the ducks and geese. It’s a lot of fun. Well, it was. 

When I took her out on a walk a couple days ago, I let her drink from the pond like I always do, but there was some glass there and she cut her foot. It was pretty deep and she started bleeding. I immediately took her to the vet and called her owner and she met me there. 

Daisy had to get her foot wrapped up and I think she got stitches but I don’t recall all the details. The total cost of the vet was $227.00. As soon as the vet tells my neighbor this, she looks at me and we both are like wow that’s a lot. 

She then asks me if she wants me to pay now or write her a check later. I’m stunned and don’t really know what to say but I tell her that I’m not paying this vet bill. It’s her dog, I just walk her and I’m really heartbroken that she got hurt but I’m not going to pay this vet bill. 

She got super defensive and angry and went on a rant,  she said that if I didn’t pay this bill, she will take me to court. I told her that I was doing her a favor walking her dog, but that ends now. 

She immediately changed her tune and begged me to pay the bill because she couldn’t afford it right now and to please keep walking Daisy because she loves me so much. I firmly told her no and I would have to think about continuing to walk Daisy. 

The next day, I ran into a mutual friend on the elevator and she said that my neighbor was telling everyone that I cut up Daisy’s paw and wouldn’t pay for it. I asked what my friend thought and she didn’t believe I did it on purpose but I need to accept responsibility since I was put in charge of the dog and she got hurt on my watch.

I still don’t think I should be the one paying for her vet’s bills and now everyone in my building thinks I cut up dogs for fun. AITA? 

Tl;dr- I walked my neighbors dog for her, sweet pup got hurt, vet bill = $$$, I refuse to pay, my neighbor gossips more than my 14 year old niece.

***
I’ve been reading the comments and I do agree with the people who were saying I was the asshole for not at least offering to pay half of the bill. I offered to take the dog for walks. 

I should add that she is not disabled or elderly and works full time. She puts potty pads down for her dog so she only has to take her out once a day. I’m disgusted and saddened by how she takes care of Daisy. That’s one of the main reasons I offered to take her for walks. No dog deserves to live like that. 

I sent her a message today saying I’ll pay for half of the bills. However, once daisy recovers, I will not be put in this situation again, as I am not financially stable at the moment. I told her I won’t be walking Daisy anymore and that it breaks my heart. 

She said that I wasn’t being fair to Daisy and that I wouldn’t have to pay the vet bill if I just continue to walk her. I’m not sure what to do. Maybe if I get a contract where I’m not held liable if something is to happen to Daisy. Her owner is begging me to keep walking her. 

Anyways, I agree that ESH (except for Daisy of course)",659,2082,0.96

Ive always been the insecure one with all kinds of social phobias and for years I relied on him as my best friend and told him everything that was on my mind, he was always the cool calm and collected one that gave me advice on life and he's helped me a lot over the years.

373,Everyone Sucks,"Hi all, 
Before I get flamed, hear me out. My dog had puppies a few days ago. (It was an accidental breeding, we are getting the male fixed soon so it doesn’t happen again) 

She had one puppy that was born with a cleft palate. This puppy could not nurse on the mother because of this condition. We brought it to a 2 vet offices that were no help at all. They kept giving us the run around about its condition. The puppy could could not eat on its own, and required being fed every 2 hours through a feeding tube. My wife began feeding it at night, and I was supposed to feed it during the day. (I work from home, but I’m in sales, so I’m required to travel frequently during the day to meet with clients and give estimates on jobs. My schedule is unpredictable as I can be on call at any moment) 

Yesterday, my wife and I got into a huge fight about this puppy. She wanted to keep it and raise it. (We already have 3 dogs already, and they aren’t even receiving enough attention) I did NOT want another dog. The biggest reason was because I would be the one who would have to take care of this new puppy; potty training, feeding, taking it out, playing with it, etc. Since I “work from home” I would be responsible for the bulk of this work. I refused. I didn’t want to take on another puppy. I had to take care of our last 2 dogs from puppy hood, and it is HELL.

My wife wanted to keep this puppy. She was even looking into getting surgery for it, and spending thousands of dollars on this surgery. I did not want to spend all of this money for a puppy that I had no intention of keeping. I wanted to surrender this puppy to a dedicated rescue group who is specialized in treating puppies with this issue. It would receive around the clock care, and eventually be adopted out to a nice family. Every time we fed the puppy, the milk seemed to get pumped right out of its nose, like fluid was entering the puppies lungs. My guess is that it was developing pneumonia, but I’m no veterinarian. 

Sadly, the puppy died yesterday. I came home and found its stiff body. My wife blames me for the puppies death.... She says it’s my fault because I didn’t want to spend the money on getting the puppy help. The quote that we received from the vet required surgery, and costed thousands of dollars. It’s true, I didn’t want to spend all of the money that we have been working so hard to save up. But I also feel like we should have surrendered her to a rescue from the start, as we had no knowledge on how to properly care for a puppy with this condition. 

I got really upset that she blamed me for the puppies death. There was lots of yelling, and anger towards each other, and we aren’t speaking.

I wake up around 6:45 to leave the house for school every morning, but little did I know my next door neighbor for whatever reason brings his dog over to shit on my lawn every morning around 5.

376,No A-holes here,"M29, for context.

Around three years ago, I met ""Ashley"" through a mutual friend of ours and we hit it off immediately. We have similar careers and lifestyles, are both fairly liberal socially and politically, and love spending time with each other. Like all couples we've had our moments of disagreement and tension, but we've worked through them and have a very loving and happy relationship. Two months ago, I proposed and she accepted.

I should mention that Ashley and I come from pretty differing backgrounds - I'm from a more middle-class, lowkey and very liberal family, while her family is pretty wealthy, conventional and conservative. Her parents have always been very generous and kind to me personally, but the few times our parents have met and interacted could be best categorized as strained.

So, my cousin ""Joe"" and I are very close in age, and although living 5-6 hours apart most of our lives, we have been pretty much inseparable all throughout. However, he's had a bit of a rougher go of things with some poor decisions and personal problems - he spent some time in jail due to charges stemming from a fight outside a bar (long story), and fathered a child unintentionally out of wedlock. He also looks much less clean-cut than me - tattoos, long hair, etc. Despite these issues, he has always been an incredibly compassionate and kind person and helped me through some difficult problems in my life. He has gotten sober, accepted his responsibilities as a parent, and is genuinely trying to right his wrongs.

The moment I got engaged, I knew I wanted Joe as my best man. Although I have several other close friends, it wasn't even a question. However, when I mentioned this to Ashley, it was instantly clear she wasn't thrilled with the choice although she didn't say too much else at the time.

Last night, she calmly confronted me and said she would like me to choose a different best man. She said she is fine with him being in the wedding party and has no issues with him personally (they've met a couple times and always gotten along fine), but given his history/appearance and the already strained family ties, another choice would be better for everyone involved. It wasn't necessarily an ultimatum, but she did say she'd have to think everything over more if I wasn't willing to do this.

I'm torn. On one hand, I know compromise is essential to any relationship and it's not like she's trying to have him blacklisted from the wedding or even thrown out of the wedding party. On the other hand, this is my family and I've told her how much he means to me. I feel like I'd be a sham if I gave in and chose someone else and wondering what I'd have to give up next.

I found out they were having sex after seeing her name pop up on his phone (her name is very uncommon, and my brother isn’t too social, so I knew by process of elimination it was her). I just assumed she was asking about me because my phone fell in the pool, so I haven’t had access to it, and because I had no reason to believe they had any other relationship before until I saw her messages. They’ve been doing it for a couple weeks it seems. 

I know they’re both adults that can make their own decision, but I just find it weird as fuck. It makes me uncomfortable. I decided I didn’t really want to be her friend anymore and sent her a text letting him know. She was defensive/hurt and tried to question me about it, but I felt like I didn’t really owe her anything. It’s impractical to go no-contact with my brother logistically, but I still feel very betrayed by him as well.

I know it's a risk as a future partner might not be ok with this plan and I might change my mind about wanting to wear them, but for the purpose of this post I'd prefer not to debate whether or not the rings will be useful to me in future as that is a separate topic.

He initially, during the breakup, offered to give me the rings for free. Later on he said he had just been emotional at that time and that he'd give them to me for half the cost, which I accepted as I know things said during a breakup can be a little crazy. We went through several more rounds of negotiation over the next couple of weeks with both sides vaguely agreeing to things and then backing down, and he settled very firmly on a final cost of 75% of the purchase price of the rings that I would need to pay him to get the rings.

The thing is, these rings are not returnable since they're custom, they have very little resale value for the same reason and because the e-ring is an alternative gemstone (not diamond or similar), and he has no use of any kind for the rings. The breakup was mutual but he was the one who ""officially"" broke it off. I strongly feel that we should take an equal financial hit and that my paying half is fair, and that demanding 75% of me is unreasonable given that he would otherwise have $0 and rings he can't use. We both decided to go ahead and get rings made and I had his budget in mind when designing them, not mine. He feels it's unfair of me to take possession of the rings for substantially less than their purchase value, as he would be left with no rings and a loss of any money he doesn't recoup from me, so by me insisting on a discount I am ""demanding free money"".

Financial context: 75% of the total cost would equal 3 weeks' salary for me. It's a lot of money but I have savings so it wouldn't send me to the poorhouse. His salary was 7x higher than mine, but he was laid off recently. He can get a new high-paying job pretty easily, but he's still experiencing some anxiety as he is an extremely frugal person, which is contributing to this situation.

So, AITA for wanting to pay half?",88,109,0.89
379,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We only get to see each other in person every 3-6 weeks depending on our current work schedules/ school. Whenever we see each other, we call off work or make time within our schedules. The last time that I came to her, she worked 2 and a half out of the 4 days that I came to visit. I vented out my frustrated to her before and she apologized and said she couldn’t get those days off because she was saving up her vacation days for our vacation in July. I accepted her apology and we made the best of that weekend. 

This weekend, she’s coming down to visit me. We had planned out our weekend together two months in advance. She claims to have had notified her employer two months ago that she would be taking this weekend off. However, her employer had not granted her one weekday in the middle of the 4 days we had planned together, thus cutting short our time with each other to 2 days instead of the 4 that we had planned together initially. I’ve never had an employer reject a request to take a day off after giving them at least three weeks of notice, so I am doubtful if shes telling the truth or not. Would I be the asshole if I called her out on my belief that she isn't being truthful and also tell her to do better in terms of working out her schedule?

Edit: The issue of me not believing her is because she waited just until now to tell me. Blindsiding me until a couple of days prior to her visitation is not okay, and I will not endure that. If she had addressed the issue in the past, I would understand completely. Some of the comments claim that she is more annoyed than I am but have no idea what week I had prepared with her.",97,161,0.88
380,Asshole,"I had been with a girl now for almost 2 years. This past year, she began a steady relationship with another boy, but still wanted me too. She was super shady in how she did it. Tried to hide it from me at first. I found out and we tried having an open relationship with a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. However, it became obvious that she was just using me for financial gain. I've always been the type to spoil my gfs. But she definitely went the extra yard with asking for help for plane tickets to her study abroad program ($2500) and needing a new laptop ($1300) along with a lot of other stuff. It became apparent that she was really just stringing me along to get financial help.

&#x200B;

She graduated last week and didn't even thank me for helping her out. Instead, she invited her bf and her family who haven't supported her at all and didn't even give me a chance to meet her since she was moving back home after graduation. She kept telling me that I could visit her after graduation, but when I tried to make plans, lo and behold her bf was already there and she basically had no time for me. When I asked when is he leaving, she told me she is moving in with him in his parents' house. It was obvious she was trying to string me along until the last minute.

&#x200B;

I decided to basically expose her on social media. I was tired of being the secret bf that did the most, but got nothing in the end. I went on her mom's FB page and posted on a public graduation post and told the truth how secretly she was messing around with me to pay for stuff and that she still tries to get stuff from me. It's a public post that she's tagged in so not only will her mom see it, but also all her friends and family. AITA for doing this?",35,30,0.74

382,Asshole,"So there’s this weird thing that happens in community theatre, especially if you live in or close to LA (or NY, or Chicago, or any big theatre/acting hub) where mediocre amateur actors think they’re the next big thing because the local community theaters cast them in stuff. 

Community theaters hire volunteers. They are often desperate for actors. Sometimes just being present and willing or knowing the director gets you the role. 

So there’s this kid I’ve worked with on a few different productions that just straight up SUCKS. Painfully awkward stage presence, zero comedic timing, and the last thing he did required a southern accent and he was so “into it” that you couldn’t understand a fucking word he said. 

So he just got cast in like his 3rd local production this year so far (all at the same theatre, mind you) and makes a big Facebook announcement that once this show wraps, he’s finally quitting his bank job to take the plunge into pursuing acting full time. Of course he gets a million likes and hearts and pats on the back, just the way he does at the end of every local production. 

So I PM him and say this:

“Hey man, congrats on your new role! Just wanted to give my two cents on your announcement, I really hope it doesn’t offend you. But you’re seriously going to have a very difficult time getting cast on a professional level with your current acting ability. I know it feels encouraging to get cast in all the shows you have, but professional acting is an entirely different ball park and you just don’t have the chops, you barely have them for what you have been doing. Maybe you could improve with lessons, but you have a really good job at the bank and I would highly suggest keeping it while taking lessons and then getting some professional opinions after a while before up and quitting your job. I just care and don’t want you to suffer because no one was honest with you.” 

He never replied, unfriended me, and now people from his little theatre clique have unfriended me too and I feel a definite coldness when I encounter certain people in that group. AITA?",227,784,0.94

386,META,"Since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time I ranted about voting on this sub. So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

You may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

As you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

Also important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. If you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and GTFO. You have come to the wrong place.

P.S. If you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. Maybe you're not an asshole after all.

387,No A-holes here,"I always wished I had an interesting AITA story to share but I’m pretty laid back and apathetic that I don’t find myself in those situations. But the mom who let her picky child go hungry post reminded me of something that happens infrequently that I’ve been called an asshole for. 

My son, H, is 5 now and is really particular about his food. He eats a lot of different food but is weird about how it’s prepared- he hates sauces and gravies, likes almost everything in a casserole but hates casseroles, etc etc. One thing he’s super picky about is steak. He only likes certain cuts (NY strip and sometimes a sirloin). He can tell the difference between a rib eye, a filet and a strip steak and won’t eat the first two. He also only likes them medium rare- rare. He’s been like this since he was 2 years old.  He won’t eat a steak if it’s cooked medium- it has to be red with maybe a little pink throughout. 

So we’re at a steakhouse and I get him a $28 NY strip medium rare. I cut into it and it’s not even a little pink. He says “mommy why is my steak white and not red” so I tell the waitress the steak is over cooked and ask for a new one and specify we want it with a warm red center. She looks perplexed and irritated that I’m sending back a steak for a toddler (he was 3 at this incident). Our next steak is better but not a warm red center and my son eats my salmon and I eat the steak so when the manager comes by and asks us how the food was I tell him my son’s steak was over cooked twice and he takes it off the bill. My family said I was an asshole bc the restaurant was out the cost of  two expensive steaks and it’s ridiculous to send food back for a toddler.  I say I’m still the one paying and we should get what we ordered. 

In the 3.5 years since he started eating steak I’d say we’ve went 3 steaks back for being over cooked. Is this an asshole move? Is it an asshole move for everyone or just for a child?",123,103,0.85

I was gone for the days that he worked. when I came back my trip I was blown away. He literally went above and beyond. He fixed it up, repainted my whole basement with the left over paint, fixed a door and put back the rug. I was so surprised because we had never discussed doing that much work.

When it came time to pay him, I gave him $550. That’s when an argument occurred. He said he did at least $800 worth of work. That I should tip him more than that. I told him that we never discussed doing that much work and we had already agreed on a price. He got mad and yelled at me when I refused, he eventually left.

I do think that $800 is a reasonable price for the amount of work that he did. My issue is that I never asked or expected him to do that. My plan was to slowly do it myself.

Then she messages the group chat (direct qoute) ""Thank you to everyone (but OP) who donated I love you all"" and now my friends are mad at me saying I make good money and shouldn't be so heartless.

 I(26M) have been wanting to watch Detective Pikachu for the past few weeks. Unfortunately for me, after asking out 4 different groups of friends and my girlfriend (24F let's call her Joy), everyone is a lot more interested in Endgame. With John Wick releasing last week, I'm probably gonna have to wait till Detective Pikachu releases on Netflix because the hype will switch over to John Wick. The following started last weekend and the ""date"" is supposed to be tomorrow (24/05)

After a bit of pestering and getting an adamant no from Joy, I jokingly told her ""Fine, I'll just go on Tinder"" only to get a ""Hah, like that'll work out"". So I downloaded Tinder, where my profile was from 3~4 years ago, changed only the bio to ""I just don't wanna watch Detective Pikachu alone"" and got to swiping semi-seriously till I fell asleep.

For context, (I think) dating apps aren't exactly a thing where I'm from and (I think) I'm only above average in terms of appearance so expectations were low. So imagine my surprise when I wake up to a match (23F let's call her Jenny) asking whether or not I was serious about the movie. I excitedly said yes, asked when she was available and where she lived/worked so we could go to a theatre that wasn't too far away from our places/workplaces depending on the situation.

It didn't occur to me that I should tell Jenny that I'm in a relationship until I told Joy about the match. Throughout the entire time, I thought Joy was ok with it. She joked about how I'll end up watching the movie alone once I told Jenny. I came clean to Jenny ASAP and told her that if she was still interested, I'd pay for the tickets, popcorn, drinks, etc. and the ""date"" was still on. Normally, I wouldn't do this but I admit I was tunnel visioning pretty hard. I probably shouldn't have assumed it from Joy's replies but I also told Jenny that Joy was ok with it since it's just a movie and dinner (might as well right?)

Fast forward to yesterday, we were having dinner and I showed Jenny's Instagram to Joy. This is probably where I might be TA for possibly making Joy insecure by commenting on how gorgeous Jenny is (a sentiment that Joy vocalised first) garnished with an ""I didn't think I could land an 8.5"".

After desserts, I felt like Joy was giving me the cold shoulder. Nothing aside from a goodbye and no ""I just got home"" text from her. Till today, Joy hadn't replied to several of my texts asking her how work was, etc.

I've also asked if she objects to the ""date"" with Jenny just to be sure. No reply still. I'm still planning to watch the movie tomorrow. Joy might have just been too preoccupied/tired to reply. Am I over thinking this or WIBTA if I followed through on the ""date""?",430,725,0.86

It was pretty suspicious, because we know his dad was born and raised there, plus that he moved back there. This, combined with the fact that my dad doesn’t look like his two brothers from his dad, but looks more like his siblings from his mom’s first marriage, was suspicious. I knew he couldn’t have the same dad as his half-siblings because he died before he was born, but there were relatives that they all remained close to.

My dad was in denial about this for a while. He came up with excuse after excuse. My mom tried asking one of my aunts and she shut it down so fast, it was definitely shady. There was a secret and I wanted to know. (Dad’s mom is dead so no one can talk to her about it either.)

My dad’s supposed biological father had another son with someone else after he left my grandma. I talked to my uncle who had gotten back in touch with his father and that side of the family prior to his death, and he gave me the brother’s info. Turns out, he lives in America and not that far away. I used one of those drug store DNA test things and talked with him, explaining the situation (I’m in my 20s). I didn’t tell my parents I was doing this. I figured if I was right, my dad could find his biological father, who might not know about him.

The results came back…and I am not at all related to this man. Who looks exactly like my uncles from my grandma’s marriage to the Mexican. It was confirmed. I told my dad and shit kind of hit the fan. The aunt my mom talked to, told me that the older siblings from the first marriage always knew but didn’t say anything. They’re mad at me for confirming it. As is my dad. Apparently, I should’ve left it alone. AITA for digging up these secrets?",26,63,0.91
407,,"This is dumb but I love animals and I feel guilty. I currently have a betta fish named Sashimi (I know..) that I agreed to take from a family that didn't give him proper care and didn't want him anymore. He now lives in a 10 gallon heated, filtered tank with live plants and a few snail friends.

Problem is he is getting old and we're moving soon. I've moved with fish before and its very stressful on them, considering I have to put them in the plastic cup they came in and then find a way to keep them from sloshing around. Sash is getting skinny, less colorful and biting off his own fins so he can swim better. The move will be very stressful for him.

I kind of just want to put him to sleep before we leave. I don't have any friends to take him that know anything about fish care, and while I've taught my dad how to keep bettas properly he still doesn't quite know what to do when one falls ill and also his last fish died recently so I don't want to give him a close to death fish anyway. Even moving him to my dad's house would be stressful for the fish but my boyfriend keeps telling me to just give the fish to my dad anyway. I totally would if Sashimi was younger and in better shape but I don't know. Fish aren't as easy to rehome as other pets and to be honest I haven't met anyone else who actually knows how to take care of one.

I wouldn't kill him by flushing him down the toilet or anything but by use of clove oil which kinda just puts them to sleep. My ex killed all 8 of my previous fish by flushing them after he dumped me and I was heartbroken so I feel really guilty for killing Sash before his time. WIBTA if I euthanize him?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not considering killing my fish JUST because i'm moving, so if you want to say YTA please don't say it because you think I'm doing this out of convenience. If this fish was healthy I'd take him with me for sure because I know he could probably handle the move. If you still want to say YTA then thats ok because that's why I'm here, just don't assume I'm doing this because I can't be bothered to move a fish tank.",105,40,0.81

411,Update,"A month ago, I shared [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/be78v7/aita_for_sleeping_with_someone_to_spite_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Tl;dr I have a homophobic boss, met her son on Grindr, he hates her, we would pretend to be a couple at his birthday party to piss her off, my friends dumped me because of it.

All **my friends** but one are out of my life. She stayed friends with them and found out they don't have a problem with this incident as much as they do with me being on Grindr. Apparently they find it gross that I have casual sex?

**The job** I had lined up will happen. I had a call with them, they said they were considering 3 people but I am the most qualified, and they need to sort out some paperwork before they officially offer me the job. It's abroad.

**Before the party**, I met Sonny's friends to solidify the idea that we're a couple. We had drinks and watched GOT at his place. **At the party**, I came with a big gift, I embraced and kissed Sonny and he introduced me to everyone as his boyfriend. To **Mommy**, he said: ""Mom, you already know OP from work, right? We're dating"". She was quite obviously angry as fuck and very badly pretended not to be. I smiled at her and shook her hand, and she just dumped her food and left us. Sonny's other family was very nice.

**Granny** arrived and she was super excited to meet me. She asked if I met Mommy. I told her I already knew her from work, so she asked what she was like there, and I said something diplomatic like ""There are good times and bad times, just like at any job"" (I don't remember my exact words). She took my hand and told me I seem like a nice person and that she's happy Sonny has me.

Mommy was in the kitchen the rest of the party, avoiding everyone. I barely saw her again before she left. At work, she hasn't spoken to me. She usually starts pestering me with her bullshit on Monday at 8 am but she hasn't said a single word to me nor has she looked at me. Several people noticed and asked me what was going on and I said I don't know.

Back to Saturday, after the party, I stayed to talk to **Sonny** alone. He didn't seem to be in a good mood, and I assumed it was because he expected a worse reaction from Mommy. But then he said he had something to tell me. Apparently, us meeting on Grindr wasn't a coincidence. He came across my profile by accident but he recognized me from the staff photos from our college's website. He said he was very sorry, he didn't expect me to go with his plan at all, he initially just wanted to rant about his mother to someone who might understand. I guess I'm mostly okay with that, but I wish he had told me sooner. But then he also said he has feelings for me. We spend so much time together, we text all the time, we have dinners, we sleep over, and it just happened. I get it. I'm not exactly cold as ice when it comes to him either. But still, I will be moving away in August. And there's the whole Mommy situation.

So yeah. I got NTA the last time, but I'm starting to feel like this is something I really didn't need in my life.",114,1433,0.94

My GF and I were pretty close. We were planning on getting a place together as soon as my lease ended which was in a few months.We lived near her parents and and relatively close to mine. Plus, we both grew up in this town so we have lots of mutual friends that we regularly hang out with. I sell cars for a living and it’s a small town so pretty much everyone knows me.

About 8 days after my GF passed away, one of my good friends (who I had a crush on prior to the relationship) was consistently around to be supportive. In a moment of weakness, I ended up kissing her and we have now been hanging out almost daily. I revealed this to another friend and she was extremely upset and disturbed. She ran her mouth and two other friends texted me saying that’s really “twisted” and “cruel.” Since it’s a small town, people started talking and now my GF’s family also got word and they texted me insults.

417,Not the A-hole,"Context: I (19M) Have a slightly unorthodox and quite feminine appearance. I've had some questioning about my gender identity, but that's mostly not related. My nose and ears are pierced and I have silver/blond hair with the side shaves. The top reaches my chin easily. I also wear gold rimmed glasses that are round.

All in all, I look quite androgynous. Today, I bought some new earrings - They're of navi from zelda, and have a blue stone with wings, then two smallee blue stones dangling. I wore them today after buying them.

The incident: As I got home from work tonight, my parents saw my earrings and responded effectively saying ""what the fuck is in your ears"". This is a pretty standard reaction and just kinda smiled. They were having some trouble with my little sister (17F)  lying to them to visit guys, so I knew they were upset.


About a half hour later, my Dad had a serious discussion with my sister about her habits and asked me to come speak to him after. 

I sat down and he immediately asked me what was wrong, if everything was okay, and ""What's going on with you?"" I responded simply by saying that ""everything's fine"", probably looking confused because I was. 

He went on to tell me that I looked like a transgender person trying to look like a woman, asking me if I was transgender. I said no to all of this because it is easier.

He got more and more frustrated and ended up saying ""I used to be so proud of you. The proudest Dad ever."" Because I have always excelled in school. This really got to me for obvious reasons, and I just said ""Used to?"" To which he replied ""Yes, used to."" Referencing my appearance as the reason.

At this point he said some more things that to be frank I don't remember because I was upset. He then told me that he doesn't think anyone will take me seriously - This couldn't be further from the truth, as I have achieved a lot and am very active in mu student community. I have a verg competitive internship in which I was one of three students chosen from several 100 applicants. I share this to show that I am respected by my peers and superiors.

I stood up and begin walking away, simply saying ""Well, I'm lucky most people aren't like you."" 

He could tell that I was upset and started to yell after me saying as such. I replied ""I'm not upset. I'm really, really angry.""

He yelled back ""Good! Get angry! You look like you want to fucking fight me, come on, fight me if you want to!""

I told him I didn't want to fight him and went to bed.

AITA here? Do I have a responsibility to look as he wants while living with him? He's never told me against any of my piercings, it's the femininity he takes issue with.

420,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I were married about a month ago; the wedding had 150 guests, and every guest was out of state.

In our bridal party, at the last second we had one guy drop out due to a family emergency. We didn't see this as a huge deal and just accepted that one guy would walk in with two girls, as the tux place said it'd be a huge upcharge to get a tux for someone that quickly and we didn't want to burden anyone.

My wife and I wanted to just hang out with the bridal party a few nights before the wedding; one of the SO's of the girls wanted to tag along (He'll be Gary); they've been dating about 5 years, but they were not (and are not) engaged. I do not care for this guy. He is incredibly disrespectful, narcissistic, and tends to make everything about him. He wanted to propose at our wedding and my wife and I told him we'd prefer him not to. We made it clear that we only wanted the bridal party to come hang out; we stated our reasoning was that if we invited an extra person, everyone would want to bring an extra and eventually several weddings guests would invite themselves into it causing a mess; this is partially true. This has happened before. We told the wedding party 3 months in advance that we would all want to hand out with just them; Gary contacted us to confirm that this meant he was not invited. It's not like we sprung this on them at the last second.

So the night we're supposed to hang out I find my wife extremely upset; apparently Gary had been badmouthing my wife and I to his SO and some of the other bridal party members in the hotel, saying that we were bad friends, inconsiderate, etc, because we didn't invite him to the bridal party thing. Keep in mind, he knows other people there outside of the bridal party, he's just specifically angry that he didn't get an invite to that (and later, we found out, that he wasn't asked to fill in for the groomsman who dropped out).

With the stress of the wedding looming over our heads and my wife in tears we told our bridal party that we didn't feel right to go out and to head out without us; some of them did, and they brought Gary with them. Gary even tried calling both of our sisters and my brother to see if he could get them to come out to what was supposed to be our last even with our bridal party before the wedding, but they refused. According to a groomsman, Gary continued to badmouth us when they went out (though some people still stood up for us).

Aside from that, the wedding was wonderful, but I'm still angry at Gary. He made my wife cry and tried to manipulate her family members behind her back because he was angry over not getting an invite to something that he'd been aware of three months in advance. Were we wrong in not inviting him, or should we have just sucked it up and let him come in spite of our feelings towards him?

428,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I know the title is very incendiary so let me explain. 

My boyfriend and I are in our mid twenties and have been together a little over 2 years. He was a chain smoker when we started dating, but thanks to my incessant nagging, he was able to quit. 

For a while. 

Now he’s starting up again and just trying to hide it from me, which is impossible because the smell just reeks. My uncle died of lung cancer and it was an absolutely awful way to go, so I told him that we can get him the patch, pills, or whatever he needs to quit, but I can’t stay with him if he’s going to keep smoking.

He gets very defensive, saying I don’t know what it’s like to be so addicted to something. And he’s right. I know it will be extremely hard, but people quit every day and it’s not impossible. So he told me he’ll quit if I quit drinking.

For some background, I don’t have a drinking problem. I’m in my twenties and I admittedly spend every Saturday at the bar with my friends, but that’s about it. I don’t drink alone. I very rarely drink during the week. I never come home after work and crack open a beer (not that there’s anything wrong with that). I refused, because I feel like he’s just trying to take something away from me to be spiteful. My occasional drink isn’t going to kill me. His cigarettes probably will kill him. 

I offered to stay sober for a few months out of solidarity to help him get over the worst of it, but he refused. He said if he has to give up cigarettes forever, I have to give up alcohol. And tried to turn it around saying that I must love drinking more than him (I had said something similar about smoking). So I refused. 
But now I feel guilty. After all, it might actually help him quit and save his life. It could save our relationship, and I’m basically throwing that away to have beers on the weekend. 

AITA?

EDIT: a lot of people are calling me the asshole for dating a smoker and trying to change him. For what it’s worth, I told him I was worried about the smoking before we became official and he assured me he was trying to quit. I believed he could, which may have been naive of me.",480,1427,0.93

433,Not the A-hole,"This is my very first post, so apologies in advanced.

&#x200B;

Some background, I'm a Christian and have been attending the same church for some time. A good friend of mine from my church and I got together and talked about starting a book club. Originally we talked about reading some classic horror novels of a pretty famous author we both love. We invited a few friends to join and I was really looking forward to it, I love horror and mysteries and the idea of talking about and analyzing them made me really excited.

&#x200B;

But then, a few days later my friend said they thought it'd be better if we strictly stuck to Christian literature instead of what we originally talked about, since reading something that could be anti-Christian values/theology would be unhealthy spiritually. I was totally against this idea and said I thought it would be fundamentally less interesting, and that I'd rather read books with more varying themes and ideas. They countered that the stories could all be different and I wasn't giving them a chance. It felt to me that my friend really dug their heels in and was unwilling to budge, but truthfully neither was I.

&#x200B;

I'm not against reading some Christian literature, but I'd rather not be so limited. Part of my bias is I usually find Christian movies/stories to be cheesy and not very good, although I will admit I haven't read a lot of Christian stories. I've only seen a handful of movies.

&#x200B;

Now I want to reiterate I do believe that spiritual health is a thing, but I also believe that sheltering yourself and other's from ideas that are different than yours isn't helpful or worthwhile. I think that if your faith can be so challenged by reading a book and analyzing it then it wasn't very strong to begin with. I really don't feel like the other people who wanted to participate would love being limited either. I just feel like this a weird thing to demand and makes me want to just give up on the whole idea. So AITA? Would I be if I just joined another book club on my own?

Thank you guys so much. I was really bothered by our conversation all morning and your answers really helped me out. I was really nervous posting this here but you've all been so lovely. I think I'll just join with a different book club on my own without feeling guilty about it. It's not what we talked about so I'm not tied to it. I don't wanna limit myself to what other's think is spiritually healthy for me personally.

She mentions bedsheets W was going to let her borrow and asks if I had brought them. W didn't mention this to me, but I had noticed some sheets that she left next to the front door of our apartment. I was going to lunch after church so I wouldn't be going home to get them for WF, but I made a snap decision that we could probably trust her to grab the sheets on her own. WF was good with this option, so I gave her our door code and went on my merry way.

Now, I had been working through a laundry backlog and little boys are very capable of making a mess, so the house wasn't the most presentable. I had plans to do some more cleanup later that evening. I obviously wasn't expecting to have someone else in the house. Getting two little boys fed and out the door in the morning is a chore all its own anyways. 

Things went according to plan and I had the laundry done, dishes cleaned, apartment swept, etc. W came home super tired and thankful that the house looked as good as it did. Wasn't perfect by any stretch, but it rarely is with little boys.

A couple days later, W offhand mentions her friend having come to get the sheets. I tell her what we arranged and find out that the sheets I saw were the wrong ones. WF found them after messaging W, who was surprised she was in our apartment without me. This is where the obnoxious behavior happened. 

WF tells W essentially that the house is a mess and I have a lot of work to do to make the apartment presentable before W gets home. I'd be willing to laugh this off as a joke, but WF then proceeds to take a video of our entire apartment to try to ""show how bad it is."" This lady has no kids so I guess her home is always perfect or something. W is a champ, so she told WF she's not worried about me and even sent WF a message when she got home about how well I did and how clean the house was.

At any rate, I can't help but feel a little violated and insulted. W and I are equal partners in all we do and the idea that I need to be monitored when W isn't home is just trash IMO. I haven't said or done anything yet, but  WIBTA for confronting her and letting her know she is no longer welcome in our home without supervision, how hurtful that was, etc",447,4358,0.94
436,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I (32M and 34M) eloped and got married because we got sick of our families and the fact they were treating *our* wedding as *their* wedding.

We got engaged over 3 years ago. Various life circumstances have prevented us from getting married sooner and since our families were getting annoyingly impatient, last year we decided to finally do it. The first thing we did was set and book a date: June 22.

Our parents ***INSISTED*** they pay for everything instead of giving us gifts. After arguing for several weeks we said yes. Big mistake. Our mothers, sisters and aunts immediately got involved because we're ""both men and men don't organize weddings"". We've been getting messages every day for the past 4 months with suggestions for everything wedding-related. The number of guests grew from 32 to 86 and every time we tried to fight it, our parents said: ""Don't worry, we're paying for it!"" Which is beside the point (the point that I don't want to get married in front of 50 people I don't know). The only thing we managed to keep is best men. Our mothers tried to force us to have a whole posse of groomsmen but we put our foot down and said our 2 best friends would do.

The invitations were my sister's idea and self-inflicted responsibility, the party favors my MIL and SIL's idea, my mother and MIL ""designed"" the cake etc. Our sisters took us to try on suits and we ended up settling for whatever *they* liked because we were sick of it.

In the midst of all this, my SO says he wants to elope. The next day we buy suits we like, contact our actual wedding photographer and ask when the earliest is when she's available, get our best men and get married within 4 days. It was lovely and we have wonderful memories of it.

5 days ago, my mother saw the different suits and, long story short, we admitted we eloped. **Everyone** freaked out. Apparently, since we're already married, ""the second reception won't count"". Our parents told us that OUR WEDDING IS OFF and that they want their money back. Deposits have already been made and it would be a huge amount of money so we said we aren't giving them a single penny for the wedding they themselves insisted on and modified according to their own wishes despite our protests. They called us all sorts of lovely names and left. My SO tried to reason with them over text, saying it can still be a party for family and friends, and they're ignoring him. June 22 is approaching and we have no idea what to do.

Did we make a mistake by eloping? Are we obligated to pay them back? Are we the assholes?

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm not sure I explained this correctly. The wedding our families were planning *would have still happened* despite us eloping. We never intended to tell anyone we eloped, but my mother likes to go through our stuff and she found the different suits. Had she not found them, nobody would have known. So we would have our lovely intimate moment, they would get the wedding they wanted and everyone would be happy. Several people's comments suggest they think we eloped KNOWING the wedding would be off. We didn't know or expect that to happen.

Another edit to point out we don't care about a wedding reception - THEY DO. We were going to go through with it despite eloping in order to make them happy. We didn't use them to get a party. We don't care about having a party. They used our wedding to get a party. Because they care about having a party.",243,791,0.91
437,Asshole,"Mobile. Throwaway account because I don't want either of them to know I'm me. Sorry this is a long post.

I (30's, f) and my best friend (30's, f) have been best buds for about 20 years despite multiple moves and huge life changes, both of my own failed marriages and some bad relationships on her part as well. We've always been there for each other and it's been a great ride.

So, she's with this guy (and I used to live in that area as well, so we have met and hung out on various occasions) for years now.  I've tried really hard to like this guy, talked to him in person, or on messenger, and in the background of our phone calls.  Several things have put me off of wanting to talk to him.


I planned a trip out to see Friend which would involve me driving a considerable distance (more than 8 hours) to spend 3-4 days there, and come back. I asked for 1 day where just the two of us could have a girls day (go get our hair done or pedicures, do some shopping, and maybe grab a fancy lunch or dinner somewhere with a glass or two of wine). All good, she wants a girls day and has missed me, and we're both getting excited about it.


Two days later, we're discussing our options and he walks in and commences to start putting in suggestions for things we might enjoy in the area for our girls day. I'm pleased to see that he's actively supporting of the two of us getting some time together. I comment that he brought up some good ideas, BUT THEN HE SAYS, ""I'm really looking forward to playing chauffeur for you two...""


Full stop. This was supposed to be a 'just the two of us' day. I explain this calmly. And he gives me a lecture about how as women, we are vulnerable out in the city and he's just tagging along to make sure we're both safe because it's his responsibility that I make it home safely if I'll be visiting them because having guests means you take full responsibility for their well being while they're there.


I came up with an excuse to cancel the trip because I feel like his need to constantly babysit and chaperone the behavior of two women in their 30's is messed up. I'm not a child, neither is my friend. We were functional adults before he came into her life, and I am supremely pissed off that I can't get one single day with my best friend in the world. 


AITA for cancelling, or should I have sucked it up and gone on a trip to see my best friend and her fiance?


Edit:I had a discussion with her shortly after the exchange I described in the post (but 3000 character limit). I've also had discussions with her about why I dislike him in general.


Concerning this specific incident, I explained that I don't feel like we need a babysitter and I don't want to spend a couple thousand dollars on a trip (because I would be getting a hotel) and blow through half my vacation days for the year in one go if Im going to feel like I'm being monitored while I'm there. She said he was just concerned for us and wanted to help us have a fun and safe visit. She says she gets where I'm coming from, and explained that he completely doesn't understand why this seems unreasonable to me. And that makes me feel like I AM being unreasonable.


Edit 2: By, ""I've had discussions with her about why I don't like him,"" I mean 5 discussions over the course of the last two years. Once when he was bashing her religion which she's very passionate about. Once when he tried to claim her success financially as being due to his own efforts (she worked hard and worked her way up in her company, created a budget and worked hard to save money. He encouraged and supported her in all of this, but it was unfair to say it happened 'because of him'). Once when she called to vent that he had yelled at her after a traffic accident. Once when he tried to set me up with a friend of his and told both me and her that I was being a jerk for not going on a second date. And once for this ordeal.",45,129,0.9
438,Asshole,"Back in March, my best friend (BFF) started planning a trip to Costa Rica (CR) to celebrate her graduation in May. I asked BFF if my girlfriend\* (GF) could come. BFF said of course. When I told GF about the trip, she was really excited. BFF & I have been BFF for 3 years. 

\*I should say that GF & I are ‘just dating.’  We’re basically a couple & are exclusive. But neither of us has wanted to commit to the boyfriend/GF label. I call her GF here, but technically she isn't. We’ve been together 1 year.

&#x200B;

In mid-April, BFF told me she didn’t want GF to go on the trip anymore. I was devastated. I knew GF would not take it well. BFF cited GF’s indecisiveness & inability to go with the flow sometimes as reasons. I tried to talk BFF out of it, but it was no use. BFF also said she only wanted her closest friends on the trip. Since it was BFF’s graduation trip, & her parents gave her some money for it, it was hard to argue with BFF. The trip was now just: me, BFF,  BFF's boyfriend, and BFF's other close friend (a guy).

Now I should say that BFF is moving 4 states away soon for a job, so this will be like the ‘last hurrah’. 

When I told GF the bad news a few days later, GF was predictably really upset. GF asked if I was planning to go to CR without her, and I said that I wanted to.  (Thankfully, me & GF hadn't bought plane tickets yet). GF was teary-eyed and I could see how hurt she was. She asked for a few days apart to cool off, and we agreed to talk again then. 

Well, GF & I can hardly stand to be apart and we had lunch the next day. Things were kinda tense but she didn’t bring up the trip. A few days later, things seemed to be back to normal and I bought my tickets to CR.

&#x200B;

Then in May, right before the trip, it seemed like every little thing pissed GF off. She finally admitted:

(1) She was really hurt that I didn't stand up for her when BFF uninvited her. I told GF how much I tried to get BFF to change her mind but it didn’t matter.   GF thinks I should have been willing to not go since she couldn't go.

(2) She thinks the real reason she was uninvited is BFF has feelings for me. (BFF asked me out 2 years ago; I said no).  BFF is planning to break up with her boyfriend after the trip, and BFF sometimes criticizes her boyfriend to me, and GF said this was ‘proof’ BFF still likes me, and said I chose someone petty and manipulative over her. 

(3) She was mad that I bought my plane tickets without knowing she was ok with it.

&#x200B;

I wish I would have handled things better but I couldn’t do anything about it at that point. 

I'm in CR now and when GF & I talk on the phone, it’s clear GF is still so angry. I am trying to be understanding of her mood, but I think she’s being unreasonable for being this mad for this long, especially since she didn’t tell me how she felt until right before I left.  Also, I think it would have been unfair of GF to ask me not to go, since I will hardly get to see BFF once she moves.

439,Not the A-hole,"She loves tattoos and I knew that from the start of the relationship and I’m totally okay with it, I have nothing against it, many people from my family has it including my own brother, but the only place I asked where I would mind very much was on her hands, face and neck and she was totally okay with it and said she would never get any tattoos on those places.

So this week was my wife birthday and for her birthday present I gave her two tattoos that she wanted to get done, everything went okay she sent me the pictures of the both tattoos and they looked very good, but then she said: “I need to show you something” then sent a picture of her hand tattooed saying that the guy gave it for her for free.... When I saw the picture I went for being extremely happy for her to extremely mad at her! 

So ever since that happened we haven’t really spoked to much with each other and for me is being very hard to digest this.

I’m AITA here? I’m overreacting?

Edit: 

I think you guys are not getting why I’m mad, I know it’s her body and she can do whatever she wants to do with it and I will never stop her to do so.

I’m mad that we agreed in something and she purposely broke it and without asking me if I was ok with it. 

What good relationship is if we can’t keep a simple agreement? If she wanted to get tattoos on those place she should’ve just said that she wouldn’t agree with those terms.

Edit 2:

I mentioned this to her couple of times through the years and while she was getting it she knew I would lose my shit because of it. So yeah she was totally aware of it and how I would react to it.

442,Not the A-hole,"So my in laws got a dog from the shelter about a year and a half ago. It was very nervous around everyone but they still wanted it. The dog has warmed up to them but only them. She barks at everyone that enters the house and when they leave she runs up to the window and barks at them as they walk away.

So a couple of weeks ago we're there for Mother's day and the dog seems extra aggressive towards me, the dog has never liked me. We all had dinner in the backyard and as I'm walking inside the dog starts barking at me and charges me while my back is turned, while I'm sitting on the sofa she'll come out of the room see me and just start barking, something she's never done before.

443,Asshole,"Let's just start off by saying that I'm very thankful for the presents I received on my birthday and I'm absolutely not saying that I'm upset that I didn't receive enough value in gifts. What I am upset with is the reasoning my parents used to explain as to why they didn't gift me a car. 

This needs a little backstory, so my brother is 3 years older than me and when he was younger, younger than 18 that is, he didn't have a hobby, he didn't have a job, all he did after school was to sit at his computer all day and every day. He never showed any interest in anything except for his computer. So my parents didn't have to spend any money on his interests, as we had to pay for expensive items ourselves, such as headphones keyboards ect. 

Me on the other hand had a very expensive hobby, I had taken up horse riding at age 10 and continued with that for 8 years, once a week for 8 years. And that is expensive, especially when you were a growing kid that needed new riding clothes and shoes after a few years or so. 

So my parents only reasoning for not gifting me a car? That they had already spent a lot of money on me and that wasn't fair on my brother.

What? So not showing any interest in anything except your computer gets you rewarded with a car? Should I just have stayed in my room all day, every day? Would I have gotten a car then?

Because my brother was gifted a car on his birthday, all our relatives also assumed that I would gifted a car. So whenever we would meet up during the following months they would ask 'So, what type of car did you get for your birthday?' And I would have to explain over and over how I didn't get a car, they would look at me with a confused expression and say 'Why? I was certain you would get a car, your brother got one right?' I would explain why and every single time they would look over to my parents judging and then back to me and then change the topic.

Am I petty for being annoyed and upset about this situation?

EDIT: What I didn't mention was that my brother was given a complete computer setup for well over 1000$, he decided that some of it wasn't up to par and bought better stuff on his own violation. He didn't buy everything himself.

Most of my riding gear was given to me as birthday/Christmas presents, sometimes I would only be given, for example, riding boots as a present and nothing more, I was more than okay with that. One Christmas I was gifted nothing but a box of tiny Christmas tree decorations for my miniature tree in my room because I needed a new pair of pants and a shirt.

My brother was also given about twice as much in allowance every month than I was, because of my hobby. And the full amount of birthday gifts every birthday and Christmas. I willingly sacrificed this because I love horses and riding. 

On top of all of those things he was also gifted a car.",225,133,0.83
444,Asshole,"A few days ago my friend and I went out to dinner at a pub. She doesn’t drink, but doesn’t mind that I do, and I ended up having one too many and asked if she would drive my car that we came in back to her apartment we were both staying at that night. She agreed, and along the way she hit a pothole that busted my tire. 

At the time, I didn’t care whatsoever, seeing as I was drunk, and we both changed the tire having a grand old time and resumed home. She apologized profusely and I said it was okay, it was an accident of course. A tire isn’t the end of the world. At the time she didn’t offer to pay for a replacement, but I didn’t ask her to until the next morning. 

The next morning I was clear-headed, and brought it up to her. I said “hey, I know that was an accident, but I really don’t have the money to pay for a new tire right now” and offered to split it 50/50 with her, which I assumed was more than reasonable. She blew up at me, throwing the fact that I drank and asked her to drive in my face, and again that it was an accident, but it was my car. 

We kind of went back and forth but I wasn’t great at standing my ground, and at this point we aren’t speaking. I DO feel terrible that I drank and that’s why she was driving, but it was a complete anomaly, which is also a reason I feel that we should at least split it 50/50, because it wasn’t anybody’s true fault.

My boyfriend and I hopped in the shower together while no one was home, but when I got out of the bathroom, dad’s gf was home...

It was awkward, but since we didn’t do anything sexual in the shower I kind of just walked into my bf’s room and waited for him to finish.

She even called his dad about it, who didn’t seem to think it was a big deal. My boyfriend was really upset about it because she’s never acted like a parent before and she’s not his parent, so accusing him of something and lecturing him about it didn’t sit right with him.

457,Not the A-hole,"Im a male and my best friend is female. We have been friends for about a year and we used to talk every day and hang out multiple times a week. Few weeks ago in April, we both went to a mutual friends house for a small get together to watch GoT and eat crawfish.

We were both drinking that night as we usually do at these parties. I admittedly drank more than usual and took a short nap after the show ended. Once I woke up I wanted to get some fresh air and went upstairs to my friends balcony. My friend has a hammock up there so I laid down on it. My best friend came and sat down on the hammock with me. Since we were on a hammock, we were sitting in the middle together with our bodies touching. 

Her face was so close to mine that our noses were practically touching when she spoke to me. She told me how much she appreciates me and how glad she is that we met. I kissed her forehead and told her that I've always liked her and like to see her happy. We stared into each other's eyes and I leaned in for a kiss. We kissed for a few moments and when we stopped she got up and playfully slapped my chest and laughed. She told me to go back to dreaming and left to go downstairs.

We had a talk a few days later where I pretty much admitted my feelings for her. She told me she didn't feel the same and that when we kissed she thought we were just being drunk and having fun. She apologized for not liking me and I told her there was no need to apologise for feeling a certain way. No big deal, I'm an adult and although I was dissappointed she didn't have the same feelings for me, I was happy to still have her as a friend.

Since she apologized for not liking me back, I felt that I should show her that I wasn't mad or upset at her. I continued to text her and invite her out like I did in the past. She responded with short replies and always had an excuse for not being able to meet. Few weeks go by and I start contacting her less and less. 

This is where things get weird. After about 3 weeks she sends me a long text telling me how mad she is that I kissed her. She told me that I was very selfish and that she can't see us being friends anymore. She was really upset that I didn't apologise to her and that the way I've been acting since the kiss was very immature and selfish. She kept talking about how she's never viewed me as anything other than a friend and how stupid I was for putting her in an awkward and uncomfortable situation. 

I told her that I had no idea she felt that way and she never communicated any of that when she had plenty of opportunities to do just that. I told her that I thought we had a moment that night and didn't feel a need to apologise when we both kissed. In fact, I had no idea she thought that night was awkward or uncomfortable. I would have definitely apologized for putting her in an uncomfortable situation had I known or if she told me.

458,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I went on a tip/excursion that was advertised as ""Exiting/thrilling Activity A and Activity B"". That sounds like a ton of fun so we both sign up.

Bullet points of what happened:

* I asked the coordinator if there was a ATM on site. She said ""Yes"".

* I ask the next person where is the ATM? ""Oh sorry we dont have an ATM. If you want cash you can go to the gift shop and purchase a $10 item but pay $100 and get $90 change."" She said this with a smile on her face like she's doing us a favor. Fuck that. I dont want to buys some stupid bullshit I don't need just so I have change.  Plus I was told there is an ATM on site, i guess that was a lie.

* We go on Activity A and it fucking sucks. Exicity/Thrillling? NO! It's fucking boring as shit, moving 2mph while the guide makes dumb ass jokes along the way.

* After they have the balls to say ""Thanks for joining us we hope you had a great time.  Please tip our guides on the way out."" Tip for what, nothing happened. It was boring as fuck. So we didn't tip.

*  Next we wait for Activity B. I ask the attendant when activity b starts, ""Oh we'll make an announcement; go and enjoy lunch.""

* No announcement happens.  I walk around the compound to find the a gathering of people for Activity B (only about 1/3 of the group we came with). I found the same attendant from earlier and asked if this was a gathering for Activity B. Her response ""Yes, where ready to go."" So I ""was there an announcement?"". ""Oh sorry, our micorophe died."" What the fuck? 

* We barley make it to Activity B
.
* Activity A is closer to what was advertised except for the fact that they said 6 stations and in the end and we only experienced 4 stations. 

* During Activity B one of the guides touches my wife's gopro. At first we thought he was making sure it was facing forward at the right angle. But quickly it became clear that he stoped her recording and then restarted it twice (so 1 movie turned into 3). Again what the fuck? Why are you touching my wife's shit? Did she ask you? No, of course not. Do not touch our shit.

* We decided not top tip for Activity B either.

* As we wait for the bus to pick us up, the guide from Activity A sees me in the crowd and calls me out in front of everyone for not tipping. 

After all of that, I'm pissed. First off, half the activities sucked compared to advertised and on top of it you're going to try to shame me in to tipping. Fuck You.

So in the end we didn't tip anyone and honesty I feel good about it. However a few people in the group look at us like we're assholes. My wife felt very uncomfortable and I told her to ignore it. But after 20 min or so on the bus ride i started to realize people were disappointed with us for not tipping.

So i ask the internet. Are we the assholes for not tipping?",36,25,0.84

So I had an old RC sailboat frame that I was planning on fixing, that I put smeared sterno tabs in with a couple lady finger firecrackers in it for dazzle.

Get the phone out blast the boat with the Roman candle it sets off the sterno lined hull and some fire crackers pop boat sinks kid seems at ease. 
I show the video to my MIL and wife and they both went fucking ballistic. It was like I had shaved their hair off in there sleep or something. 
Anyway I apologize for the  grammatical errors, I'm on a mobile device and honestly hurt at the names I was called. I thought I was doing a good thing by helping my son cope.

Edit: MIL was upset that I didnt talk to her before hand so she could handle it in more of a religious manner.  (she's insanely entitled but I didnt want to have that fact effect my NTA or not). Wife is stressed at work with design deadlines for architecture and somethings that needed to be done around the house got put off for our ""adventure"".

Edit2: the boat was a small wooden frame with no plastic no motor no sails and was held together with pine resin similar to very old roofs. 
I assure everyone the amount of sterno used was burned off well before the boat sank.
Yes some paper from the fire crackers may have made it's way into the water.

If you're a senior and you want to buy the Chromebook to take to college with you or whatnot, it's 20 bucks. I had taken care of my chrome book all 4 years, until 2 weeks ago when a kid accidentally broke it. It was sitting on my desk, and he went to slide my Chromebook over, it was scooting very slowly, but then 2 of the 4 feet on the bottom went off the edge of the desk, losing half of its friction, and causing it to rocket off of the desk at Mach 5 Speeds. It then directly nailed the leg of another desk, causing the screen to crack slightly in the corner, but getting worse each time any amount of pressure was put on it (AKA opening and closing for normal usage) Now come the last day, the school is requiring me to either pay the 50$ to get it repaired or buy it, Am I the Asshole for asking this kid to pay the 20 dollars for the purchase, as it would be cheaper?

472,Asshole,"Background: my mom recently did one of those DNA family tests. She knew her dad had a secret past just after “the war”, and nobody really knew what it was because grandma kept quiet about it. The DNA test came back that my mom has a half sister, slightly older than her. My mom, for whatever reason, has been very accepting of her half sister- let’s call her Sheryl. My moms other (known, full) siblings have been standoffish at acknowledging Sheryl as a sister and refuse to meet her. Sheryl for sure got the rough end of the deal with a dad that left without notice and skipped out on child support payments. 

I live about 1K miles from my mom and other aunts/uncles. Sheryl has a daughter that lives in my city. My mom recently said she was coming to my city to visit “my aunt” and “my cousin”, and that I should meet them. I said “she’s not my aunt”. My mom insists this is rude and that aunt/uncle are terms of biology (which of course isn’t true). Looking for feedback on- should my whole family just accept Sheryl? Should I accept her as my “aunt”? Is anyone an asshole here (other than my deceased grandpa)?

475,No A-holes here,"My sister is a typical 21 year old party girl. Unbeknown to to the family (we only put the pieces of the puzzle together after her last accident) she had previously gotten into 2 accidents while driving drunk by hitting pillars and light posts, both times they were bad enough to puncture the tire and deform the wheel, both times she played it off like it was raining or she lost control of the car for another reason. Also relevant info: we're 5 siblings between the ages of 11 and 23, we're all studying and our parents pay for everything. We live a comfortable lifestyle, but there is always tension of financial worry hanging around.

&#x200B;

At 1 am on Tuesday, my parents get the call that she has been in an accident and is badly injured. She completely wrapped her car around a light post, utterly destroying it. The crash was with such force that the huge light post was completely flipped over, her headlight flew over 100 meters. By some miracle, the only damage was to her legs. She completely fractured and ripped every ligament in both of them, foot bent the other way, bones sticking out of her legs, it wasn't pretty. She has to undergo multiple surgeries, will spend over one month in the hospital, will have to do weeks and weeks of physiotherapy, probably won't walk for at least 6 months. She currently is in a lot of pain, constantly sedated, has to shit in a diaper, the whole shebang.

&#x200B;

The whole family has been alternating day and night to be by her side, they sit in plastic chairs for over 12 hours, my parents are completely emotionally drained, as is every one else. Everyone is sympathetic to her pain... except me. honestly, I feel so much anger and disgust towards her and I feel like she deserves every excruciating moment of hell she is going through. She already knew she had a problem, up to the point of crashing her car TWICE before this. How could you be so reckless with human life and just completely not give a shit at all? Her crash was estimated to happen at 150 km/h. She could have easily killed someone. It is a miracle she is even alive at all. Not to mention the enormous damage she has caused, my parents are going into debt over her treatment, we now only have 1 car to share between all 5 siblings in a city with horrible public transportation, honestly this whole thing is sucking so much money and time and everything out of everyone, because she was too stupid and selfish to learn from her mistakes.

476,Not the A-hole,"Hi all. 

It is my parents wedding anniversary on the weekend and they are having everybody over for a meal. However, I am strongly considering just my wife and myself going, and leaving my 21 year old daughter Emily behind. 

The reason for this is that my sister Sarah and her husband John will also be coming, as well as their 14 year old, Olivia. The last time they met Emily bullied Olivia and made a comment about her appearance that reduced her to tears. Ever since then Sarah and John have refused to be anywhere near Emily and don't want her near their daughter, which is understandable. 

My parents have insisted we sort this dispute out for ourselves, and I think it is fairest for everyone if Emily doesn't come. 

As for Emily herself, she has had a tough year. She experienced her first real breakup, and was kicked out of university for bad behaviour. She then got a job at a supermarket which she absolutely loathes. The first few weeks she came back crying every single day but is adapting slowly. She pays a bit of rent every week and is seeing a therapist, however, she is still smoking a lot of cannabis (another reason we don't want to take her to my parents as they would go ballistic if she had any on her in their home. 

Although she does enjoy spending time with her grandparents and even lived there earlier in the year, they also spoil her and she's guaranteed to get expensive gifts every time she goes there, such as clothes/shoes etc, and for this reason she started to cry when we told her we would not be taking her with us. 

My wife and I both agree that this is the right thing to do, as do Sarah and John, but I feel like we're being a bit too tough on Emily after all she has been through. Although I very much understand Sarah not wanting Emily near her daughter after what she said, Emily is in a very dark place right now and a fun day like this could really cheer her up.",161,374,0.94
477,Asshole,"My girlfriend of 7 years and I have been locked in something of an argument for 3 years or so now. In the first years of our relationship, our sex life was great, and mutually pleasurable. Then, my girlfriend found out she has a chronic disease which, among other things, makes sex incredibly painful. So we stopped having sex. This was about 3 years ago now. She has since had surgeries to fix the problem for a time, and sex can now be pleasurable for her again. However, since the surgery has healed and we can have sex again, we don't. She is never in the mood, and has shot me down almost constantly for 2 years. In that time, we have had sex on average once every two months. Recently, I have been feeling more and more frustrated by it, and bring it up every now and again. I will make jokes and bring it up often. She told me that she felt pressured, and I apologised. But the feelings of anger, hurt, and frustration are still there. Am I the Asshole for not being able to let this go? For reference, we are both in our mid-20's.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I can see now I have done some shitty things and forgot to consider her psychological state, which was incredibly inconsiderate and, for lack of a better term, assholish of me.

So the first time we show up, we get there an hour early and I am the first person standing in line. A couple minutes or so go by and a lady approaches me and says something to the effect of ""just so you know, you weren't here first. Other people were in there cars before you got here"". I am a little taken aback and say ""no, the line starts when someone starts standing in front of the building"". I was certain I was in the right and that this was just one odd lady and that nearly everyone would agree with me.

479,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit,

Longtime lurker, bear with me please!

Background: I speak French fluently because I went to French school (in the USA, 90% of the curriculum was exclusively in French) from PreK-12th grade. A lot of my friends are French, and to date we still speak in French when we get together(I'm in my late 20s for context). My parents, while not French, live in France, and I visit them at least once a year. I have French extended family. I watch French TV, read in French, and just generally have French stuff happening around me because it has been part of my life since I can remember.

I don't bring this up randomly to people, bc I think that would be kind of douchey to unnecessarily volunteer this info that is irrelevant to my day to day life. However, all my close friends know about my connection to French/France, and laugh at me when I get drunk and can't remember certain words in ENGLISH.

Onto the issue...this past Sunday, I met up with a new(ish) friend for dinner & drinks. Things were going fine, until she asked me what I had done that weekend, to which I replied ""I made crêpes for breakfast yesterday (Saturday)."" I pronounced the word ""crêpes"" the way I learned to say it and the way I routinely say it, which phonetically sounds kinda like ""cr-epp-s."" She proceeded to ask me what those were, and I told her they were French, thin pancakes that you can eat with butter and sugar (like I did) or with more elaborate fillings. 

She then went on to say, oh, do you mean, ""cray-ps?"" (in the typical American pronunciation.) I said yes, exactly! She looked super confused, then weirdly offended, and proceeded to ask me why I felt the ""need"" to sound so ""pretentious"" when talking about them. I replied saying I wasn't being pretentious, I was just pronouncing this food the way a) it is pronounced by the people who routinely make/eat it, b) the way I routinely say it, since I speak French. She then stated that I should be pronouncing French foods the ""American"" way when I speak about it in America, and not doing so is rude and stuck-up. I said I didn't agree, told her I've always pronounced it that way, then resumed our conversation. Dinner was a little awkward from there on out. 

Reddit, AITA? I don't feel like this is any different from a Polish-speaking person pronouncing pierogi in Polish, or a Spanish-speaking person pronouncing mole in Spanish. I would get it if I was pretending to sound like I knew the word, but I told her that I speak the damn language! I wouldn't be super bummed if this person didn't become a long-term friend, but I just feel weird about this whole situation.",550,846,0.93

I used to be really insecure when I was younger, and I self medicated by sleeping around because I liked feeling wanted. Surprise, surprise It didn’t help my self confidence at all and made me feel worse. 

Luckily, I don’t have have a lot of the Confidence issues I used to have. I was still really just starting to work on myself when I met my BF and he really showed me what a healthy relationship is supposed to be like.  He’s the first guy I’ve met who I feel loves me for me, and not just how I look and what they can get from me. I was very honest with him about my past and he was super supportive. We have had a pretty normal sex life the whole time we’ve been dating. This is my longest and healthiest relationship, and last year I realized that my past had really done damage to me. I didn’t want my past to continue to affect my present or future so  I started seeing a therapist to work out some of my issues. In therapy, I realized that I have always used my ability to please my partner in the bedroom as a yardstick for my worth in a relationship. Not how kind I am, not how well I treat them, nothing else. This was very unsettling to me. 

I decided a couple months ago that I wanted to TEMPORARILY explore a sex free relationship. I want to feel confident in my role as gf and as myself as a person on my own without relaying on my ability to please or obsessing about it. I want to make sure we are developing emotional intimacy without the physical side. Most importantly, I want to be confident that when we start back up having sex that I’m confident in myself.

Some of my friends, however, think I’m being disrespectful to him. After all, we spent over a year having a normal sex life and out of the blue I decide to put a pause to it. I’ve also heard that it’s fine if I want to be celibate but it’s selfish of me to force him into it when that wasn’t our original deal.

i (28F) and my ex-boyfriend (31M) 'Jack' have been broken up since August of 2016. the relationship was generally just garbage; he was mentally abusive, a hardcore alcoholic, encouraged me to develop an eating disorder, and a slew of other shitty behavior. even after three years together, Jack is not a person i had a hard time saying 'bye' to.
 
since breaking up, Jack has sent me several dozen texts all boiling down to 'go die, you slunt.' LG has a blocked box feature, so i don't get any notification but i can still view any texts recieved from blocked numbers. what can i say? morbid curiousity got the best of me. i've kept the texts as well, in case i feel the need to get a restraining order at some point.
 
Jack has also sent my current boyfriend (24M) 'Nate' a series of facebook messages telling him that i'm diseased and that he should break up with me for his own good. Nate has not responded or even reacted to anything, other than to show me the message request before screenshotting and deleting them. Jack has kinda been on the backburner for both of us for several months now.
 
here's where the AITA comes in. last week, i ran into an old mutual friend of mine and Jack's, and found out that Jack is dying of a terminal illness (i don't want to say what, this is already really specific and i don't want him to find me here too). basically, he'll be lucky if he makes it to Christmas. i mentioned Jack's illness to my family, who are all very aware of what he put me through, and they said i should try to forgive him while he's on his deathbed. i told them that he was an prick before all this, now he's just a prick who happens to be dying. that kind of ruined dinner conversation that night, so i left without bringing it up again. when i got home, i checked my blocked box and saw Jack had texted me almost two months ago saying he was sorry and that he really needed someone to talk to. i haven't told Nate any of this yet, as i haven't really figured out what to do.
 
  
so, TL;DR: this guy did nothing but make me crazy and miserable for years, and is now dying and asking for forgiveness. AITA for wanting to continue my life happily now that he's finally out of it? or should i suck it up and fake forgive him before he croaks?",74,103,0.93

488,Not the A-hole,"  

Hi all. I’m an 18-year old student who’s currently studying and in the process of completing my final exams. Unfortunately, I have not been able to work at peak performance for these exams due to the situation that I have partly put myself in. The situation is that I have become a major guardian for my 9-year old niece. I have had to sacrifice a lot of my time in order to take care of her. I have also had to suffer a lot of situations where I have been shouted at and insulted after trying to defend my niece.

The parent of my niece (my sister) flew back to her home country after having an argument with my dad. I recall having to wrestle a knife out of her hands after arguing with my other sister as well. I also remember having nightmares and panic attacks after the incident. I believe that incident happened early last year. The niece has since been at my parent’s house, whilst her mum has been away. 

Throughout this academic year, I have been the main person that has been signing my niece up to after-school clubs, picking her up from school, having meetings with teachers, and making her lunch. I have also been the person who she talks to about any concerns she has in school or at home. Whenever she was crying, I have been the one there to comfort her and ensure that everything’s alright (neither her grandmother nor her aunt seem to care). I have been the one to make sure she gets home on time and I have had multiple occasions where I had to run from my school to hers so that I can pick her up on time – even though other people were available at the time. I have had to miss on after-school revision sessions just to pick her up from school.

Early this year, me and my sister had an argument. This argument started when my niece was crying. My sister told her to decide what food she wanted, and because my niece did not want her food, she began shouting at her. I left my bedroom and told my sister that I’ll make her food (which my niece wanted). This caused my sister to get mad at me and she started shouting at me. She got up to my face, screaming at the top of her lungs, calling me a bitch and insulting me. She said that she’d “call the police on me” for assaulting her – when all I did was stand between her and my niece. I told her to call the police then, as I had recorded the entire exchange on my phone. She promptly left the house and came back with her boyfriend, slamming my bedroom door. I told my mum and dad (who were on holiday at the time) and showed them the video. They proceeded to do nothing about it ultimately.

It just seems like I’m the only one who gives a damn about my niece ultimately. My dad told me that I should not “act like a dad” to her, but am I just suppose to ignore her whenever she has issues like everyone else? It just seems like I either take care of my niece and have my mental health and deteriorate, or give up on taking care her and let her fend for herself. AITA?",17,63,0.94

After she told me it was a joke, I was upset, or rather, disturbed as to why and how someone can joke about something that would seriously affect my life.

I actually did great in high school because I took basically the easiest classes there, and got a scholarship for a local school. I also live in Georgia, so that (mixed with HOPE scholarship) made it so I got to go to school for absolutely free. 

Well I did one semester before realizing that’s NOT what I want to do. I didn’t do so hot my first semester, and just dropped out. They weren’t paying any of it so they had no idea. I just told them I’m doing online school now and they never really questioned it. 

Well during that semester off, I got really into camming. It started off as just a little exhibition on gonewild, but it quickly turned into more. I made almost $10,000, after taxes, in the last 3 months, just by selling pictures, videos, cam shows, and (virtual) sugar daddy relationships/girlfriend-experience relationships. I decided I want to do this for the next 3 or so years while my parents think I’m in school, build a nice comfortable safety net for my future, then tell the truth.

The young lady from this morning was largely voted NTA for telling her parents about her sister's binge eating. I am literally doing the opposite with my wife. 

My wife is very obese and is starting to suffer the common health ailments that go along with obesity. I am still very attracted to her and I admit, I think she looks great as she always has. But her last physical her doctor showed her a chart of how her obesity is affecting her health and her life span and though I don't know the exact numbers, I think he told her that women with her BMI rarely live past 65 and have a very low quality of life starting at 50 (again I don't remember the exact numbers or prognosis but it was along those lines). She met with a nutritionist (or the good kind, the certified kind...a dietician?) and they set her up on a whole new lifestyle to get her on the right track. 

However I found a huge stock of candy in her sewing closet. I also know that she's eating it because the candy has been seasonal (as in valentines, then Easter, girl scout cookies). It's a 25 gallon Rubbermaid bin so it means she's going through that much candy between refilling it, at least at the next ""season.""  It is also taking her much longer to get home from work and I'm seeing ATM withdrawals when I am pretty sure she doesn't need cash so I'm almost positive she is getting fast food on the way home. 

I have some proof that she's binge eating with the bin, I have some strong anecdotal evidence she's binge eating with the money and time to get home. My reasoning is I don't want to make her feel bad but at least she's trying to follow her new meal plan in front of us. And maybe it will eventually catch on. 

But based on that other post from this morning, maybe I'm doing it wrong? Am I the asshole here?",85,277,0.95
492,Asshole,"Hello Reddit!

Obligatory sorry for formatting/errors, I'm on mobile.

Edit: more info in comments about the situation. Off break so I wont be able to message more. Basically laid out the entire parking diabolical in my comments adding info. I'll be back later for voting final. Thanks for all your perspectives so far. It's an interesting worm hole hearing all the parking issues people have.

Original:


Long time lurker on this sub and this week I ran into a situation that I felt I should ask here for perspective. My neighbor called me an asshole and I wonder if its justified.

My apartment is a 4 unit apartment 2 story front building 2 upstairs above the garages apartments in the back with 4 parking spaces in between the 2 buildings. 1 of those spots is 'my spot' in front of my garage. You access the parking lot through a narrow side driveway and for the most part it's amazing to have a parking spot but sometimes a hassle to get in and out. I like to also keep the spot clear on occasion because when I open my garage we sit out there with a fire bowl and barbecue, put a table up, let my 16 month old son run around in the back lot, and generally just enjoy ourselves with a bit of extra space. It's also easier for me to park in front of the building if I know I'm leaving later that day or if I want to go through some stuff in my garage and pull out boxes.

My neighbor, we shall call R, saw me parking my car in front of our apartment on the public surface street. Now R has 2 cars, our neighbors have 4, other neighbors have 2 and 5, and we live next to a busy high school in the city. I currently only have 1 car so its flexible as to where I feel I can park. So, R while walking her dogs comes over and says, hey, why arent you parking in your spot? I tell her that it's easier for me to park in front sometimes. She proceeds to complain about how there is never parking on the surface streets (to be fair it's pretty jammed but often times there are spots relatively close to the house or in front if it's not street sweeping days or school event nights) She tells me that I should ALWAYS park in my spot and that I'm an asshole for not considering other peoples parking needs because of their number of cars.

This is where I said, there was a spot in front and its public parking so i dont feel it's my problem if they cant find a spot. R says well, you're being an asshole.

Now I'm wondering if I actually did something wrong and broke some kind of parking etiquette. Reddit, am I justified in parking in front when I feel its convenient for me if theres a spot open even though I have a reserved parking spot in back? AITA for not ALWAYS parking in my spot?

Thank you for you vote and perspective!",132,129,0.93

495,Not the A-hole,"I live in the western US. I was offered a short term job of a year in Europe and it sounded like fun so I agreed. Before agreeing I asked a friend if he would be interested in house and cat sitting while I was gone. I asked friend when I first applied for the job a year in advance and then confirmed 6 months before leaving the country. 

Friend was living in Iowa and hating life. Friend is a single male with no attachments and the kind of job where he is away from home 20-25 days out of the month. He also has the kind of work experience where he can be fired at 8 am and have a new job in his field by 8 pm. I've seen him do it. But he hates his work and has wanted a 9-5 for years. 

The plan was friend would move to my house and take advantage of our booming economy to find something more stable than his current line of work. He agreed to pay the bills and we even discussed switching power and internet into his name. I thought this was a good opportunity for both of us. 

Before moving friend bought a brand new 30k truck with no job lined up. I'm now 9 months into the year and he has gone through 4 different jobs. Because he's been having such a hard time I have paid the mortgage 5 out of the 9 months. He never made the effort to switch the power or internet so I've been paying that as well. He also has had power bills that were twice mine and when I've asked about it he says he doesn't know why it's high. He is constantly late on his truck and student loan payments.

At this point I've spent over $5k on mortgage, power, and internet for a house I'm not living in. Ive asked to cut the contract I have in europe short by 2 months so I can go home and at least stop the financial bleeding. I want to ask him to reimburse me some of the money as I feel like this wasn't the agreement but I also feel like he did me the favor of house sitting and maybe I should just let it go. The job in Europe is enough to pay my bills here but not support two households so I've been paying the 5k out of savings. WIBTA if I asked him to pay me back?",29,67,0.93
496,Asshole,"Context: A couple of months ago, my sibling cut me off claiming I was overbearing and have been treating them like a child. Apparently this had been a problem for years, but my sibling never said a word. (Which is I guess understandable, you don't tell this kind of truth to someone you perceive as overbearing!) 

The email in which my sibling cut me off said: *OMG stop fucking bugging me with your invitations to hang out, you have no idea how stressed I am about my job ending and my visa expiring* [&lt;---- note, this part is important] *and also my friend's friend died, and last year was such a nightmare for me, and I'm too busy, and you keep asking to see me. Who do you think you are?*

This email sounded absolutely ridiculous to me, since I only ever invite my sibling to hang out once every few months, and certainly don't make it any kind of obligation. But whatever, NC is NC, and I don't get to argue! I backed off and cried to my therapist instead. I did send short and neutral birthday greetings (no response, who cares) and a heads-up that my young kids independently wanted to email them (no response to my kids either, and I care but didn't say anything).

---------  

Cut to yesterday. 

ME: Hey I just got an email from my manager saying they are actively recruiting for multiple roles in your area and are willing to sponsor visas. See [link] and here's the [contact] if you find anything of interest. 

SIBLING: Stop trying to run my life. Stay out of my business. 

ME: Jeez, give it a rest. This was common courtesy. I know you're stressed about your job/visa situation, which is a serious matter, so I did the basic human thing. It's like if I saw you lying hurt on the side of the road, I'd stop to ask if you want help. I even specifically noted you don't have to go through me, just apply directly to the [manager]. This is how adults behave, FYI. 

SIBLING: Typical. You treat me like a child and you aren't respecting my boundaries. You really think a lot of yourself don't you.

ME: LOL somehow that sort of barb doesn't sting as much as when we were kids.

-------------------------

I just couldn't fucking resist needling my sibling right on the sore spot of ""treating them like a child"", but in my defense, I have taken the high road at every prior turn in this (imo) asinine conflict. Yesterday's exchange was the last straw. 

AITA here?


Edit 1: 

Consolidating some extra info I've shared below. 

# Why was I cut off? 

Man I don't even know. This was literally the exchange that got me cut off, verbatim:

ME: hey the kids are asking to meet up and I'd love to see you too! What weekend are you free in the coming two months or so? 

SIB: can't

ME: aww, that's disappointing, how come? Well, you tell me when you *can* make it happen and we can do it then

SIB: [ghosts me for a month] 

ME: okay it's been a month and you didn't respond, looks like you need distance, lmk if you want me to mail you the stuff you have left at my place

SIB: [fucking insane email saying that ""aww that's disappointing""  is passive aggressive, ""tell me when you *can* make it happen"" is me controlling/""managing"" them, and I've been pressuring them to meet way too often, wtf, they just saw me three months ago, and also they know I've secretly been mad at them for years underneath my cheerful exterior, they are tired of my simmering anger, etc.] 

This is truly and genuinely it. Nothing else happened. It was ... quite a shock. To say the least.

As for a history of abuse, hell yes!


Mom has BPD. Dad was maybe kind of narcissistic? Idk. Definitely disinterested at best and controlling/abusive at worst. There was childhood abuse from both parents, a ton of it, for both of us. Plus dad used to hit mom and me. 

Mom set us siblings against each other a lot. I was mom's fave at first, held up as the example to live up to, and sibling super disparaged. But the tables turned by the time sib was 10. My sibling was mom's ally made to spy on me all through my teens and gather ""evidence"" (secretly dating, bad uni grades) which got me kicked out of home and cut off. 

After I got thrown out, sib was stuck playing the role I used to play as mom's caretaker/confidante. By sib's own admission, sib was very very influenced by mom in a way that I was able to avoid. 

Finally sib got free when they moved away for grad school and immediately went NC with parents. I had been VVVLC with parents for a long time, still am. 

After they went NC, sib and I began to build an independent adult relationship very painstakingly. It was going well, they married a wonderful person and my kids + SO and I were the only ones at their wedding, I went through a divorce and they were my rock, my kids loved them and they loved my kids... 

We would meet 2-3 times a year and we had good times together. OR so I thought until this explosion which revealed that they have always felt pressured or bullied or controlled when I asked to hang out (once every few months) or even when I suggested literally anything at all which they didn't like (which I was expected to magically mindread?). Like I said,  I don't even know, man.

# Examples of my overbearing behavior according to sibling:


 My sibling claims I ""always"" act like they're a child, but imo that's ... distorted, at least from all the examples they gave me, which are: 

- I constantly want to see them, which pulls them away from their marriage and their career. (Incomprehensible. I've never asked them to take time away from work and their spouse has always been invited, not to mention I only suggest meeting once every few months.)

- The last time they came over to see me, I suggested alternate travel arrangements, which was controlling and high handed of me. (It was just a suggestion which I thought might be more convenient for them. They didn't take it. I didn't mention it after they declined.)

- Eight years ago, when I had just had a baby, I asked them over and over again to visit me to meet the new baby, which was bullying. (I did ask several times to visit the baby. But note that my sibling never did visit for over a year after that, and I never gave that a second thought, let alone hold it against them.)



And fwiw I had no inkling of any of these issues they had with me until that crazy email. Never brought up before, always had a great time together. Even my sibling doesn't claim to have ever told me anything other than sometimes declining my invitations.",50,45,0.82
497,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. It's a bit long so bear with me. 

Backstory: I'm in Uni about 2hrs away from home. About 2 weeks ago I get a call from mum telling me that I need to host the Daughter of friend of hers for 3 days because she has to attend a Seminar in the Town I stay. I agree coz it's only 3 days. 

She came the following day and the 1st thing she tells me is that it wasn't a seminar but a 3week short course. I call my mum who tells me that I can't kick her out since she had nowhere else to go. That was the beginning of the most infuriating 2 weeks of my life. 

I don't know whether she thought she was staying at a hotel but omg she was the most entitled person I had ever met. All she ever did was either go out to her classes or sit in front of the TV watching Netflix on MY WiFi and Account. I cleaned the house, washed the dishes, cooked the food, bought groceries etc but she never even tried to offer to help. I swear, she would just sit there and watch me do all that shit like I was her fucking Maid. I mean, she never even thought of buying any groceries.  I don't know where she thought all that food she was eating was coming from . Maybe I was raised differently but I think it's common fucking courtesy to at least buy a loaf of bread when you are a guest in someone's house. 

I was done with her BS after day one.The only thing holding me back was that my mum would be pretty disappointed if I kicked her out. But it all came to a boiling point Saturday morning. 

So she didn't come to the apartment on Friday . I was really panicked and called her a few times but she didn't pick up. I called my mum who found out that she had decided to go home for a few days. I was angry . She didn't even have the courtesy to inform me that she was leaving. 
Saturday morning, I wake up to a text from her saying "" Hey. I've gone home. I'll be back on Monday. Please don't touch my stuff"". I was enraged, fucking livid. WTF! Did she think she was staying at some fucking hotel where she can come and go as she please. And to tell me not to touch her stuff like I was some creep who would go looking through her stuff. I was Done!  I called her and told her that I didn't want to see her and not to bother coming back to my apartment. I was done with her shit. 

It has been a few days and I've been getting texts and calls from her and her mum begging me to let her stay with me since she only has a week of classes left and that I was being very cold-hearted in not letting her stay with me. My mum understands where I am coming from but thinks that I should have let her stay with me for the few days she had left of classes. All my friends are saying that I could have held on and that I was an Asshole for kicking her out just like that. I heard that she's staying at a hotel nearby and that it's pretty expensive hence why she's trying to get me to let her stay with me.  So, internet strangers, AITA?",24,33,0.94

505,Not the A-hole,"The apartment upstairs from us had been vacant for a few months, but a month ago a family with two young children (1-3yr old) moved in.

I work from home a few days a week and my wife works very early hours and often goes to bed around 9pm and wakes up at 4am, so we both like having a quiet home.

Well... the kids upstairs run back and forth, the entire length of the apartment, pretty much all day until 10pm. At first I thought it was a large dog and then later realized it was two kids. My wife and I have gone up there 4 times when the kids were running so hard that it was shaking pictures on the walls and making glass bottles in my kitchen shake.

Mom is at home with them during the day and doesn't really speak any English. Husband comes home around 5pm and speaks enough English to communicate. They both kept repeating ""they are kids, what do you expect us to do?"" My wife and I said that because we live in an apartment, you need to teach your kids to be respectful of neighbors and we recommended for them to get some rugs.

Last night the kids were loud again and since my wife and I are tired of going up there, we called the landlord. Our very strict landlord told us they didn't mention any kids when they moved in and they could be in violation of their lease and could potentially face eviction.

Now I feel bad for getting a family with two young kids in trouble. AITA?

tl;dr: Called the landlord on the family upstairs who has two kids. The landlord said they could be violating the lease and may face eviction.

Edit: So my landlord called me and told me he talked to the family. I guess they speak English well enough with him?!? It’s interesting because it’s been very quiet up there all day, so I guess it is possible to quiet your kids down. The landlord also told me that the 1st floor apartment is becoming vacant soon and he will encourage the family to move in there. The landlord told me that this building used to have a lot of terrible tenants and gang activity, so the landlord really stresses having a quiet and peaceful building now.",440,1352,0.96

She's still in rehab and we take care of the kids. We absolutely love them. 

Now her boyfriend decided that he wants to be a part of the kids life and wants to be with my daughter again. And to our horror, my daughter is actually considering moving in with him. We told her that we don't think that's a good idea because he's not sober. And I don't think the children will be in a safe environment. 

So my husband and I kind of gave her an ultimatum. I told her that I'll report her to the CPS of she moves in with him. Now she accuses us of controlling her, blackmailing her. We love our daughter very much but I don't think I'm being unfair here. AITA?",411,3330,0.97

 Letting her take over the finances was a struggle for me because before we combined banks I was (still am) very frugal and made sure any credit charges were paid off immediately. She tends to let the credit card  debt build up, get a couple thousand dollars on there, and then we live tight for a few months to pay it off and the cycle repeats. 

I've tried getting involved here and there in the past but the pushback I get caused me to drop the issues and bite my tongue. 

Lately the credit card debt is higher than normal and we just moved into a house (mortgage is 30% of our income). I'm pushing to make a budget and limit our credit card spending, suggesting it gives us too much buyer confidence. I received the same pushback but didn't let up this time because I believe its justified. 

She is upset at me for suggesting she's bad at managing money and she reminds me she always get everything paid on time and we always have food in the fridge. She's not wrong there, again, I think we can do better. But now she's saying if I think she's so bad at it then she'll let me do it. I've told her I'd like to tackle this together rather have it be my way or her way. There has to be a compromise. But she believes I'm criticizing her money managing strategy.

510,Asshole,"I just wanted some perspective because some people in my life think I'm being unfair.

Leah and I have been best friends since high school. We never dated or hooked up. She has a 12yo daughter Ashley. Leah and her husband got divorced when Ash was 2months old. Leah was actually married to one of our mutual friends. He was a great guy. She cheated on him and Ashley turned out to be the affair partners daughter. So he left her. And she got almost nothing in the divorce. So back then, I let her live in a place I owned. She still lives there. 

I don't condone the cheating or sympathise with her, but I did what I did for her daughter. My daughter and Ashley go to the same school and they are very close. So, whenever I take my daughter out somewhere, Ash comes too. We have them over at weekends and I'm really fond of her.

Now my wife doesn't like the interaction. She thinks Leah is mooching off of us, because I don't charge her any rent. Leah is a waitress and she doesn't make much. She can never afford the place. I own my family business and I can say that we are affluent. I think it's a good gesture. Also, she's my friend. I can do that for her. 

But recently, at a family dinner, Ashley just told me that she wished I was her dad. This pissed off my wife. And I'm unable to deal with the issues at home. I feel like my marriage is falling apart and I can't afford that. I love my wife. So I stopped visiting her and contacting her.

511,No A-holes here,"So for a little background, my parents, my sister, and all my relatives are all very religious Hindus. All of them go to temples every week and pray. All the kids in my generation are Hindu and listen to their parents for everything

Since I was a young kid, I’ve always been the rebellious kid. I’m atheist and I’m also a biker while everyone else in my family drives cars. Anyway, my relatives and my family are all assuming I’m still a “good” child and will listen to them. They assumed I would get an arranged marriage like all of them and become Hindu again. It’s clear that’s never going to happen, but I haven’t ever verbalized it because I’m 17 and still dependent on them.

I have sex frequently and lost my virginity about 5 years ago. My parents had no idea, and recently found out about this, which led to the biggest fight I’ve ever had with them(and we’ve had a lot of fights). Being the devout Hindus they are, they thought I would only have sec after marriage and only to produce kids. I for sure don’t want to get married( especially not anyone they choose) and sure as hell don’t want kids. 

They started ranting about how I’m a curse and all they wanted was a good kid who listened to them. They started talking about plans they and the rest of my family had for me(why tf are my relatives in this?).  They were basically complaining about how different I was from the rest of them and I had no respect for family or culture. The rest of my family are fat diabetics who eat out almost every day and couldn’t run a couple minutes without passing out. I workout almost everyday and eat junk food in moderation(one of the reasons I dislike visiting my relatives, they try to get me to eat a whole lot of junk food). I’m rather proud of my body and get complements on it frequently in the gym and everywhere else. I have no intention of being anything like them and plan to limit relations extremely when I go off to college next year.

They complained about how moving to America was the worst decision they ever made, and had I been raised in India, I would have grown up right. That really irked me. Them moving to America was a stroke of luck that made me who I am. I basically blew up at them and said to screw off, im far better off then they would ever be, and that I have no intention of being like them or listening to them for anything in my life. I’ve put up with that crap for far too long and I was done with it. I then stormed out. I took my motorcycle off to a park to meet up with some friends and blow off some steam.

My friends all have sex whenever they want and are allowed to make their own choices by their parents. I would rather die than let my parents have control of any major decisions that impact me.

AITA for what I did and said?

Edit: while I did lose my virginity at 12, it was only the one time. I only started becoming sexually active at 14

Edit #2: the vote seem to be split between NTA for yelling at them for being my own person, but YTA for losing my virginity at 12. Yes I agree it was dumb and stupid to do it at 12, but I was really dumb and stupid back then. I’m more responsible now than I was back then.

512,Not the A-hole,"I have a character limit, so I’m going to try to keep this as concise as possible. Basically, the night of our wedding day (yesterday), my wife came to me crying. For reference, we’ve been together for 3 years and our engagement was a year.

Basically, from age 16 to 20, my wife was in an abusive relationship by the hands of a “boyfriend” (a 25-year old predator). I can’t describe the extent of it because of the automod filter, but just assume it was *really* bad. She was threatened, intimidated, blackmailed, along with other really, really bad things. She told me all of this while crying last night. We were abstinent throughout dating, and she admitted to me that she doesn’t think sex or ANY sexual contact is on the table, nor will it be for a long time. She said she’s tried therapy but it didn’t seem to work, so she’s just been living with this demon for all of this time.

Here’s the thing; I didn’t sign up for this. I’m a very sexual person (yes, despite waiting nearly 3 years to get any). The thought of sex being off the table indefinitely scares the hell out of me.  In addition, I just feel betrayed. She didn’t tell me ANY of this throughout dating; not even a hint. I’m just thinking; shouldn’t this be a thing you tell your supposed love of your life **before** you’re married? Especially if it’s going to continue to cause issues in the future?

I didn’t bring up annulment to her, but I would be lying if I said it wasn’t weighing on my mind. I feel like I don’t even know her anymore. Who is the person I married? Does she have anything else she’s hiding from me? How long will I have to wait until I can make love to my own wife; or will I just be in a dead bedroom situation for the rest of my life? I feel like if I wait and get a divorce instead, it will be MUCH more costly (she doesn’t work at all, and I pay for everything).

I’m terrified of going to my close family and friends. She knows I’ve been acting distant since she’s told me, and I haven’t found a way to bring it up. AITA? Am I right to feel betrayed?

---

EDIT: The reason she told me during the day of the actual wedding, because sex was obviously on the table because we were now married, and she felt like she couldn't do it. Before then, she never really had a need to justify why she didn't want to have sex

---

**UPDATE**: So I decided I needed it to talk to her. I broached the subject gently. I told her I understood that it was a deeply personal, painful thing that's happened to her, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel betrayed that she didn't tell me until after the marriage. She started crying again and said she's sorry, she didn't me to think she's broken and that she didn't mean to betray me. That she knew sex was important and she felt like after the trust and commitment that goes into a marriage, she convinced herself she would be okay after the marriage before realizing she's not. She already booked multiple different therapists appointment since our talked and she **begged** me not to leave.

I told her that I didn't want to leave her, but I was considering getting an annulment. I by no means want to break up, but I think it would be best to work on this issue before we're married. She broke down some more and started bawling. She begged me to not give up on her and that she loved me. I tried to tell her I wasn't giving up on her; I love her, but she needs to realize what she did was a serious betrayal. She just couldn't stop crying and told me that she knows and that she didn't mean to hurt me and that she's sorry and to please don't leave her. She said she's ready now and that we can have sex and it's not that big a deal. She even started coming on to me and touching me and insisted that it was okay. I told her I couldn't and that I was going to take a walk and she started crying some more. 

I'm walking now. Obviously she's not really ready and she's only saying it to save the marriage and at this point I just don't know what to do...

---

**LAST UPDATE. PLEASE READ**

Sorry for the late update. So after the last one, she texted me. She told me she didn't realize sex was so important to me, and that she's willing to give it a shot. She's learned this ""disassociation"" trick when her abuse was at an all time high, where she's able to completely disassociate from the situation. She says that if she wants her to be an active participant, it will take some time, but she would rather just disassociate in the meantime than risk annulling the wedding.

Well I know Reddit's filled with the overly hivemind-y ""she's trying to trap you"" BS, but that pretty much solidified that it's complete crap. *She would rather endure a painful and traumatic experience over and over again than risk losing me*. I decided to say to hell what the annulment. I love this person, and I'm going to try to make it work.

515,No A-holes here,"My wife and I are expecting a daughter. My wife is half Japanese half African American. However her Japanese side is like 3rd generation Japanese. She does not speak Japanese and she’s never been to Japan. I say this not to negate her being Japanese was but just to establish she’s more American than anything.

So she recently started taking Japanese lessons and she’s suddenly decided that she wants to give our daughter a Japanese name. Her top choices are Kokoro or  Sakura. Now I have no problem with these names but I genuinely don’t think we should give our daughter a Japanese name. Neither of us know much about Japan and I personally think it would be odd to give our daughter, who most people would not even perceive as Asian such a Japanese name.i tried to compromise and say we can give her a Japanese middle name but she doesn’t think that’s fair. She thinks I’m being racist or prejudiced or whatever but I really don’t think I am and that my logic makes sense.

516,Not enough info,"My MIL is in her early 60’s and as far as I’m concerned doesn’t have a memory issue. She and I are working at reconciling our relationship after some explosive wedding drama last year, caused by her. Pretty much we’re playing nice for the sake of my husband. At this point we are cordial, and I only speak to her when the social setting calls for it. She’s a serial caller and one of those people who will ring you repeatedly until you answer and has the time of the day to leave you 12 missed calls. 

Recently I started picking up her calls again, though I find that our conversations lack substance. For example, she would ask the same questions repeatedly, daily, even if my answer is the same every time. For example:

MIL: Are you at work?
Me: Yes, I work office hours and then some. I can’t really take personal calls.
MIL: *I just wanted to tell you about this trivial thing that crossed my mind* Goes off tangent for 20 minutes, ignores my attempts to end the conversation.

*Next call 3 hours later*

MIL: So you’re at work huh?
Me: Yes.
MIL: *Hey so I wanted to tell you about a random non important thing that I already discussed in our call earlier*

Rinse and repeat the next few days. Usually, I either listen quietly or try to cut the call short by giving excuses. Unfortunately this morning I was hungry and the lack of food can sometimes make my fuse shorter than I expect, so I snapped at her. I reminded her that I’ve already answered her questions repeatedly for the past few days. She got off the phone fairly quickly after and hasn’t called me since.

I feel bad because sometimes I think she’s just trying to make conversation, but then I also don’t feel bad because I get an inkling that she’s doing it just to see how far up the wall she can drive me.

AITA for not wanting to have pointless conversations with my MIL?",49,213,0.96

We invited him to join in our friends GOT viewing parties and I'd bake and do snacks until he starts taking over that. I like to study in our sitting room as to help offset my anxiety and cause I share a room with my bf who works nights so my bedroom is dark until about 4pm every day and he's started taking over my spot.

To keep it brief, I'm a single dad. Idk what I allowed to say here per the rules, but let's just say my kids mum isn't at all a fit mother and I have full custody. I'm pretty young (23, kid is 5) but I really think becoming a parent was the best thing that's happened to me and I wouldn't change a thing. I'm *happy* being a single parent. 

My brother and, especially, his wife don't seem to grasp this. Since I took full custody she's been asking me non-stop when I'm going to ""get back out there"" and trying to set me up with her friends. I've told her multiple times that I'm not interested in dating again right now, and have given her my whole list of reasons as to why. To begin with she countered them with ""oh but you're so young, you should date while you can!!"" type bullshit. Then she started telling me I was selfish and that I'm depriving my kid of a stable two-parent home for my own ""bullshit reasons"". That, I took offence to, because I provide a stable home for my kid by myself and don't need another person to be able to do that.

Anyway, things peaked last month when I found out my sister in law had been signing me up for dating sites and talking to people on my behalf and trying to set up dates. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me, and I kinda flipped out and called my brother and told him that I think his wife is an inconsiderate bitch, that she needs to learn some respect for other people and that I don't want her around me or my kid again for the foreseeable future. He told me that I'm being selfish, she's just trying to help me be a better parent, and that I'm ungrateful. It ended in us basically having a shouting match on the phone and we haven't spoken since.

This is something I think about all the time, and I can’t figure out if it’s morally just for the mother to keep this from her son. Because Reddit has a lot of autistic/aspergers users, I want the community’s opinion on the situation from their side. 

My grandparents used to live next to a very kind family. They had a son about 19 years old. He was very shy, quiet and very nice. 

My grandmother told me that his mother confessed his specialists gave him an official aspergers diagnosis, but she had no intention of telling him, because she wanted him to live a “normal life” and not risk him using the diagnosis as an excuse to change that. 

Personally, when I got my own diagnoses (depression, bipolar II) around his age, I was somewhat relieved to know I wasn’t alone and had understanding as to why my brain wasn’t working right. It allowed me to develop a treatment plan and get back on course. Without that I’d probably be dead by now. 

I know her intentions are good and she’s trying to do what she thinks is best for her son. But I don’t know the future ramifications of her choice, how it would affect the guy in the future, if it’s fair to keep his mental condition secret from him...

542,Not the A-hole,"I’m not sure this is the right board, but here goes: I (m28) have a small horticultural business, which I have put my heart and soul into. About a year ago I hired a guy (m22) and have always, always been really lenient with taking time off with notice. I’ve given him time off to go to music festivals, celebrate birthdays, watch GOT - you name it. Albeit I benefited from some of this time off, also. He also enjoyed a week off recently when I took my first (7 day) holiday in 4 years.

He's paid above award rate, and always is looked after when times are tough. Upon hiring him, he told me that he would be getting a drivers licence in the coming months. This did not, and has not happened despite me pestering him constantly. 

Recently, I had to lay off our apprentice after being stung by a bad client to get the business out of hot water. I kept this guy because he was reliable and honest. As we are still coming up out of hot water at the moment, he knows that it’s imperative we work as much as we can when it’s there (approx 30 hours a week for him.. at most).

It was his girlfriends 21st birthday over the weekend and he had asked to have the Monday off ages ago, so I obliged. Prior to the weekend, I had paid him his last fortnight’s earnings (Approx $1000). He knows well that I’m doing it pretty rough at the moment, but had the knack to ask for more as he had rent coming up as he was broke after partying all weekend. I said no and copped salt from him because of it.

Fast forward to yesterday (Tuesday). He comes in to work saying that his dads dog was attacked on Monday night by a group of strays at the park and that “he needs to take time off to look after it”. I told him that he could take days off from Friday until next Wednesday, under the condition that he stayed with me until Thursday afternoon. This is because we have 3 big days of tree work, which pays very well. He was pretty ho-hum about it but agreed at the time.

He then brought it up later that he has to look after the dog because his dad can’t, which I responded with my original compromise again. He kept pushing the idea that we should just postpone the work.

Tonight, after I confirmed tomorrow’s works with one of our big commercial clients. He messages me saying that he can’t come tomorrow, but he’ll come Friday if it’s possible to push back the work.

He’s also returning to study in a month or two, so I will only have him 2 days a week. An agreement am ok with, because he will be armed with a diploma in a year or so.

But by this point I’ve kinda lost it. I haven’t said anything to him yet, but I think I have to let him go. He’s all take and isn’t willing to make a compromise on anything. I understand that the dog situation is very important to him, but I had offered him a very fair compromise. The guy is all take and can’t be told that he’s wrong.

To keep it private, we'll say my friend's name is John. John has severe ADHD which makes it extremely hard for him to focus and take some conversations seriously. He also doesn't keep up with basic hygiene. He doesn't brush his teeth (his teeth are Lego-yellow and has a hole in his front teeth, and his breath is just absolutely disgusting,) he doesn't use deodorant, and when he showers he just ""rinses,"" no shampoo or soap. We can literally smell him from 5 feet away.

John's last girlfriend was an 18 year old who was severely immature. As in, ""personality of a spoiled 14 year old girl"" immature. John is the type of person to where if you give him any form of constructive criticism, he'll either cut you off to stop talking to you (he stopped talking to me in high school for 6 months because he asked for relationship advice and I told him that basic hygiene, such as brushing your teeth, is a great start.)

We all discussed it among ourselves and had a ""meeting"" where we told John that we didn't think his gf was treating him fairly and that they weren't compatible together. He ignored us and didn't talk to us for a week. Then he told us she had cheated on him and she left him.

That same week, he met and had sex with her best friend (19) to ""get revenge."" They've been dating for about 7 months now. She is even worse than the last girl: causing scenes in public when we don't do things she doesn't, treating John like her ATM and taxi, talking down to him, etc. At New Years Eve we were all outside drinking and explicitly told her and John that she wasn't allowed to drink. I go to the bathroom and return to find her drinking.

We've tried being nice about telling him that we don't appreciate how she treats him (she's a carbon copy of GF#1) and he would just keep asking us our opinions of her, hoping we'd change our minds.

548,Asshole,"So my partner and I moved into this apartment about a year ago. That was a thursday. On the Saturday, we had my daughter, who I only have on the weekends. She is/was six years old.

My daughter and I were leaving the building to go to the park. As we were making our way out, the neighbour directly below us flew out of her apartment to talk to us. She's an old lady, and seemed nice.

""There's a park next door!""

""I love kids, I really do""

""The people in the apartment before you had kids and they were very noisy""

Anyway, the next day, at 11am, on a Sunday, we were vacuuming the floor. There's a knock at the door, it's crazy old lady. ""Can you please tell your children to stop running around up here, it's making my whole ceiling shake.""

Look over at six year old, she's sitting on the floor reading a book. ""There's no one jumping around up here, just vacuuming.""

""Please keep the noise to a minimum.""

Twenty minutes later there's a knock at the door. ""My WHOLE ceiling is shaking. I have a right to quiet enjoyment of my home, you have no right-""

""-I'm going to stop you right there,"" I say. ""My daughter left fifteen minutes ago with my partner to buy groceries. It's just me here, sitting, reading a book. I don't know what you're hearing, but it's not us.""

""No. I have a right to the peace and quiet!""

""Okay. Go make a noise complaint to Strata.""

Later we find random garbage in our letter box. We put a leaf with a mark in her letterbox. Next day, same leaf is in ours along with double the junk mail.

I decided that we would not try to be quiet. For the last year, we have walked heavily, asked my daughter to quickly go and get something so that she runs down the hallway.

And so, over the past year she has started screaming at the top of her lungs, whenever we so much as walk across the room. She screams obscenities out her windows. At one point, she started screaming incoherently in a wild rage and for 5 straight minutes continued to open and slam closed her sliding door. At least 100 times.

We intentionally try to set her off because it's funny.

Some neighbours were listening to music. It was 1pm on a Saturday. It was outside on their balcony, but not loud. Crazy lady started wandering around downstairs screaming up at them to turn the music off.

When this first happened, we emailed our landlord to let them know this lady was a bit unreasonable. Today, our landlord emails and says they've got a noise complaint coming. We laughed and emailed back that I bet it's the same lady I emailed about a year ago and that here's what's really been happening...

I am going to send them the video of her screaming and swearing and slamming everything and say that we don't feel safe and that her agression makes us uncomfortable.

550,Asshole,"My ex husband and I share custody. We’re not on speaking terms. Tonight I was woken up by my 16 year old screaming at her 12 year old sister for stealing her charge cord. 16 year old had a shower and came back to her room to find a broken charge cord in place of her original. 16 year old is freaking out, screaming at her sister to give it back. 12 year old has crocodile tears pleading innocence that it wasn’t her, it was 14 year old sister. I’m up. Tired. This goes on for 15 minutes. 16 year old is tearing up the place. Furious. She hits the 12 year old with the broken cord. I’m frustrated and trying to get to the bottom of this. 
12 year old doesn’t know that the 14 year old’s device has been broken for two weeks. We all know 100% who stole it. Tears and pleads of innocence. Enough is enough. I make the 16 year old sit on the basement stairs, fill the sink with water and tell the 12 year old her iPad will get drowned in 30 seconds if the cord doesn’t reappear. Countdown from 30. At 10 she throws the cord at her sister and tells her it was just borrowed. What’s the big deal?
I give 12 year old a lecture about lying and stealing. Mind you, this is an extremely entitled child. The tears dried as soon as the gig was up and she tells me: This was your last chance, mom, I’m not coming back here. I respond: oh? Was this my last chance? Then dunk the iPad in the water. 
She is furious and heart broken. So angry. I’m at the point where I don’t care. I will never replace this device for her. I am beyond frustrated at my daughter being a liar, a thief, and disrupting our household. She does not have a drop of remorse, does not see a thing she’s done wrong. 
I hate that I wrecked something that I saved and paid for. I hate that I lost my temper.  But I can’t have her behaving like this anymore. Should I apologize? What consequences should both of us have? Am I the asshole for drowning my daughter’s iPad?

Edit: There was a lot of buildup to this breakdown. She has been behaving badly for a long time. Stealing, lies, abuse of our home. Always met with tears and denials. It always puts enough doubt in me that she isn’t punished to the extent she should be. My gut knows, my brain can’t prove. I think the hard switch from denial to anger at being caught is what pushed me. 

As for her sister, there is a lot of history there as well. 12 has done some heinous things to 16. Violating and unforgivable. Being a referee was a full time job, and now that I have a full time job tension is brewing.

I have rarely punished any of my kids physically. I have always had the mentality that expressing my anger is not what will have them make better choices. This destruction of property is very out of character for me. It is a huge regret.

I talked with her this morning and apologized. Taking the advice from this post, I told her I would replace her iPad but it will be confiscated until there is better behaviour- a punishment I should have done. She’s happy with this. I feel played. I will talk to her therapist today to update her and seek further advice. I will email her father’s lawyer and see if he’d be willing to take her for a while as I am clearly not handling her well enough.

Additional Edit: Rarely punished physically means I don’t spank, I don’t hit. I have squeezed an arm and dragged a kid out of a grocery store. I have pulled a kicking and screaming kid by their leg into their room. I have propped up a child and held their hands to make them do the dishes. Physical encounters like these fill me with regret. Their father believes firmly in corporal punishment. The oldest children refuse to see him. The youngest behaves very well with him and terribly with me.",173,262,0.86
551,Not the A-hole,"**Overall Situation:** My roommate has bipolar depression and often gets mad or moody around me. She brings down my mood constantly, is weird and creepy (ie. just stares at me sometimes), and as a person, I really don't like her. She wronged my friend (her ex bf). She will talk my ear off for 5 hours straight and then not let me get a word in edgewise because she has no friends, so if she catches me in the hall of our apartment I will literally dart for my room to avoid her. 

As a roommate, she doesn't take out trash unless I force her, etc. She also \*may\* have autism (has never confirmed) and can't form sentences clearly/sometimes whispers so I can't hear her talk/doesn't make eye contact. Basically, I feel real bad about ever being ""mean"" to her, since she's the definition of psychologically meek, but since she doesn't pull her weight unless I am stern, I HAVE to. This girl has wasted THOUSANDS of my dollars already by not pulling her weight, and me buying everything (TV, etc). She split SOME furniture with me, but it took 4 months of teeth pulling.

**Today:** So today she comes home and I groan when I see her car pull up, here she comes to talk my ear off. She comes in the house in a bit of a mood, not sure if she saw me groan while I was walking in with groceries. She apparently whispers ""hi"" to me and I don't hear it, so I say ""hi"" back. She SNAPS at me, says ""Uh. I SAID HI FIRST. I SAID HI FIRST!!!"" in this totally bitchy tone. I'm instantly disgusted so I give her a real bitchy ""Uh. Okay. Chill."" She storms off wiping tears, takes a bath, and goes to bed at 9 pm (now ""depressed"").

Now I feel bad, so bad I am scared I can't sleep cause karma is gonna come kill me or something. I know you shouldn't be cruel to the mentally ill, but I have OCD, ADHD, and major depression, so by that logic I too can be a cunt to my roommate without people's retaliation (wrong). I just feel so negative around her, she's a socially awkward and mean drag. My friend even broke up with her over it (she was his Tinder date gf who nobody likes anymore). She did the same thing and yelled and screamed at him until he snapped at her with the same tone I did today. Am I the asshole? Or am I the sub asshole today? Or am I more of a butt to her asshole?

I am crying over this, I see so much of her sadness in me, and I really really feel for her. BUT I JUST CANNOT BE HER MOMMY ANYMORE. I want her to move out so bad but she's squatting. I have a pavlovian fear of seeing her. Every time I do my heart sinks. I just know it's gonna be a fucked up ""mood"" or creepy over the top bipolar niceness. :( I can't change my resentment for her anymore. My friend who used to date her doesn't even know what to do.",19,33,0.87
552,Everyone Sucks,"This situation is a little messy and complicated, so not something I want my kids to come across (which is why I'm posting on a throw away account will try to keep this short and to the point) but I just want to know if I'm over reacting at this point because my wife hasn't spoken to me in 3 days.

I've been (for the most part) happily married to my wife for the better part of 25 years, with five beautiful children, but I  recently found out that my wife had been cheating on me (No the kids dont know and Yes I was angry but I realised I was also to blame because I had been pulling away around the time our last child was born - I was/am going through some health issues both mental and physical and I had thought that it would be better if I didn't worry my wife with it because of the new baby and the next thing I know two years had past and it felt like too late to talk to her so really the fact that she turned to someone else for support shouldn't have been a surprise). I won't go into any specifics because the way I (and many of our close friends) found out was very public and memorable. However we've talked about it and decided that we still love each other and because of our children, we would give it another go. 

We decided we were going to renew our vows and start a fresh putting all of this behind us but my brother (who is a lawyer) and my best friend talked to me a few days ago and told me to be careful. So I thought about it and me and my brother wrote up a contract (essentially like a prenup) stating that if either of us is unfaithful then we wave our right to half of the other's assets and majority custody of the children (amongst other things). I gave the paper to my wife and she lost it. She said that this was proof I didn't want to start anew and that I wasn't really putting my all into our relationship  this was my way of punishing her and pulling away right from the beginning, dooming our marriage. 

I argued and said it was just a precaution and she said the only way our marriage was going to work was if we were both open and then she walked away.

That was three days ago  and outside of the act we put on for the children my wife hasn't spoken/ interacted with me. I spoke to her sister and my mother and they both say that I'm being insensitive and now I'm starting to wonder if I am. 

Edit 1 - To clarify, according to my brother the contract would only kick in if either of us cheats. If we decide we still aren't happy after trying to make things work then we can get a divorce and things work as normal.

Edit 2 - We included the children because where I'm from the mother usually gets custody and I'm not trying to bad mouth my wife when I say she has a vindictive streak (Which was how we met as she completely annihilated my roomate for trying to hit on her in college - trust me when I say that was completely justifed he was a creep). So my brother warned me that should she cheat again and I ask for a divorce she could take my children away from me completely (he said the usual precedent is that the children stay with the mother).",105,91,0.88

Well recently we made the jump and had sex. We agreed not to tell anyone, especially our friend group.

I went to message him on Facebook and ask and I saw he posted a meme about finally getting the girl you want and he changed his stuff from single to in a relationship. 

I messaged him piiiiiiiissed. He responded that he didn't tell anyone and he got a new girlfriend (entirely false) who he put the status up about. I feel like now that we have had sex he's being a douche and lying to my face (well, screen) so I blocked him and asked our mutuals to not invite us out together. They responded by telling me I'm overreacting and should apologise to him and not throw out our friendship especially since I was the first girl he's ever been with.

558,Not the A-hole,"The title makes me sound like a jerk, but I really can’t with this kid. I have a son (15), and he hangs around a lot with “Luca.” Luca comes from a wealthy home, but he has some conduct issues. He’s in detention all the time (my son is an okay student, and he’s never in trouble), and he was suspended from the hockey team that he and my son play on. He’s loud, rude, and destructive when he comes to my house, and he’s here several times a week. Below are only a few of the incidents:

* He came over to play video games with my son and he was obviously high and smelled of weed. 

* He took our craft scissors and used them to trim his...downstairs hair. I know this because he left our toilet seat peppered with hairs. 

* He called my son a fa***t in my presence, and my oldest son (20M) happens to be gay. 

* He likes those tasteless YouTube pranks where people trick the homeless etc. 

* When his ex girlfriend broke up with him last year (she was 16 — too big of an age gap imo) he poured sugar in the gas tank of her car. 

The only reason I don’t ban him outright is his home life. His dad is always gone, and him mom is struggling with a pill addiction.

560,Not the A-hole,"So my roomate and I are both lesbians, we have been living together since January, we were really good friends before we moved in and are still really good friends, I think. This weekend, while we were out drinking she confessed that she has strong feelings for me and the only reason she moved in with me was because she ""knew"" we were going to get together. We were originally looking at places with 2 other people but apparently she told them that we were going to start dating and that they should look at other places.

She told me that she has been attracted to me since the beginning and has been getting close to me in order to start a relationship with me. She never wanted to be just friends and has talked to a lot of our mutual friends about this behind my back. She has told them all about how I have been flirting back and that there is all this sexual tension between us. 

So when we were out on Friday we were drinking and dancing and then when we got home she told me that we had to talk and then proceeded to tell me that she loves me and has loved me from the beginning. She then asked if I love her back. I tried to be nice at first, I told her how much I value our friendship and how I don't think that starting a relationship with someone I am living with is a good idea. But she kept pressing the question and I had to tell her no. I told her that I feel like she has cheapened our friendship by hoping we would get together the whole time. I affirmed that there is a zero percent chance that we are going to get together. 

She started to cry and went into her room, and there wasn't really anything I could do, so I texted a good friend of ours asked her to check up with her.

Now all of our friends who she has talked to have been calling me an asshole and telling me I should have been kinder to her and let her down more gently.

When she passes I will inherit $800k-1m. The only reason that this has been on my mind is because her and her lawyer called for a meeting with all of us grandkids and my Aunt to discuss exactly what will happen when she passes. We had never discussed it as a family as it is a somewhat awkward conversation. 

Learning how much I will inherit has really made me question who I am and what I want to live for.

Okay, now for the real point of this post. I have an above-average sex drive and am often stressed (anxiety and BPD suck) so I masturbate (once per day at most, as quietly as I possibly can, and ALWAYS in the privacy of my own room or the shower) as a coping skill and to relieve sexual urges.

Today, when I heard the knock, I had to rush to cover myself and ended up snapping at her, asking her to please never come into my room again without waiting for a response. I told her that I had asked her to do this multiple times, and asked her once more to please never do this again. She left the room.

So here is where the story really starts. There is a spare room in my house that nobody is using. My mom has it made for me and my brother. She calls it our ""Mancave."" The problem is, I am the only person who uses the damn room. I have talked to my parents many times about making our ""Mancave"" my own room.

I understand this and expressed that I do. I also told them that they should not be stressed, because I would be the one working on it. 

Anyways, later on in the day my mom told me: ""If you keep the room you have now SPOTLESS for a week, then I will allow you to have your own room."" Well, at the end of the week, she had seen no flaws in my room. I had kept it spotless. 

She still told me: ""Hell no.""

565,Not the A-hole,"I’m the dad of a 25 year old young woman who I love very much. I’ve been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and I enjoy my time with her, but there’s one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

She exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, I realized she needed professional help. Throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. With an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. She received an ASPD diagnosis at 18, and I had suspected it for long prior.

After her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. She’s law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. Especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. She uses that old dating guide “The Rules” like a Bible. She currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who’s crazy about her, and who I have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). He is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

But I doubt she loves him. We’ve had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she’s been open with me that she doesn’t feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. When she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt “pretty neutral” about the whole thing. She has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she’s ever done, and doesn’t know what guilt feels like. While she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, I highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

Her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she’s been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it’ll scare him away. I’ve made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or I will**; to which she always responds, “I know you wouldn’t dare.” I actually would - I really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this “secret” from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

I’m not trying to sabotage my daughter’s future. **Maybe** her boyfriend’s love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won’t end the relationship. It’s his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. Someday he’s bound to find out she’s a bit “off”; it can’t be kept a secret forever. AITA?",5019,33515,0.96

I guess technically I could wear the dreaded boob holders. It would hurt though.

I stopped asking her if she wanted to go places with me as a result, but she invites me out sometimes and then always asks when we're ready to go if I'm gonna hurry up and get dressed, or if I can put on a jacket and cover up, despite the 75-90° weather. It's so annoying and constant that I haven't left the house in a few days. She walked in my room earlier to ask when I thought I could wear a bra again.

She's always been weird about my tits and I get really tired of it. I just feel like I should be comfortable wherever I go. Part of that is being dressed comfortably. It took years of fighting to be allowed to take off a bra anywhere that wasn't my room or the bathroom. I'd have to put on a bra in my room to walk approx. 4 feet to use the bathroom because the hallway was a ""bras on"" area.

My husband and I have been together for 11 years, during our 1st year of dating his mother would take unwanted and at times unflattering pics of me and post them to fb without asking. The first time I asked her not to she got VERY pouty and offended.  After a couple more years of this I very politely asked her again to stop because I want to have a career in administration in public education and I don't want pictures of me in my pjs for anyone to see. It means that posts to social media give me extreme anxiety no matter who posts them. I worry for my career image. I told her about my anxiety disorder and how it affects me and she said,""Well you just need to get over that."" I was very hurt, but kept it to myself. That was about 5 years ago.

Flash forward to 4 weeks ago. So, this last time we went out we took them fishing(my hubby loves to fish)and she took some of me trying to get the hook out of the fishes mouth(think hunched over and camping hair.) She promised she wouldn't post any pictures of me except for the standard family selfie one. Well, she posted all of them anyway. Then texted me,""Let me know if you don't like any of them so I can take them down."" Which to some might seem thoughtful, but I think she knows would make me look whiney, plus she promised not to post them AS SHE WAS TAKING THEM.  It isn't so much about the actual pictures anymore as the promise she made not to post them and her disregard for my feelings. Also, what about when we have kids? Will she respect my boundaries with pictures regarding them? AITA?",37,39,0.9
571,META,"I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, I've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. OP was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. Their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? And there is a resounding chorus of NTA! You don't owe anyone anything! Or someone was mean to OP, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. AITA?  No! They were rude so you get to be as well! 

I dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. Sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. These reactions are understandable. But just because its understandable doesn't mean OP can't be the asshole. 

Being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. People make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  It is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""They started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now.

However he expressed that he only wants a Jewish wedding. I told him that when my family has interfaith weddings, we always have two. One day would be the Hindu ceremony and the next would be the Other.

A while back I found out I was pregnant. I never wanted children and the father of the baby is a colleague I had a sexual encounter with. Even though we used precautions, I still ended up pregnant. 

You should know I - for reasons - really don’t want children. At first my plan was to get an abortion (even asking advice about it on reddit) but eventually I did end up telling him out of guilt, and he - as I expected - begged me to continue the pregnancy. He says he’ll raise the baby himself and I don’t need to have any contact with either of them. 

I don’t know how to feel about this. I still really can’t be a mother, even if I’m having a child. I will offer to chip in financially but nothing more I guess... Like, I legally want to give up my parental rights, if possible. But does this make me a horrible person?

574,Not the A-hole,"I (30F) was raised Catholic, my fiance (32M) was not. I haven't considered myself Catholic since my teens, and a couple years ago started attending a non-denominational church. My family has been mostly non-resistant to that despite many being quite Catholic.

The issue began when I announced my engagement, my parents then started asking if I planned on a Catholic wedding. Obviously I didn't and see no reason why I should. My mom told me that in the eyes of the church since I was baptized  and confirmed I must have a Catholic wedding to have it be considered valid, after all they don't respecter consider my gay and lesbian friends' marriages valid. That is of no issue to me, I don't care if a church I don't attend and am not a part of considers my marriage valid. My mom explained that it's a way bigger deal to some of my aunts and uncles and grandparents than them, they're not comfortable with anyone in the family marrying outside the church. I said that doesn't matter, it's MY wedding and if they have a problem with it that's not their decision to make.

When I was talking with one of my aunts she proposed a compromise: one of my cousins' sister-in-law wanted an outdoors wedding which the Catholic church doesn't allow so the night before they had a small ceremony with just immediate family in a Catholic church and had a priest bless the marriage before the ""real"" wedding. My parents have picked up on this now too. Thing is I still don't want to do this. Catholic weddings require pre-marriage counseling teaching things like ""natural"" birth control I have no intention of following and me pledging to raise any kids we have Catholic...which I won't. I told my parents this was not a reasonable compromise, I'm still having a Christian wedding and the notion that my marriage has to be blessed by a priest instead of the minister I have or it's not valid is simply offensive.

My fiance for the most part doesn't care, he said he'd be fine with a Catholic wedding or even a simple ""pre-wedding"" but he doesn't think I should be forced into anything.

Who do you think is being more unreasonable here? Should I just suck it up and do that to make my family happy?",123,338,0.95
575,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: On  mother's day I went to a local grocery story that I've been going to  for ages to buy my mom some flowers and get some beer. I'm coming on 23  and have been going to this story on and off for beer for damn near 2  years now, never ever had a problem. I get along well with the  employees, especially with a woman in the liquor department (this is relevant to the story). This particular day, I'd driven up there without realizing that I hadn't brought my wallet because I had cash in my pocket to pay with- no big deal, I carry an old copy of a license which has an older address on it  (but still technically valid through the date) in my car with me for this exact reason. In any case, I get through checkout and eventually have to call the manager because the employee won't validate my age. He basically tells me that I don't look like the person on the ID.

Then, I see the lady from liquor department who always checks me out. I asked her to help me assure the manager the ID is legit. He tells me he won't sell me the liquor because he insists it isn't my ID (address is different, which is why I got a new one), and then proceeds to try to keep my ID. I put my foot down here because, frankly, this is ridiculous. My hair was longer then, but I have the same piercings and everything as in that photo. I was really trying to remain calm since I learned from you guys, to be exact, that causing a scene doesn't get you anywhere nor do you come out the victor. After a bit, I slip up and drop an F bomb in the conversation and the manager just flips out, tells me to get out or he'll call the cops. So I told him ""aight, call the cops""

Wait 5 min, cops arrive, ask whats going on, etc etc. I show the cop the old ID and he says ""yeah, looks like you"" and checks it to ensure it is a  real ID, which it is. Then the manager tells me he's \*still\* not selling me the beer and the cop says it's his prerogative not too. Manager tries to put his hands on me to escort me out and I told him off, left with the cop in tow. As soon as I got home I called corporate and filed a complaint against the manager to which they told me they'll get back to me about it. Frankly, I wasn't expecting anything to be done, but today they call me and tell me disciplinary action was taken. I don't know if they fired him or what because they wouldn't tell me, but some of my friends and family have told me I'm an asshole for filing a complaint that may have cost him his job over such a petty incident, that I should have just taken the L. It just sucks because I'm uncertain about whether or not I'm allowed back there or whether I'm even willing to go back after this, but I really liked most of the employees there.

577,Not the A-hole,"It sounds worse than it is. I promise. 

Background: So my husband (m36) and I (f31) have been married for 5 years, together for 10. We are not wealthy but we are very comfortable. We both make ~75k/year, we live in a small 3 bedroom house with a very low mortgage (less than $700 a month!). I have paid off my student loan debt and have no other debt besides the house. He has a car he bought last year,but it's still a very affordable car. We have no kids. No plans to have kids. Our expenses are very low, we live in a LCL area. 

Our finances are set up in a ""yours, mine, ours"" kind of way. Both of our paychecks go into one joint bank account. This is our main account that we use to make household purchases (groceries, small furniture, etc) and pay our bills and stuff. We have another ""rainy day"" account where we keep $6k for us to use when we need to make short-notice large purchases or emergency purchases, like if we decide to get a new couch or TV or random medical trips. We also have a main savings account and investment accounts and any money pulled from the rainy day account gets ""refilled"" by adjusting our input into savings account until we're back at 6K. We also have our own personal accounts. We budget $600/month each for our own money, like an allowance. 

For the last 6 months I've been saving a portion of my money in order to buy a handcrafted custom yarn spinning wheel, it's part of my hobby and something I've been wanting for years and it was around $1300. Last month, something on my husband car broke and it was about $900 to fix it. We used money from our rainy day account to fix it. When my wheel came in yesterday my husband threw a whole fit about it I was being selfish by ""hiding"" $1000 from him when it could have been used to fix the car instead of dipping into our emergency fund and that I should have asked before making such a huge purchase. I told him that  it's not fair to expect me to give up money that I saved up to fix his car and that I shouldn't have to get his permission to make this purchase for myself with my own money. 
This is also the first time I've ever made such a large purchase for myself. AITA?",423,1300,0.97
578,Not the A-hole,"I am currently engaged to be married and have been with my fiancé for 8 years. We have been engaged for 5 years and have finally started to plan the wedding. We wanted to finish school, get our careers going and buy a house first. My wedding is 9.5 months away and my sister is my maid of honor. Just recently, my younger sister announced that she and her boyfriend, that she has known for less than a year, have decided to start trying to conceive.

I think I’ll provide a bit of information about my sister. I love her dearly, but she has a history of making spur of the moment decisions. She has moved to cities, quit jobs, bought cars she can’t afford, quicker than you can blink an eye. Everything always works out for her because she has my family to back her up.

When she made this announcement, I was shocked because she didn’t seem to be in a life position to think about children. She's quite young, my parents are paying for half of their rent, my sister is currently working a minimum wage job and her boyfriend is out of work due to an injury. Also, they haven’t been together very long. But hey, that’s their business!

It didn’t take me long to do the math. If my sister conceives quickly, she will be either extremely close to child birth for my big day, or just had a baby. Since I’m doing a destination wedding, she won’t be able to come since I’m pretty sure you can’t fly when you are 9 months pregnant. And she probably wouldn’t want to go anywhere if she had just given birth. So, I asked her to delay trying to conceive for another month or two so it will be safe for her to fly. I can’t imagine getting married without her there.

Needless to say, she did not take it well. She couldn’t believe I asked her to do something like that. She states her future baby is more important than my wedding. I agree with that. But, I’m not asking her to NOT have a baby. I’m just asking her to wait a bit longer so she can be my maid of honor.

Am I the asshole in this situation?

I bought her the books with the impression that I would get the reimbursement. Something we agreed upon. 

Months go by and I find an opened envelope from her work. I look at the contents and see that it’s the stub of a check for around $300. I had totally forgotten about the reimbursement as I figured she would have brought it up. 

I show her the stub, ask her when the check came and where the money was. She tells me it arrived a couple weeks ago and she used the money towards paying off some credit card bills. 

I told her that it wasn’t her money to use once it came back. 

She started getting very upset, telling me that I have borrowed money from her before so I shouldn’t be upset. 

Even after telling her that I was ok with not seeing the money anymore she still was upset. I told her that I was mostly pissed about her not letting me know it had arrived, and had she simply asked for it, I most likely would have given her the $300.

When we first got together and talked about our friends, She discribed her friend group as mixed but more guys than girls, This struck me as odd but since they all seemed to hang out in one big group I didn't have a problem with it.

Within a few months however, all the other girls had stopped hanging in the group, Some were dating guys in the group and they broke up (My GF always sided with the guys in these instances) a couple moved out of the city for work or school. Within six months of our initial conversation, Her friend group had turned almost exclusively male (She does have a couple female friends, But they aren't close) She'd be going out to bars with groups of 4-8 guys on the weekend, Going to parties at their houses, Sometimes staying on their couches (I'd offer to pick her up and drive her home, But they have a tradition of all getting breakfast together the morning after a party) 

I started to have a problem with this pretty quickly, It was different when it was a mixture, But having my girlfriend alone with guys all the time was weird and it just didn't sit right with me.

So a few days ago I began playing fortnite again after a long hiatus, mostly because a friend wanted me to play, but I've been enjoying myself. Usually I play alone, but yesterday I decided to just join a game with some random people. Once we all loaded in, it was me, two (presumably) teenage guys, and a young child. When the child began to talk, the two guys immediately began to smack talk this child. I felt bad and told them to just mute the two other guys and talk to me, because I don't mind playing with kids, I want them to have a good time too!

The kid started complimenting my microphone, asking if I was a streamers or singer etc. , But was mainly drawn to my username because both of our names referenced sushi. I had a better time talking to this kid than I do most games, mostly because the toxicity was non-existent, and we were both just playing for fun anyways. During the game, the kid was talking about how she doesn't have any friends to play fortnite with, and when I asked if anyone from school plays, she told me that she doesn't talk to anyone at school because they make fun of her voice. This really broke my heart! I was unsure how old this kid was, or even if it was a guy or girl, but didn't really care honestly. After the game ended, they added me and I accepted, and wanted to play some more games with me. I ended up inviting my girlfriend to play with us, and that's when I found out the kid was a girl, mostly because she was super excited to get to talk to another girl that played fortnite! After playing a few games, we find out that this kid is only 7 years old, which did freak me out a little bit considering I'm a 21 y/o guy, but I still didn't let it bother me to the point of de-friending her, mostly because I felt bad that she had no one to play with.

I don't feel like I'd ever go out of my way to invite her to play again, though if she asked me to play I feel like I would feel awful saying no just because a few people called me some rude things. A few friends called me a creep/weirdo when I told them about this situation, but I truly have no bad intentions here. I wholeheartedly just want to give this kid a good gaming experience, especially with how a lot of female/children gamers are treated nowadays. 

I apologize for any mistakes in the writing, I'm on mobile right now, but I just want to know if I did the right thing, or if what I did is seriously weird or gross.

TL:DR - I played fortnite with a 7 y/o girl, and accepted her friend request to play again sometime. She seemed super happy to play with someone who wasn't an asshole to her for once.

EDIT: I wanted to add a little edit to thank everyone for your kind replies. It's probably pretty unlikely that I will end up playing with her again, mostly due to my newly packed work schedule and vacation coming up, but if she ever does ask me to play a few games, I'm going to make sure to attempt to speak to one of her parents, or at least make sure they know that she's playing with older people.",250,858,0.96

At this particular movie theater anyone under the age of 18 has to be accompanied by an adult to see an age restricted movie.    This means that I would need to be with them the whole time. I get permission from the child's parent to take her to the movie.  She lives a block away so she's able to walk over to our apartment.  

 As soon as she gets inside I realize that she's wearing a T-shirt with a lot of writing on it.  I take a closer look and I realized that it is a copy of Kurt Cobain's s*1cide note (word not allowed) I wasn't sure what to do at first but I googled the shirt and it seems to be something that people would recognize.  Normally I'm pretty open to whatever people want to do, want to wear but this just didn't sit right with me.  I felt like it was in very poor taste and I didn't want anyone to think that she was my child and that I was OK with her wearing this.

 I explained to her that I didn't really feel comfortable with her wearing that shirt. She's the same size as my daughter so i asked if she would like to borrow one of her shirts I also offered to take her home to change.

 She said she would walk home to change. However  she ended up text messaging my daughter saying that I was a bitch and she didn't wanna go to the movie.

 I feel very bad that my daughter didn't get to go to the movie and I feel bad that I upset her friend.  I was a rebellious teenager and I would have felt horrible if a friends mom asked me to change.  I am definitely second guessing myself here.

In short, his family is pretty bad with money. They take out lots of high interest loans (in the ballpark of $300,000 USD) and make a lot of speculative investments that usually go awry. He personally has a pretty strained relationship with them and the last time he lived with the he was 12 (military boarding school...). Recently we got into a pretty big fight because his parents paid for some of his college and expect him to pay them back REALLY quickly. They want him to send them $12,000 a year for the next three years (so $36,000 in three years). He currently makes $65,000 a year and lives in a super expensive US city. In addition, they also expect him to pay for his brother's college education when he goes to college in about 8 years. It has caused a lot of stress in our relationship because there are things I would like to do, like travel, that he simply can't and probably won't be able to do until his mid-thirties (in addition, to not being able to save much money for expenses). I have offered to pay for these things but that's a whole different shit show. In addition, I don't think it's fair that he has to both pay back his parents and pay for his brother and I also feel frustrated that it's going to impact both our current ability to do fun/interesting things and down the road might impact our ability to pay for a mortgage and/or college for our kids. I've tried to talk with him about this but I feel like I'm overstepping a cultural boundary and that it's not my place to dictate the relationship he has with his parents. At the same time, I can't afford to support both of us and I'm scared about our ability to save money as well as have financial freedom.

He kept persisting because he just wanted to know more about it; he insisted he'd be okay if they were just random hook-ups, but he was curious. For reference, he already knew I slept with 4 guys, but I never gave him more detail than that.

After some coaxing, I told him one was to my long-term boyfriend but the other 3 was when I was young and stupid at 16. I went to on some online websites and managed to find myself some sugar daddies. One wasn't that much older than me (23) and the other two were in their mid-30s. They didn't break the law because the age of consent was 16.

I did it because I didn't really come from a great home life, and I associated men giving me money and buying me things with them loving me. They ended up doing it for about a year and a half, and I earned enough money for my laptop, TV, the car I still drive today, and a good size chunk to my college fund (which is essential because my parents didn't pay for shit). 

Well my boyfriend was completely appalled at my answer and started getting snarky. He said I should’ve let him know that I was a “slut” before dating me. At that point I got really pissed off because I didn’t even think I needed to tell him in the first place; it’s my past and NOT relevant to me now. I went off on him and told him to fuck off for trying to slut shame me; that he has had WAY more partners than me (over triple mine), and I was a vulnerable teenaged girl at the time. If he didn’t want to know, then he shouldn’t have asked. He got really quiet, and made a flimsy excuse to leave a few minutes later.

I never cursed at my boyfriend before like that and I feel so guilty, but I really didn’t like his judgmental attitude. I don’t know if I should apologize to him or wait for him to; thought to come to Reddit to ask who was in the wrong.",504,72,0.63
594,Asshole,"So I (16M) recently had a meeting with my school careers advisor, who is basically someone at the school who advises students on what is realistically possible for them as a career option. 

Anyway basically we had no choice but to have meetings with them so I had one. I get quite good grades, she asked me about what I wanted to do and I said I want to start my own business at some point in my 20s after uni and she said that the business world is really tough and unlikely to succeed in, so I just politely said:

''Look, with all due respect, I don't take the advice of someone who actually works as a school careers advisor seriously''

She looked really shocked when I said that but we moved on quickly, I told my friends I said this and they said that was douchey, but tbh I feel it was true AITA?",153,31,0.6
595,Not the A-hole,"Recently my ex-boss contacted me asking me for some help handling the computer lab i used to work in.

My friends told me i should be the better person and help him ""just this once"" but honestly when i worked there i did WAY so much work than what i got paid for (8/hr, part time).

I did basically the work my boss didnt do... before i got there there were 98 computer non-compliant, and after that the next report showed 2.

I kept asking for a raise, or more hours, or full time. Even when i graduated (CS major) i stayed there as a part time in hopes of getting full time but he kept promising me that i would get a full time position.

Then after i told them i had another offer he told me i could leave and that they could find someone to replace me. The day i left he didnt even bother showing up for a goodbye or anything. He also then refused to hire the person i recommended, and hired some randon person that has no experience in computers.

Now his part timer(a friend of mine) keeps asking me for help because my ex-boss doesnt know so much as to image a computer, and recently he shoot me an email about some forgotten passwords and help teaching him how to properly manage the lab.

I think its fair that i would ignore him and let him struggle after thet way he treated me, but my friends are saying i should be the better person and help him out.

Am i the asshole for not wanting to help him?

597,Asshole,"I'm an Irish college student, and just got back to my hometown for the summer. All had been going swimmingly until my parents began to take issue with me wearing a baseball cap indoors.

I have decently long red hair on top (often gets in my eyes) and a bushy ginger beard. While I'd like to think the hat frames my face quite nicely, or at the very least, looks alright on me, It's mostly there to keep the hair well away from my eyes when I haven't styled it.

I asked why it was such an issue and had it explained to me like this :
""It's just common courtesy, and you look like a knacker with a hat on inside anyway!""

""Knacker"" for those not from Ireland, is a derogatory term for a member of the travelling community, and in my family at least, is not exactly a light jab, more of a jarring insult.

This seemed to suggest my parents felt VERY strongly about this, so I assumed the tradition had very deep cultural roots. I was curious, so I asked exactly where it came from, only for my father to become incredibly angry at the line of questioning, say that it's ""JUST MANNERS"", and refuse to talk about it any further.
 
At this point I was convinced a hat had once killed a cousin or something, anything that might have warrented that kind of reaction.
Thankfully, we live in the age of the internet, and after a little while spent searching, it appears the practice originally came from a Christian tradition of removing one's hat when going into church, as not to hide your head (one of God's creations) from God.

Now, I'm not certain of their actual faith but, my family doesn't attend church, doesn't pray, doesn't abide by dietary restrictions put in place during certain catholic holidays, and generally view what religious events they do have to attend (due to our extended family) as annoying timesinks that serve little to no purpose.

I'm an atheist, and have very strong views surrounding ignorance in the name of faith, so I'll   admit I was quick to get annoyed when my attempt to explain what I had learned to them was met with the same angry tone, and ""for fuck sakes, just leave it.""

Am I The Asshole for suggesting that if they can't come up with a reason other than a vague explanation of ""manners"", then they shouldn't abide by any tradition like this?
There's a laundry list of various traditions that are upheld in this house that no one is able to explain the origin or function of. I just don't understand why we'd keep doing it if we don't know why we're doing it.

My parents said afterward that they were appalled by the fact I was trying to bash a religious tradition.
I'm very worried I was being anti-catholic, but my own values align with my argument, so really I'm now worried I'm just a bad person in general

Edit : (changed antisemitic to anti-catholic.)

Thanks for the responses, I am definitely in the wrong, I didn't realize I was being so immature at the time, but posting it has been eye opening anyway.
I now understand that stating I was athiest was unnecessary, even though at the time I believed it was relevant information.

I should probably mention I haven't worn the hat indoors since it had been said the first time, I'm not some contrarian child as some of the comments seem to suggest.
I respect my parents, and appreciate what they've done for me up to now.

I should also stress my problem with these traditions as a whole is the ignorance as to where they come from and why we do them, not the traditions themselves.
I still firmly hold the belief that if there is no functional purpose for it, we should get rid of it, but I respect that it's not my place to change that in this household.",80,45,0.89

600,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend has been really into the gym and weightlifting lately, which I fully support - I’m a part of a few sports teams myself and love that he has a hobby and is being healthy.

However, his timings have really annoyed me. He keeps having massive weightlifting sessions just before events and trips, which inevitably results in him being in too much pain to do anything, particularly after leg day.

We recently went to Budapest for a long weekend and we had a whole itinerary planned. A couple of nights before we left, he had his leg day. He spent the whole time limping and complaining about the pain and we ended up doing just two of the things we had planned. By the Sunday I snapped and told him, in summary, that I didn’t care he was in pain, because he did it to himself and that I was fed up with listening to him whine and sitting around doing nothing, all because he refused to reschedule leg day.

He got very upset with me and said I was being unsupportive, that I cared more about our itinerary (which we made together by the way) than I do about him.

We got home last week and we’re in this weird standoff where neither one of us will apologise, nor let it go, so it’s been pretty icy to say the least.

Friend B felt very offended, came to me to complain about Julie and said that they didn' t like being judged as a ""weeb"" after only a very short interaction.  I argue that weeb isn' t necessarily a bad word and is most often used in an ironic/joking way, and that Julie didnt mean to hurt her but that it is custom in my friend group to just joke around about one another. Friend B disagrees and wants me to do something(?) about Julie, even though the conversation between them has long stopped and Julie stoped callinf friend b a weeb. 

I feel like friend b shouldn' t have been so offended by a simple joke and felt that it was kinda unfair of them to come to me to complain about/badmouth julie instead of just directly talking to her to begin with. I never called friend b a weeb, just argued that there was no reason to be offended as Julie never meant to hurt her. Friend B is now super pissed and demands I tell julie to apologize.

I usually take off my uniform before I go places, but I passed the mall on the way home and didn’t want to burn extra gas. When I get to the front of the line, the cashier asks what branch am I in. I say that I’m apart of the Air Force. She thanks me for my service and gives me a military discount. Which I never asked for. While I am waiting for my food, some active duty soldiers (I live by an army base so they’re not uncommon to see) start freaking out. One says what I’m doing is basically stolen valor. His friend was more empathetic and said that he understands that I’m proud of being in CAP, but it is unacceptable to reap the benefits of actual soldiers, many of whom have to deal with hardships from deployments. This made me feel a little bad, but in my defense, I never asked for a discount, she just gave me one. Also, I would definitely be in the military now if I was old enough. In two years, I’m definitely enlisting. Also, as a member of the Air Force auxiliary, I think I am less of a civilian than other people, as cringy as that sounds.

I told my SO (22f) about a possible opportunity to buy 2 watches that trade for roughly 5 figures over market value each. I was incredibly excited, since I have been hunting these down for months and this deal would equal my years salary at my job.

Then my SO asked me if she could also buy one if I managed to get my hands on an extra one. Taken aback I told her that there is a very limited supply and that I would buy all the watches I could get my hands on, since each translate to 5 figures in profit.

She did NOT take it well and has been upset at me ever since. From her point of view I just denied her half a years salary for no reason. From my point of view, I would be gifting her that amount since there is an incredibly limited supply and I did all the work hunting them down.

For fairness sake, I have to point out that our current financial situations are very different and this would have a much larger impact on hers than mine.

605,Not the A-hole,"I work at a small business with about 20 employees and we have a full size fridge in our break room. About once every six months, I do a cleanout to help prevent smells and food that was abandoned by former employees from taking up space.

Yesterday was cleanout. I sent an email last week detailing the rules of the cleanout. Those included very first of all this line:

""Any items you wish to keep, please place them on **top shelf** of the fridge or take them home before end of day Monday. This includes items in the door and the drawers. Anything not on the top shelf will be thrown away. This includes Tupperware, so even if it’s in your favorite resealable, it’s getting chucked if it isn’t on the top shelf.""

I sent another email yesterday reminding everyone of the cleaning.

I verbally announced to our office a half hour before the cleaning that I was about to happen (it's an open office space where everyone can hear each other).

When the time came, the vast majority of stuff was moved to the top shelf. A few things weren't. This included an open non-expired salad dressing and three sealed, non-expired yogurts.

These, as promised, got chucked. Today, one of my coworkers is miffed that I threw away his salad dressing and yogurt. I feel like I was absolutely crystal clear as to what I was going to do. I have no idea whose salad dressing and yogurt those were, they could have been abandoned or (in the case of the open salad dressing) spoiled.

Another coworker thinks this person should have been able to follow the rules and that I was fair because the rules applied equally to everything in the fridge.

606,Asshole,"My husband and I used to be petroleum engineers and are retired now. We have three kids: two daughters and a son. They had a rough childhood because we were in relative poverty at the time. It wasn't until my husband and I started and subsequently sold our own company did we start to have a nice life. They were under 10 at the time, all of them. We promised our children to pay for their weddings.

Our eldest daughter, 33 now, got married in 2013 and divorced a year later. We paid for the wedding to our daughter's specification and it cost us to the tune of $30,000. We've regretted it ever since because the money has effectively been wasted. She has no further interest in ever getting married.

Our son who is 35 has zero interest in getting married. He's expressed this sentiment for the last 15 years and we have no reason to believe he'll change his mind.

Our youngest daughter, 30 now, was proposed to by a very sweet and kind man last year. They already have two children, my only grandchildren, so I know it will last.

But my husband and I don't want to go through another wedding. We've become disillusioned with the idea of weddings, especially paying for them. We told our daughter ""we'll give you $40,000 if you get married at the courthouse, just don't have a wedding ceremony"". They own their own house outright and have no debt, so this is money for them to invest or put into savings or get properties to rent for passive income or even throw in a fire, we don't care. We're just adamant in our money not being spent on a wedding because we think it's a waste of money.

My daughter's fiancee is relenting to whatever my daughter wants but has told me in private he doesn't believe in weddings, either. He wants to get married, but more of an elopement or small 20 person thing, not a fullbown 300 person wedding like my elder daughter. My daughter is staunch in her decision to have a wedding, though.

To us, the choice is clear: if they have a wedding, we will not pay for it. That's the end of it. If they get married in a courthouse or in some other fashion, we'll pay for it and give them $40,000. My daughter argues we're blackmailing them, not even knowing her fiancee doesn't want a wedding anyways.

My mom has been staying with me in my 1 BR apartment for 10 days. I invited her to help her get out of a bad situation. It was originally supposed to be for 3 weeks, but after she got here she said she expects to be here longer. At that point, I said she could stay until the end of June, but absolutely no longer.

My mom is 65 and has never kept a steady job. She refuses to learn how to use a computer and is therefore constantly asking me to look up everything for her. She has no skills.

Before coming to visit she talked about getting a place with a friend. She told me that fell through because the friend would not respond. Two days after she arrived, she ignored a call from her friend saying ""that's 8 times...""

I knew it would not be easy having my mom around, but she has made my life incredibly difficult. She refuses to do anything for herself. That includes looking stuff up, but also driving places, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and picking up after herself.

She constantly ignores what I say, like the fact that I'm in a diet. I pay for everything, and I generally dont mind. However, she complains about how much everything costs, but then in the next breath suggests we do something expensive. I've been slowly getting angrier and yelling some.

Her birthday is coming up, so I offered to take her to a comedy club and get her a cooking class that she had expressed interest in. She then responded that she thought I was taking her to a casino. (Backstory is that my mom has a gambling problem and I have told her repeatedly including that morning that I would NOT take her to the casino but that she could go herself.) At the point I had had enough and lost my cool. I told her that I was in the verge of kicking her out but that I did not want to. I explained that I cannot get any space from her, physically emotionally or mentally. She didn't really respond. I gave her until the morning and said we would talk then.

The next morning she said she would try to give me space. I responded that I was sorry I lost my cool and that I didn't want to be a person who kicked her out. I told her she could stay until the end of June and I would not threaten her to be kicked out again with 2 exceptions. She was not allowed to smoke in my apartment and she could not bring back in her jacket that she wears when she goes out to smoke (she put her cigarette butts in the pocket and it reeks.) She agreed and offered to cook. I told her she didn't have to.

I got home and she had cooked a meal that didn't fit my diet. I felt guilty, so I ate it and now feel like shit. This morning I went to the bathroom and there sitting on the floor is her smoking jacket.

Still, my male relatives are very jealous of the girls in the family, probably due to background reasons but now we're living in Europe (I was born here). My second boyfriend was, to use an euphemism, not very appreciated by my brother. My brother often treated to tell about my bf to my father (he didn't know about him), or controlling my phone etc.

We broke up after a year or so on amicable terms, and my family, expecially my brother, was the major reason. We're still friends, though.

Fast forward to last Saturday evening, my brother has a part-time job in a pub (he helps his friend, a DJ) and was at work. I've gone there, wearing a pair of leggings, started smiling to a handsome man and met him. I let him kiss me on the neck and caress my butt. I know for many of you this is nothing, but for me it was an over the top thing. I saw my brother looking at me furiously, but he didn't act. After 20 minutes of kissing and caressing I left, giving a wrong number to my just met man.

On Sunday, my brother insulted me, saying things like ""Dad and Mom would kill themselves if they saw you doing that"", ""All of the people there now think you're a *"" (note: I was the only one wearing long pants there and I left alone).

About 2 years ago, my fiancé and I moved back to my hometown in NYC from Northern Illinois. While my mom and sister live in IL, about 90% of my family still lives in NYC. His immediate family all live in IL.

We made the decision we’d get married sooner than we originally planned on due to arising legal concerns. We’d go to the courthouse, elope, and have a ceremony later on where everyone can be involved (we also don’t have money to spare on a fancy party at the moment). When we shared the news of this idea to our families, my mom was 100% on board with the idea as she essentially already considered us married. His family, however, immediately got upset. They said it’s not fair that they have to miss seeing him get married, that they’re being excluded and feel left out. I had a baby in March, and they brought up that they weren’t a part of her birth and haven’t even been able to see her in person due to the distance. 

I understand their concerns, I really do. I tried to pitch ideas to them to compromise. I said we can wear wedding outfits and pay a photographer for a quick photoshoot — immediately shot down as that’s not a “proper” way to get married. I said we can video chat them during the signing, they (again) said that doesn’t count. I reminded them we’d have a ceremony in a year or two, but they said that’s technically a vow renewal and doesn’t count. I asked them if it was at all possible for them to fly in by August at the latest and we’d hold the tiniest, cheapest ceremony physically possible. Again, no. All their schedules conflict AND they’d need US to pay for their travel and hotel. 

I don’t want ANY family involved so everything’s 100% fair and no one can say “so-and-so was allowed! Why not me?” My fiancé agreed with me, saying it’s the best idea. My mom, who’s also far, says they’re making a big deal over nothing. However, his family will still be unhappy and complain about it “not being the same”. They’re contributing literally nothing towards their OWN travel or expenses and I feel they’ll get over it eventually. My fiancé says he just wants to keep them happy, but that seems impossible.

613,Not the A-hole,"This may be lengthy. I apologize in advance :P

Met a girl recently, I'll call her Jane, who I got along very well with. We met twice in person and texted a little every day for the last couple weeks, so still dont know a lot about each other.

The other evening were talking about our days and Jane texts how she was having a good day but then she went to dinner with a friend and had to wait a couple hours for food to come out and it ruined her day.

I say how I'm sorry that really sucks, I cant imagine what reason they could have for a 2hr wait time, and ask if the restaurant discounted anything. Jane says the restaurant wound up comping the meal, so I reiterate that I'm sorry she had to wait so long but on the bright side she got more time spent with a friend and also a free meal. This is where things get a little confusing for me.

Jane tells me finding a bright side is minimizing and invalidating. I'm a little taken back, I didnt mean to invalidate her experience just trying to find a silver lining. I apologize for coming off invalidating and that I was just trying to find the silver lining to try and help. I'm told sometimes there is no silver lining and it comes off as invalidating because it is.

I try to explain how I disagree with that. That in my personal experience a silver lining only comes off as invalidating when the person upset is not ready to be anything other than upset yet. In that time all they want is validation of their emotion, and since silver linings are not that, its treated negatively instead of how it's usually intended which is a form of support.

I hear nothing back.

The next morning when I wake up I apologize for making Jane's night worse. I try to explain that I wanted to be helpful and clearly failed. How I'm still getting to know her and I dont know what she responds well to when frustrated, so I went the route of what I want to hear in that situation- validation but also a bright side. How clearly that wasn't what she wanted, my bad, and I wished her a better day today.

Still nothing. Eventually I notice she unfriended me from Facebook and blocked me on the site we met on. Not sure what I said that would provoke such a reaction. 

I try and ask what happened and eventually she replies accusing me of mansplaining, tone policing, being critical and assuming, and that she would not like to continue contact with me anymore.

I said this feels like a pretty extreme overreaction to something we could have talked out, and that if shes going to act that way then it's probably for the best anyway.

614,Asshole,"Allright, so I have this coworker that I have now caught 3 times passing off Reddit jokes as his own.

The first time was about how he was eating at Burger King and the gay cashier told a customer not to be rude because he was gay and the customer told him wrong, that he likes dick too. I laughed, and then a couple hours later, saw the meme on here and just shook my head.

The second time, he related a story that someone asked when you knew your kid was really dumb and how some kid threw their shoe out the window and didn't want her dad to be mad. He said his little daughter did that. Again, I just shook my head and went about my business, as this time, I had literally just seen that post and actually read quite a few of the stories.

Then, just this morning, he really tried to say that he got a haircut to look like his friend when he was a little kid so their teacher couldn't tell them apart, but that his friend was black. This time,  another one of my coworkers looked at me wide eyed and I told her that was the 3rd time I've caught him stealing internet jokes and passing them off as my own. She said, oh yeah, thats a Reddit joke. 

So, would I be the asshole if I call this guy out for being so unoriginal?

EDIT: I have thoroughly enjoyed all your responses. I wasn't expecting such strong emotions. I can't reply to each comment, but this was really a hypothetical AITA. My other coworker and I were laughing so hard about making a post on this sub. Anyways, I don't know how you guys got that I was upset or angry or bothered by this, the only type of way I feel about it is just it is what it is.

615,Asshole,"My husband has been donating 10% of his pay cheque to charity ever since he left college. He has justified it by saying he wants to make a positive impact on the world in his life and this is easiest way to do that. If it matters, He donates to a range of different charities that mostly focus on providing education/healthcare to children in developing nations.

I don’t like this as we have a mortgage/kids and there’s no reason for him to throw away 10% of his pay cheque like that. I’ve asked him to stop multiple times and he always says the same thing: “we don’t need the money anyway.”

While we don’t NEED it, it would be nice to build up our savings. So I finally demanded he stop throwing away his money and he just gave me a look and said “I’m disappointed in you.”

617,Not the A-hole,"I (based in Canada) recently bought something through eBay from a seller in the UK. The seller had set the shipping cost to be 35GBP from UK to Canada, which I considered to be a reasonable shipping charge. I complete payment and all is well. 

After the seller shipped my item, he reports back stating that shipping actually costed him 70GBP, and I only paid half of that. He hasn't outright asked, but on several occasions (3 separate messages), he's brought up the discrepancy of what I paid from his original listing vs what he actually paid at the post office. I've ignored all of his messages from the point of him first mentioning the shipping costs.

619,Not the A-hole,"My mom has been with her boyfriend around 6-7 years, they fight most of the time and every so often they have massive blow-up fights that get ugly. They fight about the same things all the time and it's just a vicious, repetitive cycle. They become verbally abusive to each other and have gotten physical in the past. 

In the 3 months I've been living with them, maybe 4-5 times I've been watching tv when he's come home. He usually gets home around 4:30 but sometimes shows up whenever. One night around 7:30 my mom and I were sitting in the kitchen and I put a hockey game on, he came home, didn't say anything to either of us, walked to the couch, picked up the remote and changed the channel without even asking if we were watching anything. Another time I was off work for the day and it was 2 in the afternoon and he came home and went upstairs for the rest of the night apparently because I was watching tv, but if he said he wanted to watch I would have had let him have the tv. My sister made a huge deal that I was in his space and shouldn't be watching tv, and my mom said whenever he comes home I should just go to the basement. I said it's unfair that everyone should have to bend to his will just because he gets upset at the smallest things, and he could just say he wanted to watch tv and I'd have no problem. My mom agreed with me that he was being ridiculous and rude, and I said I would not let him get whatever he wants just because he's a baby about it. 

So fast forward a bit and the 2 of them were fighting again and he called my mother a whore among other things, I guess my tv watching was somehow a part of it as well. They got into a massive fight when I was out of the house for an entire day, my mom said she ripped his shirt and the dog gate to the kitchen was smashed and she told me I had gotten my wish because he might never be coming back. Shame on me for thinking my mom had finally come to her senses because it lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and then a couple days ago she told me he was coming back and all of a sudden was framing it like me watching tv was the only reason they had fought and I was the issue. I told my mom I'm just not going to up and leave whenever he gets home, and if he wants the tv and I'm watching something, then he can say so and I'll have no issue. Apparently this was way out of line on my end and now my mom is telling him she hates me, that I'm lazy and I deserve nothing. I'm really confused by this 180 because she had no problem agreeing with what I said 2 weeks prior, but now her and my sister are painting me as the villain.

This morning he tried to tell me that what him and my mom had was ""different"" and that he cares for her deeply, and I can use whatever I want, but to understand that it's his space. I told him ""I don't care for you because you called my mother a whore"" and left, he hasn't said anything to me since and my mom hasn't spoken to me since he came back and I'm left wondering how I'm the bad guy

621,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I don’t want my other account to have pregnancy stuff on it. 

Last year I spent the year in France. I just turned 17. When I was in France I had a boyfriend for the last 8 months. About a month before I left we slept together (for the first time) and I fell pregnant with twins. I didn’t find out until after I came back to Australia.

My ex boyfriend and I (we broke up purely because it would be stupid to have a long distance relationship when we’re both teenagers) have agreed so far on basically everything baby related. His family are very very wealthy and his parents are determined to give their future grandkids the best of everything so they have bought basically everything so far (cribs, bassinets, strollers, all the big items). They also signed off on a legal document saying they will give me a set amount of money each month until the babies are 18. The babies dad is also paying child support out of his own money so I’m getting two sets of payment. He sends me packages of baby clothes, toys, nappies all the time.

He is planning on going to uni in Australia in 2 years time (after he’s finished high school in France) and so far we have agreed on basically everything regarding the twins. We are still really good friends and we talk every night and I send him baby updates etc. all the time. He wants to be a part of the twins life and he is trying to get australian residency. 

The only thing we haven’t agreed on is names. He wants very traditional french names but I don’t. They’re hard to pronounce if you don’t know french and I want people to be able to pronounce their names without me telling them how to. He wants Alèxis or Sacha for the boy twin but for me those names are girl names. For the baby girl he wants Camillé but it is pronounced “cami” and I don’t like it. My top choices are currently Oliver and Esme. I’m willing to compromise and told him some french names I like and are easily pronounced but he is set on having traditional french names. He says it will basically be the only tie they have to France (he knows I’m going to be speaking French to them and teaching them french from a young age). Names are a big thing to me but obviously they are to him as well. I don’t want to settle just to make him happy and then regret it later

I get a snap at 1 am of her and the guy she was with before me. No messages and her phones off. So I load her dogs up and some things to take to her parents and pass his house on the way and her cars there. I proceed to load my trailer with all her things and get ready to go when she calls.

So get home and she calls at about 6am wondering what's going on. Proceeds to explain he called her friend and they needed someone to take them home since they were plastered and him and his friend drove her car to his house and let them sleep it off there. 

She gets home and immediately pulls all the cards to make me feel like I'm a POS.
I don't trust her, I don't care what happens to her, I overreacted, I got her parents involved, and I could've waited till she got home to speak to her.

She did show me her phone and he didn't call her surprisingly but he snapped her right then ironically saying he left his pistol in the car...

I don't know whether I believe her or not since she had a manic meltdown but this could be done out of manipulation. Then goes on to say she doesn't want to lose her best friend and why would she cheat when she has me at home blah blah blah all the dumb things you would say then

629,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday was my 20th birthday, and my boyfriend bought me a car. My boyfriend is 22. He has been pestering me for the entire relationship (18 months) to pass my driving test. Three weeks ago, I started my lessons, pretty much just to shut him up about it. I don't have much ambition to drive, as the public transport around me is easier, cheaper, and just more preferable for me. 

About four weeks ago, he asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I told him that I wanted the new Lewis Capaldi vinyl in the limited edition red. It came out not long before my birthday, so to me it seemed like a fine gift, and fairly reasonably priced. 

I woke up on my birthday to him having messaged me saying to go to his at some point. So, I spent the morning with my parents, and then got the tube to his place. He met me outside, with a huge grin on his face. He told me to follow him, and took me into his apartments car park. He then pointed to a Mini Cooper in his space, and said Happy Birthday! I was just kind of surprised, so when he asked me what I thought, I just said ""I haven't even passed my theory yet"". Looking back, I probably should have said something else, but I really did not know what to think. He then told me to go and look on the passenger seat, where the Lewis Capaldi CD was. He said it was so I could listen to it in the car. I don't have a CD player, other than the car now I guess. 

Basically, this gift is more of a burden to me than anything else. I live in a terraced house with my family, who already park in front, so I have nowhere to put the car, no way to pay for it, and no ambition to even drive it. I did thank him, and did not say any of this to him, but I was complaining to my sister, who told me I was being an ungrateful bitch and should be thankful he got me anything, which I am! I just would've preferred that he spent the £25 on what I actually wanted rather than £1500 (plus the £10 for the CD) on something that I can't even use. My parents agree with her.

Whenever he walks into the room, his smell permeates the room, and I have a sensitive nose and can't handle it. Breathing through my shirt is hard.

I tried telling my advisory teacher but she said, ""you're just gonna have to deal with it.""

Well I dealt with it alright. I used to put essential oils on my nose/shirt to block his smell, but one day I forgot them and he smelt especially bad, so I wrote on a whiteboard by the door ""Showers are beneficial! Take one today!"" because I've had enough. I don't have to put up with someone else's lack of hygiene.

2 days later, I get implicated with two other people for bullying and talk with the assistant principal. I explained that I don't know who the other two people are, and that when I wrote what I did, I had no ill intent, and tried to assertively but anonymously tell him to shower, because he has bad hygiene.

The assistant principal then told me that he could have bad odor due to illness or digestion, and she let me off with a warning.

Illness? You still need to shower. Digestion? Still need to shower, and change up your diet.

We are very excited, and are soon going to discuss what we both expect from each other upon moving in, and how things will work between us. For instance, meal times, chores between us, etc. One thing that I am planning on bringing up is some of his friends which I do not want to come round whilst I am there. I just don't know if this makes me an asshole or not. 

Basically, most of my boyfriends friends are lovely. I get on with them really well, they are super welcoming and accepting of me, and I don't feel uncomfortable around them at all. There are even some that I have established my own relationship with without my boyfriend. However, there are three of his friends who make me incredibly uncomfortable, each for different reasons. 

Friend 1 is super creepy. He makes jokes which make me cringe and feel uncomfortable. He is so embarrassing to be out in public with. He sits way too close to you. He is also super nosy and insulting to both mine and my boyfriends things.

Friend 2 is just plain weird to the point where it makes me uncomfortable. He makes comments about things which I completely disagree with, but tells me I'm wrong because I'm ""a girl so I have no idea what I'm talking about"". He thinks he is superior because he knows all about Eastern European culture (we are American). He always cuts me off and talks about things which he knows I know nothing about, deliberately to leave me out.

Friend 3 is someone I went to school with, and he hated me. He made my life in school a living hell. He would bully me and insult me all the time for being fat. Basically, we don't see eye to eye. He seems to have changed now, but still isn't someone I want to spend my evenings with. 

I have absolutely no issue with my boyfriend being friends with these people. I have friends who he wouldn't be friends with, and that is completely fine. And if he told me that he didn't want to be around them, then I would understand personally. I also have no issue with them being round if I am not there. I don't not trust any of them around my things, or think they would disrespect the house in any way, I just don't want to be around them.

He is Married himself but has said that his wife is away that night with a friend of hers so can't go with him.

The location of the funeral is 2.5 hours away and he has said that he will stay overnight as he would like a drink after the wake. He has said that he will pay for a hotel room for her and will also buy her dinner to say thank you.

She met this person at work and has known him for less than a year. He no longer works with her, but they have stayed in contact. In the last couple of months, she has been on a couple of nights out with him in group situations but has met up with him first, so she doesn't turn up on her own. She has also met up with him a couple of times in the day, the last time she met up with him they went shopping and had lunch together and was gone for 6 hours which she doesn't even do with me. She told me the day before that she was meeting up with him for shopping and lunch and asked if I mind, I was working from home that week so I said that I need to eat too so I could meet them for lunch. I also said that this guy makes me feel jealous. The next day comes and I thought she would either cancel on him because of how I felt or would offer an invite to come and meet them for lunch to make me feel more at ease, but I got nothing. After she got home, I discussed it with her again and she ended up getting angry with me and told me I was over reacting, and I need to get over it.

I have been with my partner for nearly 8 years and we are getting married in less than a month. I do trust her, and she has never given me any reason not to. She is always honest with me and can never keep something to herself, if she has a guilty conscious about something, she will always own up and tell me. She has never done anything seriously wrong like cheat on me.

Even though I do trust her, I am only human and, I do feel jealous. If this was a female friend of hers, I would not be having these thoughts however this situation doesn't sit well with me. I don't know what his wife is doing with her friend but if a loved one of mine needed emotional support I would have to have a very good reason why I can't cancel or rearrange plans with a friend.

They may be the last ones from this artisan in existence that have not been broken, altered, cleaned, painted and have been stored properly and I have the signed receipt of delivery from 1745. The value of these to the right collector could be off the charts. I have a signed and notorized affidavit from ex's grandma saying she was giving them to me as part of her estate.

Essentially, me and my bf said that we were going to go to an escape room when they first started to become popular. Life got ahead of us, and being long distance meant that we never got a chance to. He and his family ended up going to one for one of their birthdays, and whilst I was slightly upset about not being able to experience it together for the first time for us both, it was no big deal, as it wasn't the one that we had shown an interest in together. A year or so has passed, and we still haven't got round to going together. He then mentioned to me that his friend is planning on going to the exact one we planned to go to for his birthday, and my boyfriend said he didn't really want to go, but probably will. I had a bit of a moan at him about me always missing out on things, to which he called me unreasonable, so I dropped it. I don't very often complain at him for doing things without me, but he does quite often go places we planned to try out together, and then brushes it off when I am upset about it. I don't care that he does things which we have already done, or that he sees his friends or whatever, just that he can't seem to wait for me to try new things. I know the escape room situation is different, as he didn't get to choose what it is, but not only can he not really afford it, but he doesn't really even want to go with his friends.

My wife and I work together, and are together nearly 24/7. Recently we have been trying to do more fun activities and hang out with friends because our work has been so busy that we feel like we should be more social. My wife has mentioned a need to make friends and be hang with other people besides me. She has always been more isolated and I have always had a big support group of friends and family. So far this has been going well. We’ve definitely been making progress. 

Well yesterday the idea of wife swapping came up (sexually not the TV show). She said she would be interested but I got a slightly off vibe from her. Last night after my wife fell asleep I decide to act on my hunch and began reading through her text messages. To my surprise I found a text thread dating back a few months between my wife and a supplier that we buy from for our work, let’s call him Fred. 

The conversation started very professional but turned more friendly quickly and within the last few weeks they have sent pictures of each other back and forth. Nothing explicitly sexual but my wife sent pics of her tattoos when the subject came up and they are in more revealing places like the ribs, “pee-pee pointer” and lower back. She had to lift her shirt to take these photos, no boobs. Then, last night while I was out working on a project with friends she sent Fred a picture of her laying in bed eating Cheetos. She sent me the same picture while I was out with a kissy face. 

I admit that I am not always there for her and I use my phone to take mental breaks as we spend almost 100% of our time together but she says I don’t talk to her and she has no friends so she resorted to this. She said she would never cheat on me. But I believe she was sending these pics to try to escalate the situation. Fred kept it somewhat professional and did not try to escalate things although I believe my wife would have if he asked for more pics or tried to make it sexual. She’s upset that I went though her phone.

EDIT: So far it’s unanimous I am TA for snooping. But that doesn’t change the fact that I feel wronged in this situation as well. Any real advice on how to move forward from here?

EDIT: Update - First of all, thanks to everyone who chimed in. No one said anything toxic which I appreciate. It was nice to hear people support me and also helpful to hear people defend my wife from her perspective. I feel I’ve gained insight from everyone who posted. 

For those of you who may be interested, my wife and I took the day off work together and enjoyed some activities and meals together. We talked about the situation and she has agreed that she will cut off communication with Fred immediately. She still feels it was friendly conversation but understands that I have boundaries especially when It comes to sending pictures back and forth. I have apologized for snooping and admitted that there are some insecurity issues there I need to work on. These issues likely tie into me being emotionally unavailable at times. We are both open to couples counseling and while we don’t have anything scheduled at the moment this will be the first thing that happens if another issue arises.

I'm a gay man and I'm married to a man who is pan/bisexual. How he identifies is essentially pansexual with a strong preference for males.

We communicate our feelings, desires, and frustrations very well normally and respect each other's needs and concerns. However I feel like I'm being selfish with a recent issue I experienced and I'm concerned I may have ignored his feelings and needs.

We both use pornography, together and separately. We genuinely don't have an issue if one of us is in the mood, and the other isn't. We also aren't particularly private with each other, and I have never been uncomfortable with him using pornography or masturbating while we're in the same room; with one exception.

During instances where I've noticed him using heterosexual porn I get incredibly uncomfortable. I've reflected on this for quite a while and I've tried to identify exactly what I'm feeling and best guesses are feeling, self conscious, inadequate, and regrettably disgust also.

I'd like to be clear. I am not disgusted by women. I fully accept bisexuality and pansexuality. So naturally I feel quite a bit of shame at my own reaction.

Despite my own principles I asked my husband to not use heterosexual porn. Am I an asshole? Was I wrong?

His response was pretty mild, he didn't fully understand, but he agreed to my request.

Edit1:  it may be important to note that I asked him to not use it, there wasn't a demand. If he had said no to my request I would have accepted that.

Edit2: I've spoken with the husband and admitted I was wrong. I am glad you guys were able to help me confirm my own insecurities and also accept that my feelings were valid. I'm going to work on my own insecurities and have informed him that my request has been officially retracted.",37,36,0.66

643,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post on reddit and it’s gonna be a little lengthy so you all understand my situation.

Growing up, my cousin (let’s call her Sara) and I were really close. The older we got though, it seemed like we just grew farther and farther apart. Many arguments and disagreements later, she deleted me from social media and didn’t speak to me for a long time. My father was upset about this and never let it go. When Sara got engaged, I wasn’t invited to the engagement party. My father lied and told Sara I was upset about this (I could’ve cared less) while also telling me that Sara “really wanted me to go,” and this created a lot of drama. In the end Sara and I both agreed my father caused drama and she said I could come if I wanted. I had better things to do so I didn’t go. 

Months later, I get a wedding invite, surprise surprise. Again, I’m confused because we literally don’t talk. Ever. We’re at the point of being “Facebook friends” but that’s about it. 

I brought up the concerns to my father and he keeps telling me to “give it one last chance.” But why? I genuinely don’t care enough to, and I don’t think she does either. After talking a lot about my concerns he slipped up and revealed that my aunt was the one who made her put me on the invite. Hearing this is what made me just say “fuck it.” I’m over it. 

My father is already really upset that I’ve decided not to go. He’s tried manipulating me by telling me that one day I’ll need her (which is absolute bullshit, she’s never done anything good for me in my life). My mother on the other hand completely understands, as my anxiety is terrible and I feel extremely uncomfortable in a place I’m not wanted.  

I don’t mean any harm at all. I love my family, but I don’t need to and absolutely will not spend $400 on a flight, some more money for a new dress, and the time and effort it takes into doing my hair and makeup. For someone who didn’t even want me to go? Fuck that. 

In conclusion, I’m just worried about my family being upset with me and shunning me. Then again I’m already shunned by them for having tattoos and piercings so this would only give them a reason to gossip. 

Shortened version: My cousin and I aren’t close, my aunt forced my cousin to invite me to her wedding, so I don’t want to go. We don’t ever even talk. Am I the asshole?",55,307,0.94

645,Not the A-hole,"I just moved into my new apartment a few months ago and there was this small restaurant nearby that I frequently had breakfast or dinner at. The owner is a young lady who always looks like she hates her job so much. She never smiles and one time at the counter when I left my wallet on one of the tables and ran back to get it, I could hear her heave a loud sigh impatiently behind me. 

Later I found out that she participated in a charity for animals and once and sometimes twice a month she would put up a charity poster on the wall behind the counter, with pictures of hurt and abused animals on it, and whenever I paid in cash, she would very nicely, with a wide smile on her face, ask me if I would like to donate half of the spare change to the charity (only if the change was less than a dollar though). I mean I love animals so I was always okay with that. Sometimes I would even donate a dollar or two and even more. 
So the only time she ever acted nice was when she would ask for donation. Other times, she would always go back to being all unfriendly and cold. But I thought like well she may not be friendly but at least she cares about the welfare of abused animals. 

Last week though, I was in a hurry and after finishing my breakfast, I walked to the counter and I realized I did not have my wallet with me. So I told her about it and asked if it would be okay with her that I drove back to my apartment 3 blocks from there to get my wallet. It would take  less than 10 minutes and I would even leave my phone with her so she believed that I was not trying to mess with her. 

I could see the mental gears grinding to a halt. As if she thought that I was trying to run away and not pay for my meal. She coldly asked me to leave my car key as well. I had no other option so I left my phone and my key with her and started running back to my apartment because I did not want to be late for work. 

The following week, again she looked friendly when I came and of course there was another charity poster on the wall. When I went to the counter, she asked me if I would like to donate half of the spare change. I said yes but this time I also proceeded to tell her to at least try to act a little nicer to her customers all the time, as opposed to being friendly only when she needed donation from them. 
She did not take it well and told me very harshly that I did not have to donate my money if I did not want to. So I left immediately. Am I The Asshole Here?",41,236,0.95

So here's some context for this story:
Me (21F) and my BF (23M) have been dating for over 3 years now, we're both fans of a game called League of Legends, I do amateur cosplays in my free time

So here's the story: around a few months ago, we were playing the game like we do almost daily, we were pretty bored and decided we would do a friendly bet (he told me the idea), we would do a 1v1 and the loser has to do anything for the winner.

So him being 10x better than me, he easily beat me and immediately told me his favor, it was okay for now, All I had to was putting on my old Katarina (his favorite champion) cosplay for the rest of the day

After another 1v1 that I lost he again immediately asked me his favor, a blow job, I never did one in my life, nor did I ever actually have sex, I immediately refused it, but he got pissed that we agreed to do anything, after a bit we did make up but I still don't think he forgave me. 

So am I the asshole? I feel bad because we did agree to doing anything, my boyfriend was always a bit sexual but I think he took it a bit too far here.",348,460,0.87

Daughter has decided she wants to be a vegetarian. I love meat and it’s very rare for me to go without some kind of meat at dinner. 

My daughter naturally expects me to accommodate and cook vegetarian options for dinner too. I told her that if she wants to be vegetarian she can make her own dinner.

Wife told me I should cook veggie dinners for her, but shut up quickly after I asked if she wanted to start cooking dinner instead.

Naturally I am now the asshole in all of this.

648,Not the A-hole,"I'm not against singing and dancing and enjoying yourself. If it is at home i would encourage it even. In public i hate attention and can't stand people looking at me, if it's not just a passerby-look. My GF knows this but says singing and dancing is great and everyone should do it more, which i aggree with - just not in public, when I'm with her - that's all i ask for.

She does it regularly in the city, supermarkets, etc. She just sings or dances. She doesn't dance badly but it's nothing special and some of the moves are just embarrassing. Her singing is another story - she is completely tone deaf and knows it. She knows it sounds terrible but doesn't hear it herself.

People just look at us and watch or listen and make comments and i hate it. I just want her to stop when im with her. But she won't. AITA here?

651,Everyone Sucks,"Background:

&#x200B;

Before getting married, wife and I decided to pool all income.  All necessities and all other essential accounts...all maxed out and came from the house pool.  Whatever was left over we split 50/50 and that was fun money to be used at our discretion.  As we've earned more, fun money has grown.  I earn 80% of household income.

&#x200B;

I dislike my job, but I'm good at it and it pays very well.  My wife loves what she does.  She has said she will never do something she hates, and will always work in a creative field even if it means less money.  I busted my ass at something I didn't like because it afforded us to live a lifestyle that she really wanted.  Most people dislike their jobs, but they do it because they have bills.  I just accept it and move on.

&#x200B;

Current:

&#x200B;

Myself and my wife (Marty and Megan) went to dinner with my wife's coworker/close friend and her husband (Fran and Fred).  Megan and Fran are going on a vacation to Europe this summer when school is out (they're both teachers) so they started talking about their trip.  Fred said, ""Hey Marty, I just wanted to say thanks.  We would never be able to afford a trip like this if you didn't allow Megan to pay for most of it.""  Megan snapped, ""Actually its my money.  The fact that he makes a lot more than me is irrelevant.  We put all of our money together.  We both take an equal amount which is 'fun money' and what I spend my money on is none of his business.""  I felt like that was a little rude and unnecessary.

&#x200B;

Fred then asked me what do I usually spend my fun money on.  I told him that I just invest it.  Megan likes to spend on clothes, cars, vacations, and gifts while I invest.  I'm doing extremely well overall, and I'm in a good position to be able to retire at 45.  As soon as we got in the car to leave, Megan lost her shit.  She had no idea I had that kinda money.  I've never said an exact overall dollar amount, but anyone that invests knows thats not exactly how it works.  She's seen statements of my bank account, and I've told her about investments that have done well, and have not done so well...but overall she's not interested and never asks for details.  I reminded her that its my money, and what I spend my money on is none of her business.

&#x200B;

She is more pissed that I want to stop working as soon as I can afford to by myself, while ""making"" her work.  I'll still contribute just as much money to all of our other accounts.  She'll still be able to live the lifestyle she's accustomed to.  I'll just be managing our investments from home, while pursuing other hobbies.  She asked me how I could sleep at night knowing I would just lay in bed all day while I watch my wife slave away at work for 10 more years.  The same way you slept at night going on lavish vacations with your friends while I stayed at home to watch netflix?  We both made our own decisions with our own money.

&#x200B;

Who is the ASSHOLE?  

&#x200B;

Edit:  We've talked about retirement.  She knows the only reason I work is for money.  When we first married, I mapped everything out to ensure we could live just fine by retiring at 65.  Our retirement accounts are very healthy, so now we can do so at 55.  We're both already retiring 10 years earlier than expected thanks to smart investing.  The only difference is that I'm now also focused on saving fun money to retire even earlier.",50,38,0.96

653,No A-holes here,"Hi everyone. I've had this conflict for the longest of time.

&#x200B;

I am now a senior in college and I finished high school about 5-6 years ago. During semester break, some of my classmates would go back to our high school, meet our teachers, school administrators and juniors to share experience, advice, guidance, etc. They say that they want to contribute back to the school because the school has given much to us the students. I can't deny the fact that as a student there, I have received so much from the school. Good education, got paired with a research mentor and went to an international school conference. 

&#x200B;

Upon knowing that I'm on semester break, the school counselor commented on my Facebook to come visit the school. Everyone from administrators, counselors, teachers, alumni and current students are friends on Facebook and I am not a fan of this. I have nothing against the school. I do acknowledge that the school has given me an education, but I'm just not the type to visit back my school after being out of it for so long. It's like how Andy Bernard keeps talking about Cornell, and I'm the total opposite of that. But with the counselor and the school alumni association keep pushing the narrative that students need to contribute back to the school, I feel like I'm TA for being forgetful of my roots (as how the alumni association puts it).

654,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday a kid knocked on my door and asked if I wanted my lawn mowed for $10. I’d mowed fairly recently but admired his entrepreneurial spirit so said sure. 

After about 15 minutes he comes to my door and says he’s all done. My yard isn’t huge but it usually takes me a solid half hour to mow, more like 45 if I’m really mindful of the edges and corners, so I was a bit suspicious. 

I went out to look and it was mowed in haphazard blocky patches, with some large areas totally untouched. I told him he was off to a good start but that I wasn’t satisfied with how he’d only mowed certain parts and I needed a uniform cut. 

He said it looked good to him, so I said it was fine if he didn’t want to finish the job but I’d need my $10 back. 

He started accusing me of taking advantage of him and I said I was happy to pay him if he actually mowed my lawn but if he wasn’t going to do the job I wasn’t going to pay him. 

He said he wouldn’t give me back my $10. I told him I couldn’t force him to return my money but that I’d make a point of warning the whole neighborhood not to use his services. 

He begrudgingly gave back the $10. My husband had to remow the lawn which, like I said, I had just done recently anyways. 

A few hours after the kid left his dad showed up and demanded I give the kid the $10 back. I told him I couldn’t pay him for mowing my lawn because he didn’t finish and I would have to mow it just to even everything out and keep it from being an eye sore.

He railed about how his son was just trying to make honest money over the summer to pay for AirPods and asking me why I would try to discourage him from working. 

I offered to give him $5 since he did start the job but the dad refused and badmouthed me to everyone who lives around here. 

Several people who know me confronted me about it and it was a 50/50 split of people who wanted to let me know he was spreading lies about me stiffing his young son and people who wanted to know why I would be so hard on a kid with good intentions. 

I do think it’s great the kid is going out and trying to earn some money. Maybe I should’ve been more clear about my concerns with how he handled the job. 

I was dead set that I was in right before, especially after offering $5, but the contestation of some of my friends has gotten me to reconsider since he’s just a kid and maybe had never been shown how to properly mow a lawn.

655,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

Some background: My sister is high functioning Autistic. She is very smart, kind, talented, beautiful, and REALLY outgoing. She has some behavioral issues and some anxiety issues, and has in the past been prone to violent meltdowns (she has gotten much better in the past couple of years, but she still has flair ups of meltdowns/tantrums). Ever since I was little I have helped watch her and take care of her. We pretty much have a Nani/Lilo relationship dynamic. I spent a BIG chunk of my childhood watching and taking care of her while one of my parents worked. For a while I was the only one able to help calm her down when she had meltdowns. 

About a year ago, I was offered a job I couldn't refuse. It's pretty much jumpstarted my future and I feel so blessed and grateful for the opportunity. However, the job is out of state, far away from my home. It's been really hard on my sister, and I miss her like crazy. I have never been gone over a month without seeing her before this. 

A couple months ago, I decided to surprise her and come home for her birthday. I was going to come home the night before, wake her up in the morning, and take her out to do a bunch of girly things that she likes. Everyone else knows and they've been very good about keeping this a secret. However, she really wants me to come home for her birthday. Last night she called me and asked me if I could come home all teary and my heart broke. I told her I would see what I can do. Now, I'm not sure what I should do. I feel like it would be a dick move to keep pretending like I might not, but I really want to see the look on her face when I surprise her for her birthday.

The reason also why I'm asking if I would be in asshole is there's the risk I could inconvenience my parents if my sister has a meltdown. Her birthday is still a week and a half out, so if I waited it out that could mean a week of my sister being upset and a week of my parents having to help calm her down and make her feel better. And like I said earlier, her tantrums have been violent in the past and involve hours of reassurance. It really takes a toll on my parents.

My aunt and uncle think I should keep the plan and go through with it. My boyfriend (who also has an Autistic sibling), thinks that it would be a dick move and that I should tell her. 

TL;DR: I'm planning on surprising my little sister by coming home for her birthday, but she's starting to get upset and sad due to the fact that she thinks I'm not coming. I really want to surprise her, but if I go through with it I could cause my sister to have multiple meltdowns beforehand and force my parents to deal with it. I've been planning this for a month and I don't want to tell her, but it could affect her and my parent's negativity.

WIBTA if I didn't tell her?

EDIT: It's also important for me to note that she actually really enjoys surprises. I'm aware that many Autistic people normally need to be informed about bug events beforehand so that they can stick to their schedule and aren't blindsided. It's the opposite for my sister. Nornally, we only tell her before something big happens a couple of days before (if not on the day). Her anxiety causes her to build bigger events up in her head and she tends to get very nervous and upset that something will go wrong with it, which then leads to a meltdown (if not multiple). I wouldn't even entertain the surprise idea if I didn't know that my sister would enjoy it. The only thing I'm concerned about is if me not telling her now would cause her distress about me possibly not coming

Also thank you so much for all the replies! I will get around to replying to all. I appreciate all the advice you guys are giving me. I'll update when I decide what to do


EDIT 2: I took some of your advice and I told my sister I was coming down. I asked her if it was alright that I didn't tell her which day I was coming, so that I could surprise her. She said she would be okay with that. You guys were right, it was uncool of me to put my sister at risk of being upset for a surprise. I am arriving the day before her birthday. I'm very excited to see her, and if anyone is interested I'll post an update after her birthday is over :) thanks again for all the great advice!",39,92,0.99

The thing is, I wasn’t planning on ordering anything, but my friend asked if I could drive her because she wanted to get a light snack. 

We go into drive thru, and I order for her. PLEASE NOTE, she’s a very picky eater, and she can’t handle getting her order wrong or eating foods that aren’t the correct flavour or type. 

I order for her, I strongly remember saying “m&m McFlurry” through the speaker, not Oreo (she hates Oreo).

When we pull to the window, my other friend is working, and he gladly asks if I wanted a free extra one. I said sure why not, and I asked for an Oreo one. So me and my friend expected an Oreo and an m&m.

(Key info, my friend who is working at the McDonald’s drive thru has a bad history with my friend in the car)

Unfortunately, the ice cream machine stopped working after the first McFlurry was created, but my friend had made MY Oreo McFlurry first, not my friend’s m&m. 

I start to feel really bad, and I asked my friend if she wanted anything else and we drove off. I told her how upsetting that was, and how unfortunate the machine broke and my friend decided to make my free order first before hers.

But he's never really been interested in my personal stuff--relationships, friends, etc.  I love both my parents to bits.

Stop me if you've heard this one before--""I don't care what people do, just don't shove it in my face!""  I'd actually never heard this out of my dad's mouth before.  There was a bit when he thought my brother might be gay (he's not), but he'd seemed pretty ok then.  I was taken by surprise, and once my mom explained to me what he was saying and what he was complaining about, and I kinda snapped at my mom, ""Well, no.  He either 'doesn't care' or feels it's being 'shoved in his face.'  It can't be both; pick one.""  My mom agreed with me and kinda laughed; meanwhile I can hear my dad going on in the background, and suddenly I couldn't take anymore and just said, ""you know what, mom, I gotta go; I'm working and I have stuff to do"" and just hung up abruptly, then burst into tears as soon as I was off the phone, surprising myself.  


My parents are not conservative or religious. And somehow this  makes it worse to me?

660,Everyone Sucks,"Prom is coming up, and I had I was all prepared. My mother had bought me a dress in November that I loved at the time. It was dark red and fitted, and only cost $150 (a small miracle by prom standards). For context, I have body dysmorphia, so I tend to avoid fitted clothing as it makes me so anxious it can trigger a panic attack. I thought the red dress would be a good exercise in self-acceptance, but as prom got closer, I couldn't deny the fact that I hated how I looked in it. I genuinely wanted to like it and spent months trying it on almost daily to convince myself it wasn't that bad, but I ultimately began dreading prom.

&#x200B;

I decided to tell my mother, hoping that we could find a dress together that didn't make me anxious. She was understanding overall, and once I got my work schedule I was going to set a date to go shopping with her.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. My birthday is coming up, so I made plans to take a walk with my stepmom and catch up. She gave me a card with $100 in it, but our walk couldn't happen because it started raining. As we were talking, I mentioned looking for a new prom dress, and she told me she had seen an ad for a consignment store that had 50% off prom dresses. We went to the store out of curiosity - I had no firm plans to buy a dress today - but as soon as we walked in, I saw The Dress. It was dark blue with silver accents, it fit me like a glove, and it was only $100. The best part was that I actually felt beautiful in it. Coincidentally, I had $100 of birthday money burning a hole in my pocket, so I bought it. Even though I said she shouldn't, my stepmother told me she would reimburse me, as she wanted me to spend the $100 on a birthday gift to myself rather than a prom dress.

&#x200B;

I texted my mother to let her know, but she ignored my messages. When I asked if she was upset, she responded, ""Why would I be upset?"" so I assumed everything was fine. When she picked me up later for a small birthday dinner, I wanted to show her the dress, but she said she wasn't even willing to discuss it, as she wanted dinner to be enjoyable. I respected her wishes, and our dinner went well.

&#x200B;

Later, I asked if we could discuss why she was upset. She told me I should wear the dress I already have, and that she found it offensive that I had bought a new one. I reminded her of the anxiety I was having about the red dress, and that, despite the fact that I was grateful that she bought it for me, I wanted to feel comfortable in my own skin. She said she saw my actions as a ""personal slight"", and that she expected me to pay her back in full for the red dress regardless of whether or not I could return it. I agreed and asked to put this behind us, and now she isn't speaking to me.

&#x200B;

I understand that the process of shopping for a prom dress is special and happens only once, but at the end of the day I want to like the way I look at prom. At the same time, I don't want to seem ungrateful or disrespectful.

I told her to give me a minute to think, I said they had sugar and oats and chocolate and sunflower butter and asked if that made it vegan. She said it depended on the chocolate I told her the brand and she said it was good. Later in the night another person at the party asked me for the recipe.

He’s a great kid and really adds some much needed comic relief and lightheartedness to a team that has always been super serious and has had issues with chemistry. 

He’s shown up to every practice and worked as really hard to pick up the sport but even though our team is really undermanned (15 players in total) he never sees action on the field. 

We recently played a game against a weaker team and we were up by 10 in the 4th quarter. By this time the other team had put their backup goalie in to prevent their starter from getting hurt. He finally got in the game and by some miracle got wide open and scored a pretty impressive goal from about 12-15 yards away (for those of you who don’t understand lacrosse, this is basically like shooting a 3 pointer in basketball, except not worth any extra points). 

When he scored, our whole team went crazy and jumped all over him. We got a penalty for excessively celebrating but we really didn’t care, it was great to see our friend finally score. 

However, I did feel kinda bad about it after because even though it wasn’t our intention, we basically rubbed in an already bad loss for the other team.

AITA or Are WE the assholes for celebrating a pointless goal by a water boy like it was a game winner? 

TLDR: Kid who has never stepped on the field scored a goal in a game that we were already winning by 10 and we mobbed him like he scored a game winner",20,27,0.89
664,Not the A-hole,"Hello good people of Reddit, I am in need of some advice. I've been working in hotels for about 6 years now and the one I'm currently working at has to be the most disorganized one if I've ever worked in. When I was hired I was asked how I felt about working the overnight shift. The position involves working from 11 pm to 7 am. it involves a lot of finical paperwork for management and baby sitting a dead hotel until the creak of dawn. I told her I wouldn't be against learning how it works (big mistake) but also told my manager that doing overnights is difficult as I don't have a car have to rely on my roommates to bring me to work and pick me up in the morning. Additionally, working overnights makes my depression and anxiety do really weird things. So in an essence, i told her no that I couldn't be relied on to work overnights. 

A few weeks after starting one of our overnight people announces that she is leaving. My boss texts me saying that I will be training to take her place. She wanted me to work one full shift and then half a shift the ext night. Naturally I tell my boss what I told her when I started. She assured me that it would only be temporary until we hire a new overnighter. I said it better stay temporary or else I'm not going to be very happy. I work the 2 sifts and I'm am absolutely dead tired and have to wait almost an hour to get picked up by my friends. 

The following week, I am put on overnights again but this time by myself. Of course I am livid. I tell her once more then its difficult for me to work because I don't have a rid and there is no way I can work the shift by myself. ""What do you want me to do? I don't know how to do it."" 

She continues to put me overnights even though I have told her many times to not to. We did hiring another overnighter but she's leaving tonight and we had another person quit thus making us very understaffed at the front desk. So now I'm going to be working overnights pretty much every right with little to no training. I'm doing the best i can but I'm starting to get disgruntled and very depressed. i understand that in a business like a hotel you have to be flexible to the hotel's needs but there does come a point when you're bent around so much that you can't bend back. I've had a few interviews at other hotels and some of them seem very interested in me.

Me: “How many bedrooms are we getting?”

Mom: “One. Why, did you expect to get your own special room?”

Right off the bat, she’s already being rude by assuming I’m being an entitled brat, but I carry on.

Me: “No, I’m just wondering if I’m sleeping on the couch again.”

Every trip, I always sleep on the couch. My sister and her friend get one bed and my mom gets the other. I sleep on the couch every time, willingly. Anyone who knows hotel couches knows that they’re not the comfiest of things.

668,Asshole,"My (25m) wife (22f) gave birth to our first child 3 days ago and in the delivery room I made a few lighthearted comments which my wife laughed at, but the joyless hag of a nurse lost her shit and kicked me out of the room.

I calmly tried to placate the demented old boiler by explaining she has no right to be offended on other peoples behalf, but that just made her worse.

Eventually I left before my ears started bleeding, but I feel the nurse was in the wrong for giving me shit in response to a joke between my wife and I.

My wife thinks the whole situation was hilarious but considering the amount of money I pay for private health care instead of playing russian roulette with the NHS, I am 50/50 about laughing it off or reporting the miserable old bag.

Me: ""I feel like i'm watching my favourite restaurant burning down""

**\*Wife chuckles and punches me on the arm\***

**\*miserable nurse tuts loudly and rolls her eyes before stomping out of the room, returning a few minutes later\***

**\*time passes and our son is born (there was much rejoicing)\***

**\*I left and got a sandwich\***

669,Not the A-hole,"Okay so a year ago my wife and I agreed we would travel the world, she's quitting her job and I retired early through injury. We're going west around the globe for around a year.
I earn roughly £400 a month more than her so knew I'd be paying the majority and supporting her financially while we were away and I'm okay with that. I also have savings which I've built up for something like this. 
We did however agree that she would contribute wherever she can and save as much money as possible over the year. I was hoping maybe £50 a month saved by her towards it over a year.
With a month to go she's now revealed she hasn't saved a single penny towards the trip, has no intention of contributing but very much wants to enjoy the trip and stay in nice places, enjoy excursions and so on. 
I'm spending roughly 10-12k on this and she hasn't put anything into it and never intended to despite her promises otherwise. 
To be clear - we share the household bills , have no kids but as the main earner I've always paid for every meal out, every piece of furniture, the car, basically anything outside base living costs. This has pissed me off though, AITA for expecting her to contribute towards this?

673,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for about 10 years and for that whole period I have been a vegetarian while he eats meat. This has generally been ok and not a point of contention. For the first 6-7 years we were together we each pretty much cooked our own food when we got home from work, and on weekends we would make one shared meal that he would add meat to, like we’d make burritos and he’d add ground beef to his. A few years ago the situation changed to me working a lot less than him (like I was laid off and didn’t get proper employment for a while, and then we had our daughter and I stayed home with her for a bit over a year. During that ~2 year period I took over the evening cooking since I was home, and 99% of the time I cooked vegetarian food since raw meat really grosses me out. My husband did not complain. Now, for the past 8 months I have been back to work. I am responsible for picking up our daughter from daycare, getting home and getting dinner on the table. I get home about an hour before my husband. Said daughter is a toddler now and it can be challenging to get dinner together while watching her, especially if she is in a clingy mood. Several times in the past few weeks my husband has complained about dinner being vegetarian all the time. He said he would not help me pick recipes (what I hate the most) because he doesn’t get excited about the food. Today he brought it up again, saying that I’m “making him be vegetarian”. I think this is ridiculous, as he eats meat on weekends and at lunch, and I have offered to cook meals with meat in them for dinner if he preps the meat portion so I just have to heat it up. This was not acceptable to him but I didn’t really understand what the reason is. He just said our arrangement is “weird”, and then later “shitty”. Honestly I feel like he’s quite audacious to complain considering I am willing to cook the food and he gets to come home to a cooked meal each night that he didn’t have to prepare. He may enjoy meals more with meat, and I’d enjoy meals that I didn’t have to cook! Who’s the asshole?",42,61,0.84

678,Not the A-hole,"Hey y’all. I’m ancestrally Irish from my moms side and have been obsessed with the history since I was a kid. Triggered by a traumatic life experience 14 years ago, I ended up buying a place in Ireland a little over a decade ago and spend a good chunk of my vacations over there renovating the cottage and just using it as a little out of this world spot to get away. 

For full disclosure, possibly because it’s crucial to the context of this scenario, the painful life experience that was losing my wife at the hands of a drunk driver. To comply with the rules of this sub, I’ll avoid graphic imagery but there basically was nothing left of her and I am deeply grieving still. 

My father has always been a loving dude, but I wouldn’t say we are super close. He walked out on me and my mom and 2 year old sister when I was 3 years old and due to him being a lucky gambler, he always had enough to throw money at his problems. As he’s got older he’s stopped that and has started to rely on me a lot more. I know he loves me but I just have my own issues with him I guess. He’s a good guy just... he isn’t in my circle. 

Last week he called me asking me if he could take my nephews and nieces to my cottage. I said hard no. Not happening. He got real offended and asked why not and I basically told him that cottage is a tribute to my wife and I go there to be alone, cry, and drink myself stupid. It’s my place. He was quiet and kind on the phone but he told me I needed to stop being selfish and let the cottage be used for good. He said my wife would want kids in that place and it made me cry like a baby because it was true. My wife *would* have wanted that. But I just can’t give up that sanctum. In the US I am a worker drone who has to carry on with my life to put food on my table and in my dogs mouths. Pay bills. Look after my mom and dad. I look forward to those escapes to Ireland, it gives my life purpose and whenever I’m there, I can be the widower of my wife, I can be the broken man who doesn’t need to drag his body up and try and carry on while everyone else forgets.

679,Not the A-hole,"I work in a coffee shop that also sells food. A regular visits us everyday and has done for years. He cant speak a lot of english and doesnt have family here so i try to give him some of my time when i can to have a little chat. He enjoys the company and likes me allot because of it.

A few months ago his benefits got stopped and he would just ask for a glass of water. He looked awful so for 4-6 weeks we helped him out. Everyday he would come and get his meal for free. Which is pretty expensive tbf. If he was at the shop when it was closing time, any food that was going out of date (which is perfectly fine to eat) would be bagged up for him.He soon realised that he didnt need to queue up anymore and just found a table and waited. Eventually, i was told this could not go on much longer,as it is bad for buisness.Not to mention i can lose my job.I did carry on helping him but just more sneakily. I even got him a few bags of shopping but then found out he doesnt own a kettle/microwave or oven. Eventually,i organised to meet him and took him to citizens advice. After a long day of appointments we got his money sorted! And he was back to himself in no time. clean shaven (which im pretty sure he does in our customer toilets) and looking healthy again. Happy days. 

Ok so now the AITA part. 

Lately he has started going through the same steps.asking for water,started to look and smell.like crap. At first i gave him his usual meal for free because i genuinely feel bad for the guy but then soon realised he was back to finding a table an looking at me until i bring him his free food. Management put their foot down an said it cant carry on. I did slide him a banana,coffee and pastry but explained to him i cant do it anymore as im getting in trouble now. 

Next day, same again. Sat at table waiting and watching me. Eventually he left. Today he done the usual awkward table waiting routine but had a bag of letters with him. I gave him his glass of water. Gave him a small glass of milk (these are free anyway) and looked over his letters. Looks like hes just waiting on his payments to go through. Although these things can take a while to get sorted out. I had a little chat to him about it but then he actually started begging me in the middle of the shop. Basically caused a scene. I stuck to my guns and said i cant do it anymore. He left but no doubt he will be back tomorrow..

Im on my own most nights so i can easily give him free food and nobody would ever know. Unless somebody was to check the cameras.If an official was to check the cameras because of suspicious stock shortages i would be gone in a heartbeat.Tbh i dont want to carry on doing it anymore. Its causing me issues at work and now im riddled with guilt knowing hes hungry,theres food there i can give him,but at the same time i just dont want him to think he can keep coming in an begging for free food.

680,Asshole,"Long story short, back in the day I had this house where we used to throw pretty good house parties back in the day. I met a lot of people through it one of them being Alyssa. I knew Alyssa semi well, she was going to PA school at the time I met her. Also she used to be one of the girls my roommate would sleep with. 

&#x200B;

Through Instagram I found out she got into a relationship with some guy that looks like he has a good bit of money. He added me and I followed him back, he replied to two of my stories. Then asked me over dm about how I knew Alyssa. I told him that she used to date one of my friends. 

&#x200B;

He then asks me more detail about her past, because he said that she told him she has only slept with three guys, and that after college she hasn't slept with anyone since she was focused on finding a husband. I told her I don't know her past like that but she has slept around in the time I knew her and that she has bragged at parties about sleeping with a football player.

&#x200B;

Dude told me thank you and then I noticed two weeks later they had taken down the pictures. Alyssa's best friend messaged me what I told her boyfriend. I didn't respond, and then Alyssa and her sister actually came to my spot to confront me and were shouting and crying. (Alyssa was) She said that I ruined her life that James was a perfect guy.

682,Not the A-hole,"Update at bottom.

Please, I know this isn't the place for relationship advice, which is why I am not asking for that but asking if ITA for how I reacted to this event. Let the judging commence.

Note, my husband wakes up at 5am to leave for work. I am a SAHM for the moment.

I am a new momma again and I have finally felt some energy to get stuff done after being bedridden from PPD and exhaustion. I told myself that today I was going to get up, clean the house, take the kids for a walk around the neighborhood, and go donate some boxes of stuff for my parents that they left for me. So I get up, get 2 loads of dishes done, 3 loads of laundry, and threw out a bunch of garbage. I collected the garbage to go put it out to the curb only to be met with a F TON of bugs because my husband put half an uneaten pizza in the garbage can. Not in a bag or anything, just on the bottom of the can.

Needless to say, I was VERY unhappy. And it was even more unhappy to open the garage to find my car gone. He decided to take my car instead of his own to work.

So I called him up expressing my displeasure, stating ""all you had to do was ask for my car so I could change my plans accordingly."" But now he's all mad at me for blowing up at him ""over nothing"" as he puts it. It's MY car, first of all. Secondly, I have 2 kids who's carseats are in MY car, and thirdly, the stroller to take my newborn in is in the trunk of MY car.

I'm pissed. My whole day was uprooted. Yet, my husband thinks I'm an asshole. AITA for yelling and telling him not to use my car without asking?

Update: I want to thank you all for your advice. While I have been trying to work on our communication issues for a while now, he has finally admitted that he should have at least said something and it was inconsiderate of him to just take it. Which was a big step for him, I think. I told him about this post and all it did was make him bring up something else to blame on me, at least he took the second to think he might have done something wrong. We have discussed switching the carseats to his car if he wants to use mine more often, so we may do that when he gets home as I have my car today. Anyway, thanks for everyone weighing in! 

I also want to assure you this wasn't some kind of ""I hate men"" thread? Which, for some reason, people think this was? This was just an isolated event where I believe I was in the right and he was in the wrong. I don't make his days hard for him, but dang does he make some days hard for me.",241,662,0.93

684,Not the A-hole,"My [late 20s/f] boyfriend [early 30s/m] asked me to show him what kind of engagement rings I like. 

I showed him the (honestly pretty specific) style I want. White gold, solitaire round or cushion white diamond (or something similar) with a pave band (the little diamonds around the band). Very thin band. What I think is very much my style (I like classic and timeless). I reiterated numerous times that I do NOT care about the size of the diamond or clarity and all that. It doesn’t even need to be a real diamond and the pave band is just a dream, not something I’m asking for. I said I don’t care if it’s expensive and I’m not asking him to buy a big ring or anything. 

He stated money isn’t an issue and proceeded to say he likes yellow gold and different stones (many of which are waaay more expensive than what I want and much more prone to scratches). I reassured him that I wanted him to choose it, but that I do think what my taste is should be taken into consideration, especially since he asked. He said it’s completely up to him and if I don’t like it, he’ll get me a different one eventually. 

I’m not into the idea of “upgrade” rings, since I personally want the one he proposes with forever. I reiterated again it’s not that I want anything big or expensive. 

He kind of rolled his eyes and acted like I was being selfish and not taking his thoughts into consideration. I know he doesn’t already have a ring or a family ring he wants to give me and my grandmother has even offered the diamond from her ring because she wants me to have it (she is in her late 90s and it’s in the will that it’s mine). 

I’m really not trying to be selfish or bratty, but it seems weird that he thinks his opinion is the be all, end all to something I would theoretically be wearing the rest of my life.

688,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone, this isn’t an awful brag nor am I some sort of tough guy, I just sort of snapped last night and my girlfriend is pissed at me. 

Last night we went to super high class Outback Steakhouse. We’d been there 10 minutes when a lady was sat one booth behind us. She was loud talking, verging on screaming on her phone. I tend to be very misophonic so it instantly bothered me. My girlfriend put her hand on my leg to try and chill me out. But the lady was just going on and on about some sort of evangelical nonsense. I don’t remember exactly but it was things like “doofus 6:43 says we must hate the sin and the sinner should burn!”  It was so bad a manger came over and talked with her so obviously I wasn’t the only person she was bothering but she sort of shushed him. It went on for at least another 5 minutes and then she said “and the sinners all around us will perish and the chosen will (do something, not sure what she said).” 

I couldn’t take it any more so I scootched my GF out of the booth and went over and tapped the woman on the shoulder and she put her phone down and I said “everything you are saying and everything you believe is utter bullshit.” She freaked the fuck and started screaming at me and into her phone and I actually laughed my ass off because she at Times couldn’t tell who she was supppsed to be saying what to. I sat back down while she continued to freak out and very quickly a security gaurd from the mall came in to escort her out.  She was certainly a topic of conversation but everyone put it behind them and we ate.

ML= mother in law
H= husband

Back story for context: H (26)is getting a stem cell transplant in a few weeks because of a recurring cancer. ML (55) was absent during the first year of treatment, she lives in a different state. During this time H’s health was failing and he was near death (resting heart rate of 140, hallucinations, etc). ML insisted she couldn’t afford to come down despite paying for private school for other children and going on vacations. H went into a short remission but quickly relapsed. The day H was diagnosed with relapse ML went to a Cher concert. This past doctors visit ML came down and then after discussing a life or death procedure she went to a Dave Matthews concert and only had a very short lunch with H to visit. 

Now on to the dilemma. After the transplant will be the most crucial time for H because he will essentially have no immune system for a few weeks until his new one develops. The hospital only allows one person to spend the night but multiple people can visit during visiting hours. I want to be there in case anything goes wrong but now ML is insisting that he will need his mom during “his scariest moments”. I told her that I would like to be there during that time because his scariest moment already happened when H was near death last year. Now H feels torn between the two of us and I am left wondering, am I being the asshole here by putting my foot down with ML and staying with him?

Edit: I forgot to clarify that I have spoken to my husband about who he wants there and he said he would like me to be there over his mom. They don’t have the most solid relationship for obvious reasons but friends and family have said I’m being too hard on his mom and that I should let her stay the night. These comments from friends and family have caused my husband to feel bad about his choice and I’m choosing to double down on the decision while also telling him to not feel guilty about it.

My father had a daughter sometime in college and although paid for his financial responsibility never had a relationship with her.  When I was born my mother encourage him to get to know her. She visited a few times and came to baseball games with me and my dad but never lived with us. Sometime when I was about 7, she got pregnant and apparently had a falling out with my dad (financial issues). Because my father didn't support her she cut all ties with him. Couple months ago my dad had a stroke and is having some health problems. He decided to call my half sister and ask to reconcile, she came with her husband and kids. Yesterday, my mother told me my father had written her into the living trust, and wants to give her 50% of the family money and some of the estate upon both of my parents deaths. His reasoning is that she has children and I will receive my mothers inheritance anyway.  At this point most of my mothers money is invested in the family estate and is mostly joint so I don't see how they can split it. And this is going to sound harsh, but they have been estranged for 13 years and suddenly she cares so much about my father conveniently when he is sickly.  I know she has children, but she is financially stable. And the thought of her inheriting my childhood homes really bothers me for some reason.

He wakes up around 5 am and tries breaking down the door of his bedroom that he's locked in, and screams to try to wake people up. 

Talking to my mother she says that he wasn't raised properly, not in the abusive sense, but in the spoiled sense. They give him food to calm him down basically rewarding him for being bad. Honestly I can't blame them, it's hard to deal with. The parents rub me the wrong way though as he's thrown to his grandma who lives with them. 

My bf loves Kent. I don't blame him. It's his brother he grew up with. I don't  bad mouth him or be rude to him. I treat him like I'd treat any other kid. But I just can't stand him. He gives me panic attacks when I'm not feeling well mentally and he tries breaking into my bfs room. 

Am I horrible for hating him and not wanting to see him again?

Edit: There has been some more specific incidents I have remembered that may make it easier to understand his behavior and how it's handled.

He ran out of the house and had to get the police called on him just to get him back inside as he was just standing in the middle of the street. 

He smashed a brand new TV because the TV remote wouldn't work

The problem is; there’s just no way she can be an author. She’s not a good writer. Like I said, she’s an English major, but even majoring in English, she can’t even get the mean for her classes (all mean/median info shows on our transcripts. She’s gotten anywhere between a B- and a B+ while the medians are at around B+ to A- range). She works hard and tries a lot, but she just isn’t an exceptional writer.

I asked her if she’s explored other careers, or does she think she wants to do anything else writing related, and she’s like nope. I tried to gently suggest that she should consider something else and she basically just brushes me off and tells me that she’ll be the next JK Rowling. I said making it as an author is impossible in this day in age anyways, and that she will never, ever make it a professional author. Even if she was an incredible writer, it’s just an oversaturated field, and she can barely do okay in her English classes much less write something a whole audience wants to read.

A few months ago, I started planning a trip for my best friends, mates, bros, whatever. These are the guys who, whether I like or not, for better or worse, are in my life. I generally like them even though they can be dumb as rocks and actually piss me off sometimes. BUT, if I needed someone to vent to, cry with, or help me hide the body, each of them would be a bro and help me out - and I them.

So this trip was in the making for like 2 years. We are going to Mexico City and Medellin for a month to party and let loose because we are graduating and need a way to celebrate our new responsibilities as adults. We are leaving on Friday. I like credit card rewards because free money so, I paid for the entire thing on my card. Nothing is refundable. Everyone sent me their part on Venmo or gave me cash.

This past Saturday, one of the guys tells me that he can't come because he is very low on cash. Ok, no problem. I tell him that I can't refund him but, he is more than welcome to try to find a replacement. I reminded him that in my email to the group, I put in big, bold, fucking letters that if you cancel, you won't get any money back but he wasn't happy about my response.

Fast forward to today and literally every dude in the group is texting or calling me telling me to give him the money back. Their reason is that his family is low income and I ""can afford it"" so, I should help him out. They told me that I'm being a dick because I know that he has had a tough time paying for things recently, etc. But, from my perspective, I don't want to just give away $1500. AITA?",128,130,0.93

They are filled with cleaning supplies/our hoover (etc) and they are not kept particularly clean. So they are not fit for customer use. When anyone does ask if we have a toilet we are told to direct them to one of the shops either side which both have customer toilets.

I was on the shop floor and answering questions from customers and was just directing a man to a product he was looking for when I heard, 
""Excuse me! Do you have toilets?"" Immediately I thought this was rude as I was with a different customer.
I replied, ""I'm afraid not, but there are toilets in 'x' shop and 'x' shop either side.""
To which she replied,
""You don't have any toilets at all? Its for my daughter and I'm disabled.""
""I'm sorry, we only have staff toilets and they're filled with cleaning supplies so they're not fit for public use."" After that she left with her daughter, to, I assume, use one of the bathrooms in another shop.

When I told a colleague about it they said they have let customers use the toilets in the past. I've never, personally, allowed customers to use our toilets and have been told by management to direct them elsewhere. So, I was wondering if this makes me the arsehole?",28,72,0.83

His girlfriend has been in a similar emotional state to me and has been one of the few people I’ve been able to handle being with since he died. I know that most people have good intentions but their questions and sympathy bother me, as they do her.


His family were never great and she’s not from our city, I live at home and she’s spent a few nights in our guest room as she has struggled being alone in the home they shared together. 


I always got on with her and have had a little crush on her since they started dating but I never would have moved on her whilst they were together.


The other night we slept together. It was stupid and I regret it but it came from a place of grief and wasn’t to do with my feelings for her. I just missed my friend and she misses him too. She left early the next morning but my parents worked it out and have told me I’m basically a horrible person who took advantage of her.

704,Not the A-hole,"I was at a hackathon in my city a week ago with a group of 4 people (whom I all knew and consider them friends). We couldn't decide on an idea, and I told them my idea and we decided to run with it. I set up the dev environment, and coded like 80% of it by myself whereas the another member (Bill) coded the remaining 20%. The entire idea was mine, I wrote most of the code, did all the github stuff (branching, merging etc), managed the servers, and deployed it. The other two members (John and Jack) did not code anything because they didn't know how to read the documentation and write code (they were self-proclaimed ""amazing developers""). I asked Jack to do a very simple task (link css with html using django) but he kept trying to get me to do it because he didn't know how, despite telling him to figure it out for himself. He kept adding negative output by constantly asking irrelevant questions and distracting us, as well as hardcoding API keys (despite telling him to read the keys from a file or use env variables multiple times) and pushing non-working code to master, which I had to go back and fix.

&#x200B;

At the presentation stage, one of the recruiters for a local company inquired about the project and Jack took charge and said he built it all, and that everything was done by him. The recruiter told Jack to add him on linkedin, and apply for internships for fall 2019/summer 2020. When the recruiter pressed for more details, Jack told them I can explain it (which I did to an extent because I essentially wrote all of it).  The recruiter messaged him recently and said he wants to hire him on a contract to extend what he built at the hackathon. Jack messaged me saying he wants me to ""help"" with with it aka do all the work again.

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole for messaging the recruiter and setting the record straight? I feel as if I should have gotten the connection on Linkedin and the contract, because I did all the work, whereas Jack threw Bill and I under the bus. I did not want to cause an argument while we were presenting by saying that Jack lied, and I wouldn't have ever messaged him if it wasn't for the contract. That should have been me and it very well deserved to be me, not him, because he didn't do anything and lied that he did it all.

He was a drug addict, mentally abusive, controlling, didn't have a job, didn't help with children, etc. When I was pregnant with our son, my ex decided he wanted our son to be named after him, making my son a junior. After years of being manipulated by this guy, I became quite submissive, and even though I was totally against the idea, I agreed.  Trying to keep this totally anonymous so I'm not going to tell you my ex's name nor my son's name, but let's just pretend my ex's name is ""William Christopher"". He goes by his middle name, so 'Christoper' and my son goes by 'C.J.' (Christoper Junior). My son hates his *real* name, and I feel like the initial thing will maybe grow old after some time. My dad is a junior and it has created multiple problems for him throughout his life.  I would never want my ex's background to affect my son. I just feel like I want him to have his own identity, and changing his name would help tremendously. He would still go by 'CJ' for the time being. We would pick a name beginning with a C and J, so it won't create a ton of confusion for anyone.  My ex is barely involved in their lives. He has never paid child support.

Had a bit of a row with my dad tonight. I run on Spartan marathons, and the next one we’re poised to join is in a city we have to fly to. I’m going with three male friends, which I have known since we were about five (most of my friends are guys). Over dinner, I told them about our mini-vacation plans while in the other city: canyoneering, swimming with whale sharks, those kind of stuff. Dad just scoffed at me.

*non-verbatim*

Dad: Don’t go if you’re the only girl in the group.

Me: I’m always the only girl in the group.

Dad: Bring your sister with you then.

Me: I don’t have money to pay for her.

Dad: If you don’t have the money then don’t go.

Me: I can pay for myself, not just the extra for her.

Dad: Then stop spending on unnecessary things. We have a lot to fix and pay for at home.

Me: I always give money for the bills. Don’t tell me what to spend on.

I just hated the fact that he had to point out the expenses. I’m generally frugal, but would definitely cash out for the family if needed to. I wouldn’t want to list down everything I’ve done as a daughter, but last year I computed that 77% of my salary goes to them.

It might also be good to mention that they’re recently disappointed because only two days ago, I found out my boss isn’t going to send me to work in the UK, which would mean I’d wouldn’t get a raise and wouldn’t be sending pounds from overseas.

Of course I do love her, she’s my sister but I can’t stand her. Her high pitched screeching when she doesn’t get what she’s demanded, her manipulative and sneaky behaviour, using her autism diagnosis as an excuse to misbehave, her monster tantrums, encouraging my 4 year old also autistic sibling to do naughty and dangerous things etc. etc. the list goes on. 

She’s been taken to doctors and my mother tells me that their advice is to ignore all of her negative behaviour (along with medicating her but they aren’t). 
Sound advice sure but it’s NOT working, they know it’s not working and they sit there complaining that they’re sick of her behaviour. 
My grandmother flat out refuses to babysit because of how my sister treats her. She’s locked her out of her own house because she wasn’t happy being told no. 

I understand she isn’t my child, it’s not exactly my place to criticise how my parents are raising her. BUT it is my place to say something about how she treats my children. 

I’m not going to pretend my children are angels who do nothing absolutely wrong and that I’m a perfect parent but they are good kids, I barely have any problems with their behaviour. sooking when they’re told no, won’t eat their veggies, continue to play with their toys long after it’s bedtime etc. average kid stuff like that. 

My sister bullies my 4yr old daughter every single time they are together. She tells my daughter that my daughter is stupid, that she doesn’t deserve the nice toys I buy for her, that my daughter is ugly. i’ve chalked it up to her autism. I’ve made excuses for her. She’s only a child, she doesn’t understand blah blah blah 

But something she said very recently has infuriated me. She told my daughter IN FRONT OF ME that she wished my daughter was dead. This comment was not a retaliation or anything like that , it was said as casually as one would discuss the weather and cane out of nowhere. I was appalled and shocked. 

My daughter is very upset when my sister is mean to her. She doesn’t understand. She hasn’t been bad. She adores my sister and all she wants to do is play with her. But for some reason my sister seems to hate my daughter. I do not believe it to be a jealousy issue, I genuinely believe my sister is deliberately trying to hurt my daughter. 

I’ve have several discussions with my mother about this issue and all I get is an apology. I feel bad for saying this but an apology means nothing when there is nothing to change the actions that warranted an apology in the first place.

709,Everyone Sucks,"Last year my brother fell on some hard times (that I came to find out were entirely of his own creation, despite his sob story). I loaned him $5200 to bail him out. He promised to pay me monthly installments and I have yet to see a single penny, much less the entire amount which he promised to pay me by May 1st. 

I know that he is bouncing from couch to couch and so far have not been able to track him down and he either has blocked me or his phone is turned off. I know he's talking to my mom but she won't give any information on where my brother is.  A week ago today I happened to be at my mom's house and there was a key on the floor. I told my mom just in case she was missing it and she told me ""oh set that on the table, it's the duplicate to Brent's storage locker lock."" So that got me thinking and I put the key in my pocket.  My plan was to have my husband call around to the various storage unit places pretending to be my brother, saying that he would come in and make a payment. We hit pay dirt on the second call and they confirmed he had a unit there and even gave my husband the unit number (and since he was a little behind on the payment, we even paid his balance and one month in advance). We took the key removed his lock and replaced it with one our own with a note attached saying

>When you make arrangements to pay me back, I'll unlock this, thanks, Angela.

Well he hasn't called me but he's complained to every other member of the family that his dog's medicine is locked away in the storage unit.

710,Not the A-hole,"AITA:   

Firstly, I do not have body dysmorphia and I realize that I am not overweight. I was overweight last year and have since lost 40 lbs through diet and exercise. However, I do have areas on my body that I would like to improve or tone up, like I’m assuming a large majority of people do. 

I’ll start my story where it began, I went to a friend’s house for a small gathering of my 3 closest friends. We were having a girl’s night with appys and wine. One of my friends (Lisa) commented on how great I looked since I lost weight. I thanked her. She asked if I had loose skin and I explained that I did have some on my abdomen that I was considering removing with surgery. Lisa asked to see proof of this loose skin and I hesitantly showed her. I am a private person, but since I was with my close friends and I was feeling no pain after two glasses of wine, I lifted my shirt. Once I lifted my shirt, my other friend Cassie, scoffed and rolled her eyes. Cassie is overweight and possibly larger than what I was before I lost weight. Once she scoffed, I got the picture and pulled down my shirt. Lisa, who was oblivious to Cassie, commented on how she did see some loose skin and surgery was probably the only option. It may be important to note that Lisa is a physician and was probably only interested in my loose skin from a medical point of view. 

The rest of the night, Cassie seemed to behave differently towards me. She was almost being rude. She even invited Lisa and my other friend, Jessica, to her house next week for margaritas and didn’t extend the invitation towards me. 

I spoke to my friend, Jessica, about Cassie’s behaviour and she said that I shouldn’t have talked about my body in front of Cassie since she’s struggling to lose weight and I was able to lose weight easily. I reminded Jessica that my weight loss wasn’t easy, I worked my butt off. 

After speaking to Jessica, I called Cassie to talk and apologize. Cassie still hasn’t returned my call or text. I am sad and feel guilty that she was hurt by my complaining about my body, but I’m also a little annoyed. Why can’t I talk about a body part that I am insecure about? Before I lost weight, I wouldn’t have blinked an eye if someone did that in front of me.

My house is closer to the daughter's daycare than my girlfriend's apartment. So I offered to her to hang out at my place and then we'd all have dinner together a couple nights a week. Whenever the girlfriend doesn't have her daughter with her, nightly dinners are usually a thing anyways, so instead of 4 times a week, it happens every day a week. And I don't mind!

The problem is I get home from work about two hours after daycare is over. So she spends those two hours playing with her daughter in my living room, giving her a snack, etc. I'm getting tired of the snacking, because her idea of snacking is giving her a bowl of cheerios or crackers or whatever, the bowl inevitably gets toppled or spilled onto the floor within 10 seconds, and the daughter smooshes them up leaving crumbs everywhere. 

The girlfriend doesn't clean it, and I have to clean it when I get home. But sometimes I don't catch it all, especially when she decides to smoosh cookies into my couch cushions. I've started to get ants, localized in my living room. I've never had ants before, and I worry about what's next. Cockroaches? Mice?

I warned her to be more attentive of her daughter and if she makes a mess to clean it up. I even bought her some bowls that suction cup to my coffee table so it at least prevents some mess, but she doesn't use them and doesn't clean up. I told her the nuclear option is coming: no more daughter at my house until she's capable of being cleaner, and the girlfriend says I'm punishing the child for something she can't control.

I'm not punishing the daughter, I'm punishing my girlfriend. If she won't clean up the mess her daughter makes, then I don't want an opportunity for the mess to occur. The daughter isn't the issue, the girlfriend is the issue, by not cleaning up or being attentive enough.

Well, it happened. I banned the daughter from coming here after daycare. This puts pressure on my girlfriend because if she wants to have a dinner with the three of us here, she needs to travel 40min home, wait until I get home, and then another 40min here. This isn't only time, but money. She called me an asshole for ""making the life of a single mom harder"" but she dug her own grave.

My son (16M) caught his mother vaping to get relief from nausea and pain. He confronted his mother and called me to tell on her. I assured him that this was something his mother and I discussed and we both agreed for her to try. We also explained that this was the least addictive way for her find relief vs what her specialist and family doctor want to prescribe. We also let him know that in no uncertain terms we know this is illegal but feel that is outweighed by the positive results.

His response was that he finds this morally objectionable and thinks that his mother should stop doing this.

My response was to call him a condescending asshole which is clearly not a good response as a parent.

Edit:  Followed up with him last night. Sincerely apologized for calling him a name.  Started to dig a little deeper into what he was thinking regarding the morality of the situation.  He leaned heavily on the bible for justifying his position from the passage that states that drunkenness is not cool.  He was under the mistaken assumption that the amount that was being smoked would lead to ""drunkenness"".  Once he understood that there were degrees of high, he softened his position.  

Then he moved to the illegality of it.  The tact I took was asking him how he forgives himself and rationalizes that it's ok to speed, even after his recent speeding ticket.  Once he saw the hypocrisy of being able to tolerate and justify his own law-breaking habits he started to soften some more...then doubled down and said it doesn't matter she needs to not do that.

718,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend and I went to the beach last Thursday and on Friday night after a wonderful day of swimming and hanging out and enjoying our favorite beach, we went to our favorite restaurant and had a great meal. When we were done eating,  we walked onto a pier near the restaurant and watched as the sun set. The atmosphere was very romantic and we had been dating happily for nearly 5 years. Judging the moment to be perfect, I got down on one knee and proposed.  She said yes and was over the moon happy and excited  and we didn't even leave the pier for another two hours because she didn't want the moment to end. She spent the rest of the weekend on cloud 9 and we finally pack up and go home. Here's where the problem starts. 


She personally tried to call her parents on Friday night after it happened but it was bad timing for the parents to talk. After trying again Saturday she's decided we'd tell them in person instead. So we waited for Sunday. We make a cute card for them to surprise them and give them it. Their reaction isn't particularly enthusiastic but no big deal. At first we thought it went well on the whole, but then her father says ""wait a minute you need to ask my permission before you propose. "" So he decides I need to redo the proposal at a large family get together next week and publicly ask ""to talk to him"" before doing so and then propose in front of her whole family. I wouldn't mind that much, but this will basically erase our previous, perfect, real proposal with a fake proposal to suit his desires. 

Presently I am considering just going along with the request to keep things from getting escalated in a negative way and I'm positive if I just do what he wants he'll leave it alone after that. But if I'm honest with myself, I am LIVID that he fucked up our perfect engagement weekend for his personal preference and I'm not sure how to proceed without blowing up my relationship with her parents ( which has been pretty good up to this point).

Later in the evening they started bitching about the clothes they requested not being washed and I told them ""all you had to do was put it in the hamper"" to which my son said ""yeah but it was near the hamper you can just pick it up"" to which my daughter agreed. I didn't say anything more about the issue

The next morning I went to the dollar store and bought some laundry detergent. When my kids came down for breakfast it was sitting on the table, and they asked what it was. I informed them that until they stop being entitled spoiled brats that they can wash their own clothes, but not with MY washing machine. I informed them they will be washing all THEIR clothes from now on in the bath tub with dollar store detergent until they start being respectful and I receive an apology for the remarks about picking up their crap near the hamper AND once the detergent runs out they have to use their own money to buy more but they're only allowed to buy it at the dollar store. Then came more whining and bitching 

It's been a week and they still haven't apologized and I'm saving time, money and water on only washing mine and my husband's clothes. My husband said I'm being ""harsh"" but I don't think so. So am I the asshole for teaching my kids a lesson?",1918,9520,0.9
720,Not the A-hole,"I'm a member of an Indigenous tribe in the United States.  However I grew up very far away from them and only reconnected in the past few years. I live closer to them now and am more active with them.

One of my parents is very European, which means that I have very mixed features. All through my life I had a lot of people who ""couldn't tell"" or ""would have never guessed"" about my heritage. I had a lot of people growing up challenge me and push things like blood quantums (what percentage are you etc) on me to see if I really WAS in their eyes. It wasn't until I went to college and met more people with the same background that I felt like I ""fit"".

My eyes are green, my hair is lighter and even kind of curly/wavy and I have naturally light skin, but it has very obvious coloring to it if that makes sense. So when I tan, it's very easy and I get dark quickly. When I dye my hair darker, I ""look"" more Indigenous. I started doing these things when I reconnected with my tribe because it made me feel more like I belonged. To be clear none of them EVER questioned it. It was other people.

When talking about this with my husband (who is not Indigenous), and talking about our future kids, I shared how I would be excited for them to be involved with their heritage. I said that I hoped it wouldn't be so difficult for them to ""prove it"" to the outside world, as my husband also has lighter features. He didn't know what I meant, so I explained how I darken my hair etc. 

He told me that this was lying and deceiving people, that it was playing into stereotypes and that I should stop lying. He told me it was an asshole thing to do, like I was pretending to be someone I'm not. I don't see it that way but that's why I'm asking you guys lol. Is what I'm doing bad?",32,118,0.93

Some context, this is not focusing on my relationship, this is on my thoughts. 
I did not know about these issues before getting into the relationship.

I’ve been dating my SO for three years now, and for about two of them, we rarely get to go on a date anywhere. I love getting to go to their house and cuddle and watch a movie, but it’s every time nearly. We occasionally see a movie in theaters but about two-three times a year. They have pretty bad social anxiety, any time we go somewhere they’re vomiting and breaking down, even if it’s a simple trip to a local store. I never say what I think, I’m also as supportive as I can be. But in the back of my mind I’m sometimes a little disappointed and irritated that we can’t do anything new. I try to not suggest we can anywhere because of this, but sometimes when I want to go somewhere she would otherwise enjoy, I invite her. Very rarely it pans out, but once a one day beach trip did so. But this time I had somewhere I was very excited to go because she was getting to come with me. She reassured me she could go. Then that morning came, I woke up around 4 am, got ready and started driving to her house, and halfway through she canceled. I turned around, went home, and just sat there. I was very disappointed. She was belittling herself and I was getting her to stop, I reassured her I didn’t hate her, etc. She calmed down and felt better. But I feel horrible. I know she can’t help it, but AITA for being annoyed and disappointed because of this?",22,36,0.78
725,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone, happened just earlier today and still not sure if I made the right call. 

&#x200B;

My roommate and I have been friends for the past 5 years and decided to live together the year after graduation from college. All was fine, we did our respective chores and we have lived together before without issue. He is attending medical school, and I have started a full time job so our schedules are often different and we don't see one another too often. 

&#x200B;

Anyways last Friday when I came home from work, he came over to my room and said our landlord company had called and said they had messed up our lease and we had double booked the lease for 2 months in June and July by accident. They reached to him and asked if we would be willing to move out earlier than our original date (July 28th) so that the next tenants could get in closer to their signed June 1st date. They said they would also provide movers for help. Ouch, this sucks but both our parents about 20 minutes outside the city we live in, and would have no problem with us coming home now for a month until our next lease starts (I planned to overlap my next lease starting July 1, and he overlapping June 15th through the end of our current lease). Spent the weekend and talked to may parents and found enough time this week to move out by the end of this week after work, and before my cousins grad party this Friday all morning. I told him today and I could be out before Memorial day weekend and I was going to try to make it so we weren't paying any June rent. He came back upset saying the earliest he can do is June 15th. 

&#x200B;

What? June 15th? Nope, way too late for me. I don't want to be paying June rent if i don't have to. He says he has finals until May 31st (granted med school finals), and a wedding June 1-2. Okay I suggested June 5th and hopefully thats good for everyone and he said ""dude, I cant't do that. I just cant do it. You're still saving a month an a half of rent."" 

&#x200B;

AITA for telling him I wouldn't pay for any June rent because he can't fine/ make the time to get out any earlier?

I dont know why I was so upset by this. I do everything I can to cut down on my carbon footprint. I know some people that really force this lifestyle on others, but I don't talk about it at all.

730,Asshole,"Throw away fpr obvious reasons.  My wife and I met in our early 30's.  We were married within 2 years.  We both wanted kids but waited a bit as my wife was finishing a PhD program.  We started trying to conceive her final year and had issues.  Everything checked out for both of us medically but we weren't getting pregnant.  After 18mos of trying we started discussing other options including medical procedures and adoption.  My wife (who is a bit of a SJW, a giver and a crusader) was really excited about adoption.  She actually mentioned early in our relationship that she always thought she wanted to adopt.  I remember saying at the time that I hadn't ever really thought about adopting but that maybe I'd be open to it.  Obviously at this point the discussion became a bit more serious.  I told her that while I wasn't 100% opposed to adopting I wanted to persue feasible medical options to have genetic children.  We tried some treatments and luckily we were blessed with a little girl within a few months.  10 months after she was born we were pregnant again, this time having a baby boy.  The first 5 years of parenthood were pretty typical, hectic and crazy.  There was a move and a job change mixed in for good measure.  Now 6 years later things finally seem to be settling down.  Six months back my wife began hinting she might want another baby.  We discussed it and both agreed that in our early 40's it just wasnt feasible to have a other child.  It was then my wife brought up adoption again.  I shot down the idea pretty quickly.  I was honset that I liked our lives now, I didn't want to disrupt things.  I didn't mention that deep down I don't want to raise another persons child, and that while if I was forced to I would do an admirable job I could never love another persons child like I do my own.  The following months there were fights and arguments until finally I agreed to do an interview at an agency with an ""open mind"".  That occured last week and I left feeling more certain than ever I do NOT want to adopt.  Predictably my wife is on the opposit end of the spectrum.  We discussed the issue that evening and at a loss I told my wife something along the lines of letting the chips fall where they may and I would accept it.  The following morning I drove to the agency sat down with our interviewer alone gave her the cliff notes version and told her bluntly that we would accept a child but I had very strong reservations about being an adoptive father.  I asked her not to tell my wife about the conversarion and left.  AITA for sabotaging this process?  I love my wife very much and I adore our family, I just didn't have the heart to tell her no on this.

EDIT:  I should have been more clear that I have over the course of two months repeatedly told my wife then I really didn't want to adopt and was upfront and honest about the reasons. It's something that she seems to not be able to take no for an answer.

EDIT2:  Everyone losing their shit over me calling my wife a sjw is cracking my shit up.  It's not intended as an insult and she wouldn't take it as such.  Her facebook profile lists her as an ""Unapologetic Social Justice Warrior"".

734,Not the A-hole,"This week has been the worst week of my life. Today was my 19th birthday. My mum was diagnosed with heart failure - I’m devastated, and it’s been particularly difficult because she’s been in hospital whilst my dad, who has dementia, needs someone at home at all times to make sure he’s fed, showered, clothed, well looked after, happy.

Naturally, I took time off of university to look after him and visit my mum in the hospital. I love them both and I would do so much for them. Since her discharge 2 days ago I have had to juggle my part time job, university, looking after my dad. Once again, this is absolutely fine with me and I’d do it all again in a heartbeat.

Today is my birthday and I caught a stomach bug. I had diarrhoea and was vomiting all night until there was nothing left, so I became really dehydrated and lost quite a bit of weight. I went to the doctor so I could be prescribed something for the dehydration and pretty much slept the rest of the day, taking minimal sips of her prescribed fluids since nothing was staying down.

My family has this tradition every year where we have a birthday dinner, so the birthday person will pick a place to eat and we’ll have a good time as a family. Today, my mum decided she wanted expensive gourmet burgers, but I said to her that I was really sick right now and would prefer if everyone ate something cheaper and healthier for tonight and if we could postpone the burgers for a later date when I felt better, partially because I also didn’t want the smell of burgers all around also.

My doctor had told me not to eat any greasy foods. I wasn’t able to keep anything down, so even though I love burgers I just knew that I would get sick if I ate them so they’d be a waste.

My mum went livid. She told me she wanted burgers, and I said that was fine, but I also knew we couldn’t afford a second birthday dinner since we don’t have much money and that I really wanted to spend family time together, with this being my only birthday wish. She called me a selfish, childish bitch and I was very hurt by this. I had spent the entire past week trying to help my parents and I thought my birthday would be the one day where I could be allowed to be a little selfish, so I decided I needed a time out. She went out to get burgers and the beautiful cake she ordered (which I am very thankful for, since she ordered it before I was sick and there’s nothing I can really do about that now).

I decided to go to my boyfriend’s house to study just to clear my head and get away for a little bit. I left my mum a note saying that I’ll be back before 11, that I just needed some space to cool off (because this had been a really hard week for all of us) and that I loved her very much.

A lot more has happened since - my Mum is really upset and telling me to leave her and my dad alone forever which really hurts me because I do love them so much and I’m trying my best - I just needed a break.

This less an ""am I an asshole"" and more ""am I a creep"", because I genuinely don't know if I've overstepped a line here and I'm scared of what's going to happen next. 

Simply put, I'm an 18 year old gay guy who until recently was still mostly in the closet. Due to my home life and my parents social/political views I'm currently not in a position where I feel it's safe for me to come out. The only people who knew are my two best friends and my uncle (he's also gay, estranged from the family, my parents don't know I speak to him). For the past year or so I've really fancied this guy who's been in my classes all throughout school. He's so cute, he's funny and he's a really talented musician. Kinda makes my heart flutter. 

I never made a move on this guy. I don't know his sexuality, and didn't want to come off as weird or pushy by flirting or something. So I left it. However, one thing I did do was when I was sort of absent mindedly doodling on a piece of paper in class one day, I did my name and his inside a little heart. I know that's stupid pre teen child behaviour, but I was just dicking about and doodling, and it was in the back of my notebook so I thought nobody would see it. The chick next to me did though, and she asked it it was this guy (he has a pretty uncommon name so it was obvious it was). I sort of blushed and tried to deny it but she wasn't having it and I eventually confessed but asked her not to tell anyone. She told people. 

The whole thing has kind of gone wild. People think I'm some weird creepy stalker and there are rumours that I was drawing portraits of him in my sketchbook (a lie, I don't do portraits) and that I'd been writing love letters/poems to him (also a lie, it was just that one doodle). School is done now, so the rumour mill isn't as active any more but everyone thinks I was some predator (this whole thing going on with that one makeup artist guy from YouTube hasn't helped matters). The guy in question hasn't actually said anything mean to me, but he messaged me asking me to leave him alone and has blocked me on everything. I'm crushed because we were pretty friendly beforehand and I didn't want to hurt him. I'm terrified that this is gonna come back to my parents and God knows what they'll do if they find out. 

At the same time though, I feel like I kind of deserve it for not being more careful. Plus, maybe it is creepy for me to be crushing so hard on a guy who is (assumedly) straight.

So I'm planning on throwing a birthday party. I literally have not had a party since middle school and I've spent every birthday alone. This is the first time I've actually wanted to celebrate my birthday, so it's a little special for me.

I became good friends with all of the hostesses except one, we'll call her Patty.

Patty is rude, mean, snotty and condescending. She treats everything like a competition and you can't have a conversation without her making it about herself. All around unpleasant person.

It's to the point where a couple of the hostesses, me included, have had to report her to management because of her behavior.

Point is: I don't like Patty.

But also: I don't like excluding people.

I've been bullied all throughout my school life and I even had to leave my previous job because of bullying, so I have a soft spot regarding that.

The restaurant has such a small crew that it wouldn't take that long for her to realize she would be the only hostess not invited and it makes me feel hella guilty. Being excluded from stuff hurts and I don't want to inflict that on someone else, even someone as unpleasant as Patty. I don't want to feel like I'm stooping to her level.

On the other hand, it's my birthday and I want to celebrate it with friends and loved ones. It's supposed to be a joyous, drama-free, positive occasion and I don't want someone there who will make me or other guests uncomfortable.

745,Not the A-hole,"So, the background here is that I'm \[23M\] a wheelchair user, full time. My parents live in this old farm house in the country, a few hours drive from my current city where I'm at college, and they've done nothing to make their house accessible to me. There's a huge step up to the front door - too big for me to [wheelie](http://www.spinalistips.se/bilder/77/1280_77_upp_2_600wm.jpg) up - but I can get in if I get out of my chair onto the floor and pull my chair up the step, the downstairs bathroom is too small for me to get my chair into, and there's no downstairs bedroom.

&#x200B;

I haven't lived at home for years, but I am financially dependent on my parents. My student loans don't cover my tuition, nevermind living, and finding a student job as wheelchair user is really damn hard (can't waiter, can't work in a shop, can't work in a bar, etc), so I'm pretty broke at the moment. I'm training to be a doctor, and my parents have the money to support me financially, but they ask me to do a lot in return. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful and I know how lucky and privileged I am to have parents like mine. But it's hard for me to come home and dog sit for them when their house is so inaccessible.

&#x200B;

They've started to get really passagg about me not visiting them as much as they like - and kind of holding the money over my head. I want to see them more often than I do, as my parents are great people, I love them a lot, and we get on really well, but I feel like I shouldn't have to debase myself in their house the way I do right now. I *can* make it work, which is why they say I should: I can shuffle up the stairs on my ass and elbows, along the corridor to my childhood bedroom. I *can* crawl on the bathroom floor and pull myself onto the toilet, and I *can* cath like that. But it doesn't feel like I should have to.

  
Edit to add: we've talked about this, and they said that the inaccessibility shouldn't impede me visiting because i \*can\* get around their house if i flop onto the floor and crawl around. i tried to explain that that's not great for my body, and that it's really unpleasant and debasing (not least cos they have 3 dogs), but they said that 'it's not that bad'

I work in marketing and in my department there are 3-4 women who either have ridiculously wealthy families or have married very wealthy men (our jobs are not that high paying themselves). They talk a lot about expensive things like clothes, shoes, vacations etc. It can get annoying because they very obviously look down on some of our lifestyles.

First off, I am involved with a lot of plant discussion due to the Facebook groups I’m in,  and wandering Jew is the only name I have ever heard for this particular plant. So, how can people know what you’re talking about if you aren’t using the word for it that everyone else uses? I don’t feel like I should be obligated to not use the most common name for it due to the wording, since I’m not using it in a derogatory or anti-Semitic  way. I am definitely not anti-Semitic, I would consider myself quite the opposite, but I really don’t agree with this person, or see valid rationale for their argument. 

Edit: Sorry, I didn’t mean to sound more argumentative than I was trying to be when I posted this. Obviously if it offends someone I’m not going to continue to use that name, I was just trying to give my thoughts on it because I was confused and to get some interesting discourse. I understand their argument and I am not going to continue using that name, and I’m sorry if I came off rude, because I’m not trying to offend anyone or make this a political correctness argument.",89,99,0.83

751,Asshole,"Update: She's currently on the way home with a new skirt and I just realized I've been sitting around drinking beer and updating this post for over an hour.(Also the hentai thing is a joke, this fetish is older than time for me.)

Update 2: I guess she came back and was like the other skirts were too wide? And went out and bought a pleated skirt that wasn't too wide. But the other skirts weren't as wide as this new skirt? I totally get what people were saying about this being about control, and yeah it is, but my girlfriend says I'm NTA. Mostly this boiled down to another instance of poor or lack of communication. My new fetish is free and open communication at all times.

Update 3: She has a pleated skirt she likes and is willing to wear out that I also like. Thanks for all the posts, some really good ones that were critical but supportive. A pretty big dog pile otherwise but even a bunch of bad faith posts had an OK glimmer of positive info. It's bed time so... Bye!

First, I'm so jealous of couples that are more openly giving, generous, and considerate of each other's quirks.

I have what you could call a fetish that resolves around being able to pick particular styles of clothes for my girlfriend to wear. Mostly short skirts, plaid and pleated is best, matched with thigh high stockings. It's been a dream of mine to be able to pick the clothes my gf wears while we are out shopping, she tries them on, etc etc, then later she wears them sometimes when we go out on dates, and of course have sex with these clothes on or mostly on or whatever. To be clear, it's nothing outrageous or voyeur-level revealing, just short skirts usually with safety linings and thigh high socks and ideally I get to pick her underwear too. She has a nice body and I think these things accent her body so she might get extra looks because of that but no one can see her nono bits.

Anyway, we've been together for four years and she refuses or makes excuses constantly when it comes to this hobby/fetish to the point where when I see other women wearing this style of clothes outside (pretty common!) I go into an internal death spiral of dispare, longing, and frustration. I blame hentai but whats a guy to do?

I've been pretty clear about all this and it was getting me pretty low yesterday so I talked to her about it and we made a promise that today I could pick her clothes. When it came time to pick her clothes she had an issue with every skirt or sock I picked and I was like,""Today it's about my opinion, right? Can you just try?"" and it quickly turned into a very not fun process but clothes were being tried on at least. It turns out the skirts she had weren't really fitting or matching exactly right but seeing as I finally got her to do this thing, I was fine with the look being a little off the mark and she didn't look weird or anything. At this point she completely gave up and put loose grandma jeans on and was like “Lets go.” 

I basically said, no, you made a promise and I'm really disappointed and hurt that you aren't keeping it, it means a lot to me, to which she replied “Why are you bring so stingy.” Which kicked off a big argument. Edit: A big reason being that she can be really flaky in general, not just in a sexually charged promise. Communication is a constant struggle.

I'm not some red-pilled, nice guy, that negs and controls what she wears daily, I just want to have a say sometimes on predetermined dates because it's a stimulating activity and what I thought was a nice way to share our bodies and tastes. Unfortunately our tastes for women's fashion aren't really similar and she doesn't really have an equivalent visual desire beyond me getting muscles like Aquaman or something, which I mean I guess isn't beyond the realm of possibility but definitely not as easy as walking in a closet.

752,Asshole,"This is a throwaway bc I don't want to risk the people involved seeing this. 

About a month ago, I was at a party which was also attended by this guy we'll call Stephen. Stephen is someone I've met a few times before, he's a friend of a friend. He's a nice enough guy and I do like him a lot. At this party, he got really drunk and told me and our mutual friend that he has a really huge crush on this guy we'll call Luke, who is quite a good friend of mine and the mutual friend's. I didn't even realise Stephen knew him, but apparently they are quite close because their families are friends. He didn't necessarily say anything sexually explicit or creepy about Luke, just kind of swooned a bit over how gorgeous he is. 

I saw Luke a few days later and the topic of Stephen came up. I mentioned that he had a crush on Luke, and Luke didn't really react much so I thought it was fine. Apparently, it was not. For starters, apparently Stephen was only out to a select few people, and neither Luke or his parents were in that group. I guess Luke told his parents, who told Stephen's parents, who haven't reacted very well to it at all. Luke has also stopped talking to him almost completely, which Stephen is apparently very upset about. I haven't seen him since this happened but apparently he's just totally miserable rn. Our mutual friend says he hasn't left the house much in weeks, he's barely eating and he doesn't seem to be sleeping very well. 

I'm hearing from all sides that this is entirely my fault. I get that I was kinda involved for telling Luke, but I think it's unfair to pin all of the blame on me; I didn't know Stephen wasn't out to everyone and I didn't know that Luke and his parents were going to react this way. I've been told that I should learn not to be nosey and gossip and I get that, but I still think it's unfair that I'm being held responsible for this.",171,327,0.9

At this point my wife is insisting I go and scare this monkey off to get her purse back. Me, unwilling to get my face clawed off for a fucking purse, refuse to do so. So we keep our distance from this monkey as he's rummaging through her purse and throwing shit everywhere. Eventually he runs up a tree with her purse.

We go and pick up the stuff he had thrown out and then wait watching what he does next. At this point I find the entire situation fucking hilarious. My wife has effectively been mugged by a fucking monkey. Who wouldn't laugh at this?

My wife apparently. She's furious that not only did I refuse to get her purse back, but I have the gall to laugh about it to friends.

- As a husband and a man I should have grown a pair and got the purse back

-  I shouldn't make light about a ""traumatizing"" event such as this

So back story. My boyfriend will often think he is sick when really it is all in his mind. When we first got together I would Immediately take him to the ER or doctor and support him. However I started to see a trend. That anaphylactic reaction he was having to food ? Nope. No epi-pen. Some just in case Benadryl and released right away. That back injury that left him unable to walk , pulled muscle. Take some Tylenol and we were on our way. 

I ask him to follow up with an allergist, primary care. Even mental health as it seems to me to be very much a panic attack or some other type of mental health trigger. He never follows up. 

So tonight when he couldn’t sleep because of a head ache I ignored. Told him to take some Motrin. Sure enough ten minutes later he was according to him “ not in control of his body , unable to breath and swallow and shaking 

I tried my usual , let’s take deep breaths. Your breathing fine. It’s in your head. But he wanted to call an ambulance. He even said they he knew I I thought he was over reacting but he wasn’t. 

Sure enough ambulance shows up and calls him out. Tells him his vitals are fine and he was causing his stress. Asking him if there as something in his life causing stress. 

As a precaution they admitted him to to ER. Where I am sitting right now. At 420 in the am. He is sleeping. I am tired. The nurse is telling me he is fine and that they have no signs or any physical health problems. 

And I’m getting madder by the moment. On one hand I want to be here for Him and never down play any of his concerns. The other hand is he has yet to actually be sick. Not once. 

Am I the asshole for being pissed as hell at him?

Update: thank you all for the suggestions. I came back to a lot more than expected. I wish I could reply to more but I am reading them all little by little 

We left around 8am. They did a cat scan just in case to look for any bleeding the the brain. While he was getting his scan his nurse came by and I asked to speak to him for a minute. He asked me if there was something going on outside of physical. He assumed drug use. I let him no but this is ongoing and I was worried. The nurse gave me a resource for MH treatment but told me he would have to want it and acknowledge it for it to be successful. At discharge the nurse and doctor both talked about anxiety and how it can look and feel physical. I could tell they must have talked because the doctor looked at me often during the talk. 

I had to work today , he is at home sleeping. I’m going to sit down and have a talk. I would ask advice but that would be a different sub lol

757,Not the A-hole,"One Sunday around 8:30 P.M I decided that I wanted pizza. I placed an order online with Domino’s for a pretty standard pizza and set it to delivery with payment as “cash.” The tracker online said ""35-45 minutes."" (They close at 11:00)

1 hour has passed. I called to check on the status of the pizza. The manager answered the phone and asked what I would like to eat. I mention my order number, the estimated time, and what the ETA was. The manager replied, ""oh, that was just sent out; you should get your pizza soon."" 

30 minutes go by and no pizza has arrived, and the online tracker is now bugged. I call again and get the same manager. I explain to her that I was the guy who called earlier and I am checking in on the pizza. She then tells me, ""Oh, the driver said you canceled that order."" To which I matter of factly say, ""No, I didn't."" She then told me she would check with the driver but then hung up. I call in again and she instantly picked up the phone and hung up. This happened 3 more times. I then call and get put into a hold where domino's promotions are just looping. 

I simply order a new pizza from hot box and decide to stop by Domino’s on my way there.

I make my way to their building, and I see: chairs on tables, oven off, one driver sitting and texting, and the manager texting at the counter. I then call from my cell. Manager looks at the phone, eyes the screen, and lets out a very visible sigh. She hung up the phone instantly while the driver looked up and laughed. 

I casually walked in and went up to the counter. She looked up from her phone and asked what I would like. I say in a low, snide tone, ""I would like “X” pizza, oh wait, that's actually the pizza I ordered from hot box because you guys are so incompetent that you couldn't deliver a pizza in 2 hours or see fit to answer your phones, have a good night."" Two middle fingers on my way out. As I'm driving away, both the manager and driver come out and flip me off to which I return the favor. I then drove to hot box. 

I pull into a side street to park on the curb, and the man in the car behind me honks. I figure I just took someone’s parking spot. As I put my car in park and get out, it's none other than the driver. He then gets out of his car and says, ""Where do you get off talking to my manager like that!"" I don't think I've ever been angrier in my entire life. I screech, ""YOU GUYS FUCK UP THAT BADLY AND HAVE THE AUDACITY TO BITCH WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT; ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?!"" Taken back, he mutters ""Well, you're not welcome at Domino's anymore."" To which I rail, ""ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED? WHY THE FUCK WOULD I EVER EAT AT DOMINO'S AGAIN AFTER TONIGHT?” He then threw his hands up and drove away.

Edit: A few details based on the thread and what I've read. 1. I am a man, not sure how I became a she. 2. I did not yell in the store, only on the road 3. Only the manager and delivery man were there in the store, and I only spoke to the manager",858,6890,0.94

from the posts made on her story it looked like she would occasionally follow him to different places.

She also had a habit of looking over my shoulder at tests (usually when I did poorly) and saying, ""You know, you should really start paying attention in class more. You might learn something for once."" 

&#x200B;

Now, this girl was *obsessed* with her grades; think cry every time she gets below an A- obsessed. It also just so happened that my teacher was extremely strict with due dates. If it wasn't in the bin at the start of the period it was due or it was incomplete, it was an automatic zero.   

&#x200B;

Towards the end of the semester, my teacher gave us an assignment worth 55 points, the most out of any we've had all semester. We originally had a week to complete it; however, due to a scheduling error of some sort (I don't remember the details, but I think there was a conflict with test prep or something), he moved it a day earlier. When he made the announcement, lo and behold, guess who was browsing Instagram instead of listening to the teacher? 

&#x200B;

She asked me what he had said, and I told her, ""Sorry, wasn't listening."" I assumed that nothing would come of it since she did have a friend in the class who she could have talked to instead.

Well, apparently not, because when I came into class on the day our assignment was due, I found her sobbing at her desk. I pretended not to notice and handed in my assignment. Later, I found out that because of how many points the assignment was worth and how heavily weighted homework was for that class, getting a 0 on the assignment dropped her overall grade down to a C-. And with only one final test coming up, she wouldn't be able to pull her grade up to her usual A standard.

760,Asshole," 

Well, this all started about two years ago when I saw something called a Ball-Jointed Doll (BJD) on Tumblr. I was instantly in love. Since then I have obtained 5, ranging in price from $100-250 (not including clothes, wigs, etc). My wife (I'm also a female, btw) has been supportive of my hobby, as far as I knew. 

However, one doll eluded me. My Holy Grail Doll. Limited edition, long discontinued, almost impossible to find. Until last week. I found it for sale for $500. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I \*ever\* find one again, it won't be this good of a price. I had to act fast before someone else bought it. I put it on our emergency credit card. 

When the doll arrived I stupidly didn't hide the invoice and my wife saw how much it cost. She was \*pissed\*. She asked where I got that much money short notice and I told her I used the card. She was \*much more pissed\*. She said I would ruin our credit. I said that I promise I will pay every extra cent I get after bills toward it until it's payed off. No fun purchases, no alcohol, not even any takeout until it's paid. Apparently it will still ruin our credit. But isn't this the exact sort of thing credit is for?

She then dropped the bombshell that now she hates the dolls, thinks they're creepy, and doesn't want them in our bedroom. Until now she liked the dolls just fine and was glad I have a hobby. I have to keep them all in my home office. Which sucks because I liked to keep the dolls close to me while I sleep and cuddle with them at night while we watch TV. She said if I want to sleep near the dolls I can sleep in my office (which is actually a closet, I can't lay down).

761,Asshole,"So I feel pretty crummy even typing this out to complete strangers but here goes. My husband and I have been married for 4 years and we have a 1.5 year old together. He works and I agreed to stay at home since the birth of our son. I was earning only about 1/8 of what he was anyways, so we decided the most sensible arrangement since getting married was that I'd become a homemaker and SAHM when we had a baby. 

&#x200B;

I've been a stay at home spouse/mom for about 3 years now and it was fine before the baby. But now there are a lot of things I want to change but don't know how to, especially when it comes to finances which I feel like I have no power over. My husband earns good money but he's very frugal about nonessential spending because he wants to be financially independent (no job, earnings from investments) at an early age. Granted he was like this when I met him but I had also had my own salary at the time to do what I wanted. I'm looser with my money because I like eating out, going out with friends, going shopping, etc. All the normal things people in their 20s buy and do. 

&#x200B;

Well now that I stay at home we have mini fights every time I want to buy anything over $150 (which is the limit he set that needs a ""conversation""). This means if I go out to get clothing, makeup, brunch, little treats, etc. and the amount exceeds $150, I would need to call him beforehand and talk about what I'm buying. It feels extremely restrictive and quite frankly humiliating. He spends so little on himself that it seems like to him that I'm the one spending all the money on myself every month. 

&#x200B;

I've been talking to my sister who's also a SAHM and she says her and her husband have an agreement where she's ""paid"" for childcare/homekeeping. Essentially she gets ""paid"" a few thousand every month to spend on whatever she wants because in their relationship he's also the stingy/frugal one and she wants to have more pocket money for fun things. Right now she says she gets about $3,500 a month because that's how much it would cost them to hire an outside nanny where they live. It's a bit cheaper where we live so I wouldn't be asking as much, but would I be the asshole to suggest a similar arrangement with my husband so I don't need to go groveling for money every time I want to buy myself something nonessential?",990,809,0.83

After the whole tear-filled, humiliating cleanup was done (in front of dozens of students) another kid spoke up and told the coach who had actually done it.  Coach apologized, but the humiliation was done.

But two of her friends are stuck in that 18-22 life and inject it into everything (cant blame them if that's all thats going)

One of the girls starts loudly announcing she's leaving to meet a guy she’s going to sleep with. All good. But she wouldn't shut up about how this guy is 1 of 5 she's currently banging.

Since all the dudes in the group are top-tier at banter, we were egging her on telling her shit like ""If you bang a different dude every day of the week you get a plaque from the Canadian Association for Functional Whores"". She was loving it, laughing, and taking it in stride. But after she left the two girls who havent moved on from that early 18-22 of life (they still work retail/minimum wage, attend rallys, post politics on social media constantly, etc) started a hubbub saying we were all a bunch of sexist pigs

She blew up at us and a buddy said ""hey we were just shooting the shit with her boys will be boys"". Which was the wrong thing to say as ""boys will be boys"" is a sexist phrase.

Everyone turns to me and stares as I’m the only one not going to the same building. I get out and they leave.  It’s $85 to take my own, which is too expensive. 

The hostess saw this and texted the only other person heading our way (who was already gonna take the trains because she’s very used to them) to come back and get me so we can be together. She does and because there are fewer running, it takes me nearly 3 hours to get home, pulling up to my door at 4 am.

So Emily is friendly and fun, but she has the unfortunate habit - of shitting where she eats. In her entire time since she started working with us, she's dated three people from within the company. She also has a pretty big mouth and gossips a lot, badmouths people she doesn't like, which often creates rifts between people. Which I'm sure you can imagine what it's like when she breaks up with someone.

She does talk about her drama a lot while at work (there's a lot of downtime), usually tries to be 'discreet' about it with people she knows, but she can't really keep a lid on it because everyone ends up being 'someone she knows' eventually, haha.

She'll also sometimes just gossip about people she doesn't like or deems 'weird', not necessarily people who did anything to her. And ironically, she constantly posts feminist stuff on social media and stuff about 'acceptance' and a certain hashtag, which I find hypocritical but that's beside the point.

The three people she dated (in order) were someone above her (he was a supervisor when she was new), a guy who she rejected a year before, and someone below her (who later ended up getting promoted himself, shocker). I'll refer to them as BF 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

Now, she's allowed to date who she wants, not my business. But one time, at work, while I was around, she was 'jokingly' (playful tone I mean) talking about how she got promoted pretty early during her first year because BF1 recommended her (may or may not have been before they started dating, but they were definitely seeing each other.

So, without thinking twice, I subconsciously blurted out, kind of under my breath ""Yeah, sleeping your way to the top, eh?""

Honestly I did not mean to say that out loud, but luckily she didn't take it too terribly. She did give me a ""no! I'm not!"" and everyone else there acted all shocked and gave me looks, but she already knows me as someone with no filter so she laughed and said something along the lines of ""it's okay, only DitzyCoworker's allowed to say stuff like that"".

774,Not the A-hole,"If you didn't downvote from the title alone, here is the deal; I teach BJJ and Submission grappling a few days a week at the local club. For those unaware this is the ""ground fighting"" part of the UFC and other mixed martial arts events.

Recently a young man come into my class & says that he would like to join in the adult class as ""my dad says I'm ready for it."" He says he's 13. I sometimes let students that age into the adult class, based on size and maturity. He also has visible tics and minor speech issues. Not a problem, I have several people on the spectrum in my class & I'm a big fan of the ""least restrictive environment"" concept.

I get the rest of the class warming up, take the young man off to ring & to do some of the drills he should know from kids class. Obvious within 5 minutes he either did not pay attention in the kids class or is lacking the co-ordination required. No biggy, I just set him to do the most basic drills on the matted floor where he cant hurt himself and then get the class going.

He's ok with just doing the drills off to the side, but near end of class, he asks ""when are we going to do the powerbombs?"". Turns out some jackass upstairs let him know I was a pro-wrestler in my youth. Thing is that BJJ is real and pro wrestling <SPOILER ALERT> is not </SPOILER>. Big problem for obvious reasons. So I just had him do basic drills for the rest of class, & and at the end he joined in and shook hands with everyone on the way out like everyone else.

After class I speak w/gym owner & tell him I want to talk to kids parents and let'em know he's probably not ready for this class yet (and may never be). Owner says his mom is out of the picture, dad doesn't really care & the kid is only here because of a community program that tries to get him out of home a few times a month and I'll probably never see him again. I figure problem solved, but, in a bizarre twist of fate, turns out he thinks gruff old me is the greatest teacher he's ever had and he continues showing up to my class for several weeks now.

Now others are commenting how it's unfair to keep him off to the side & some teenage students are telling their parents about how I won't include the ""special"" kid in the class, which has lead to some awkward conversations, with some suggesting I ""tone down"" the class so he can be included after I explain why he cannot.

I can't ""tone down"" the class as this isn't a casual class, I have several high level amateurs (international competitors) & even an aspiring pro fighter in the class, & and the club would certainly lose all their business if I turned it into the kind of class this kid could join in.

To me, there is no conceivable way I can safely include him in the regular parts of class but I want to know from an outsiders point of view, Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: I appreciate the judgement and some of the ideas passed on to me in DMs and messages especially those who thought I was the asshole. Seems like the best thing to do is keep on keeping on and hopefully he will be able to join the rest of the class sometime in the future, glad to see I wasn't the only one thinking outsiders are overreacting though.",68,194,0.92

TL;DR: co-worker sent a screenshot of tattoo artists Instagram post containing her thigh tattoo.


I'm (20's/M) somewhat new to the area we live and have been looking for a tattoo artist to finish my sleeve.  In talking to a co-worker (20's/F), she recommended her tattoo artist. She said he has done 2 tattoos for her. 1 small with not much detail and one large with a lot of detail.  


She sent me a screenshot of his IG post of the large one, that happens to be on her hip/thigh, and told me how long and the price.  I was sold and made an appointment.  


Wife now says that I was in the wrong and it was disrespectful.  


I told her I understand where she is coming from and there would be nothing more sent out of respect for her wishes,  but also said I think it would be different if she took a personal photo and sent that instead.  I told her that when talking about tattoos, size, price, detail, and time all take effect and that's why the photo was sent.


She said ""now you know what she looks like without clothes"". (The picture was taken in a tattoo parlor and only skin showing was hip and upper thigh, everything else was covered)


I told her it's no different than a bikini and I wouldn't be upset if a guy she new sent a picture of a tattoo on his chest/stomach wherever if she wanted one but she doesn't have any tattoos.  She told me that's different because it's a guy. That's when I told her that she is getting over jealous about something that isn't worth being jealous.


There was no other conversation with co-worker that could be remotely taken as flirting.

For reference, co-worker is engaged, and there has never been any infidelity in my marriage.  I'm not attracted to co-worker and I don't believe she is to me either.

Our kids met twice. We spent a day at the pumpkin patch last October, and then they came back over later that week and we all painted pumpkins together.

Last winter, my ex wife reached out to my ex girlfriend on Facebook and they started talking and hanging out. The reason I know is my daughter told me she had played with her son. I asked my ex wife, and she said they were friends now.

This made me very uncomfortable. I asked my ex wife not to talk to my ex girlfriend. She said the kids have fun together, and I told her that I don't really care, I'd prefer that she not be friends with my ex girlfriend. I never told her to do anything, but I asked and she agreed.

I told my girlfriend that I didn’t want to kick Pete out because I didn’t see anything that happened and he was drunk and just being an idiot and if I kicked him out I wasn’t at all confident that he would make it home in one piece.

This lady had her phone on top of someone else’s phone in her group on the charging station. Apparently she had set an alarm thing on her phone to go off if someone moves it because she left it unattended on the charging station. 





When we got to the charging station at our terminal the alarm was going off already and apparently the lady had walked away to do something and someone else in her group was holding it and the alarm was just constantly going off and sounded like a car alarm. Me and my husband were trying to figure out what was making this noise. 






So when she comes back from the bathroom, she’s yelling at her husband “wtf why is my phone going off?! Who touched it?!?!” 





So she looks over at me and my husband with the nastiest face assuming we fucked with her phone, which we did not. I do not care to mess with other people’s stuff. She was just yelling and going on and on about someone touching her phone, very loudly and angrily. For a good solid 10 minutes, constantly bitching. 





Her husband tells her someone bumped it while trying to get their phone plugged in to this station. And she just gets even madder still yelling about people trying to take her shit, which nobody did. 





So she comes to the station, moves other people’s shit around to get her phone plugged back in and she puts that damn car alarm trigger back on it, so if it moves, it goes off very loudly. 





When it’s time to start boarding she’s waiting at the desk, even though she was in the last boarding group. She was in such a hurry to try to cut every other boarding group, I guess she forgot about her heavily secured phone on the charging station. 





Her husband tells her, this isn’t our group you can’t board and she just shrugs her shoulders and stays in the line. My husband and I are still by the charging station because our boarding group was next to last. I unplug my phone and notice hers is still plugged in. She’s near the front of the line at this point. 






So I’m not touching that thing to make it go off very loudly again and have her accuse me of stealing her shit, yet again, just to take it to her and line cutting husband. She was complaining very loudly about god knows what to the people at the boarding gate so I just decided to leave it, thinking maybe she’d remember but I honestly don’t know if she ever did.

802,No A-holes here,"My sister has been begging for a dog for the past 3 years (she's 11), I (19M) never really wanted a dog- In fact I agree with my parents that we shouldn't get a dog, because eventually, as a lot of 11 years old do- they get sick of taking care of pets, and it becomes the responsibility of the elders and the parents. I told my friend about the problem w/ my sister, and she actually offered to let us dog sit her dog  (she was going on vacation), to teach my sister how hard it is to actually take care of a dog.

we took care of that dog for 2 months, and lo and behold, she got sick of it after the first week. I was initially really mad that she lost interest, but after taking care of that darn dog, I actually started to become extremely attached to him.

I took it out for walks, bathed it, let it sleep in my room. It was obvious that the dog and I had a really tight bond, every time I would come back from school, he would go bananas, compared to when my family and sister came home, he would avoid my sister (All she really does is try and pick him up and force him to sit w/ her)

Well, 2 months passed and I was really sad. I drove to friends house to drop off her dog. I stayed for a bit and talked w/ her parents. As I was leaving, their dog was whimpering and I could feel myself tearing up. My friend's father stopped me, and actually asked me if I was interested in buying and keeping the dog, he told me nobody really takes care of it but him, he told me he originally bought the dog to teach his daughter responsibility, however after the first month she had completely stopped taking care of the dog. I told him that I would have to talk to my parents first.

I asked my parents, and they said 100% since they knew how much I cared for that darn cute dog. I told my friend's father that we had a deal. He told me he'd drop by our house and deliver the paperwork and his toys, along with his leash and of course, the dog.

My friend called me, she was really mad. She told me that I can't keep her dog, and that just because she doesn't take care of the dog, it doesn't mean she doesn't care about him. I told her that her father paid for it so that she could learn responsibility, and that it was obvious she wasn't very serious about the dog. She called me an asshole and told me if I took this dog, she will never talk to me again

I completely understand that it's her dog, and maybe I am a huge jerk for taking her dog. I also feel like I have a special connection to this dog, and that any other dog just won't do, also she has no legal obligation over the dog, so WIBTA if actually do buy the dog from her dad? He wants me to come tomorrow and I'm not so sure now.

TL:DR- Friend gave me her dog that her dad bought, to teach my sister the responsibility of taking care of a dog. ended up becoming attached to it, friends father told me friend doesnt take care of dog, offered to let me buy it.

This annoyed me because we'd already talked about this in private and it felt like he was just asking so he could say that I said no and make me the bad guy. He said that because apparently I've been 'liking babies lately' he thought I would be okay with it and that it was crucial the baby was with his friend because she would be breastfeeding.

809,Not the A-hole,"So a bit about the dog; about 2 years ago my friend adopted the cutest little rescue puppy. I was there when she brought her home and I love that dog. She’s a mixed lab with something else and she really is a sweetheart. Unfortunately she’s a little aggressive towards strangers and other dogs since she was abused as a puppy. I completely understand that and maybe my friend could have trained her more or took better precautions but anyways...

My friend always wants to bring her on hikes and other outings which I am usually all for but there have been instances where the dog will bark and lunge at other dogs teeth exposed. I usually go with her and the dog to places I know there won’t be a lot of people since I know the dog has some aggression issues. Unfortunately my friend doesn’t see it that way and sees it as her being “protective.” 

So the other day I went to this beautiful park with my Bf and I thought I would love to go back with my friend so I asked if she would like to go soon. She said yes and she wants to bring her dog.  Now this place is packed with people and I feel like having the dog would kind of be a bad idea since there were lots of other dogs there so I mentioned that and my friend got mad. 

Am I the asshole here for saying something just sort of as a heads up? It would be different if th dog didn’t actively bark and lunge at people but I feel that this may be a bit much for the dog and she might get frightened/aggressive. Just wanted some input because I absolutely love dogs and animals and would never want to treat or judge a dog badly.

Edit: she did bring the dog to puppy obedience when the dog was 3 or 4 months old. She was good up until about a year old and that’s when the barking and lunging started on walks.",34,44,0.88
810,Not the A-hole,"Hello, posting this account on a throwaway.

I lived in a college dorm for the past 2 semesters with a roommate, who I'll call John. Ever since we started being roommates, John kept using and taking my things without permission. The first time was when I had snacks on my shelf, and I noticed he was taking them because of the wrappers in his trash can. I told him one day to ask me for my permission first, he said okay, but a few weeks later, I inspected the box of snacks and saw it was secretly opened. It was turned upside down to hide the opened side. That pissed me off, and I decided to take away the snacks entirely.

There's been other incidents like this throughout the two semesters. Such as when I'm away for the weekend and I caught him using my pillow on his bed when I came back to the dorm. Or when I was taking a shower in the bathroom and caught him going through my coin box. He asked me to borrow some coins only after I caught him in the act. At the time, I decided these things weren't valuable enough to make a fuss over, so I chose to simply hide my valuable items.

However, the last straw was when I witnessed him going through my backpack when I woke up. I asked him what he wanted, but he didn't say anything. I checked my unlocked compartments to see that nothing was taken, so I assumed everything was alright. However, I later checked my locked section of the backpack (a combination lock held the zippers together), and it turned out that my wallet in there was missing most of its bills.

Long story short, I reported this to the dorm staff and the police. Later I was told by the police that he ended up admitting to stealing my money, and was charged with a theft of less than $100.

However, I received an email from him earlier that apologized for his behavior, and asked me to drop the charges. He said that because he's applying to summer internships that do background checks, the criminal charge would affect his internship and post-graduation career prospects.

I have been thinking about this, and I decided that he needs to learn his lesson. He should realize his actions have consequences, that's just how life works. I've had to deal with his shit for the last 2 semesters, and I considered going through my backpack and wallet as the last straw - a serious breach of my privacy. I would like to hear other people's opinions on this situation.

**TL;DR**: Roommate stole my stuff and got charged with a crime, he emailed me asking me to drop the charges because it could affect his career. What do?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT**:
I would also like to add another incident that helped finalize my decision to call the police. The night that I discovered my wallet was missing money, I came back into my room at about 3 AM. I turned on my phone flashlight and saw that a bunch of his clothes were on my bed. He was still awake and promptly took them off without saying anything. Neither of us said anything. I decided to sit on my chair and pretend to sleep in case he tried stealing something again. But then he started turning on *his* phone's flashlight and kept pointing the light at me. I assumed it was either an attempt to annoy me, or to test if I was awake. In my mind, that was what sealed the deal to go to the cops.

He later explained in a phone call between us that he turned on his phone light because I turned mine on. That was his only excuse, and I didn't buy it.",56,39,0.92
811,Not the A-hole,"So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 1 year, and we are definitely going to get married. We just love each other so much, and I trust her with all my heart. I should also mention, I’ve never won an argument. 

Every time she goes out with her friends, she always will call me and tell me about the guys hitting on her, and how she shrugged them away, which I always appreciate. She’s a 9/10, so it’s kinda expected. She also tells me that guys will buy her drinks, which I’ve also been cool with. 

Anyways, yesterday they were at a pool party. When she got back from the party, she FaceTimed me and told me how they wanted to get a table and bottle service, and so she went up to some guys and sweet talked them into letting them all sit at their table. She said “sometimes you have to go out of your way”. 

Up until now, I had no issue with it. Hearing this, I was floored. I thought THE GUYS would be the ones coming up to her. To me this detail made a difference. We had an argument over text last night.

815,No A-holes here,"I'm an associate at a law firm. I was an intern, summer associate, and now I'm an associate. I've worked with Tom-law firm partner who isn't my direct supervisor-each time. He's seen me progress from someone who couldn't figure out how to dial an overseas number to someone who has successfully navigated tense, high-level situations for our clients. Tom was married but got a divorce shortly after I started as an associate, and I have admittedly had more than a professional interest in him. But I've kept my mouth shut in the interest of professionalism even though I always thought we had chemistry.

&nbsp;

The firm sent us to a conference in a major city, and my mom (who lives across the country) had an event with similar dates in the same city. Mom booked a room at my hotel. When the firm arrived en masse, we discussed which rooms we were in and where we'd meet, so I knew Tom was in Room 603. Mom arrived later and I met her in the lobby before the reception. When Tom walked over I introduced them. They hit it off pretty much immediately and began talking about cars (Mom mentioned she's having her old car restored, Tom loves them, but I'm out of my element) so Tom told me to go on in and he'd catch up. Mom said that she would text me about breakfast the next day. Tom didn't show up until the reception was almost over. The next morning I texted my mom about breakfast since I didn't hear from her, and she was adamant that she didn't want me to come over. She gave a bunch of reasons-she was tired, getting a slow start, didn't want to keep me from networking at the breakfast that my conference provided, etc. which I thought was very strange. Tom wasn't at the conference breakfast or the first couple of sessions. 

&nbsp;

When I went to my mom's room before dinner she seemed off, just acting sheepish and guilty. While putting on her makeup she said that she couldn't find her metro card in her wallet, and (with permission) I sat down with her wallet/purse while she primped. In her purse, I found one of the hotel's room keys in its original cardboard insert that said ""Room 603."" I panicked and shoved the card back, then kept looking until I found her metro card. That evening, and my mom kept hugging me and saying stuff like ""You know I love you/I'm proud of you, right?""  Tom's been avoiding me and even the tone of his emails has changed. Now all he asks me are short, direct questions about the case we're working on.

&nbsp;

My mom knows how I feel about Tom. That I look up to him, I'm attracted to him (I never obsessed over him but I have mentioned it), he's seen all of my successes and mistakes. And now I feel like I've lost even our professional dynamic.. I don't think I can talk to her without getting mad and/or yelling so I've decided to gather my thoughts and get some perspective here.

817,Asshole,"So there's this girl at my (a combo of call center and data entry and processing work) that I've worked with for awhile on my team, I always thought she was nice, smart and helpful, but she came across as way more religious than most people in this area especially our age, she usually wears a cross necklace and her cubicle has a bunch of Bible quotes printed and pinned all around it. I noticed she has a tattoo of one of that Jesus fish symbol too on her wrist. I just figured that was probably less weird for her because she's Asian and some Asians here are way more religious than the average person in this area. Plus she doesn't hassle people over it so no big deal. She later got promoted to supervisor and I thought she was a fine choice. 

A couple weeks ago she was talking with me and talked about how she was excited for the next couple weeks because her girlfriend got concert tickets for one in June and how she was excited to be going to see Endgame with her (that hadn't come out yet then), I know that women often call their platonic friends ""girlfriend"" but the way she was talking about her implied it was something else. So I asked ""you have a girlfriend?"" and she said yes and they just started dating relatively recently and showed me a pic on her phone of them together saying ""isn't she so cute?"" (She's a pretty hot Hispanic btw, great catch!) I could tell she was really infatuated with her like people in new relationships often are but then said ""oh I never knew you were into women"", there's a lot of gays and lesbians at my job who are pretty vocal about it, she never is. She told me she doesn't like to heavily flaunt it and she hadn't dated anyone since she worked here until now but yes she's a lesbian. I was shocked and confused so I said ""oh I'm just surprised because of your Christian stuff..."" and she got a little angry looking and said ""um, yeah what's the problem?"" I thought it was obvious but didn't want to continue a heavily awkward conversation at work so I just apologized and dropped it.

A couple days later when she was gone I was talking with another girl on the team who loves to gossip and brought up that our supervisor was a lesbian and said how I learned that recently and was really shocked because of how openly religious she is and the girl was like ""uh, what's weird with that at all?"" I think being very devoted to a belief system that says you're going to be eternally tortured for your sexuality is pretty odd but didn't say that outright. She also seemed to think I was being rude, I was just genuinely surprised and still wondering how someone can possibly have that contradiction. Especially since she's open about religion and isn't about her sexuality as much but also doesn't seem to be ashamed or guilt-ridden about it.

819,Not the A-hole,"I went through an ugly, ugly divorce last year. My wife has essentially let herself go through severe food addiction and I tried everything in the quiver to try and help her and save our marriage. She had a massive public breakdown outside the mediation room and even her attorney advised against her having any sort of decision making custody and as such I am fully allowed to deny visitation any time I feel it's appropriate. 

In conjunction with her eating disorder we found out our son is severe ADHD So I was fighting both fronts at the same time. He does not react well to medication but we have discovered that if he is on a strictly controlled diet, he functions ""normally"" and even has a super high IQ and excels at math (he's in algebra 1 as a 6th grader).

I was allowing the kids to spend one weekend night at her house and I even sent my son his meals. Well she fed the food I prepared to her dogs, bought the kids each a huge package of Reese's cups and put them in front of YouTube and locked herself in her bedroom. This happened 4 times before I knew what was going on. All I knew is my son was a disaster on Mondays and then would even out over the week. I approached her about it this weekend after the kids told me what was happening and she told me ""the diet is bullshit. He needs antidepressants and anti anxiety"" I asked what she'd been feeding them as a whole bag of Reese's can't be real. She said it's none of my business. I told her unless she told me I will insist on a weekly visit at the mall with me one table a way. She called me an asshole and tried to bait me into a bigger argument.

For context, my sister has always been obese, and I've never said anything about it as its not really my place. Before the get-together my sister had been going through a lot. Her best friend passed away and she had just lost her job. Knowing this i was prepared to tread on eggshells all weekend.

One day I asked him if he could tell me the 5 pillars of Islam and he struggled with 4 -couldn’t quite tell me the fifth one. So I wouldn’t say he’s religious. But Eating pork is kind of where he draws the line. When I offer food like bbq ribs, or pepperoni pizza he always says “ Na I’m Muslim.”


The other day He came to my house and just finished smoking all my weed. He asked me if I had any food. I responded “it’s ramadan you should be fasting anyways” he responds “fuck you bitch” and opens my fridge. He grabs some left over  Kolaches , microwaves them and goes to town.

Threw a few jokes and she just replied with, ""tomorrow is my birthday"" and eluded to wanting to hang out. I thought why not, I don't have anything going on. She was going to celebrate with her family on Friday and wanted to meet up for a beer on Saturday.

Fast forward to Saturday she messages me the location of the bar and wants me to come because she's lonely on her birthday. Well as soon as I show up I buy a beer and she wants to leave. I should have seen this as a red flag already because I didn't even really get to know her through one beer. As soon as we get into my car she tells me that we can't go to her place as her son is home with a date and that would be weird. She wants me to pay for a hotel-not even knowing anything but her name and that she has a grown son (yes I know she was older but she had the hole milf thing going on.)

At this point I'm a little taken aback by the forwardness and having to suddenly foot the bill for a hotel room that I don't want to pay for. She changes her mind shortly after I tell her I don't even know her yet and wants to drive 30 minutes away to a bar in a more happening part of town. I'm a little irritated at this point and she starts to say ""it's my birthday!"". As we're driving she starts to tell me how she wants more kids and criticizing me for not having any.

my boyfriend (24) and I have been dating for 3 years now. we're both very happy. I live with roommate, he lives with his older bro and older bros girlfriend. we're all of close ages that we hang out sometimes. BF is extremely close to his bro and his girlfriend however and I have sometimes brought up that I feel left out of a lot of secrets, jokes and plans. he brushes this off as me being paranoid but as I type this they're off to a new restaurant that I wanted to go to, and I wasn't invited. he has a history of favouring them/taking their sides over mine/generally thinking the sun shines out of their asses even if they're being quite devious, which they can often be. 

my cousin and her partner are moving into their first place in a couple months and invited me and boyfriend to come hang with them, we're turning it into a 3 day trip and have already booked transport/accomodation and im ridiculously excited to catch up with them again. out of nowhere older bros girlfriend announces they're having a party for older bro, whose going to be working out of the country for a few months. surprise surprise, party falls right in the middle of our trip and I have a feeling everyone involved knew this but maybe im being too cynical. I was upset but told boyfriend he could go and that I didn't mind going to see my buddies on my own, I understood he'd rather have a fun night with brother before he leaves. this was clearly the wrong response because he exploded and said I'd need to come too and that we'd have to cancel the trip. I asked why I needed to be there and he told me everyone would think it was weird if I didn't show up, that I needed to support him and that being in a relationship meant doing the right thing even if it involved something you didn't want to do. I told him that I had been to every other event, even when I had to cancel important plans, and even when I was clearly the last person told. also, if me being missing from the night was so important to everyone they would have asked if I could make it before they planned, right? boyfriend is insisting im letting him down by not coming to the party.

my cousin can't reschedule for at least another few months. boyfriend has not mentioned at all how much it would hurt me to let my relatives down. I'm certain that this is another example of me being overlooked but expected to drop everything so boyfriend can have best of both worlds - being tight with his family and having a partner who would literally do anything for him. AITA for not wanting to go?",65,192,0.94
826,Asshole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  My boyfriend and I have been dating for over five years.  When we started dating, I weighed 110 pounds at 5'2"".  However, I've had a fat fetish ever since I hit puberty and have always wanted to gain weight.  After years of repressing my sexuality, I finally took the plunge about 3.5 years ago, and I'm now 185 pounds.  I'm happy with my weight and feel like I've hit that sweet spot where I'm on the upper end of chubby but not quite fat yet.  I feel sexy and satisfied with my body for the first time in my life.

My boyfriend hates that I've gained weight and is directly threatening to break up with me over it.  He says that it's not fair that he's about the same weight as when we started dating but I've gained 75 pounds.  He calls me disgusting and says that often he doesn't even want to look at me, let alone touch me (which hurts so much).  But I think he's overreacting.  This is my body and my choice, and it's not like I'm morbidly obese.  I've told him that I'm content with my current weight and don't want to gain any more, so he doesn't have to worry about that, and I feel like we should be able to compromise (I honestly would prefer him a bit heavier, but I've never pressured him to change himself for me because it's his body and his choice) and work this out.  People's bodies change all the time.  If everyone freaked out over a little weight gain, then marriages would never last into old age.

He is refusing to budge and has told me that I either lose the weight or he's breaking up with me.  He's given me a month to decide, but I don't know what to do because I love him and don't want to lose him and everything that's great about our relationship.  I don't understand why he can't see how much this means to me and how much my self-esteem has improved and be willing to compromise with me.  This is really stressing me out, and I'm so torn.

828,Not the A-hole,"Long time reader, first time poster haha, sorry for any typos or formatting problems

I (18, FtM) graduated high school yesterday. My dad's been sort of in and out of my life for a while and I hadn't seen him since I was in 7th grade. As a kid, he would say he was coming for visitation and never show up. When I was in the hospital for a week when I was 14, he refused to see me. When we did have visitation, his wife said nothing but criticisms toward me and my sister (2.5 years younger). We were yelled at nearly every day for things like not eating fast enough, saying dogs were smart, or playing games on my DS (all true examples haha)

He moved overseas when I was in middle school to teach classes at military bases. Our relationship has been rocky at best and I'm still not ready to talk to my stepmother. 

I invited him to my graduation, half expecting him to bail again. He promised he was going to be there for me. He showed up with my step mother, didn't stand up when they asked parents to stand, didn't say he loved me or my sister, told me he liked my shoes, and left for the airport again. I had talked to him for 5 minutes.

I don't know if I'm being over dramatic or over emotional, I'm just so disappointed and hurt. I think he was upset I didn't make honor roll. Would I be the asshole if I just stopped contact with him for a while? It just feels like every time I believe him when he says he's going to be there for me, I get proven wrong.",13,33,0.88

He was with this enormous woman and because he's still an immature slob, he was trying to act overly affectionate with her pretending like he didn't see me. He was in line behind (alone) me and he said hello. I said nice to see you too. He said somthing about losing weight. I said yeah I finally got my act in gear and do triahtlons and marathons now. He said I want my girlfriend to lose weight but I'm worried what would happen to her boobs. I said boobs are just fine if not better than before. He said well they don't look good from here. I was like wow you are still an asshole and I'm not 19 and able to be negged anymore. He said I was still a greedy piece of shit by my ring and the expensive camping mat I was buying. I turned around and ignored his continued comments.

It just ate at me all night so I texted a friend to see if she still had his number, she did so I took a topless mirror selfie and sent it to him. I captioned it ""does moo-cow's udders look this good!"" He just texted me back ""blocked"" which really made me laugh.

832,,"Yesterday early in the day, my girlfriend’s friend texted me that she wanted to come over later in the night with some friends to hangout on our balcony. I was totally okay with this. They all came over and picked up some alcohol and food to grill. The night was going well and more people show up to hang out. At around midnight, I get tired and turn in. I wake up at around 2:00 and everyone is still outside hanging out. They’re being pretty quiet but they’re playing some music and we have quite a few neighbors so I text my girlfriend to ask her to please wrap up the hangout. She doesn’t respond but the next time I hear her inside, I ask her the same question in person only to be basically dismissed. So I wait some time and text the friend who initially planned the get together. All that I said was,”please wrap up the hangout”. No response for about 40 minutes.  At this point I was feeling disrespected by both my girlfriend and her friend. I texted her friend again and asked her where the respect was and explained that if the person who lives at the place she is hanging out at asks them to wrap it up, they should start getting ready to leave or at least let them know when they’re going to leave. Almost a minute later, her friend storms inside and is freaking out saying I’m an asshole. That I’m so disrespectful and that they are all going to leave right away! She was really upset and continued texting me after she left saying a lot of hurtful things. I felt completely justified in my actions but apparently she didn’t. Am I the asshole?

833,Not the A-hole,"I know relationship posts aren't allowed here so I want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. So please don't give any relationship advice.

Okay, so I am a big fan of Seinfeld as I used to watch it every day after school with my dad. I had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters Jerry, Kramer, Costanza, and Elaine. This poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times I got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. So yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

Now my wife and I have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. As you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and I guess you can see where this is going. I hadn't been in my study a few weeks as I've been on an extended business trip, and when I come home to my study my poster is gone. I ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on eBay.

Here's where it gets iffy. She claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, DESPITE it being so sentimental to me. The reason I am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. She tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure I behave myself). However I couldn't say no, I literally had to go or I'd severely hurt my reputation at work. So when I leave we're fighting, when I come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" See where I'm coming from?

I told my wife I was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when I get back. She's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

836,Not the A-hole,"My son is 16. A few weeks ago as a gift for making a HUGE turn around in school (he went from a typical B-C student to getting honor roll, perfect 4.0, AP classes, etc), my wife and I decided to gift for my son a car. We felt like he deserved it for his incredible work ethic and dedicate his time towards his school work. 

Almost every day this week, he’s been out ALL day. No problem by us; of course he’s going to be enjoying his freedom. 

Well he forgot his phone on the kitchen table. I thought it was mine (everyone in the family has the same phone, and my son and I have the same case), so I just put my fingerprint in and it let me in. 

Now would be a good time to mention my son is gay. He’s known since he was 12 and my wife and I have been nothing but supportive. 

Well, the phone opened straight to Grindr. I was confused as fuck but more infuriated that my teenaged son is on an adult hook-up app. I probably shouldn’t have, but I had to know whether he was just killing time (in which case, I probably would’ve pretended I didn’t see anything), or if he was actually using it for its intended purposes, so I peeked through his messages. And sure enough, he’s been seeing almost a different guy every day (4 total in 8 days, judging from his message history). Ages ranged from 18 to in the upper 20s

This was COMPLETELY unacceptable and I stormed in his room and asked him what the fuck did he think he was doing on Grindr. He said it’s not a big deal and why was I going through his phone anyways. I said because I bought it, it’s mine, and I don’t know what the hell he thinks he’s doing on a hook-up app as a teenager. I told him that he’s a kid and WELL below the age of consent in our state (18). He can get these guys in a lot of trouble and even if it was legal, he’s IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

He ultimately tried to say that it’s his life and that he can do whatever he wants and to leave him alone. I told he’s right; it’s his life, and if he wants to not abide by rules in this house, that’s fine, but there will be consequences. I guess he didn’t take my seriously because he just shrugged, so I just walked in his room, took his car keys, and left. He didn’t notice or didn’t care because he didn’t say anything until later when he asked for them and I said absolutely not; he’s shown that he cannot be responsible and it’s no longer his car until he proves otherwise. 

I also told his mom (my wife) and she thought I was too lenient, so to top it off, we plan to cancel his phone plan as well. The idea is to make it as hard as possible if he decided to continue to try to go behind our backs. 

My son’s been non-stop bitching about how horrible and cruel we’re being to him mixed with a bunch of crocodile tears. Needed to come here to double check me and the wife aren’t being unreasonable.

838,No A-holes here,"For the past 2 weeks I have barely slept, ate like shit, and pretty much been dealing with our 4 month old baby on my own. Every waking moment I have is with her. She is going through some sort of phase. I exclusively breastfeed. The past few days I have only gotten 3-4 hours of sleep (sometimes it’s really hard to fall asleep after waking up at 3:30 am. I will literally toss and turn for hours until she wakes up again around 6, and by that point she is up because the sun is up). She is going through sleep reversion. Basically I’m exhausted. I do everything in my power to comfort her when she cries, but it seems like all she does is fuss and cry if I’m not holding her. 

I’m at my breaking point. My husband is currently with her right now. For the past hour she has just cried and fussed no matter what he did (offered her a bottle of breastmilk, played w/ her, held her, etc), and I don’t care. I don’t care how hard it is for him. I just want to be alone. She is still crying and all I want to do is leave the house. I pumped enough milk for 3 bottles. AITA if I just leave for a few hours and let him struggle?

EDIT
Hi everyone thank you so much for weighing in on this! It’s been about 3 hours give or take since I left the house. I went to Starbucks to listen to music and do some sketching. I feel relaxed. In the moment, I was feeling so frustrated and resentful that I needed to step out and I’m glad I did. Someone here mentioned that I sound like I’m punishing my husband, and tbh, I felt like I was doing that too, in a sense. He is a really good husband and a really good father, and we have a “traditional” marriage/gender roles. We both like it this way, but it comes with it’s challenges and sometimes I wish he could produce breastmilk. Lol. 

He works really hard and I try not to immediately dump all my stuff on him, but I do communicate with him about how difficult these past few weeks have been. He has encouraged me as much as he can and does what he can. With exclusive breastfeeding, I am the only one who feeds her, and the only one who should wake up in the middle of the night. I rarely pump because I rarely have time, plus I hate constantly cleaning pump parts. I was fortunate to have pumped yesterday and this morning and was able to get away. 

Anyways I thought I would give more info. I hope it helps.Thank you for all the encouraging words!",392,2093,0.95

842,Not the A-hole,"So, my commencement is next Thursday and the school gives out 5 tickets to each student who is graduating. I decided to give one to each of my immediate family which includes my mother who is coming from Florida, my father who came home from overseas, my brother who share an apartment with. Then i gave one to my old manger and supervisor from work both of which I am close to and bent over backwards to make sure I could work full-time and go to school full-time. 

&#x200B;

These two have given me time off when I needed it, looked the other way when I would come in 30 minutes late, half asleep from a nap I was barely able to get in (I work night shift 23:00 to 7:00). Have allowed me to take vacation time during spring break even though other people were already off during that week and I shouldn't have been able to. Generally, they have been very supportive of my struggle. My old manager is coming up from Georgia, and my supervisor who lives in the same city as me will be there even though she is struggling with a multitude of her own personal problems.

&#x200B;

Today, 5 days before graduation my mom tells me that I'm fucked up because I didn't save a ticket for my aunt. Who has honestly been a part of my life since I was a baby. My mother and her sister are close and we spent a lot of time over there as children. But now I only see her on holidays, and she nor anyone else in my family for that matter has given me any help getting to where I am today.

I make more slightly money than he does, and he pays for the car insurance, amongst other bills, and so I said to him that if he needed any help with bills then I would send him money this month. We plan to completely half the bills when we officially move in.

Last week, he asked me to send him £200 to help with get by with fuel and bills, so I sent it to him. I had explicitly said that I didn't want to send him money for him to waste it because we are both pretty broke and are saving up to sort out the house. Yesterday, he messaged me saying ""won't be able to talk for a while, going to the escape room with \[friend\]"". I messaged back asking how they could afford to go considering they are both broke, and he replied saying ""I used the money you sent me for us both"". This really annoyed me because I had specifically asked him not to spend it on something he didn't need as I don't feel it's my place to pay for that, especially when I have missed out on things this week because I sent him that money. And, to be honest, I was annoyed because we had planned to go to the escape room he went to, and this isn't the first time he has done something with his friends rather than me, which doesn't bother me if it isn't something like an escape room, which you can only do once.

I responded to him telling him to send me the full £200 back, which he then told me he wouldn't be able to make it to pay day without it, and so I told him it wasn't my issue anymore because he chose to spend the money not wisely. I thought it was justified to do this because he had spent the money on leisure whilst I have missed out on things with my friends so that we can save and just pay bills. He sent me the money back and it's been slightly awkward since. I spoke to my friend about it, and she said I was overreacting and if anything, I should've just asked him to send me the money that it cost for him to go to the escape room with. I am now conflicted because I still in a way stand by what I did, purely out of principle, but I now also feel like I am being dramatic, and I'm maybe only acting this way because I'm also mad at him for choosing his friend to go with over me?

845,Not the A-hole,"When I was 15 I had many self-esteem and body image issues. As a kid, I was quite thin, but as I entered adolescence I started to gain weight (despite doing sports and eating healthy) and had an average weight. However, since I was no longer as thin as I used to be I thought I was fat. Now in retrospective I look at pictures and realise that this was by no means the case at all.

&#x200B;

8 years ago, I was going to have dinner with my dad, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's friends (a man, let's call him Fred, and his wife). When Fred saw me, the first thing he said was 'Oh, you've gotten fatter since I last saw you!'. I went straight to the restaurant's bathroom to cry. As I could tell the crying was going to continue, & being the dramatic 15 yr old that I was, I went quickly to the restaurant to grab my things and left the restaurant crying. I told my friends and family what had happened and they all took my side. When my dad called me later that night to ask what happened, I told him and he defended his friend, saying that he did not mean it in a rude way, and that I was exaggerating.

&#x200B;

8 years later I accept that I acted somewhat immaturely. If it happened now, I would explain to Fred why it is inappropriate to comment such things, even if it isn't ill-intentioned, since you never know what struggles someone might be going through.

A week ago I was having breakfast with my dad, and he told me that he was going to have lunch with some friends, and I asked what friends were those. He told me it was Fred and his wife. I said: 'Oh, you're still friends with him?'. He said he is, and that I should someday apologise to him for the ""scene I caused"". I said that Fred should apologise to me for saying such things, and that him (my dad) should also apologise for taking his friend's side since the beginning, and not feeling the tiniest bit of empathy for me. He kept saying that it's not Fred's fault, as ""he's never gone to university when he was young and he doesn't know any better"". I told him not going to university has nothing to do with what he did, and that in any case, he could've calmly explained to Fred why it's not okay to say those things. Anyways, the argument got heated in the cafeteria, with me telling him that thanks to Fred, and him for defending Fred throughout the years, they contributed to my eating disorders and body image issues. In fact, a couple of years later, I had an illness and the medication made me gain around 10kg of weight, further contributing to these problems. I also warned him to never say those things to his grandchildren (my siblings' daughters) if he wanted them to love him. In sum, he kept saying that there was nothing wrong with what his friend said because it was not ill-intentioned.

846,Asshole,"My husband and i got married a few years ago and we decided to try to conceive. I have had some hormonal issues and i was scared i would nog be able to conceive so once we both were 100% sure we wanted to start trying, i didn't tell him anything about ovulating or cycles or anything. I just kept it to myself. We conceived in the second month and our girl is now a todler.

A few months back we decided we wanted a second baby so the same thing happened, i didn't tell him about my cycle or anything. I really feel the proces of conceiving is something i should worry about alone, so i can protect him and not freak him out to much.

A few days ago i started bleeding but it wasnt that much blood and definitely not pms-blood. I took a test and it was positive but a very light line. A few days later i took another test and it was negative. I have bled some more and i think i miscarried. I really don't want to get it confirmed (there is no reason i should, it will only hurt more) so i will never be sure it was a false positive or a misscariage. I have taken 3 other tests since the positive one and they were all negative so it is safe to assume i am not pregnant right now.

I haven't told my husband any of this and i am not sure i should. I don't want him to feel bad. Also, i don't want to be reminded about it too much. I think i just want to let it be for now and just focus on the family i have right now.

About 3 months ago I accepted the honor of being one of the groomsmen in one of my oldest friends wedding (the wedding is in October). I live internationally, and at the time I knew that attending his wedding would be expensive. However, at the time I did not research all the costs, and as I am looking to book a hotel + plane tickets + car rental + rental tux (+ missed days of school), the reality of the total cost is hitting home (around $2,300-$2,600). In addition, I would be missing a week of school, and have to show up to the rehearsal dinner, go the wedding, and then leave the next morning. So all of this probably 60-72 hours total in country.

The more I stare at these costs, the more I want to apologize and back out. However, he is one of my oldest friends who I care deeply about, and I don't want to be a total jerk or ruin our friendship. So this is a bit forward looking rather than rear looking, but if I were to back out of the wedding, would I be an asshole?

852,Asshole,"Asian family. My wife just birthed a beautiful baby boy and my mom came with us as soon as her water broke. Now I don’t really mind I love my mom but I feel it’s unfair that I wasn’t able to spend time with my child. For 12 hours I waited and I held and helped my wife push her baby for an hour and as soon as he was born my wife only held him for a short period and then my mom held him the whole time for about two hours straight, wife developed a fever from the birth so she is on antibiotics in her own room and couldn’t visit my son in his NICU and I never got any alone time in NICU because mom would be upset I didn’t take her as she’s in the room sleeping with my wife aiding her for anything plus random relatives stopped by every time I got off work waiting for me. I’m currently bummed out right now because today as soon as I came out of work to take my son a blanket to add for his crib in the NICU, I was late mind you 1:00 a.m , my wife gave me a milk bottle to feed him when I take him the blankey. Of course mom has to come so we go and long story short I didn’t even get a chance to hold my son. My mom fed him and changed his diaper and everything even though I was asked twice by the nurse before and said yes. I’m really upset I don’t know how to go about this. My parents are the nicest in the world, but they do not give me and my wife space, we made a terrible decision and bought a nicer house so we can all live comfortable but I now regret this. we’re both 22 years old, I work all day everyday to help pay the rent for the house we share and I can’t just leave because my parents can’t afford it on there own for at least another year minimum.

It was the next day, and the money he promised had not been added to my account. Bob admitted he was having ""financial issues"" but promised it would be added to the next paycheck. I reluctantly agreed to wait.

Well, that next paycheck should have been on Friday of last week. For some reason that deposit was literally *one hour* of pay, despite me having worked a full schedule. He was ignoring my texts and calls. Before I went to bed I sent him this text message:

> Ok [Bob] im done with this bullshit. If the past 2 weeks are not in my account when i wake up on monday morning, im not coming back. Thanks.

He called me and promised I'd get it all on the next Friday. I told him no.

On Monday morning I checked my bank balance. There was no money from the company. So I stayed home. Around lunch time, Bob called me promising extra money (I don't remember the exact amount) if I came into work and waited for Friday. I told him to fuck off and I blocked his number.

The guys I worked with are pissed at me. My girlfriend also said I was too harsh. She says I should apologize at least. I'm ready to apologize for a few of my words if Bob gives me my money before I contact the state labor commissioner's office next week. That seems unlikely.

I tried to explain what I meant, telling them that Erica is generally what most people would default to when thinking of pretty- blonde hair, blue eyes, fairly symmetrical features, however Sam with her black hair, large steel gray eyes unique facial features is still beautiful just in an unconventional way that one would not expect- a lot of models are actually categorized this way.

Sam laughed it off but I could tell that my comment hurt her and it doesn't help that Erica is now saying that I called Sam ugly to her face. AITA for commenting on their looks and opening up for what I thought was just an honest and harmless discussion?",472,1264,0.92

Earlier today my cousin 10 asked if he could paint his nails because he always wanted to, I was a little nervous thinking about what their parents would think kinda didn’t care; Immediately I said of course because nail painting isn’t gendered and even if it was IDGAF, I want them to have a great time and enjoy their life. So after two of them kept begging I gave them my nail polish container and let them have at it. They were so proud of their nails and commented on how “gorgeous” they looked. I’m not a stickler to gender norms so I commented on how great they looked too. When their nails dried and they perfected their nail art they went to show their parents and that’s when ish hit the fan. One of the girl’s parents (age 8) said she wasn’t old enough to wear nail polish and the corresponding son was asked what other people would thing and to go remove it (age 10). The other cousins were told that boys don’t wear nail polish (age 7) and the girls ( age 4 and 5) were perfectly fine.  The boys were devastated and cried and kept saying they didn’t see it as a girl thing. Am I the asshole for telling them it isn’t a girl thing and that they are always welcome to wear nail polish at my house? I’m so frustrated with how my aunts and uncles handled the situation.

Anyways, I (18F) have a coworker who we’ll call A (18F). A is a very excitable and happy girl with bad ADHD and keeps forgetting to take her medication, so she her excitement is amplified a lot when she’s not taking it (I’ve taken medication before so I know it’s easy to forget, nothing against that at all or her having ADHD, I just thought it would help explain why she’s so excitable.) 

One thing about A, though, is that when she gets very happy or excited, she’ll grab her boobs and just hold them. And she is very obvious about it. She doesn’t try to hide it or pretend she’s doing anything else, she’ll just hold them for a long time. We work in a restaurant and I’m not sure she’s done it in front of customers yet but I can only imagine what they’d think if she did. 

Another thing is that it makes me really uncomfortable when she does it, especially if she has a day where she does it a lot or if she holds them for a really long time. She was in some of my high school classes and I remember one time I had to ask her to please stop (we’re friends so its not like I was asking as a stranger) because she had been doing it for an entire class period and she had been joking about it and moving her boobs around a lot and it was just making me really uncomfortable since I was next to her the whole time. I have to stand next to her behind the counter at work too and I get really really uncomfortable whenever she does it now. She’s not doing it to be sexual or in any manor like that, but it’s still not something I’d like to see.

866,Asshole,"This might sound super, super petty, but we want a guest at our son's first birthday party to help pay in part for the photographer we hired because she ruined many photos.

We hired a photographer because it's a big day. Our first year being parents and our son's first birthday. We asked people to clear out away from the photographer at key moments because we didn't want people occluding the action. Things like opening gifts, taking a bite of cake, etc. We just wanted to get clear photos of these events and not have people stand in the way.

This guest in question isn't our friend, she was a +1 from one of our friends. I guess she didn't get the memo because she's in all of these shots. It's really not a big deal if she's in the corner or just slightly in frame on the sides, but I mean trying to put her face next to our son's face as he opens presents so she's center frame, doing bunny ears above his head, etc. 

The most egregious example and what prompted us to want to ask for reimbursement, was we put a dab of cake on our son's nose for a photo and her cellphone in her outstretched hand is in frame. Her phone's on and has Tinder on screen.

I don't blame our photographer. Things move fast with a toddler and things can be unpredictable. He frames, points, and shoots continuously, there's no time to stop, ask people to move, etc because in a moment the moment is gone.

We want to reach out and ask her to pay $100 for ruining these photos. We paid $800 for the photographer for 4 hours. All of the most important shots are ruined and cannot crop them to fix them.

I live 500 miles away and my older sister lives 120 miles away but I am expected to do all of the elder care. My sister will occasionally ""help"" my dad with his computer. He is very trusting and naive.

This past week, when I did my nightly check in call, dad says his gmail is no longer working and he gave someone $250 to clean up his computer. I thought right away this was a scam, so I contacted my sister since she helped him with his computer the last few times.

My sister right away gets mad at me and says it's NBD, she'll fix it later.

Later rolls around and dad is still without his gmail, which is the email given to all his financial institutions. I worry, so I try to log into his gmail myself to see if I can fix it.

As it turns out, my sister set up dad's gmail a while ago so that SHE gets the 2-factor verification code sent to her phone. They can also send a code to dad's Mac email, but my sister hadn't double-checked it and his account was listed incorrectly. So she was the only one who could fix this.

I got upset because she was telling me this was my fault somehow because I had tried to work on the problem. There's a long history of abuse from her. Now, instead of it being physical and mental, it's just emotional. So, she starts calling me crazy and blocks me when I get upset that she set up dad's gmail like this and is acting like it's NBD.

I then realize what I had long suspected- that she reads dad's emails. She also accesses his apple account. He doesn't know this. I have had this strange feeling that she reads our emails for years, but I didn't understand how. Now it all makes sense.

She was being so hard to work with, I finally realized that she did this on purpose and is now most likely going to try and take over dad's apple account also with 2-factor verification sent to her cell. Dad has a Jitterbug phone that can receive texts.

She was being nasty, calling me crazy, blocking me, etc etc that I realized she is out for total control so she can access his finances.

I ended up telling her that if she even thinks about setting up 2-factor verification with her cell phone on dad's apple account (giving herself full access of course) without him realizing what's going on that I would not hesitate to contact Adult Protective Services for elder abuse.

I don't know if I crossed over a line or not. Dad would understand the whole set up if it was explained to him carefully though, and would probably say, ""no, I don't want the 2-factor verification to go to your phone"".

I should add that my parents are well off and my sister in the past has started asking my mom for her jewelry when her husband was unemployed for a year and a half. There's also a long history of her flying into rages and beating me for no reason.

888,Asshole,"A discussion about whether alternative medicine is real or not ended in my friends convincing some girls (F20s) at this party that I (M26) am a professional healer. They believed in healing, tarot, oils and all of this crap. My friends think the entire industry is just a scam, and I of course agree.

Long story short, my friends told them I was a healer, but they had never believed it was real. It ended with three of the girls paying me $50 each for a ""full energy cleanse"", and I also ""healed"" the neck pain one of them had. I did some weird hand gestures, talked about their aura changing color, and seeing all the negative thoughts leaving their mind's atmosphere.

They all actually said they could feel it working, and felt that it proved that my ""abilities"" were real. My friends laughed the whole time, it was ridiculous. But it ended with my friends saying they finally believed it, and that they would start taking me seriously from now on. I still don't know if the girls actually believed them.

889,Not the A-hole,"I’m an only child, and my parents had me pretty late. My mom has always wanted to have a CLOSE relationship with me, similar to the one she has with her own mother. Me being an excellent student has a lot to do with my anxiety (everything has to be perfect or I’m worthless), but also with her being so controlling and such a freak.

I didn’t have a youth. She lied to me because of another health issue I have to keep me from having a social life (eg: you can’t drink alcohol, it could kill you), she scared away almost all my friends. The first time I went to a party and came home a bit tipsy she called me a little slut the next day. I saw therapists, and every time they would bring up the toxic environment I was brought up in, my parents stepped in and called them “money thirsty people” because nothing could be wrong with their education.

So had a huge breakdown in college, and ended up in a mental institution twice. I live far away from my parents (it was a choice, as you can imagine). They came to visit and were really snitchy and more pressuring than supportive. My mother cannot tolerate that something is off with her daughter, and refuses to treat me correctly.

When I stopped going to school, she told my grandma all about it without my consent. We specifically had a fight about how I wanted to tell her myself when I’m ready, and she did not respect my will. After that, I didn’t talk to her for three weeks, until I was forced to see her but she never apologized.

Everyday I spend with my parents is a nightmare, and I’m staying there for three months this summer. Right now, my mom wants to call me every two days, which I refuse because I don’t want to talk to her that much.

Over winter break, I told her I wanted to go on holidays on my own, because I’m an introvert and also to challenge myself. She started crying and asking me if I didn’t have any friends to come with me. So I abandoned the idea to please her, and I’m going on vacation with two friends for a week. It’s abroad, we have to take a plane, and she is PISSED. Again. I have panic attacks because of how guilty she makes me feel for looking forward to it. She makes me feel guilty for everything I want, do and like. My current therapist wants me to tell her to go to therapy herself, but I know she won’t do it.

I really want to tell her how toxic she is to me, so that the situation can change and we have a healthier relationship . Am I the asshole for not loving my mother? After everything she has sacrificed for me?",15,32,0.91
890,Not the A-hole,"When I first started planning for prom, I wanted to wear a pant suit because I’m really not comfortable in a dress. My mom insisted on a dress, so I ended up buying one I liked online.  
  
  But then, some close family friends brought a few that they liked and insisted on doing my hair and make up. To be honest, I didn’t really like any of the choices they brought me because I’m a bit conservative with my body. I dislike showing my chest or back, but they didn’t like the dress I chose so I ended up wearing a tank top inside of one of the dresses so that I wouldn’t show skin.  
  
  Today, they came over to do my hair and make up. The first thing was that they wanted me to lower the tank top, and they kept insisting and I kept saying no. Even though I’m a swimmer, I feel like a swimsuit and a revealing dress and two different things, but I can’t explain why.  
  
  Then, they spent nearly three hours on my face and hair. I hate everything about it. The eyeshadow and eyeliner are really heavy and I looked like I hadn’t slept in a week. They rejected my choice of lipstick and chose a really bright pink one. For hair, I thought it would be fine to just let it be, but they ended up styling it. Even though I told them my hair doesn’t curl, they tried to curl it.  

  I hate it all. I hate my dress, my make up, and my hair. I feel like I was a bit grumpy throughout and looking back, I don’t think I was very positive, but it was hard to be happy when I’ve never felt uglier.

891,Not the A-hole,"This is my first time doing AirBnB hosting and my first guest was a 22-year-old out-of-town male kid, who's looking for a temporary place to stay as  he looks for a more permanent place since he just relocated from another state to my city 2 days ago for a new job.  He booked for 3 nights total.


My airbnb posting has a 1-max occupancy for a private bedroom and bathroom. I didn't even entertain couples because I do not want to deal with more than 1 person. There was also House Rules posted that quiet hours are 11PM-7AM. Me and another friend occupy the other 2 bedrooms in the apartment.

The guy seemed like a pretty nice kid in the way he carried himself when we interacted upon his arrival, so nothing alarmed me. That night, He went out to check the city's nightlife because it was a Friday night (and I'm sure being new, he got probably excited). Then,  a couple hours later, I was woken up at 3 AM by noises in the living room, where I was shocked to see 2 more strangers at my home. I've never been so upset right after waking up, and my blood pressure never shot up so early in the day. I was visibly angry. I pulled him aside to the kitchen and asked him to get the other people out. He then tried to negotiate  with, ""what if I send the other person home with  an uber except for her?""  with the intention of having one person stay overnight (the kid was tryna hookup, obviously). Given the situation and how I felt, I said ""no"". 


They left soon enough (maybe after 20 minutes) after it was clear that I was not going back to bed until everyone was gone. I didn't fall asleep until after an hour or so because of my high emotions.

894,Not the A-hole,"I am a single parent of 2 teen boys, 17 & 19 years. The 19 yr old works less than 25 hours a week, the 17 yr old is about to be senior year. I work full time with a 2 hour a day commute. I have no family to help me and the boys' father is absent.

Since the boys were about 8 and 10 yrs I have given them the daily chore of doing the dishes after dinner, and for that entire time there has been a conflict over it- as in they don't want to do it. No matter what I have tried, chore charts, rewards, punishments, cash, reducing the amount of dishes they have to do, nothing works. It is a daily battle. They procrastinate, ""forget"", outright say no, argue about the fairness of having to do it. I am so exhausted from the years of bullshit over this that I am questioning if I am the asshole.

Other than asking them to clean up after themselves in the common living spaces (I've given up on them keeping their bedroom clean), do their own laundry and very occasionally clean the bathroom, the dishes are the only other thing they have to do.

One of their biggest arguments is that they don't understand why the dishes have to be done on a daily basis and I regularly have to wait 24 hours or more before one pile of dishes has been done.

I am currently in a stand off with my 19 yr old who is refusing to put away a load of dishes after I took his computer, wifi, phone data away because of a particularly bad weekend when I had to wait 48 hours for him to put away the dishes. He says he won't do them until he gets everything back.

I feel especially resentful toward the 19 yr old as he refuses to get a full time job, he doesn't understand why he needs to. But expects me to subsidize his life. He pays me a nominal amount for rent but not nearly enough to cover all of his expenses like food, medical, internet, phone etc.

Part of me thinks it would be easier for me to do the dishes myself and be done with the stress and arguments. But then I think fuck that. I'm a single parent that has to do everything. The very least they can do I the very few chores I ask them to do, and do it in a reasonable time. I am also trying to do their future relationships a favor by teaching them to pull their weight around the house and not expect their wives or girlfriends to do everything for them.",34,28,0.91

My niece and her mother are both Muslims, I am not. While looking at online for ideas for doll clothes, I found a pattern to make a doll sized Hijab, my niece wears one and I thought it would be nice for her doll to match her as air have made them matching outfits.

I often take pictures of what I sew and a coworker saw the picture of my model doll in a Hijab prototype (this is harder than I thought it would be) while I was showing pictures.

We made specific mention we're doing a balloon photoshoot for our daughter and any friend who wanted to join in. We got about 30 balloons, set them up outside in an ornate way to get best photos possible. Balloons and bubbles are her favorite things in the whole world it seems, so we think it's a nice treat for her and our photo album.

We're getting my daughter ready inside while we leave everything outside. We get outside and all but four balloons have been popped by this other girl. Her mother is sitting in a lawn chair nearby encouraging her ""okay, now go get that one too!"". It's just a big game of popping a balloon, laughing, egging her on to pop another, et cetera.

We tell this mom to leave with her child. She argued saying she thought we already did it. Never mind *she watched us set it up* and why would we do the photoshoot prior to the party officially beginning? It was just us there, no one else showed up. So her mother leaves, dragging her child in tears, too, with some choice words for us.

30 balloons is what, $5? I know it's not a lot of money but we ended up doing no photoshoot because we didn't want to go out and get more. We planned this, let everyone know in advance, and they still did this to us.

Now both sides will be even!"" Which I brushed off at first, but small comments here and there have definitely solidified that I'm just a stand-in to even out the sides. 

She is adamant about all of us wearing a designer dress, which I guess  is normal but she expects us to spend $250 minimum because she doesn't want us ""looking cheap."" Also we have to have our hair and makeup professionally done (at our own expense) using the makeup artist and hair stylist teams she is hiring (also super expensive). Also, this wedding is at no cost to her. Both her family and her fiancé's family are paying for the entire thing.

She loves all the attention, and making everything (even stuff not involving her) all about her. We got engaged within like 2 weeks of each other, her engagement happening first. Once I got engaged she was going on and on about how honored and touched she was that my fiancé proposed because he saw how happy she and her fiancé are, and that I should totally thank her for ""basically being the reason"" Im finally being engaged after so long (my fiancé and I have been together for over 6 years, she and her fiancé have only been together for like 3, on again off again).

Also, our wedding dates are a year apart, almost to the day. They hadn't announced their date when we picked ours, so it would have been impossible to copy their date, but yet she's been bitchy to me any time my wedding comes up in conversation. Sarcastic comments like ""are you going to copy my wedding dress too?"" when I mentioned wanting sleeves on my dress And ""oh look, we both are using purple in our weddings, what a surprise! 🙄🙄"" Even though they're completely different shades, and my purple is just an accent color. And I'm just done with it. I'm not even involved enough in her planning to know all of these details she claims I'm copying.

It always coincides with my birthday, which I don’t mind because it’s like a free party. This year some people couldn’t make it so we decided not to do it and just have a small party for me instead. 

So my family asked me what I wanted, and I asked to have my Nan/aunts there, for us to get a takeaway and have a few drinks, listen to music etc. Nothing too big, just a quite evening really. 

Now, this morning, which is the day it’s happening, I get told that my mum has invited my sisters friends round, that we’re doing a barbeque, and my sister and her friends want to play drinking games with my mum and my sister. 

I’m a bit annoyed as I don’t like getting drunk in front of people I’m uncomfortable with, and I was looking forward to it. I’m not comfortable with getting drunk in front of my sisters friends, and tbh if it’s a party for me why are they even here? 

Plus I wanted a takeaway as I don’t want to cook, and I usually have to help with cooking because I can’t have gluten and get very sick from it, so I make sure I help with cooking so I don’t get sick. My family are more lax than me about cross contamination. The takeaway I wanted is gluten free and we eat there a lot, and I’ve never had a problem with them. 

But no one wants a takeaway, so we’re having a barbecue. And I’ve been told I don’t have to cook, since I said I didn’t want to because I always cook. so I’m just hoping I don’t get sick from it, because my mum is now drunk whilst cooking it and she messes things up when she gets drunk. 

Would I be the asshole if I just spent the evening in my room? They want to sing happy birthday to me, but it’s not about me at all. If I knew this was happening I would have prepared for it, but I was told literally this morning, and I was really looking forward to the original plan.",91,661,0.96

912,Not the A-hole,"So I thought that we will receive our company bonus this week, which I joyfully told my wife. The 15th came and no bonus got credited to my account. I found out the day after that only the high ranking guys received their bonuses that day, the rest get theirs on the 30th.

Despite having my payroll atm and online access to my account, wife still did not believe me, accused me of spending it all and told this to my parents who I do not have a great relationship with.

Parents and wife wanted to have an intervention type conversation where they just brought up past mistakes of me misusing money. I was suddenly full of it and just walked out of it as I did not do anything with the money, I just havent received it yet.

913,Not the A-hole,"So, my sister and my mother currently live with me. My mom left my abusive father a few years ago and ever since I've been taking care of them both. 

My sis is currently in the last year of her college, she's supposed to finish college by July this year. The company I work for is moving to a different city in my country and so am I along with my mother and sis. This move will be a bit tough on all of us as the city we're moving to is about 30% costlier than where we currently live. 

So I asked my sis what her plans were post college. She told me her best case scenario is she gets in to one of the universities she's aiming for in the summer 2020 in take. So, I asked her if she plans on getting a job here or if she has different plans. To which she replied saying that she's just gonna ""chill"" until she goes to study. 

This enrages me, it's not a rosy situation for us just on my income. I'm currently struggling to make ends meet. I have asked her before to at least get a job somewhere in something she likes during her holidays. Also, most colleges here let you work in your last year of college. She refuses to do so. 

It doesn't end here, she has all specific requirements and needs to live life. She has specific diet which costs me at an average $20 more everyday. She needs to have the latest iPhone every year. She has to go out to extremely costly bars every fucking week. She does all this on my money. I do not have a problem with her doing any of this as long as it's her money but currently it's my money and it's making things excruciatingly tough for me and also my mother. 

I've explained our situation multiple times to her but she tells me it's my problem as I took their responsibility. 

So, I plan on telling her that if she's living with us, she needs to pitch in to the household. Will I come across as an asshole if I do so? 

TLDR: Sister's being very entitled. So will I be the asshole if I ask her to start pitching into the household?

EDIT: About her needing therapy, I recognize this. I bought a session at a therapist and asked her to go. She did but she then told me that she didn't like the therapist. I bought a new session at a different therapist, she hasn't gone to the session yet. 

About calling 911 or emergency services whenever she threatens to harm herself, I live in India, we do not have a service like 911. There are services to call and I will try them the next time. 

About enabling her entitlement, I just wanted her to be comfortable. When they started living with me, all I wanted for both my mom and sis was to be relaxed and comfortable. I thought supporting her wants and needs will keep her in a happy place. I didn't envisage her becoming entitled and abusive. I will draw a line.

917,Not the A-hole,"Apologies in advance if this thread is a bit of a downer. This is a question I've been struggling with since I found out the extent of my condition, and it's honestly only gotten more stressful as time has gone on. By the way, please don't let my condition influence your judgement of me, I'm only including it here for context.

I'm a 29 years old woman and was diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma. So let me take this opportunity to remind everyone to get a mole map done at some point, it most likely would have saved my life. Anyway my condition has only gotten worse and my chances of survival are 10% at best according to those treating me. I've basically been told that I should prepare everything now for when I (most likely) pass away.

This leads me to a difficult situation regarding my sister. We've never really gotten along well, mostly living separate lives, and we completely stopped talking to each other several years ago. My sister was responsible for breaking up my first marriage after she told his parents something about me that they didn't approve of. His parents threatened to excommunicate him if he didn't divorce me, and he did. I haven't spoken to her since.

I've never forgiven her for this. And I never will forgive her. Ever.

However, my mother, father, and brother - while understanding my resentment - all want me to forgive my sister. They say that what she did was despicable and I'm completely right to despise her, but that if I don't forgive her before I pass she'll never get closure. Supposedly (all of this I've heard through my parents), she has been racked with guilt ever since she found out about my condition. She wants to apologise and seek forgiveness but I haven't given her the chance.

As I said, I cannot and will never forgive her. This post is not about whether I should forgive her.

This post is whether I should pretend to forgive her so that she can have closure. This is what my mother wants me to do. As it stands now, I have no intention of giving her closure and feel she doesn't deserve it. My family thinks I'm being vindictive (they haven't said this harshly due to my situation, but they really want me to forgive her).

Everyone in my family is extremely attached to this situation and I need some unbiased opinions here. So AITA for not wanting to give her closure?",1115,6268,0.97

Been going on for the 6 years I've known him, and who knows how long before that. 

He's been banned from ordering from Amazon and now Boxed Lunch.

What he does is:
1) Order something online
2) Receive the item and call and complain you didn't get it to get a refund
3) Take the item to the actual store and return it with no receipt for store credit 
4) Profit

I've been at the store when he ordered clothes, called and got his money back, took the clothes in and returned them but ALSO took stuff off the rack and returned them too. Store gave him a gift card. He just said it was a separate order and he didn't have the order information. Store doesn't care. They just process it.

If one store blocks him, he'll drive out of his way to another location to return stuff. As long as he can get a refund, along with getting his money back

He ordered a custom anime statue. It was delivered to an address he since moved from. He asked me to go grab it for him since I lived closer. I did. We unboxed it and everything. I log on Facebook a couple weeks later and a post happens on my timeline of him complaining to the artist that nobody called him back and he never received it. I'm like ""wtf I know you got this one!"" He just says to mind my own business. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting to report this stuff? It's annoying that he rips everyone off, and also annoying that he lies when questioned. I've been there in person for this stuff far too often, and it's uncomfortable. 

I've been at dinner where he's plucked his own hair out to put in the meal to get it comped...his dishonesty knows no bounds. 

I ordered something for him from Boxed Lunch for store picked up, forwarded him the confirmation pickup email, he picked it up and then I got an email thanking me for calling customer service. It threw up some red flags.

923,Not the A-hole,"I (28f) went out on a few dates with a guy (27m) in April. Then one day when we were hanging out, he starts flirting with some other girl. I pulled him aside and told him that while we weren't an official couple, I was uncomfortable with him flirting with other girls right in front of me. In the following argument, he revealed that he's poly. I have no problem with polyamorous people, but that's not me. If he had told me that before, I wouldn't have dated him. I put an end to it there and we've barely spoken since, though I've run into him at some social events.

A few days ago, I saw him being really touchy with some other girl. Later I saw her heading for the ladies' room and I followed her. I asked her if he had told her that he's poly, and she said no. Apparently, that was not her type of relationship either, and she ended whatever was going on with them.

Now he's furious with me, saying I had no right to go behind his back, that it's none of my business, and that he was going to tell her when the time was right, and that he learned from his experience with me. I don't believe him, because she clearly had no idea, though I have no idea how long he'd been seeing her. He's claiming that I'm jealous and petty and just trying to get him back. I think she had the right to know. I'm definitely not trying to ""get him back""- I feel used by him, tbh.

My (mid twenties) boyfriend (late twenties) was born and raised in the same small city and has lots of friends from all walks of his life. I've met many of them and generally think they're good people and get along with them, and I've gotten feedback through my bf that they generally say they like me a lot too. 
So, there's this one friend that had recently moved back that my bf wanted to hang out with. He had never talked about this friend before so I was assuming it was a casual friendship, and he said he might have hung out with her about five times before she had moved away. So we're out with her and their mutual friend (m) at a bar, everyone's been drinking, when she starts doing belly shots off their mutual friend. Ok, weird for the bar we're at but fine. She then starts talking about men's chests or something and starts unbuttoning their friend's shirt. She then comes over and starts unbuttoning my bf's shirt. I'm a little shocked and say nothing but I'm mad. She then comes over again and unbuttons my bf's shirt again and is talking about his nipples. I swat gently at her hands and say ""hey! Keep your hands off my bf!"" And she just freezes and backs off. I was pissed my bf hadn't done anything while she was unbuttoning his shirt, and we talked afterward about boundaries with others. 
This person is not the type of person I care to hang out with, and last night I saw my bf was texting her to join us at a bar and I got mad. AITA for saying I don't want us hanging out with her?

930,No A-holes here,"Throwaway obviously.  So before you grab the pitchforks let me explain.



My parents are both obese.  Nothing that makes them completely immobile, but they're both pushing 300.  I have nothing against obese people; sometimes they're already trying to be healthy, and sometimes they're completely fine as they are.  Not everyone can control their weight.



The thing is, my parents eat like SHIT.  They blow all their grocery money on sugary juice, Drake's snacks, candy, and seltzer water because normal water ""doesn't taste like anything.""  They only recently stopped drinking soda, just to substitute it with cheap, sugary juice anyway.  They go to the doctor's and lie about how much they exercise and how much water they drink.  They lie to their DOCTORS.



So clearly they've developed health problems because of this.  BOTH have had kidney stones, one has a bad back, bad knees, bad everything, and one has high blood pressure and has HAD A HEART ATTACK.  First thing they did once they got home from the hospital? Bought a shitload of snacks because ""those nurses were StArViNg them in the hospital!!!""  



I've given up on feeling bad for them and helping them with their problems because I feel they caused them.  They refuse to do anything to change it and continue to fry their dinner, eat massive portions of food (like 3-4 servings worth EACH) and snack constantly during the day AND even come back for more snacks at midnight.  One of them has basically never touched a vegetable in their life and one only eats them if they're drowned in salt and dressing.

932,Not the A-hole,"So, let me start off by saying that I already feel like an asshole. throw-away account for that reason.

When I was 19, I was diagnosed with cancer. Right before treatment, I froze some of my eggs on the advice of my oncologist. I eventually needed a full hysterectomy. I  got better and returned to normal life and college. That's where I met my husband. We both knew we wanted children down the road.

Years later, we started exploring both surrogacy and adoption. My sister-in-law Bethany (married to my husband's brother), learned that we were exploring both options, and had all of the sudden volunteered to carry the baby for us. She has 3 kids of her own and all of her pregnancies were smooth-sailing. She went out of her way to convince my husband and I that she'd be the best choice. My in-laws were thrilled. Eventually it seemed like I couldn't say no because everyone was so excited. I was taken aback by the generosity.

While Bethany was preparing for the implantation, and she was undergoing injections, which are typically well tolerated but, Bethany was complaining of multiple symptoms & seemed to need a lot of rest. She wanted to persist and the whole family stepped in to help with her own kids, which included driving them to school and taking them in for sleepovers to help her rest. She became pregnant soon after.

Bethany quickly started experiencing nausea and severe morning sickness. Every pregnancy is different but it seemed odd. Again, the whole family rallied behind her and prepared meals for her, took care of my nieces and nephew, paid for a cleaning service, and went above and beyond to dote on her. As soon as the morning sickness had subsided by month 4, she started having severe back pain. Again, a new pregnancy symptom for her.

She started doing things that made me feel uncomfortable. She did a maternity photo shoot & included the rest of our extended family in the pictures. She posted the photos on facebook, as well as multiple updates on her pregnancy. She posted ultrasound pictures online for 'her little nugget'. She posted a long facebook post on mother's day detailing her pregnancy and how surrogate moms should be celebrated on mother's day. Now she is insisting on having a joint baby shower. I explained that as the new mom, I felt that I, for once, should be the center of attention and celebrated as the mom. She already had her baby showers for her own kids. It doesn't feel like it is acknowledged that it is MY child.

I told my husband and he thinks I am the asshole and that she's done this wonderful thing for us. It feels odd to me now that she has this control over the family and I am worried that she will continue to interject into my family well after the birth. I am already sensitive about not being able to carry my child, and watching her take this over the top has hurt me. Am I the asshole for feeling hurt and wanting my own baby shower?

&#x200B;

Edit to add: some of her other behaviors:

\- I let he know that I wanted to have a gender reveal party with one of those cakes that are either blue or pink on the inside. She told my parents-in-law the gender before I could even start planning the party, and then she made it sound as if it's no big deal, because there were other people that don't know the gender yet. She blamed the whole thing on her 'pregnancy brain'

\- She wants our mother-in-law to be in the room when the baby is born, and while I am grateful that she has allowed me to be in the delivery room as well, I feel that it is strange. I wanted to have some bonding time with the baby and with my extended family in the delivery room and in the waiting room, there's no way I am going to have that privacy for the first two days. The strange thing is that she did not allow anyone in the hospital for 24 hours when her own kids were born.

\- She insisted on pumping exclusively for the baby. I told her that I would rather formula feed and she said that she's going to pump anyway in case I change my mind. She also asked if she could have skin-on-skin time with the baby to stimulate her milk production. She said she promises not to attempt to breastfeed our baby. I am going to formula feed and I don't understand.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

**Thanks again everyone for the support and tough love. On the pregnancy symptoms, I do agree that I was mostly the asshole for doubting her pregnancy symptoms. Due to my cancer treatment and hysterectomy, I went into menopause while barely out of my teens. I had battled feeling less of a woman because of it. Despite that, I rejoiced with each of my SIL's pregnancies and swallowed my own feelings about infertility and menopause (while also watching countless other friends and relatives give birth so effortlessly). When SIL developed those strong pregnancy symptoms, I feel like it was a slap in the face. Not only was she pregnant with my child, she was REALLY pregnant with my child. I realize that it was unfair to her and I will seek counselling to deal with my feelings.**

**I do believe we did our due diligence with the legal paperwork and like I had mentioned, all parties have their own lawyers and we have addressed multiple scenarios, and finances. I will have to trust that she will hand over the baby as agreed. The arrangement that we have with the hospital is that we will have one joint room but with a partition, and I will stay on the other side of the maternity suite with the baby until she is discharged. Moreover, our entire family will turn against SIL if she decides to cause problems or keep the baby, and I don't think that will happen.**

&#x200B;

**My mother-in-law is very overbearing when it comes to grandkids and it was one of the reasons why my SIL had a rule in place for the births of her own kids. She did not have any visitors for the first 24 hours.I think she is enjoying being the sole giver of grandkids for my in-laws.**

&#x200B;

**For the baby shower, what SIL had proposed is that we each open a gift and that both get to invite our own friends/ family - therefore, joint in every sense of the word, but she has no interest in keeping the gifts. She wants to ooo--aaaah over the cute outfits, which I think is my job as a new mother? I like the suggestion of having a post-birth shower and make it even more so about the baby.**

**Hindsight is 20/20 and had I known about the emotional roller coaster, I would have thought twice about the SIL's offer, but I also don't regret any minute of it because of the love that I feel for my daughter. But, it has been extremely isolating being on the outside watching in, and SIL and her sainthood being beyond reproach because of the extremely selfless act. I have been kicking myself over my feelings and I wish I had gotten help sooner.**",505,2009,0.98
933,Not the A-hole,"**(Kind of Long, TL:DR at the bottom)**

&#x200B;

Being the big nerd that I am, I started up a hobby collecting ""Hobby Shop"" board games. That is the $50, $80, $120 ones that you're not gonna find in Walmart or Target. Hobby gaming stores' expensive, well-made, interesting ones that go way past Monopoly or Scrabble. Things like Red Dragon Inn (and its DOZENS of expansions), Twilight Imperium (we need MORE table space!), and the like are the norm for me.

&#x200B;

With that in mind, I wanted to spend time and get closer to my wife's family. My in-laws are complete sweethearts, my brother-in-law is... odd, but nice (aeronautical engineer) and I wanted to form some family bonds with them. So, after living with and around them for five or so years and really putting down some happy roots, I invented Family Board Game Night. We get together once a month, pull out some of my games and we play. I scheduled them at three in the afternoon so no one would have to worry about food. Lunch would be over, and dinner could be afterwards depending on how late we played.

&#x200B;

Then the food started showing up. It started small with chips and cheetos, then moved into chocolate and popcorns, then quickly went into cheese-with-chicken dip, salsa, and other sticky, goopy foods. Things that make me sweat when I see them within inches of my $100 board games, sticking to people's hands and getting on game pieces or boards. It drives me insane.

&#x200B;

I've talked to my brother-in-law about it and while he agreed at first we shouldn't be eating if we schedule it specifically to NOT have food at the table, he certainly doesn't abstain when there's food around. My wife just sort of shrugs and says ""if we get together, my father is going to feed us, no matter what."" 

&#x200B;

There is very, very little in my life that I would DARE to look into my wonderful wife's eyes and say ""that's not ours, it's mine"", but my board game collection is one of them. Would I be the asshole if I threw up my hands and locked them all away, since they are ignoring my wishes? I mean, we're getting together at my house, I put forth the effort to get everyone together on all their busy schedules and I can't say something simple like ""no food please around my expensive games?"" I feel like the sanctity of my house's rules are being ignored. My wife has a few games that are hers, since she's unwrapped them for Christmas and birthdays and such, so it's not like Family Game Night would just END-- the options would just be way fewer while they were eating their dusty cheetos, sticky chip dips, giant plates of cheesy popcorn and all that other crap that, ugh, I just don't want all over my stuff!

&#x200B;

I'm ready to lock them all away and say ""mess up your OWN stuff!""

934,Not the A-hole,"So to give some background me and my gf are both in university. In the past year or so, she has started getting the habit of cheating on almost every exam, usually by getting a sick note to get more time and then sending me pictures of the exam and asking me to search up answers. I can't pretend to be a saint because I've cheated before in the past as well, but nowhere near the extent as she does. See, if it was once or twice that she asked me to cheat I wouldn't really mind because there occasionally there might be something that you're dealing with in your life that makes it hard for you to study. But this has now became a habit for her, and I'm sick of it. I keep telling her to get her shit together and to stop relying on me to bail her out on exams, especially since she has already gotten caught before. I thought that being caught would've have taught her a lesson, but boy was I wrong. Just two days ago she asked me to help her cheat (on an exam she sicknoted), and I tried to say no but after a lot of pleading and begging I reluctantly helped her. Now she asked me again to help, but that was the last straw and I firmly said ""no I won't help her"" without budging. She told me that this is the last exam she has, and so she won't ever ask me again after this, but I'm really annoyed by the fact that she relies on cheating so much that she can't even try to study hard for an exam. She's telling me that she can't do it, that she'll fail if I don't help and that this could ruin her entire future.

935,Not the A-hole,"We have two children (2 and newborn). My husband goes out by himself once/ week. All of his friends are single and have no kids. Whenever he goes out, it's late and he stays out until before bars close (2am here). Last night he came home at 3:30am.    
    
He didn't respond to anything I texted him post 11pm (nothing naggy until 130am). I called at 2am to make sure he was alive, since playing pool for ""a couple hours"" apparently takes 5hrs. He said he was leaving the bar, taking a friend home 15 mins from our house, and would be home soon. We had a jovial chat. An hour later, still not home.     
    
I called at 3am and had a decidedly not jovial chat. I think it's ridiculous for someone like him to be galavanting around hours after bar close getting hammered with single people. It's disrespectful to tell me one thing and do another when he knows I'm up waiting.     
    
He did this throughout my 2nd pregnancy, rather difficult since I was in pain, bummed about not being able to stay up or go out, and all my friends are married with children so it's not like anyone would go with me anyway. In my 37th week, he and his friend were piss drunk and kept me up til 2am, parading around the house when I had to be at work that morning at 5:30am. That was the hardest day of my pregnancy. No apologies or anything, just picking away at me ever since for being a stick in the mud.   
    
We all worked in the restaurant industry at one time so I'm sure he's just tagging along and not up to any debauchery being out until 4am, BUT we're not 25 anymore. We have kids that depend on us.      
    
In his defense, he got up and made breakfast for the kids no fuss despite having gotten home 4 hours earlier. He almost never gets upset about anything I do, probably because I don't do dickish things, and encourages me to go out. He also says he wasn't drunk last night despite slurring on the phone at 3am and now he's mad at me for being mad. AITA?

I also completely rearranged my life, work, etc, to have the 2nd child that he was dying for, including quitting my job as a manager to work at a low level office job, but anytime I ask him to make any change I'm met with months of resistance ending in a half assed attempt to fix whatever is bothering me, lasting about a week.",163,277,0.89

The date is going ok. He’s a sweet guy, but I don’t really get the feeling we’re ‘clicking’ with one another romantically. However, I think B thinks so

We watch some movies and things get a little heated. I don’t see a romantic pull to him, but I wonder if there could be a sexual pull between us

We start kissing and then we go to the bedroom

I’m gonna spare you most of the details, but after some forplay and some kissing, we get to the sex part

He struggles a little and I get the impression he’s pretty nervous. After slipping out a few times he gives me some oral instead before he tries again

But then he’s not hard anymore

He assures me it isn’t me but because he’s nervous and I while I 100% understand that, it did make everything a little awkward

We try a lot of things to get him hard again, but nothing is working and eventually I straight out tell him:

“B lets just stop”

He is reluctant in stopping and I think it has more to do with his dignity than sex so we try a little longer

We stop and I can visibly see on him how embarrassed he is about it. I tell him it’s okay, that it happens but it doesn’t seem to help

And everything just turns really awkward from there

That’s when I make the decision to leave (and where I’m probably the a-hole) 

While the ‘not getting it up again’ wasn’t the only reason I had for leaving, it probably pushed me over the edge

I dress myself and make my way towards the hallway and by then he has obviously caught on to where this is going

I put on my shoes while he stood there looking incredibly embarrassed and me leaving right after probably doesn’t help at all

I knew it was a selfish, but I just didn’t want to stay

We didn’t click and I was completely sure I wasn’t interested in seeing him again

I said goodbye to him. Told him he was a great guy and that I had a nice time

Then I left

The next day I got a message, asking if we were ‘over’, and I said yes

He asked if it was because of the sex and I told him that we just didn’t click

I told this to a friend of mine, and she said I was an a-hole. That I should’ve stayed the night to make him feel better
 
That ‘running away’ after he couldn’t get it up, is gonna scar him

I don’t think it would be fair for me to stay when I wasn’t comfortable with it, just to make him feel better. But maybe I’m wrong?

I don’t regret doing it but that doesn’t mean it couldn’t be an a-hole move anyway

937,Not the A-hole,"AITA: I’m currently 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. I am an only child and have a bit of a strained relationship with my mother because four years ago I moved out of the house and in with my then fiance, now husband, six months before our wedding. She has never really forgiven me and things are generally pretty tense yet polite.

&#x200B;

Personally, I don’t enjoy spending time with my parents. They both stress me out. My dad is a bit of a chauvinist and my mom is just so judgmental and emotionally abusive. Every time they come over to our house they start rudely debating my husband on everything - politics, education (he’s a teacher), why we decided to do certain things to our house, etc. They also expect to be hosted the entire time, which is exhausting.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my birthday fell on Mother’s Day this year. I haven’t heard from either of them for over a month despite being pretty late into my pregnancy. Late Friday night, two days before my birthday, my dad texts me to say they want to take me out to brunch the next morning. 1. We already had plans to go to a concert and too many activities wasn't in the cards for me. 2. I know he didn't make reservations, which in our area you need for brunch so we'd been waiting 1-2 hours for a table and he would just be angry the whole time 3. You're going to ask me less than 12 hours before?? I responded saying I wish I had known they wanted to get together, but we already had plans. I also didn't plan anything for mother's day because well... my mom hasn't been there for me the past year. At all. Also, it's my birthday and I wanted a day to just do whatever I wanted.

&#x200B;

Mom ends up inviting me to meet for dinner later that week but ended up canceling because she had a cold. I get another call on Thursday asking me to host them at our house on Sunday for a belated birthday celebration. This is officially the last weekend before we have our baby and I have a long list of things I want to get done - cleaning, shopping for guests that will be coming into town to meet the baby, making returns, decluttering, and just spending time alone with my husband before our lives change. 

&#x200B;

I told my mom that and you would've thought I spat in her face. She basically hung up on me. I called my dad yesterday and he was also baffled about our weekend plans saying we could still clean when the baby is here. So clearly I'm the one in the wrong in their eyes.

&#x200B;

Is it bad that I just don't want to spend time with people that frustrate me on my last weekend before giving birth and having to care for a newborn? Also, if they want to see me so badly all of the sudden, they could offer to come help us complete my checklist. Or am I just being a crazy hormonal pregnant woman?",95,680,0.95

I looked him up on Facebook and I will be damned if I don't look just like him and his other 20 some odd year old daughter. I am also DNA linked to his cousin who has taken the test as well. I ask if I'm the asshole here because my mom has given my dad hell in the past for child support. Like dragged him through the mud. He's lost his license countless times and had his taxes garnished for years. WIBTA if I kept my mouth shut on this one? I have ZERO interest in reaching out to my bio father. Ever. He has a wife and 2 kids, one is like 4 years old. I'm not trying to get into someone's life like that. I am afraid of damaging what I have with my dad, the man who raised me. He dislikes my mother so much that a part of me feels like he would go distant if I told him but IDK.

Edit: I was 50/50 visitation between the 2 of them but my school records show I lived with her so he wasn't able to prove otherwise in the court system, so she petitioned the courts to go after him for money she was not entitled to. So what she did was in fact disgusting. I did not include that in my post as it didn't seem relevant.

My husband and I are  considering buying a new home so we sat down to talk about money/finances we are comfortable financially and are looking for a house with more. Currently we split the morgage and bills 50/50. If we decide to buy this new house our mortgage/bills will increase by 700 a month- if we split it 50/50. My husband  said that because I make more money than him I should pay more of the mortgage (for reference I make about 30k more a year). I was very surprised by that statement and immediately said no and that his reasoning doesnt make sense. He said that it does make sense because I want to move more than he does (not true). He then went on to say that other people who have salary differences also split their bills unevenly so it's not out of the ordinary. Needless to say we argued and decided we are not ready to move at this time.

My wife and I (22F, 23M) are currently on holiday in Thailand. We took a short detour to Pattaya which has a bit of a reputation for sex tourism. 

Now my wife and I are both very sex positive people. We are both quite hedonistic I guess, so long as you’re safe and enjoying yourself, whatever goes.

Now this is where it gets weird so if you’re not interested in dumb couples drama I’d stop reading here. I have always wanted a threesome and I’ve asked my wife many times. She has always shut me down but left the possibility open. On this trip she said she would provided I agreed to a threesome with one of Thailand’s well known “ladyboys.”

Note: I apologise for using the term, I suspect it might be offensive. But it’s the term everyone uses here so bare with me 

I’m not interested in transwomen personally but if it got my wife to agree to a threesome with a non-trans girl (which is easily achievable while in Bangkok/Pattaya as well) I figured I may as well do it. She insisted we do the ladyboy threesome first since she said  I would just go back on my word otherwise.

I guess you can see where this is going. We went and got a bar girl from one of the ladyboy bars and had a threesome. The next morning she said she was joking and was just fucking with me. She said she wouldn’t do a threesome as she agreed.

Now I like a good prank as much as anyone but I thought this was fucked up. I lost my temper, yelled at her, called her names, and packed my things to go to another hotel, where I am now.

I imagine no one disputes my wife is an asshole. But do you think my reaction was too much? To be fair to my wife we are extremely sex positive so it wasn’t traumatic or anything. It just felt like she betrayed my trust.",354,426,0.9

950,No A-holes here,"This has been an ongoing argument between my wife and I, but it resulted in a huge argument today and I’m starting to wonder if I’m in the wrong. I think it’s impossible for someone in my position to see my wife’s point of view fairly so tell me who’s the asshole here. I’m also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it’s solely this topic/argument that I’m interested in hearing your judgement on.

So my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven’t said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.

I still own the same house as then and I’ve pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it’s kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can’t really explain the logic behind it because I don’t think there is any. It just doesn’t feel right to change her room.

This has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there’s my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it’s just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It’s therapeutic in some weird way.

My wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. 

We’re now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn’t an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.

When she said these things I was really hurt. But I’ve had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It’s not fair to make my kids share a room because I won’t let go of the past. It’s not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn’t my first love.

I was 17f at the time 

so i have quite a severe nut allergy and my whole family has to make changes when I'm over so I do not have a allergic reaction. 
It sucks but you honestly just have to deal with it. 

So I got to my cousins gift and I noticed it was in a container and the item looked home made, turns out it was a body scrub. 
(I knew she ran a etsy store but had no clue on what she sold) 
a few minutes later I decided to read the ingredients on the back and it said peanuts. (i think she used peanut butter) I took my mum to the side and explained that I cant use it as I could get a rash and she understood and told me we could throw it out when we get home. 

that was a great plan untill my cousin comes up and starts to rave about how good it is and how she made it, and that she would love to use some on me, I tried to say no as nicely as I could but she refused to listen. and then started to open the container. 
so I kinda told her off, I told her that she was kinda stupid for making a nut scrub for someone who is so allergic to nuts that eating one can land them in hospital. 
and that I would rather not have a rash. 
I then said I'm  also annoyed that you made this even when you know how allergic I am.

954,Not the A-hole,"I was sitting in my college class when my friend texted me asking if I'd go to her because she needed a friend and that she wanted me to go to the store. I told her I was in class and we were going over everything for the final, I said I could meet up with her in about an hour and a half. She asked me to leave class to go to her and said she was having a breakdown. Then immediately texted and said she was sorry and shouldn't have asked. I asked her if I needed to leave, she told me she needed me and she was stressed. I asked if she could hold out until just an hour and a half, she told me the store closed by the time I left from class. I told her we'd probably finish early, and she told me she could call to ""make it an emergency"". I asked ""an emergency to go to the store?"" she said yes. I told her I could pick up w/e she needed from the store in the morning or that evening, and that I could see her in an hour or so. She told me never mind, and then she told me she'd go alone. When I left class, I asked if she wanted to meet up and she said no, and she hasn't texted me back since, although she's been online here and there.

&#x200B;

To be clear, I prepared to leave until it was mainly needed that I go to the store w/ her. If she wanted me to come over for an emergency, I would, but not to go to the store. But maybe going to the store is an emergency for her, so maybe I'm in the wrong there?

I feel bad, but I do believe in general that I'm there for her. I've canceled plans on several occasions, or done random chores for her(cleaning, yard work, babysitting), helped out in more ways than one and I never ask for anything in return more or less(I think she picked me up from the airport once? But i'm not sure). Not that friendships should be built on a weird debt system, but my husband has sometimes wondered if she's using me. I don't usually think so. When she gets a new friend I kinda get dropped out of plans quite often, and then when they move or they get in a fight then I'm back in the line up of chores and randomly going to the store or w/e with her.

On one hand, I feel like she makes a lot of demands of me and if she labels them as a need I drop things to go to her. But it happens a lot, and this one time I refuse I can tell she's upset w/ me. Not to say I'd stop being friends with her if she were using me cause idk, I do love her- and I knew who she was when I got into our ""best friendship""/""sisterhood"" I guess you could say. But I am confused at where I stand in this situation, if I should go to her apologetically or more stand my ground.

Me and my husbands oldest son is 21 years old. He doesn’t go to college. He hasn’t had any “real life” friends since highschool. He spends all his time in his room being a recluse.

Over the last couple of years he has developed very toxic opinions. I can only describe them as an Asian-male version of what “incels” are generally thought of. He goes on sexist rants about how no girls want to date him because he’s Asian... which is ridiculous since his dad is obviously Asian, and also because he never leaves his room to meet any girls.

Anyway the argument at hand is about what my husband thinks we should do. He suggested - and obviously this disgusted me - that he take our son to a brothel so he can just lose his virginity and get a confidence boost. I should specify now brothels are not illegal in our country and our son is obviously of age.

This sparked a big argument between us that ended with me screaming at him and calling him a “disgusting pig” at which point he left the house to take a walk.

My (now ex-) girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. Over this time I've gotten her jewelry for her birthday/christmas/basically any present. I actually dislike giving jewelry as a gift as it's kind of cliche, but it's what she always wanted, so whatever I did it to keep her happy.

Fast-forward to last month I catch my girlfriend having an emotional ""affair"". I put that in quotes as I have no evidence she physically cheated on me so I guess affair isn't the right word, but she's been talking to some guy for at least 3 months flirting and they even exchanged ""love yous"" and ""miss yous"" etc. She denies cheating on me, but idk what the fuck she's doing texting a guy like that behind my back if cheating isn't her intention.

Anyway, I'm not trying to make this into a relationship post, I just think the context is important. So I give her a month to move out of my house. Eventually all her stuff is packed up in boxes (she's now at her parents house) and I'm waiting for her dad/brother to come pick it all up. At this point I decide to take back all the jewelry I got her since:

1. Try to claw back some of my losses

2. I got her it in the context of a monogamous relationship. She violated that and hence I think it's fair game to take it backk

3. If I'm being honest I'm also doing it to be petty

So I go through the boxes until I find her jewelry boxes. **Important: I only take back jewelry I got her. I didn't take back anything I didn't buy her.** I then return the jewelry boxes like nothing happened.

Eventually she realises and starts asking questions. I  deny everything since there's no way she can prove I took anything. It's all currently sitting in a box in my attic.

My brother in laws partner rang the social on myself and my partner and tried to have my child taken away, she told the social services that we dont feed her, clothe her, wash her, doesnt go to school. The social services came around the house and checked all our cupboards and fridges for food, checked my daughters wardrobe for clothes and were asking her questions about us. My brother in laws partner did all this because i told her off about the way she was living because she had a newborn living in a pig sty, ants crawling all over the counters and her baby bottles, ripped carpets and broken doors, she even left her two week old child unsupervised in a room with what i thought was a dangerous dog so i had to tell her and my brother in law that it was wrong and they need to sort themselves out. Having the social services come round my house and investigate me is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to me, i think about it all the time, that im a bad parent and i dont look after my child properley. My point is everyone i have spoken to such as close friends and family about this wouldn't have anything more to do with them after what they did and that's my mentality, family should never do something like that to one another. My partner refuses to say anything to her or her brother about it and we constantly row and argue because i don't want to be around them and dont want them involved in my life. I've missed out on holidays, theme parks and much more because my partner always wants to go with her and just refuses to see how much it bothers me and thats why i can't go with them because i just hate her so much. But after another argument tonight because i didn't go to thier engagement party I've been told i don't love my daughter, i don't love my partner or care about them and once again ive been told ive gotta move out and that im just a selfish bar steward who only cares about himself. Another thing is my brother in law and his partner have never acknowledged what they did and just act like nothing happened and my partner won't say anything to them because she doesn't want to upset them because she wouldn't be allowed to see her nephew then, even though it tears me apart every time their around.

My boyfriend and I were going to get a 2 bedroom to share with his mother. Turns out his mother wanted the bedroom for his sisters family and basically lied to us the whole time. We said nevermind, we’re getting a one bedroom. His mom gave $1000 to his sister and her family. The $1000 was supposed to be for the 2 bedroom apartment, plus our $1500 savings. 

Fast forward to today, his sister now wants us to give them our $1500 in savings and she’ll apparently pay us back in 5-6 weeks when her taxes come. Btw is she lying? Isn’t it way past tax time? 

Anyways, my boyfriend told her he has to get back to her. Her and her husband tried to guilt trip him by saying that family helps family etc. She kept bringing up the times of when she took my boyfriend in when he was in 6th grade... She feels super entitled. Also, NEITHER of them have tried to get a job in the 6 months they’ve been househopping. They’re at the point where the income is leeching off of other people. 

My boyfriend talked to me and he’s conflicted. He wants to help her because he doesn’t want his sister and three kids out on the street. He doesn’t give a fuck about her deadbeat husband. But he also doesn’t want to give away our savings or open our home to them. I told him my answer is absolutely not and that he can call me heartless if he wants (which he did). I told him that we can give her $600 and she can figure out the other $900. He says it won’t help because they only have 4 days before they’re kicked out. 

So basically he’s feeling super stuck and I’m clear on my answer. I love him and his family but I draw the line at their irresponsible asses trying to move in or take our savings. He really believes we’ll get that money back and if I’ve learned anything from reddit, it’s not to loan money you won’t miss. This is our rent and deposit money! If we don’t get this back we’ll be in the same fucking place again. 

He’s mad at me right now because he thinks I’m selfish for not considering this or trying to help him think of something to help them. His brother (who housed them for 3 months and blew his $6000 savings) AND mother (who has literally been working her old ass off to give the money) both said that she put herself in this situation and it’s not her responsibility. My boyfriend has a good heart and doesn’t know what to do, but he’s mad at me because I’m supposedly being selfish and heartless. 

So AITA for having my clear and stubborn answer of ABSOLUTELY NOT?

965,Not the A-hole,"I’m the manager of a retail establishment. The company I work for sells some high end products and the employees are supposed to look the part, we have a fairly formal dress code. 

Men and women have to wear all black, women must wear a blouse and professional pants with nice shoes (heels, flats etc but no sneakers or flip flops and shoes have to be clean and not worn out), or a black dress, blazers are allowed but not required. Men have to wear a suit and tie with professional shoes. 

We tell everyone this during the interview process and the company does also allow people a grace period of one month to gather the clothes they need. You can also submit tailoring and dry-cleaning bills for reimbursement. This is pretty generous in my opinion. 

One employee was hired over 3 months ago so her ‘grace period’ is up. She still comes to work out of dress code; for example today she wore black jeans (not allowed), a gray blouse (not allowed but would have been if it were black) flats (allowed), and a cardigan (not allowed, blazers only, plus it was covered in dog fur). 

Today I took her into the office and told her she needed to follow the dress code. I had even printed out some photos as examples of what is acceptable, and made a list of places to get inexpensive dress clothes (Ross, thredUP, different thrift stores). I also told her that since she’s outside of dress code so often outside of her grace period, she can be let go because it’s insubordination. 

She responded by crying and calling me classist and saying she can’t afford nice clothes and that it feels like discrimination because she wasn’t born into money. I honestly do feel bad for her but I also know exactly how much she makes and that she frequently makes large purchases in our store (everything we sell is a non-essential item). She later called me a bitch to another employee, in front of a customer.

After they moved in they threw away the lid for some reason and stopped using the bin bags we had in place. They have a bowl full of tampons on the shelf which I have no problem with.

968,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a year ago, I (White M 23) was out for a walk with my dog (America Blue Heeler mix, on a lead) around my apartment complex.  A rottweiler got loose from a family's apartment on the complex, attacked my dog, and wouldn't let go. I kicked the rottweiler multiple times to get it to let go of my dog, eventually it let go and it started coming at me. I kicked it again and by this time the owner of the dog (black M 25-30) came out, got a hold of the dog and started yelling at me. His son them came out, and took the dog back inside. I saw my dog was bleeding rather heavily from where the rottweiler had bit him, ended the conversation with ""I need to take my dog to the vet"" and left.

Turns out, my dog needed sutures to close the wound, it came out to being around $364.29 (I have pet insurance (accident and surgery) and got reimbursed $314.29 about 3 months later). About 2 weeks later, the guy showed up at my apartment demanding I reimburse him for his $800+ vet visit, I refused, stating that it was his fault his dog got injured. There was some shouting happening, eventually he left (no racial slurs were used). I then received a letter in the mail stating that I was being sued for hate crimes and animal cruelty / neglect. 

Long story short, it got taken to civil court, he lost. He claimed that my dog had gotten off his lead and attacked his dog that was tethered in his yard and his dog just defended himself. However, there was video evidence of his dog running across the lawn to the left of the security gate, that exonerated me. Since then, the family has been evicted from the complex as rottweilers are not allowed in the apartment complex along with a slew of other dog breeds for insurance purposes. There is a rumor that his dog was put down, however, I cannot confirm that. 

My lawyer has, since then, given me the option to sue them for harassment and false claims, stating that we have a very good chance of winning and getting some form of settlement out of it. The family has already had to pay my court costs, as well as reimburse me for the lawyer. The hate crimes charged was dropped as there was no proof to his claim that I threw racial slurs at him, and it was a trumped up charge to begin with. 

So reddit, WIBTA if I couter-sued the family?
Note; some of it was paraphrased as I don't remember the entire conversation that happened after the attack.

Edit: I should also add that the vet visit alone cost me $35, on top of the $364.29, I got reimbursed $314.29 putting my total loss at $85.

Edit: despite the overwhelming support, I have decided against suing. It's not worth the time and effort, the family, I think, has suffered enough. Thanks for the help tho! I appreciate it!",59,77,0.93
969,Not the A-hole,"I need to give a little context before I go into the story. At the time I was living with two of my roommates. They had both been friends since high school, whenever we were all hanging out, I was always the third wheel because their interest and friendship aligned more than mine did with them. They always had anywhere between 4-10 people over at the house on a regular basis, mostly their high school friends. Week night, weekend, their friends were always at the house. Their friends are people I wouldn't choose to hangout with if I had the choice. They were the type of people that preferred to go out to clubs every night and get wasted until they pass out. The loud rowdy type. Not my cup of tea. 

Anyways, on to my birthday. I thought it would be fun to go out to eat with my roommates and then go see a movie I had been wanting to see. Well I ask them if they wanted to go and they said that they had plans that night and couldn't go. Honestly, I was a little hurt. A few days go by and I guess my roommates could tell that I was upset, so one of them spilled the beans. ""I feel like I should let you know, we said we couldn't go because we are throwing you a surprise birthday party"" I was kind of shocked, no one had ever done something like this for me. I'm not going to lie I was pretty excited. 

So my birthday rolls around and now I have to act surprised for the big moment. Everyone yells ""surprise!"" and it feels pretty good. I start to look around the room and I notice that all the people here are my roommates high school friends. Thought it was a bit strange that none of my friends were to be seen, but whatever, I'm grateful that people are here to celebrate my birthday. But a little time passes and I notice that everyone is zoned into something else. An NBA game on TV. Everyone's crowded around the tv watching the game. It became painfully obvious to me. They didn't want to go out for my birthday because they wanted to watch this basketball game. At one point in the night my roommate came up to me and told me that he tried to invite some of my friends, but they couldn't make it (Later I find out this is untrue).

The game finishes, and people leave, most of them heading out to a club. My roommate ask me if I had fun, and I was honest with him, I told him I felt like the party was kind of an excuse to stay in and watch the game. He gets upset with me. Makes me feel ungrateful and reassures me that everyone came out to see me. I felt like an asshole, and I still think about it all the time. Am I the asshole for being ungrateful for this surprise party?

EDIT: I know my friends were not actually invited, because I told them about the event and they didn't even know that it took place.

TL;DR: Instead of doing what I wanted for my birthday, my roommates threw me a surprise party with their friends so that they could stay in and watch a basketball game. I confronted my roommate about this, but they made me feel ungrateful. AITA?

970,,"Ok bear with me here. My amazing wife (29F) and I (28M) are expecting our first child, and her pregnancy has gone very smoothly thus far. We're about 6 months along, and she's been extra touchy-feely of late, if you catch my drift. 

We had sex about a month ago and I'm going to be honest, it was awful. My wife wasn't doing anything wrong, but the idea of having sex with her while my child is inside of her just disturbs me. I don't know why, but that thought just set up camp in the middle of my head, and i could not possibly cum with that on my mind, which made the sex last even longer.

973,Everyone Sucks,"So about 3 weeks ago, I woke up in the morning to the sound of my GFs phone vibrating against my bedside table and I see that it’s K (we’ll call him) calling. K and my GF have an on-and-off romantic history and, while she’s never blatantly stated that she wants to go back to him, she reminisces about the “good times” they had together more than I’d like to remember. Needless to say, I’d always suspected something happening on the side between them and I finally decided then that I needed some answers. I quickly picked the phone up off the table and went in the other room while my GF was still asleep and answered it. Sure enough, it was K and all I asked him was if he wanted my GF back. He admitted he did and that they had indeed been seeing each other on the side for a long time but said that nothing of a sexual nature had taken place (BS). Fed up, I told him it was cool and to go ahead and continue seeing my GF but not to relay this call to her as I would deal with our problems myself and didn’t need more trust issues. He agreed. So I continue my relationship with my GF cuz she’s pretty hot and good in bed and open some things on the side as well. But just a couple days ago, I decided to get into something serious with one of my side things and obviously needed to call it quits with the current GF. So I just told her the truth: that she didn’t make me happy anymore and that I found someone else. My GF got mad that I was “cheating” but then I brought up that I know and have evidence of her infidelity too. Then she started sobbing claiming that “her and K are just friends bla blah.” And after she said that, I was just done so I left her apartment and am currently ghosting her to the best of my ability. But when I confided in my philosophical friend about this incident, he said that “two wrongs don’t make a right” and that my evidence was shoddy.

974,Asshole,"Throwaway account, mobile user alert. 

My husband and I have been married for 3 years, together for 8, having lived together for over 5 now, and I believe our marriage is a very healthy and happy one. Almost 3 years ago we bought our first house together. It is smaller than our shared condo that we were living in before, and during the moving process we were actively getting rid of many things to help downsize for our house. During some of this sorting, I found an old shoebox among his things. I opened it to see what was inside to determine if it would go in a “keep” box or a “donate” or “trash” box, and discovered it full of photos, memorabilia, etc. from an old high-school ex-girlfriend of his. I wasn’t immediately angry or upset, I’d been known to keep an ex-bf memory box or two, especially at that age, and asked him if he would be okay to discard of it.

He became defensive and initially refused to my surprise. He had no other reason for keeping it other than “I guess I forgot about it,” and he promised to get rid of it later, but not without first bringing up a box of mine as well. 

I have a shoebox full of things from an old boyfriend from college. This boyfriend and I dated for 3ish years, and it ended tragically when he passed away from injuries sustained in a car accident. His mother discarded most of his belongings very abruptly after his passing, and the few things I had I quickly locked away. His mother/family and I are no longer in contact for a few reasons. This shoebox is all I have remaining of him. I do not revisit the items in this box. I haven’t opened it in almost a decade now as its taped shut. I should also note that I have exactly zero other memory boxes from any other ex-relationships I’ve had.

Today while searching for something unrelated, I stumbled upon my husband’s ex-gf box again. Last I recall, my husband had promised to discard of it. But here it is, 2 years later still in our house. I don’t want to bring it up again because we’ve already argued about it but I feel very hurt that it’s still here. I do see his side of it, that he wants me to also get rid of my shoebox before he’ll get rid of his ex-girlfriend box. However to me, it’s not a comparable situation because he and his high school ex-gf broke up. She’s still out in the world, living her life and making new memories which they both chose to do over 15 years ago, whereas my college boyfriend is obviously not.

It’s difficult getting perspective on this issue because most people who know us have a connection to one or the other and our pasts, and so I would like an unbiased, objective opinion on this. Am I being the asshole for wanting my husband to get rid of his shoebox of ex-gf memories while wanting to keep my own?",161,480,0.89

Alright so some backstory before we get into it. I’ve been friends with this guy (We’ll call him “G”) for over a year. We used to work the same shift, have mutual friends/coworkers. I am now on an opposing shift so time to hang out is difficult. My off days are his on days and we have one shared day of work. There’s this girl, we’ll call her “B.” I never had good vibes from her, my ex broke up with me for her and someone in my personal life was fired from our job because of her. I’ve been amicable with B when i encounter her because that’s what adults do despite my distaste for her. 

G invited me to go on a hike which I had been looking forward to attending for a while. The details were being worked out and him and we have had some flirty chemistry so I thought maybe this would be the chance to make a move. He then informed me last minute that B would be there. I then declined politely because I do not want to be around said person. She’s toxic and even if they may be friends, which is fine, I’d rather not spend my free time around that person. G thought I was being petty which may be true but I opted to avoid a potentially awkward situation because of our history and because I have to work anyway. 

G then texted me today that B bailed on this hike and I was free to go. I got upset and I was blunt on my opinion of the situation. I felt I was a backup option for this because B couldn’t go so now I was wanted in attendance. I am honestly insulted. I told G to lose my number. Our text exchange can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/mJxp63J). 

I feel that I may have been bitchy going about this, but G knows the history between B and I. For the better of myself I decided to cut G out of my life because I feel our friendship was just an attempt to get in my pants. He previously told me he thought i’d be “over” this although the occurrences between B and I were a year ago and also a few months ago. While we never contacted directly, I was effected by both situations and lead me to have a negative image of B. 

G is clearly upset about my response but I don’t care at this point because looking forward, it’s in the best interest of my development and mental health to steer clear from this type of situation. So Reddit, I ask, AITA here?

tl;dr: told guy to lose my number after he invited me to go on a hike because someone we know mutually and i have bad history with decided not to go

EDIT: Some more info, I was informed of there being a hike with no details on when and who was going. It was just a vague plan. Was told last night hike is this Sunday and that B was going so I declined although I was initially going to go. B Bailed and then I was informed but I kept on my decline because 1 i have to work and 2 his wording made it seem I was a backup because B wasn’t gonna be there.

EDIT 2: I want to genuinely say thank you to everyone who called me an asshole. I am, I needed to see that I was in the wrong. I wasn’t a backup option but saw myself as one because I was being petty and immature. I probably ruined this friendship and will be apologizing in person when I get the chance but do realize the consequences of my actions. This was the tough love that I needed.

980,Asshole,"I have tried to type this up 3 times and keep going over the limit so I am going to try to hit the high points and make this sense. 

Two years ago my husband was killed pretty suddenly in a car accident. It was very tragic but it was not a happy marriage and I felt like for over 30 years I put my interests to the side. We had a very successful business and I got a large life insurance policy so I have plenty of money. I very quickly fell in love with a new man who treats me like a queen. I readily admit that he doesn't come from much and one of my sons and quite a few of my friends were worried about him taking advantage of me. However we have been together almost 2 years and he has changed his life for me. He has dropped his toxic family and kids (who really did see $ signs when they met me) which to me is the sign that he is committed to me. 

His dream has been to travel the country in a motorhome. So right after we got together, I bought him a nice used one. We took it on one trip and realized pretty quickly we wanted more. So last week I went and bought US the absolute top of line RV money can buy. It is loaded with features, two bathrooms and it even has a fold out patio. My boyfriend is so excited and I enjoy seeing him excited. 

My non-supportive son is furious with me. He thinks if it wasn't obvious I was being taken advantage of before, then Roger asking me to buy this ""ridiculous"" (his words) RV should be the smoking gun. I want to be clear here, this is MY money. My son's reasoning is that he worked at the business and we sacrificed a lot to build the business and that its insulting to buy Roger a motorhome for all they sacrificed, this in addition to the ridiculous argument that I'm being taken advantage of. 

Things have not been good with my son for a very long time and Roger thinks I should threaten to write him out of my estate unless he comes around and then make good on the threat if he doesn't. I am actually at that point. But before I do anything, I can't take back I would like some neutral judgment.

981,Asshole,"I live in a newly built neighborhood. Our house was built about 7 years ago, and our neighbor's house was built about 6 years ago. All of us started with dirt lots, and part of our homeowner's association agreement was the requirement to either seed or sod within 12 months of moving in. The HOA was dissipated shortly after he moved in, so nobody ever enforced that requirement.

Six years later, he still hasn't done anything about his yard. It's uneven and is basically just dirt with some weeds growing in spots (see imgur link at the end of this post). It's the only one in the cul-de-sac that looks like this.

We are sick of looking at this, so we wrote a letter to him, as politely as possible, asking him to do something about it. We also included contact info for two landscaping companies. We signed it with our own names, so it was not anonymous.

The next day we found out that he wrote an aggressive Facebook post about his asshole neighbors that were criticizing his yard and how we should mind our own business unless we're going to help him pay his bills.

He is a single guy, but he does work a lot (he owns a trucking company and drives a semi). That is his reasoning for not being able to do anything about it. But it just doesn't add up for me. You should either have enough time to do it yourself, or if you're truly working so much that you can't spare a single summer weekend from the last six years, then you should have enough money to pay someone else to do it for you. I get that there could be other circumstances that I don't know of, but it seems unlikely that he couldn't do it if he tried.

AITA for writing a letter urging him to do something about his lawn? Some pictures of his lawn and a screenshot of his FB post are here: [https://imgur.com/a/ncFKQfd](https://imgur.com/a/ncFKQfd)

Edit: A lot of people are saying we should talk about it in person with him. We have talked about it casually multiple times in the past, and he always says he'll do something about it some day, but he hasn't done anything about it in six years.

Also, a lot of people are suggesting that we should have offered to help, and we did. We've mowed his weeds a couple times in the past. Here is the content of the letter:

>We are writing this letter on behalf of several of our neighbors to ask that you please clean up your yard.  
>  
>This is a nice little neighborhood where residents feel proud to live. You should understand that even a single yard in the neighborhood that is not well maintained ruins the pleasing appearance of the whole neighborhood.  
>  
>It creates many negative impacts on the whole neighborhood - lower property rates as the major one. An overgrown lawn is the perfect place for large weeds, wild grass, etc. It creates many problems and is an eye sore.  
>  
>We really do not want to disturb your privacy, however, it being visible to everyone creates problems for other people here. We are concerned about your house as it’s a part of our neighborhood and we are ready to help you. I can also provide you with the necessary tools to get your yard in shape.

>When we moved into our house, we noted that the soil was not conducive to growing a healthy lawn, so we brought in topsoil.

With respect to current events in the US, and the start of campaign season here, we would like to address the issue of politics within our sub. Simply put, this is an apolitical sub. 

We recognize politics are a source of conflict for many people. We know there will be some conflicts that are exacerbated by politics, but it should never be the primary conflict for a post here. This is for several reasons:

* This is not a sub to discuss or debate broad, intrapersonal opinions.

* This is not a sub that wishes to promote any specific political views.

* Politics are something a great deal of people cannot approach civilly.

* Perhaps most relevantly, you will not get good, unbiased answers – rather people speaking to their own political belief systems. It’s more of a game of “how many subscribers do we have that share my political views?” than a question of “was I wrong in this situation?”

What does that look like in action? No more posts about the abortion ban and ""sex strike."" No posts about supporting a certain candidate. No posts about how you want to disown someone because they support [insert candidate of choice here]. No posts about proposed legislation or policies. No posts about your family, friends, coworkers or anyone else being a big ol’ meanie because of your politics. Whether the post is directly soliciting debates about the merits of your political views or not, we all know it’s going to happen anyway.

This extends to comments too. It is not acceptable to disparage other people’s political slants. No calling people mean names targeted at their political beliefs (e.g. libtard, red hat, feminazi). No using someone’s comment as a jumping off point to debate politics. 

Again, we are an apolitical sub. The good news is Reddit offers you a wealth of subs to explore these conflicts in an environment that is structured for them. /r/FindAReddit is there to help. And, as always, ***read the rules of any sub you participate in.***",230,3456,0.98
984,Asshole,"My brother has been dating this chick for like 5 years. She’s quiet and barely talks to the family except for my mom when she comes over. My mom says she’s just shy but she seems standoffish and uppity. 

I’ll come right out and say I never really liked her. She’s in grad school living off her daddys money while my brother has a high paying finance job. It looks like she was just trying to find a new pay check for when her dad stops covering everything and shes using my brother for that.

My brother arranged a massive proposal where both families and all their friends would come celebrate after he proposed. She really pissed me off at the celebration. If shes really just shy, why is she suddenly all over my brother, kissing him and sitting in his lap and talking to everyone. She was on her phone the whole time taking pictures of her hand and the fucking massive ring he bought her. It’s like her whole personality changed once she got what she wanted. On top of that one of my aunts made a joke about them having kids soon and my brothers girlfriend said nope I’m not having kids get ready for some adopted babies. It rubbed me the wrong way that she couldn’t just roll with the joke and needed to assert herself suddenly when she was never even talking to us before.

I told my brother that I don’t think he should marry her becauSe she has bad intentions and was just chasing the stability and finances he provides. He told me to fuck myself and blocked me on social media. My mom is pissed at me too and told me to get my shit together. I don’t really give a shot about reconciling but I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong. Am I the asshole for pointing out the red flags that I see everywhere?",382,818,0.82

986,Not the A-hole,"Hi,

my gf is pretty jealous. I usually don't mind.
But I really wanted to go watch John Wick 3 tomorrow and I talked about it in class and mentioned I didn't have anyone to go with. A classmate suggested she can go with me, as she loved John Wick and she also had noone else to go with. So I decicded we should go. I agreed because I know my GF hates action movies and never seen a JW movie.

Also, it is worth mentioning that we are both in a very commited ""long term"" relationships (2 years and ~4 years).
Also there is 0 chance of anything happening since there is 0 attraction from both sides. 

Obviously, my GF now acts weirdly (doesn't really talk to me)

989,Not the A-hole,"As the title says, I (Dad) promised my 6 year old while he was in the bathtub that I wouldn’t tell Mom that he stole Pokémon cards from a friend.

It came out of nowhere at 8 o’clock last night, historically speaking, is not my best parenting time.  He was crying in the tub, he looked me in the eyes with tears in his.  He told me that he wasn’t bad and that he didn’t want me to be mad.  I looked at him heartbroken because I don’t see him like this, he’s very much so like me.

He said that he felt bad because he had taken a friends Pokémon cards.  I asked if that is what has been bothering him?  Yes, then he says, “I don’t want to be bad and I want to stop feeling bad”.

As a man that has served in the Armed Forces, the steps are clear.  Don’t worry because we have a plan.  You plan to give the cards back (not possible because he traded them for a GX or something).  Ok, give back something similar.  He says he doesn’t think he had anything similar but he’ll make it work.  

Here’s the AITA part, I knew my wife was at door listening but he asked if this would be our secret.  I promised and the situation was at its resolution for the night.

My wife compounded the problem when she point blank asked him what the problem was and we don’t promise to keep secrets from each other.  I addressed her very sternly and stated that he has it figured out.  She asked him why he would want to keep a secret from her?  Why wouldn’t he tell his Mommy?  At this point, we’re over the edge, she’s pushed him to tears and I feel like the asshole for promising such a things.  BUT, he’s me, not even the better parts.  Pride, Manipulation, Ego, everything.  To see him at that point in the tub peaked my empathy but made me question if he’s going to trust me.  

I got angry at my wife for pushing the trust thing, she’s insecure because he came to me, she’s angry because I promised to keep a secret.

I made my wife cry so my 6 year old will trust me in the future, AITA?",27,27,0.84

991,Not the A-hole,"Everything is in the title, really. My family lived in central Africa for decades before moving to Europe. My siblings (2 older brothers, 1 older sister) all have fond memories of Africa because they spent their childhood and teens there, but I was 3yo when we left. For me, Europe is home; for them, Africa is. My relatives never acclimated to Europe and they all live on welfare, I’m the only one with a job. I make about 1,600€/month, but I can save a bit.

In Africa, we had a live-in maid/nanny, Judith, who worked with us essentially the entire time we lived there. She was there when all my siblings and I were born, and she raised us. I know about her because she is in every family photo and all my siblings talk about her as if she were our second mom (my older sister even went back to Africa to see her about 15 years ago), but I honestly have no memory of her.

Judith contacted my sister recently. She apparently has AIDS and needs to come to Europe for treatment. She needs to do the Africa-Europe trip often, and each time she needs to stay here for long periods of time. She is broke and is hoping we can help her out, which is fair enough as my siblings immediately accepted. But even if they all pool their savings together, they don’t even have 1,000€ total.

That’s where things go to shit. For the past few days, they’ve been harassing me and asking me to put all my savings towards helping Judith. I don’t have much more than 10 grands saved up and I’m not even sure that would even be enough to cover all her expenses. AND I DON’T KNOW THIS WOMAN. I have no memories of her, she didn’t raise me beyond the age of 3 and IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 30 YEARS SINCE WE LEFT AFRICA. I don’t want to jeopardize my entire life (I’m hoping to marry my fiancé soon and buy an apartment, possibly get kids in the near future) for a person I consider a stranger.

My siblings tell me I’m cold-hearted and that I’m letting our second mom die if I don’t send her the money. I don’t think I’m an asshole for putting my needs first, but I’m literally the only one who thinks so. AITA? I could use third party perspectives right about now.",27,40,0.93
992,Asshole,"I have a friend, let's call him Joseph, who is an aspiring filmmaker. He hasn't made anything but student films yet, but he's had a script for a short he's been working on for a while and he was trying to film it. He wanted me to do sound on it (basically hold a microphone) - he never really asked, he just assumed I'd help him, but whatever, I'm down to help out a friend.

Well, last Christmas I flew back home to visit my parents and some friends I don't get to see very much anymore. I talked to those friends about visiting me, and suggested they do it for Memorial Day since it's hard for me to take off work. They liked the idea and decided to plan a trip.

A few months pass, it starts to seem like their visit won't happen since Memorial Day plane tickets are expensive. Joseph starts asking me when I'd be available to help him shoot his movie. I tell him any time really, but don't schedule it on Memorial Day weekend because I want to keep that open. He talks to everyone else on the shoot, and he's having difficulty finding a weekend when everyone is available. He starts begging me to shoot on Memorial Day weekend, I tell him I don't really want to. He keeps pushing, and I figure that it seems like my other friends aren't coming, so I say I can do it.

Fastforward to yesterday. I get a message from my friends back home that they booked their plane tickets and are coming to visit me on Memorial Day weekend. I tell Joseph and he is understandably upset, but he gets really mad and starts saying he has to cancel the whole shoot now.

I'm sympathetic, since I've made shorts like this and I know how tough it can be to wrangle everybody together. But I also know that you are asking a big favor of people to help you, and sometimes real life happens and you have to make do without them. I know he has other options - attach the mic to the camera, ask someone else to hold it, etc.

More info: this is unpaid. These kinds of shoots are 12 hour, exhausting affairs, and it would definitely take up all of Saturday and Sunday, and possibly Monday. If I did it, I would not have any time to spend with my friends from home at all.

994,Not the A-hole,"Background: Over that last few years, my brother and I (both 20M) have gotten gift cards from family for Birthdays, Holidays, etc. He is an avid player of video games while I am not. We have both gotten a few gift cards for Game Stop, a video game store.

My brother asked me if he could have the gift cards that I have been given over the last few years so he could use them to buy a game. Since I know that I’m never going to use them, I was originally going to give them to him. The two cards are worth $50 together. However, when I went to give them to him, I asked if I could have $25 in cash for the $50 in gift cards. My reasoning for this was that even though I was never going to use the cards, I still wanted to get something out of it since they were gifts to me and I felt like I would be getting nothing in return. Also, I reasoned that he would still save $25 on his next purchase. He called me an ass for this (and doesn’t want to go through with it), so I don’t know how to fell about it.

So, AITA for wanting to give my brother $50 in gift cards that I’m never going to use in exchange for $25 in cash?",240,1502,0.96

996,Everyone Sucks,"My friend and I decided to go away for a few days because our destination would allow us to combine our hobbies (trains for him, walking for me). We'd set out an itinerary which was full of compromise, so that each of us got to do what we came to do. 

First day is a walking day. My friend is not used to walking and within a few km he complains that his shoes are rubbing. We are in the middle of nowhere so have no choice but to continue to our destination. I have to go out and buy every plaster in a mile radius but it was a good day.

Next day is a train day. We get a number of them and I show as much interest in them as possible, which is difficult, because they're fun to ride but boring as hell to learn about. 

On our final train journey, my friend, checking various train timetables, announces he's getting off the train at the next stop, riding back to our start point and then repeating the journey on a rare train. This is fine, because it was important to him. I was a bit miffed that he didn't ask if I wanted to join, but whatever. He promptly ran off and I was left to travel on alone. 

Now, as I had a number of hours to kill before he arrived, I planned a walking route which was longer than it was originally going to be, because my friend would not have been able to walk far at all. 

When he finally arrived in the evening, he didn't ask me a single question and talked about how amazing his experience was- I was kinda hoping he would empathise with the fact he'd left me. I was kinda pissed at this point, so announced I'd be leaving super early the next morning to do my longer route, and he could do what he pleased. 

My thinking was, he didn't care much about leaving me, so why should I? It meant we both got to do the things we wanted, but he was left alone for the day today.

999,Everyone Sucks,"My ex husband goes to school and as such has decided he can not keep our two kids (2 and 4) overnight ever. We have a custody order that he fought me tooth and nail for 50/50 but he realistically sees them about 6 hours a week during the day because he “has class” and never at night because he “has to study”.

We have this unofficial arrangement where I won’t take him back to court to adjust the custody to a more reasonable schedule for his actual schedule as long he promises to be done in the next two years and finally get that job he has been claiming the university degree will help him get if I just give him time. He swears this area of study is the right one this time. 

This is his fourth tray at college. He has two bachelor degrees and an associates. He has no job. He has been a full time student for most of our relationship apart from the 6 months he worked at my workplace (a job I stuck my neck out to get him) but got fired. 

Anyway, I’ve been pulling long hours at work and working from home long into the night for the last 6 weeks. I am tired. I had been asking him to take more time so I could catch up on some sleep. He said his class load was too much and that he could maybe do an extra hour or two during the day. “How long of a nap do you need?” But when the kids are gone I do more than just nap. I work, I clean, I run errands I can’t take them to. I go to the gym. I pee in peace. I shower without having to ask repeatedly if they are okay from the bathroom. 

I got tired of it and last weekend told him that I had schedule a medical procedure for Monday and Tuesday. He was hesitant to because he said he had some studying. He eventually agreed after some nagging from me. 

I took the time off work. I told the kids mommy is fine and she will see them Wednesday. I packed them snacks and spending money. I made sure they had all they needed and then I checked myself into a hotel downtown and slept. I checked on them occasionally via text with my ex. They were having a tough time of it. I felt bad. But also I needed this. I was going to crack. I didn’t pick up any work phone or mess with any work. I drank. I had a drink in an actual bar for the first time in 3 years. I mostly slept and ate food that was awful for me. Tuesday I felt guilty and almost caved and went to sweep up the kids. They called at bedtime wanting me to come get them. 

Wednesday morning I left feeling refreshed but guilty. What if I had died? What if I really have to have a medical procedure in the near future? 

I could have told the truth and just asked for a vacation. But then my ex would have not taken the kids. And my workplace might have tried to guilt me into working while I was away. A vacation with the kids wouldn’t have even the same.

1001,Not the A-hole," I DID NOT BRING THIS UP but when “what makes someone good in bed” came up in conversation, my boyfriend asked me point-blank if I think he’s good in bed, and I said no. He’s angry because it’s not his fault I don’t get off, which is true. I can’t get off just from PIV sex, and he doesn’t like the things that do get me off (oral, kissing, foreplay). 

I’ve told him twice now, politely, that I’m unsatisfied and I’d like him to do x, y, and z to fix that (initiate, show some passion/lust, occasionally offer to do the things that might help me get off, like play with me with a toy). He agrees he knows how to please me, he just doesn’t make the effort because he doesn’t get anything out of it. So I said “well yeah that’s literally the definition of ‘bad in bed’”. He got angry and said it’s my job to “make” him do those things. I said “well I can’t enjoy it if I have to force you, that’s not sexy at all” and he got huffy and left. 

Obviously I’m very grateful that he’s wants to sleep with me at all (I dated my last boyfriend for five years and he really only wanted it once every month or two), but I don’t think that that alone makes someone “good in bed”. I put a ton of effort into my appearance/fitness, I show initiative and enjoyment in our sex life, I compliment him and make him feel sexy…he does none of those things.

1003,Asshole,"OK, so that sounds bad, but hear me out. I have 4 step kids (and 2 of my own), the oldest of which is 18 (step son). My 2 kids live with me full time, and my wife's kids split the week between her and their father. 

He turned 18 at the beginning of the school year, and made the choice to live with his father full time, and come visit us on weekends. He uses the excuse that his school is closer to his dad's, but his sisters school is also close to his dad's, and whenever she is with us we drop her off at school, and have told him we would be responsible for getting him to school as well, but he has declined. I'm pretty sure it's because we set limits in video game time, and his dad doesn't, but he denies it. He doesn't have a driver's license, and has shown little interest in getting one.

When he is with us he chooses not to participate in family activities unless it's loaded with fun(escape rooms, amusement park, and such). We often do family board games and he excludes himself, and when we ask him to stay he makes it glaringly clear he's miserable. He spends most of his time on video games.  We've asked him time and time again to try to be more involved in the family. It has gotten to the point where my wife told him he can only come on weekends when he wants to, and we only see him once a month or so now. She texts him pretty often, and most of the time he leaves her on read, or gives ""OK"" as a response. 

I've tried to talk to him about how he treats his mom. He makes up excuses, and blames it on her, saying she's the problem, and argues until he realizes that his arguments hold no merit, and then just shuts down. 

I should also add that he has a mild form of aspergers. If you weren't told he was diagnosed, you would just think he's inconciterate. 

Now the trip. We've been planning a family trip to Europe this summer, and my wife brought up the idea of not bringing him. I told her it would probably destroy the rest of the small relationship she has with him. On a personal level, I have no interest in bringing him, he often complains when we're doing things that he doesn't want to do. My wife asked him what he expected of the trip and his response was ""you guys acting obnoxious, and making me do things I don't want to do.""  After he said that, she asked him why she should take him, and cited his abandonment of his family and negative attitude, and he said he doesn't have an answer, but that he does want to go. She told him if he wants to go he needs to make an effort to be a part of the family, and nothing has changed. 

So I ask, should he be allowed to come?

Edit:  so it seems like it's just about split down the middle. For all those that vote YTA, I appreciate your candor. The only thing I don't agree with in many of the responses is the ""typical teenager"" comment. He is one of four teenagers in the house. I view the teen years as a sin wave of emotional rebellion and lashing out. 14, 15 and 16 are usually the worst years. I have 2 other kids in this house that are either in there or past there, and neither acted the way he does. Yes, they had times they didn't want to be a part of family gatherings or events, but they respected other people's feelings when they had to be. They didn't make other people feel shitty for wanting them to be involved in the family. 18 is technically an adult. It's the year we as a culture have decided that it's time for them to branch out on their own, and start growing up. If he was 15 or 16 and acting this way it wouldn't even be a discussion, but if he doesn't learn now that you can't just think about yourself all the time with no consequences, when will he? That's our dilemma.",115,46,0.75

When I come back downstairs, stood in my hallway is a very tall black man. I am visibly surprised, but only because this is not the man that I let into my house. In particular, the other man was very short, whereas this man was very tall, and I think that is actually what surprised me the most. Anyway, so I say “oh..” and he says “what? You scared? You ain’t never seen a black man before?” (verbatim) and I tried to explain that that wasn’t the case at all, but I also know that trying desperately to explain that you’re not racist can sometimes prove the opposite, so I just said “no, I was expecting the other man” or something to that effect. Anyway, he starts installing the washing machine and continues muttering about racist white girls. I was really quite upset about this whole thing and was considering reporting it, but then I don’t know if that would be a step too far.

**EDIT** I won’t report him, because I think that the appropriate reaction here would be a conversation from his manager to him/the whole team to say that every person installing an item should introduce themselves at the door before walking in, but I can not know for certain that the company won’t overreact and fire him. I do not want to be responsible for anyone losing their job and I certainly don’t want to be responsible for a POC to lose their job in a location that is predominately white and they may struggle to find employment elsewhere because even though society fights against it, POC are still oppressed and that’s shitty.",252,834,0.92

I don't have an apple, but I have a PC and have offered to Skype.  Skype works on both platforms.

Visiting her currently isn't possible due to work schedule restrictions and visiting hours (effectively by the time I get into her city, the hospital is closed and we have to leave the next day in the morning before the hospital opens to get home in time.  Two work schedules + a toddler = no flexibility on this)

I've told her she can use a tripod if her arm gets tired or if we need a ""private"" conversation.

This started out as a simple ""oh, I don't have an apple, let's use Skype this weekend"" sort of conversation, and has gradually turned into a heated argument about how I'm being inflexible and making things unnecessarily complicated.

She accepted and picked a place.

I wasn’t particularly hungry either, I was just offering her food since I knew she would be on a plane for a few hours. So I just ate an appetizer and we left. 




My mother says I have no reason to be upset- I offered her a meal and she accepted, end of story. 

But to me, when you offer to buy a person a meal it isn’t just free food you are offering, you are offering the treat of a communal meal at your expense. It’s like if I tell my buddy I’d like to buy him a drink later he doesn’t just say “Just give me the $4 and I’ll just buy one myself.” 

And in my view, if someone offers you a meal and you *aren’t* hungry you just order something small or refuse- you don’t just use it as an opportunity to stock up on food for later.

For reasons I don't understand, she didn't have the box ready in time, even though she had five months.

&#x200B;

A few more months went by, and I grew tired of the delay, and gave her two weekends to get the items to me. She did, but she didn't pack the box carefully, and a couple of things got ruined: a $1000 leather coat, and my dad's overcoat (dad is deceased, so it's a cool coat because it's vintage and well made, but also has sentimental value). A bunch of paperwork she included got trashed, but it was all garbage anyway, so I don't care.

&#x200B;

Now I have this big box of degrees, certificates, and work-related awards that I need to mail back. I'm not sure how much it will cost, but it's a big heavy box (almost the size of a bankers box). I had planned to carefully wrap everything to make sure it arrived safely, but now I feel like just taping up the box as is, sending it on the cheapest way possible, and being done with it.

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I didn't take more care in mailing the items? She's dragged this out for 10 months, didn't protect my things, and I'm angry about it (not surprised though, as these were issues when we dated). However, I'm not really an eye-for-an-eye type person, and I don't want to lash out in anger in a way I'll regret later. And most of all, I'm looking forward to closing this chapter.",22,31,0.85

1018,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I were together for three years, and we've known each other most of our lives. They were my best friend by far, very supportive and loving. We got along well, but we moved on when we realized we had very different ideas on having children.

They met someone not too long after moving out, and went 100% no contact. It's been almost six months, and I can't describe how hurt I feel.

We bumped into each other by chance a few months ago. I just shook their hand, the hand of their SO, said ""Nice to meet you,"" and got out of there. They texted me later to say they hoped it wasn't weird or anything, and I flat out said that it wasn't weird to see them, but going no contact has been hard to deal with.

Anyway, WIBTA if they reach out in the future and I just ignore them on the grounds that they completely forgot about a lifelong friend and long term partner?

Edit: Sorry to most of you, your responses seem pretty spot on from what I posted, thank you. I didn't include the fact that after we broke up, we lived together in a very open, functional way for a few months until they met someone else. We were solid on the fact that we were happy we continued to feel comfortable with each other, and agreed to keep our lifelong friendship going. Then... nothing.",28,133,0.93

1020,Asshole,"I grew up from 10-21 years old with my mum's ex husband. He's always been a great guy to me, we were like really close friends since I became a teenager - he took me on holidays with him, taught me how to scuba dive, landed me my first job, taught me some valuable life lessons and was just all-round a fantastic figure to have close to me while growing up, we had so much fun together.

Unfortunately he and my mother fell out pretty bad about 3 years ago due to their marriage just not functioning properly anymore. In all fairness he didn't behave that well to my mother towards the end of their marriage - he'd go out with his friends more than being with her, drank a lot (possibly doing coke too but that's a theory of mine), barely showed up at home for dinner and other stuff which I'm not 100% aware of since I was in another country at the time (university, was back home maybe once every three or four months).

The biggest thing I guess that makes my mother not want to have him around is that during the divorce case , the judge decided my mum should pay him 1,500€ a month for two years to him due to a loan he gave her when they were married. My mum's problem with that is that while they were married she was paying for large part of everything, bills, the house was hers, a lot of the holidays, etc. That really pissed her off.

Now it's my birthday in a week and I really wanna invite him over but my mum said that's out of the discussion, she doesn't want him at the party and has forbidden me to invite him, but I'm thinking of doing it regardless because I think once he shows up she'll be fine with it. WIBTA for doing that?

EDIT 1: Important point I missed: I live in another country, I'm going back home and since I don't have my personal house there, the party will be at my mother's house which is basically my house too, but I don't technically live there full time.",27,44,0.9

1027,No A-holes here,"Hooter’s is a chicken wing restaurant. The waitresses wear booty shorts and tank tops. 

My boyfriend, me, his brother, and his sister in law went to Olive Garden. We’re in town visiting them and we wanted to go out. It sucked. SIL didn’t like the food and his brother regretted getting appetizers for his meal since they weren’t good. Our waitress was an asshole. My pasta was disgusting and my boyfriend surprisingly liked his. Overall it was just bad. 

But SIL and his brother were disappointed. They were going to go out to eat alone at hooters but wanted to include my boyfriend and I. My bf and I don’t eat meat so we had to pick a place that would work for everyone. We felt bad that they wasted almost $40 on food they didn’t eat. My boyfriend and I offered to pay for their Hooter’s since we basically prevented them from going. So it all worked 

My bf and I went inside to pick it up. We walked to the pick up counter and I look at my boyfriend and see him staring at a waitress’s ass. He nervously laughs and says “what do you expect it’s all out” so I get even more upset. Like because an ass is sticking out you have to look? I understand being attracted to other people is apart of life but idk I was just hurt that I caught him staring. 

I’m insecure because we both gained a lot of weight. Maybe like 75 pounds each smhhh. We’re just now starting to get it off but until then, I’m envious of girls who have a better body. Especially because I know that’s what he likes and he only is attracted to me still because he loves me. 

But yea I didn’t really say anything else and I was just standing there waiting for the food. I guess he could tell I was upset because he started sloppily explaining himself. He said “I wasn’t looking at her I heard a loud noise and you saw me looking at the same time”. And then he said my insecurity is becoming a problem. He said he likes girls with confidence, not girls who compare themselves. So I understand that because I have been very insecure lately. 

But I feel like he shouldn’t have made lazy excuses.

That was two nights ago and I’m still feeling insecure. I haven’t been in the mood for sex. Honestly I’m not even mad at him. I’m just upset that my body isn’t how I want it to be rn. He’s been irritated because he thinks I’m mad when I’m really just not in the mood for talking or sex or any of that. 

I’ve also caught him looking at girls butts on Instagram, Facebook, etc. So I feel like I’m reasonably upset but he’s irritated because I haven’t been talking to him. Btw despite me gaining weight, he’s still shown interest in my new shape and has loved me regardless. My insecurity stems out of my previous shape and the shape that he obviously likes (which isn’t mine, not even close. Haven’t seen him starting or watching porn with any girls that look like me).

1030,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get the answer as to whether or not I’m an asshole in this situation, obviously. 

To keep it short and sweet, my fiancée and I have been engaged for a few short months now and she has not so subtly hinted at the exact wedding ring she wants, even before we got engaged. She is currently just wearing a cheap Walmart ring because I have promised her she will receive the one she wants in the near future. This was after she broke down crying from not getting the ring she wanted initially. I thought the Walmart ring was nice and pretty, but I guess not. Sigh. 

Her parents are extremely wealthy people and she grew up being well taken care of and getting pretty much anything and everything she wanted. “No” is not a word in her vocabulary.

I grew up very modest and middle class and began working when I was 16 to help provide for my family after my father passed away from esophageal cancer when I was 15. I’ve worked ever since and she has only had one job in her entire life. Rings are not a huge deal to me and I feel like she shouldn’t be throwing a fit over it but oh well.

The ring she wants is to the tune of $4k (it’s from a popular jewelry brand) and because I love her dearly, I am determined to make it work even though my bank account is hemorrhaging after making several purchases for our home we bought last year.

I began looking up ways to make money, and sperm donation was one of the options I looked into. I keep myself fit and healthy and have no family history of common diseases. I looked into the requirements to donate sperm and figured I’d be a great candidate. 

I called the clinic yesterday to set up a consultation but the line was busy at the time. I left my cell phone inside with my fiancée while I went outside to take the dog to use the bathroom and get the paint from my truck. I come back in and she’s in tears and looking extremely angry. She begins shouting at me and tells me that she can’t believe I’d betray her and now she wants to call the wedding off because I “want to give other women children” and I “secretly don’t have faith she can get pregnant due to her PCOS.” Sigh again. I don’t know what to do about all this. Maybe it’s best we call the wedding off, I don’t know. I didn’t realize she’d react this way otherwise I’d have never inquired about donating my sperm.

I’m embarrassed that I can’t afford the expensive ring she wants outright, but I thought donating sperm would be beneficial for everyone and I could get the ring faster so my fiancée would just shut up about the stupid ring. If it makes it any better, I fully intended to make myself anonymous.",99,87,0.85
1031,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 11 and my stepdaughter is 12. We’ve been a blended family for 4 years now. My stepdaughter has amazing genetics and she can usually eat all manner of cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc without gaining weight. My daughter is not that lucky and if she eats the same amount sadly she will gain weight. She’s definitely a lil chunkier than her sister, and recently her paediatrician highly encouraged me and her to lose weight and he suggested cucumber dipped in hummus for snacks, sugar free soda, etc. 

We have been doing really well at that and my daughter has been losing weight but... sadly... so has my stepdaughter!! In 3 weeks both have lost weight and her dad and I have shed a couple lbs too, 

I have started to encourage my stepdaughter to eat more, stuff like greens, more fish, to hopefully gain a little weight as she is starting to worry me, and her dad is also on board with me. We recently saw my stepdaughters mom at a birthday party and she made a snide remark to us that just because my kid is fat, doesn’t mean I need to deprive her daughter. I told her that both my kids will eat what I give them and they were both able to eat whatever snacks they wanted at the birthday party as it was obviously a big day so it wasn’t like I was ‘depriving’ anybody. They live with me and dad full time and I love both those kids. 

When we came home that night I felt really bad and told both girls I know it’s probably difficult at the moment but we will still have treat days like our froyo dates with just me and the girls that we love.

She says she hasn’t seen my wife cheating but that she came home a couple of weeks ago and found my wife having a glass of wine and lying on the couch with a guy she’s never seen before. From her description I’ve never heard of him either. She kept it to herself as she assumed it was just a close friend of my wife. 

I guess this thread serves no purpose and will get locked now. So before that happens just want to thank those of you that brought this possibility to my attention. Honestly thought my marriage was perfect I never in a million years suspected my wife would be unfaithful.

--- 

My wife and I have 5 kids together, ranging from 2 - 15. My wife is a stay at home mom while I work a full time (8am to 7pm, 5 days a week) job. 

We live in Hong Kong where it's the norm to have a maid (or ""domestic helper"" as they're called here) rather than being limited to rich. Our maid is a 34 year old Filipino woman that has been working for us since she was 19 years old. She lives with us in her own room and gets weekends off. 

The problem is that my wife wants us to fire our maid. She hasn't given any specific reason other than ""I don't want a maid anymore."" I honestly have no idea where this change in attitude is coming from, but I don't want to fire her because:

- She has helped raise my kids for 15 years and is almost part of the family at this point

- She relies on this job to send money back home and it would seriously affect her and her family to lose it

- We still have an infant/young children that require constant attention

- I work extremely long hours and don't want to have to do cooking/chores on top of that. My wife doesn't cook nor clean so I am extremely skeptical that she will take up all the chores once our maid is gone

The woman in question is nothing but kind/polite and I don't understand where my wife is getting all of this resentment towards her.

I'll mention this now in case people think she's jealous: my wife is significantly more attractive and we spend all our spare time together. Jealousy does not seem to be the case here.

1036,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 years and living together for 2. We've been over to this friends house and hung out with both my friend and his future wife plenty of times together. He asked me to be a groomsman in his wedding and I of course said yes, but he didn't mention anything about my girlfriend not being invited before hand. Then today nearly 3 months later I got an invitation without a plus one. When I asked he said the only plus ones were for the Best man the maid of honor and any of the guests that have children. Of the wedding party I am the only groomsman with a girlfriend other than the best man. Am I asshole for wanting to step out of the wedding party? I feel like my relationship is not being respected because we don't have a kid, and feel like I got hoodwinked by not being told earlier. I am expected to buy a suit, drive 2 hours and rent a hotel room on top of everything. I feel very frustrated, I know this is their day, but I feel like if my girlfriend isn't respected enough to be there, there's probably no reason I should be in the wedding party. Had I known when he first asked, I would have immediately said no.




Edit: I talked to the friend. I voiced why this bothered me and he said he understood. I'm now also frustrated with how he seemed to ignore me for quite a while (Not as long as it took me to get to writing this, I had to work so the update got delayed). I do not think he was intentionally singling out my relationship. However it is also clear he gave literally zero thought to anyones situaution. 

I also think he is not the one who set the criteria, but rather his Future wife is. Which I hope is true and he didnt just lie to me to appease by throwing his FW under the bus. Him saying this and not owning it as a group decision between the two of them is a bit concerning to me.. May be a red flag?

Anyways, my SO absolutely does not want to go now, but thinks I should go. If she didn't think I should I would drop out. As good as your comments have been, her opinion is the only one I genuinely care about. I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford a few hundred dollars to be a groomsman without it affecting  me, so I'll still attend. I'd be a liar though if I said I didnt think this would affect the friendship between the groom and myself. Our conversation felt off and dodgy at best. It may be he just doesnt handle having his actions questioned. It feels pretty clear that they think of my gf as someone I bring around and not as the most important person in my life. Which I do not appreciate and put a pretty sour taste in my mouth.

But I'll be amicable and go through the motions for an old friend. Then I'll worry about our friendship moving forward. This could very well be a period to a friendship arc in my life. I'm sad, but at least I know to make sure my SO is invited if I'm asked to be a groomsman for someone else.

I'll update if anything interesting happens. This wedding may be primed for drama. Im going to stay out of the rest of it now that I've said my peace. 

TL;DR My relationship was not intentionally slighted, but also more broadly its clear my relationship isn't respected how it should be by the groom. Going to the wedding, will look at the friendship as what it used to be theough the wedding and reevaluate moving forward.

We both proceed to lose a few hundred messing around for a few days. He decided not to gamble anymore and do other things like swimming. He was trying to save money and was on a budget and wanted me to restrain him when he couldn't think straight. He told me that he's weak when it comes to gambling and suffers from gambling addiction. I literally pushed him out of the casino while he had a $20 in his hand that he wanted to use on the slots earlier that day.

I proceed to beat him for an hour, taking ~$100 from him. He talks to me later and is upset I didn't keep him from gambling like we decided.

I’ve been with my bf for almost 10 years and I’ve never heard of Anne.

As part of this she’s been airing out various grievances she’s been holding against me all these years as she doesn’t think holding onto them is “conducive to a healthy relationship”. A lot of these things are petty teenage grievances I can’t believe she hasn’t let go of yet, but one of them stuck out to me. I mentioned it to my husband and he expressed disbelief and disappointment in me for my actions at the time. I maintain that I didn’t do anything wrong but his reaction has me curious.

Her email to me about the situation:

My graduation was another thing. I don’t know if you remember but you refused to let Gran come even though I told you how much I wanted to her there because of how she’d supported me throughout uni. When I told you I invited her you said you wouldn’t come if she was there so I had to disinvite her by lying about their being a limit on tickets per person. As if that wasn’t bad enough, you and Daddy refused to sit with each other, take pictures with me or even go out for a celebratory meal afterwards. I have ONE picture from my graduation...one...and it wasn’t even the professional one, it was just one my friend took on her phone of me. I don’t think you and Dad dealt with your split very well AT ALL in regards to your children but it really hurt me that you (the both of you) would be so selfish about that. I just wanted one afternoon.

For background, I am estranged from my own mother and have split up with her father. She says it was selfish of me not to allow my mother to attend her graduation or to spend extra time with her father, but I think it was selfish of her to ask that of me. It’s bad enough that she continues to keep in contact with her grandmother when I asked her not to. Anyway, I want to know if I really was the asshole here.

ETA: Though I disagree that my feelings weren't even worthy of consideration in this situation. Would it not have been best if asked me for compromise? For example, I would attend the graduation and she could have a celebratory meal with her father and grandmother separately afterwards?

Update: First of all, I truly appreciate everyone’s opinion regardless of what it was and after a doctors appointment and some reading up, i’ve decided I’m just gonna have this kid sliced out of me and the hospital has a policy on not allowing people in, so I’m sorry I wasted your time. Peace out.


I’d like to preface this by saying that I (27F) am madly in love with my husband. (27M) he is my soulmate.

So, I’m 7.5 months pregnant with a little boy at the moment and we’re at the stage where we’re talking about how things are going to go down when I give birth. He’s been talking about how excited he is to be a father and he is just so proud of it (it’s adorable, really) and expects to be in the delivery room with me. 

I am not to comfortable with this. I know he’s my partner and we should be there for each other ect. And we are, but I just don’t want him there. I love him so much and I don’t want him to see me in any pain and he has a really weak stomach for anything like that sort of thing and I don’t want to have that going on with everything else. 

Don’t get the wrong idea, we very much are a team but I’m also a slightly cold person. He isn’t. We balance each other out. I want to do this by myself and please don’t give me the “you’ll need the support.” I’m sure about that.

So WIBTA if I told him I didn’t want him there? I don’t want to deprive him of that experience, but I need that space too.


Edit: Being pregnant hasn’t gone super well for me. I’ve had 2 miscarriages (fairly early) and throughout this pregnancy, I’ve been sick all the time, having cramps, and a couple good ole complications. I’ve actually lost weight. Throughout all of this, my husband gets so clingy and (I know it’s horrible to say because he’s supporting me and whatnot) irritating. He just can’t let me puke in peace or whatever. It becomes me consoling him instead of the other way around. “Are you sure you’re ok?” “Yes I’m ok don’t worry.” “I think we should go to the hospital” “No, this has been happening for the last month, I’m fine.” “Are you sure?

Having to clarify that made me uncomfortable, so I simply skipped that part and remained awkwardly silent and after stating my neighborhood. I was not the only one who did so. But later my friend who went with me asked me why, and I replied ""I'm just not comfortable and it didn't strike me as necessary"" she made a bit of a fuss about how it's ""no big deal"" and how saying ""she/her"" takes about a second. I didn't attend again, partially because this left a bad taste in my mouth?

1048,Asshole,"My wife and I have been married for over 10 years, together close to 15. We have several children.

Ever since we moved in together I have made her (and eventually our kids when we were blessed with them) pancakes every Saturday morning. The only time I’ve not done so is when I’ve been seriously sick or away on business. I’ll wake up at 7 and make a big pancake breakfast, honey roasted nuts, bacon etc. My father did the same thing and so it’s kind of a family tradition in some sense (not really though as my siblings have not carried it on).

About 1-2 weeks ago my wife told me that she would be going on a “sex strike” that her feminist-mom group was organising (a Facebook group where moms get together to promote feminism/organise protests).

Now I’ve never been a political person. I just want to live a happy life with my family and nothing more, but I try to be supportive of my wife since this stuff is important to her, and I’m not informed on any of this political stuff.

But this just seemed wrong to me. Ofcourse she’s not obligated to have sex with me, but it seemed like she is trying to punish me for something I haven’t done. It really sat wrong with me. After a few days I asked if the sex strike was still something she wanted to do, and she reaffirmed so. 

My response was to go on pancake strike. For the first time in our entire marriage (absent sickness or being away) my family did not awake to pancakes. They were very upset.

On the surface I think I haven’t done anything wrong. But on further reflection I think I might be the asshole because:

- Not supporting something that’s important to my wife 

- Ruining a pseudo family tradition 

- Punishing my kids to get back at my wife 

The judgement given here will determine whether my family wakes up to pancakes tomorrow. I will not contest or argue with anyone’s points.

Thank you

Edit: based on current feedback I will make pancakes for my kids. But I’m still on the fence about my wife. So keep that in mind when posting/upvoting judgements.",1116,2741,0.92
1049,Not the A-hole,"I just want to start by saying my sister and I do not get along at all. She has been abusive towards me and really only interacts with me when she wants something from me. I do not like her as a person and do my best to avoid contact with her. 

She texted me out of the blue and asked if my husband and I are attenting a big board gaming convention next month. When I told her yes, she started going on about how she, her husband and her children were going to come too and that we should make plans. I did not mind that since the convention is very big and I could easily find something else to do if I wasn't having fun with her. 

My sister then asked if she could stay with us since we just got our guest room set up with our old bed. I told her no, especially since my house is not child proofed. She then asked if just her and her husband could stay for a few days while our parents watched the kids. Again, I told her no. She got really pissed off and started to complain that I was being a bitch for not letting her stay with me. My family now sees me as the bad guy because I hurt her feelings for not offering my house for her to stay at for a while.

1051,Not the A-hole,"Background: My husband and I are both agnostic. Our child is 2 years old. We've agreed to introduce to her the cultural and historical aspects of major religions when fit (e.g. when we walk past a mosque and she gets curious. Not telling her anything complicated as of now because, you know, she's 2) and save the doctrines for when she's older. Our babysitter, I'll call her ""Emily"" here, has the patience of a saint, is very helpful and... religious. 

When Emily mentioned her religion during our interview, I made it crystal clear that we will respect that, but I also expect her to respect our wishes regarding religions. I gave her some guidelines like no doctrine-embedded stories (e.g. we're all damned because our ancestors decided to eat an apple), no teaching of doctrines etc. Emily understandingly obliged, or so we thought.

One day I came home early and caught her telling my child the story of creation of the world. I explained to Emily in private that it contradicts what we've been telling her, you know, dinosaurs and such, and reminded her of our agreement. She apologized. I dropped it at that. Yesterday I found out she's been reading to my child religious books for kids that basically tell their readers  to pray to and obey some deity. Not cool. 

Now I want to fire Emily because of the religious teaching behind my back, but my husband disagrees. He thinks what's important here is that Emily takes good care of our child, and considering that she spends at most 20 hours a week with her, it shouldn't be too hard for us to ""undo"" the religion part. I told him that a friend's child came home calling their parents sinners after two Sunday school classes so 20 hours a week isn't as trivial as he thinks. He says I'm overreacting and would look really bad if I fire Emily over this issue. Plus, our child has bonded with her already, so replacing her would do our child a disservice.

I am a mechanic at an automotive performance shop. Im going to keep this as short and simple as possible: in our shop we have a machine called a dynamometer (or dyno) which measures the horsepower a car makes by driving over it. It’s like a treadmill for cars. The car on the dyno has to be strapped down to the ground front and rear to keep it in place. 

I’ve only been working here for about 3 months, and I’ve noticed that when we happen to work late, we don’t get paid for any of the extra time we work. I am hourly (as are all the other mechanics), if I was salaried that would be a different story. 

Today we had a customer come in around 3:30 to have his car tuned on the dyno. 5 o’clock rolls around and we mechanics start getting ready to leave. Our boss is staying late to work on the car on the dyno. Before we head out, all of us (4) are in the office BS-ing when the service manager tells us that someone has to stay late to unstrap the car whenever they’re done. Everyone looks at me, because apparently it is “my turn” to stay late. I simply say “preferably someone who doesn’t have an hour long commute”. The senior tech argues back “you don’t get a pass every time just because you have an hour commute”. Everyone goes “oh I got stuff to do - I gotta go to a thing - etc”. So the service manager just looks at me and says “well I guess it’s settled then!”. Once everyone started talking again, I just quietly got up and left. 

If I was *getting paid* then sure I would stay as long as needed, I have no plans tonight. But I’m not working for free for what could be another hour or two.",117,1004,0.98

1056,No A-holes here,"Today I got a text from my mother, my sister had broken her arm, was in the ER and wanted me to go check on her. She had her toddler daughter with her, husband is gone on a fishing trip. I was 5 minutes from leaving for work... Completely voluntary overtime. I hesitated, but decided to work instead.

So, why? Because my daughter just spent 6 weeks in the hospital and not one person from my side of the family stopped in to visit. The problem is I am the kind of person who always wants to be there for the people I love. This went against everything I stand for, but was so upset with my family I decided to say fuck it. The 6 week stay in the hospital resulted in missed work and more medical bills, which is why I was going in to work overtime.

*Edit for more context*

I posted this originally while at work on my break.. so was a bit rushed.  After reading it again it looks like the main reason was out of spite.  I'd like to clarify it wasn't.  The daughter being in the hospital for 6 weeks put us under a bit of a financial strain, so I've been trying to squeeze in some overtime to get caught back up and pay some of these medical bills.  Today is normally my day off and I would have loved to not go in to work.. but, due to circumstances I decided to go in.  I was dressed for work, lunch packed and was putting on my shoes when I got the text from my mom. At that point I didn't even know my brother in law was away on fishing trip.  I thought to myself ""that seems like something ""Tim"" should take care of"". And the thought ""well, why make the effort if nobody else is?"" crossed my mind. My decision wasn't made to hurt anyone's feelings, just to do what was best for me and my family.

My daughter's situation in the hospital was pretty serious. She had 2 surgeries during that time. She was in agonizing pain for over a week while the doctors basically did nothing and acted like she was faking it.. she was moaning and crying almost the whole time, she told me she was tired of living and was ready to give up, she wanted to be done. After I demanded they do SOMETHING they did a CT scan and found what they thought was a bowel obstruction (she has Crohn's disease) and agreed she needed surgery.  Once they opened her up they discovered she actually had a hole in her intestine, and had leaked waste, puss, and basically goo into her abdomen.  She nearly died and would have had they let it go another day.  2 weeks later they found an abscess and had to drain fluid in her abdomen so had a 2nd surgery. Over the last 4 years we've struggled with this damn disease and my extended family's absence is not new. In 2017 she spent half the year in a hospital, in 2016 it was 77 days. I could count on one hand the number of times ANY of them have visited. 

I actually felt pretty terrible about not going to the hospital for my sister, which is why I posted this.. but after considering the situation I think my choice was the correct one. I'm still an asshole, but for other reasons.",18,64,0.9

1058,Not the A-hole,"ETA: My parents are married but live in different countries but visit me. My dad handled the finances until he sold his business and the house and moved out of the country.  He gave my mom about 500k of the proceeds from both sales.  Then he started giving my mom about 100k a year from her demands.  His only assets left are a house and the equivalent of 10k USD.  He lives off of social security now. My mom has only started working this past year, but she is flaky  and will just not show up to work to go on some vacation that suits her whims. My brother just graduated but has yet to hold a job past 2 months. 



I'm feeling shocked. 

Just found out that my mom is over 150k in debt, and most of it is ""personal loans"". 

She won't elaborate much, but I was aware that my dad was giving her money at about 100k at a time up until a few years ago. 

Apparently, most of that money went into get rich quick schemes that failed instead of paying bills. She was secretive about it and I still don't believe she's shared the whole amount. 

I'm ticked. 

My dad is retired and doesn't have much left. He lives on the bare minimum with no luxuries while my mom is buying luxury handbags, clothing, and shoes -- and supplying my younger brother with the same. 

My brother spent 10 years in college and the last five years unemployed while living in a city with one of the highest cost of living indexes in the world. 

You guessed it. She's been paying for his organic food diet, his name brand clothing, his partying and vacationing, his tuition, and his large apartment. 

I told my mom that I felt upset about what she did, and she yelled at me that they spent money supporting me for the first 15 years of my life, too. 

I may have said some things I regret. Such as 15 years does not equal almost 30 years That I didn't ever ask for luxury goods. That I've been working and supporting myself since I was 15. 

Guys, then I found out that my mom took out loans in my dad's name.

1059,Not the A-hole,"I (24F) have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. Basically think fragile skin, dislocating joints and a butt load of pain. 

Most days I walk with a cane because when my hip and knee joints are unstable it really helps. I regularly get the local bus to a small shopping centre to pick up lunch and get myself out the house, I can't drive because of the aforementioned health issues. If the bus pulls off before I sit I can get a really nasty knee dislocation, it happened once a few years ago and it required scans and hospital appointments months later. 

Because of that risk even on days where I'm relatively ""Normal"" and can walk perfectly fine I still keep my fold up cane in my bag. When I go to a bus stop I always get it out, because using it makes the driver wait until I'm seated to pull off.

If I'm honest that's not the main reason though. I tend to sit in the upfront seats, so I do minimal walking. The last few years I've had a few instances with little old ladies and mums with push chairs berating me for taking ""their seats"". My illness is pretty much invisible when I've not got my cane and I get snide comments about how I'm probably taking up a place for a poor old lady ect (don't get me wrong a lot of people are nice and understanding, but 2 or 3 times a month I meet a butt head).  I should also mention I have extreme vertigo and fainting issues and these contribute to me wanting to sit down asap!

So yesterday I was doing really well, no cane and moving around fine. My friend and I went to catch a bus and I gave a brief explanation why when she asked why I was pulling my cane out, she knows about my health issues and was obviously worried I was in pain or my condition bad deteriorated a bit. I admitted that on that day I could probably make it to a normal seat without a cane, and she said in that case I'm being a bit of a knob. 

My worry is that my small village has one bus every hour and it's always the same people on it. I worry about someone seeing me as ""healthy"" then judging me for it. 

I will also not there is usually one or two seats free near the front! If there isn't I will make the effort to go further back on the bus, I've never taken the last seat even on my worst day. Still I get berated for daring to take up one of 6 seats.

Should I just suck it up and try to reach other seats on a better day, even if there's a slight risk increase? If I'm being an asshole here I will try to make the effort to use my cane less on public transport!",26,82,0.89

I have been dating my (M25) GF (F26) for about 5 months now. Things have been getting serious and we have talked about moving in together by the end of the year. We've met each other's parents and friends and all enjoy hanging out together. Her dad and my dad enjoy drinking/partying as much as our friend group so they sometimes come out with us to bars.

Around two or three weeks ago, things started to get weird between my dad (M49) and my GF's best friend (F25). There were obvious signs of flirting. One night, my GF's friend was supposed to stay at my place overnight after drinking (my gf stayed over as well) but ended up leaving and not coming back until the morning. After mentioning to my GF multiple times that things seemed weird, she told me that my dad and her friend had been hooking up and going on dates. She said she knew for about a week but said my dad insisted he be the one to tell me. She felt bad because it should have come from him but felt like they never would have told me.

My GF is as uncomfortable as I am about the situation and I'm debating having a conversation with my dad about how I feel it is inappropriate and weird. I also feel like I shouldn't be the one to get in between people's relationships but their relationship has started to make social situations awkward with our friend groups.

1066,Not the A-hole,"(On mobile) My [F23] bf[M22] has anxiety. We’re in a LDR. He doesn’t like it when I go out with friends since I usually don’t text much since I’m usually doing something with friends. I do try to text him every now and again so he knows I’m not hurt but at the same time I’m terrible about texting when I’m with friends since I’m engaged in the moment and not living on my phone. I’ve stopped drinking liquor and wine when I go out with friends, and just have 3 beers at most since there have been 3 separate occasions over the course of the 2 years we’ve been together that I’ve just crashed when I got home and didn’t text him to let him know I was home which sent him to a panic attack each time. I wish I could still drink with friends but I could have easily texted him so I’ll respect his wishes and not drink with friends.

Last night made me reconsider everything. I got off work around 10:30 after doubling at work then met my brothers for dinner. I got home around midnight and called him. We were watching Parks and Rec and I laid down on my bed and apparently passed out. He apparently spend like an hour yelling into his headset to try to wake me up, I didn’t hear any of it. He called my phone, messaged me on everything saying things like “guess you can’t look at fb, discord, Snapchat, your phone” “call me on your phone now” “you’re about to ruin my fucking night, are you serious?” “If you don’t call right the fuck now him going to have a panic attack”.

It was about 2am when I passed out. When I woke up at like 5:47am I was confused about all the missed calls, texts and messages on everything. I called him and first thing out of his mouth was “WTF? REALLY?” before I could say anything. I told him I’m sorry but I just passed out. Told him I should’ve said I was laying down on my bed and that I might fall asleep but that I was also annoyed he freaked out that much because obviously I passed out on my bed at home. He made a comment about me drinking vodka with my brothers but then seemingly calmed down even saying he was sorry for panicking like that since it was obvious what happened. I fell asleep again after telling him I was tired and wanted to go to bed.

WIBTA if I broke up with him because of his anxiety? I feel like I can’t do anything without him since he’ll have a panic attack.

He won’t take medicine, won’t do therapy and I’m just at my wits end. He’s come far since we first started dating but I’m his gf, not his anxiety treatment. I’ve talked to him about it before but I always get the same answers. “I don’t want to be someone who has to take a pill to function” or “I can’t just talk about my problems to just anyone.” I love him but I can’t do this anymore.",51,31,0.85
1067,Not the A-hole,"So my wife and I bought a house last year. Half of the backyard is fenced off from our semi neighbor and the back is fenced off with a wall (main road). The other half is completely wide open and you can see right down into 8 consecutive backyards. My wife's main concern upon buying was the lack of privacy, as we can't enjoy our deck or yard without the peering eyes of numerous random neighbors. I promised her a fence within a year or two.

Well a few months after moving in I was approached by our neighbor, a single slightly older lady who I will call Rita, about having a fence put up between our properties. I said sounds great. However when my wife went over to chat she found out that Rita's plan was to put a decorative fence up that would only go up a couple feet and would still be completely open. My wife explained right away that we bought our house with every intention of putting up a privacy fence with a gate. We hope to have children and need to know our backyard is secure and some privacy in general is needed. Rita says she completely understands and she will try to come up with a plan that will work for both of us. My wife offered to split the cost.

Less than a week later they put up their very nice expensive decorative fence right down our property line with permits they got from the city without saying another word to us. We of course were ticked off and annoyed but didn't bother saying anything to her as she had the permits. She now avoids all eye contact and blatantly ignores us. Now it's May and my wife is pregnant and due in July. She really wants the privacy fence but feels she's going to risk really pissing off Rita and we are both feeling slightly guilty about putting one up right alongside her expensive one. Would it be an a-hole move just to do ahead with it?

She messaged me on Monday to let me know that someone in her workplace was selling an iPad for $100. It wasn't the most recent model but it was still in the box and had only been used a couple of times, so I said I'd take it (the culture in her workplace is pretty tight-knit, so no one would ever sell something defective).

She bought the iPad on my behalf and I said I'd pay back her the next day, when we were due to meet up for a family dinner thing. She messaged me the next morning when she got into work and said that the iPad had been stolen overnight. I asked what she meant and she said that she had left it on her desk before she went home for the evening, and someone must have taken it in the meantime.

She reported it to her boss and there was a short investigation but nothing was found (since it wasn't company property that was stolen, they didn't really give a shit). The building's internal CCTV only covers the corridors, but not the desks, so there was no way of seeing who might have taken it.

Since my sister left it on her desk and didn't think to take it home, I've been reluctant to give her the $100. She's really upset with me about this, as she and her husband have two small kids and a mortgage to pay (they're just about making ends meet, she lent me the $100 because she knew I would pay her back the next day). But my job doesn't pay that great either and I don't want to pay $100 for something that she just left on her desk. She claims that she ""didn't think it was that kind of  workplace"", but I think it was negligence on her part.

She's already gotten our parents involved. Our dad is siding with me and our mom thinks I'm a monster who is trying to steal food directly out of her grandbabies' mouths.

1071,Not the A-hole,"To begin, I don't believe I am an asshole, but I have been told otherwise and figured if I am the asshole then reddit would set me straight. I'll try to explain both sides of the argument I've heard.

Recently I attended a party with a superhero theme, and I decided to wear a Black Panther costume as I think the character is dope. I took a black tank top and using duct tape to create silver details. I also made the necklace out of tinfoil and wore a mask I found at the dollar store. This was met with mixed reactions.

For context, I am a straight white dude who grew up a fairly wealthy neighborhood and haven't had to deal with the issue of discrimination pretty much at all in my life. Some of my friends claim that wearing a black panther was slightly racist (Note: I recognize the serious issue that blackface is. No, I did not do blackface for this costume). 

Personally, I believe that  calling the costume racist reduces the character to just a black superhero, instead of just being a superhero who is super cool and a king and also happens to be black. I also think that if anything, I was celebrating the fact that there are awesome black superheros.

Others have said that, as a straight white guy, I have never had to deal with a lack of representation in the media. Black Panther was the first mainstream black superhero that black people could look up to and that I should respect that. I personally think that you would ever tell a black person they couldn't dress as Thor, so it shouldn't change when you switch the skin color.

 I have had another person tell me that because Black Panther was so culturally significant to the black community, that its kind of like when girls wear traditional native headdresses to music festivals and stuff.  I don't really buy this as this is a movie, not rooted in culture. That being said, I also don't might not understand the significance that Black Panther had to the black community.

So I am really curious to hear what reddit has to say. AITA? Even though I had good intentions, I don't want to be racist at all, even if its accidental.",534,1340,0.94

1079,Asshole,"So I’m 34 and I work in higher education.  I manage a staff of RAs and there are only 3 people total in my position at this university (it’s a small department).  For some reason, one of my coworkers who is in the same role as me has been comparing herself to me in a negative way recently.  A week or two ago she told me she “looked younger than me” apropos of absolutely nothing.  I just let it go, but happened to be at dinner with my staff a few days after she said that and mentioned in conversation how I only came out when I was around 30; some of them looked surprised because they didn’t think I was even 30 years old yet—they guessed I was around 28.

So I asked them, how old do you think [coworker] is?  And one of them said “44?”  Of course, I decided this wasn’t something I should tell her.  Until this morning.  

She comes in and starts talking to me about stuff and I’m cleaning my glasses and complaining about how the lenses always seem dirty no matter how much I clean them.  She says, “Well it’s because they’re too big for your face and you’re always pushing them up.” (I push them up using the bridge or the edges, but okay whatever.)  And then she starts talking about some fugly frames I should get instead that “go out at the edges” and I was like, yeah those just really aren’t my style.  And she said, “well those frames are just too big for your face and they make you look 45.”

I’m sorry, what?  I replied, “I respectfully disagree, as people usually guess my age around 28 or so.”  Eventually she dropped it and went to her office, but it seems like a pattern of her comparing herself to me to cut me down is forming and if she brings up how she “looks younger than me” or how “old I look” again, I’m tempted to tell her that a student guessed her age at 44 to get her to shut up about it.

1081,No A-holes here,"So a few months ago my son (13) Isaiah was diagnosed with a rare form of osteosarcoma. As any person would imagine, especially as a parent, this was beyond devastating news. My wife and I were willing to do anything to take care of our son so we uprooted our family (our daughter is 16, and eldest son, 20, is in college) and moved to Minnesota (were from Nebraska) to go to the Mayo Clinic. Fortunately, our other son and daughter were fully on-board. 

Fast forward to now, our sons condition has deteriorated a bit. He has been in and out the hospital for weeks and now has a surgically implanted port for chemotherapy. While insurance does cover all the medical bills, we still have to spend money on food, hotel (we're about 90 miles from the Mayo Clinic  and it's too exhausting on our son to make that commute daily sometimes), sons college, daughters high school expenses (prom, sleep overs, etc). 

Our soon through this has been rightfully spoiled. We try giving him everything he wants to make him comfortable and feel like he has a 'normal life'. We dont go crazy but he has its play station, nintendo switch, and so on. Recently he has really wanted a new laptop for gaming - but truthfully, we just cannot the dish out the $2500+ for it. Plus whatever expenses come thereafter (headphones, games, a desk/setup if he desires). 

So we explained that were 'tight' on finances and that going to the hospital was also expensive. He got quiet after that and apologized to us about being sick. Now I feel like a MAJOR asshole. Of course Isaiah is in no way in the wrong (my wife and I decided to move our family), but to see his look/demeanor change was very heart wrenching. I just feel like I didn't want to promise him we could get it when in reality we really can't afford it.

1094,Not the A-hole,"So I'm a PhD student who got stuck living with a first-year undergrad because of the scarcity of available housing. Despite the age and experiential difference, I wasn't too worried about living him when I met him because he seemed rather laid-back and responsible. Upon my arrival we discussed the division of housework and chores, as most housemates do when they first meet. We agreed that we would do cleaning together on specific days, but this plan totally devolved as the year went on until it turned into just me (sometimes with the help of my partner) cleaning.

&#x200B;

Being that it was his first time away from home, I expected there to be some issues, but I didn't expect to act somewhat as his parent-away-from-home. Since I started living with him 7 months or so ago, I've been doing roughly 90%+ of the housework and making household purchases. Nearly every single bottle of hand-soap, dish washing liquid, paper towels, and toilet roll has been purchased by me. I can only remember one single scenario where he bought some toilet paper, but that was after my probing and 4 days of being without it\*.

\*- I actually had a roll stashed that I used, but I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually buy it since he was asked to.

&#x200B;

There would be times where I'd sweep the floors, hoover, and mop the entire house on my own while he just sat and did nothing. If he did help, he'd just give me tasks to do or he'd criticise me. For example, when I told him to deal with the rubbish and recycling, he just sorted the bags and left them for me to take out and throw away! He'd just stick them by the door and tell me to throw them out. Once he got annoyed with me because I didn't hoover the floor before mopping it, even though I did a thorough job at sweeping it -- he made me hoover after the floor was dry from mopping.

&#x200B;

Our condo also has this set-up where residents have to clean the shared staircase, meaning sweeping and mopping. When it was our month, he only did it once. I was left to do it the remaining 3 times because he was ""just too busy"" with schoolwork.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to two weeks ago, when he returned from spring break. He brought his mother to CLEAN OUR ENTIRE HOUSE. I was in complete shock. She did all the cleaning and even his laundry, and apparently used all my laundry soap (that wasn't communal) as well!

&#x200B;

So Reddit, that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm home, slightly sick, and semi-stressed about my research project. I try to do some laundry only to find the huge bottle of laundry soap that I had completely empty and I just lost it. 

I've decided that from now on I won't be doing any housework or buying household goods until I move out at the end of July. I'll be stashing all the stuff I need in my room and not leaving it around. WIBTA if I do this?",38,166,0.93

1098,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been married for 16 years. We are usually a really easy, chill couple. I am fairly quiet and I would say probably have always been a bit reserved whilst she is bubbly and charismatic. However-My wife has always been a little bit forgetful. It’s only ever caused significant damage once in our lives, but that was enough for me. 

Two examples that immediately come to mind that could explain the sort of forgetfulness she has are: we went on an international holiday last May that would have meant we were away for 3 weeks. I had switched off all appliances the night before we went away, but in the morning she decided she wanted to quickly make some scrambled eggs and got the cooker going. She left the gas fire on and since I was loading the boot up with luggage I asked her ‘did you remember to turn everything off’ when she came back down and she said yes. I needed a last minute wee and decided to check everything again just for peace of mind before locking up when I realised the stove had been left on. I didn’t make it a big deal to her, just casually mentioned it and she said oh whoops and that was that. 

The second example was when I was at work in October and had texted her to remind her to shut and lock all windows and doors before she went out. She doesn’t see safety as a serious issue as we live in a quiet part of the UK and she does usually forget to shut windows. I got a panicked phonecall 4 hours later with her telling me our home had been burgled because she’d forgotten to shut a window. I came home to the police at my home and my entire house smashed to bits on the inside.

The burglars had taken amongst other things, my m5  (car keys were on the sideboard) which I had worked years to be able to afford. I still haven’t recouped the loss to this day as my insurance didn’t cover theft. I love my wife so so so much but my trust in her memory was irrevocably broken and so every time we are to leave the house now I always do a thorough sweep to make sure nothing is left plugged in/ windows are shut/ etc. 

She absolutely hates this and tells me that I’m undermining her. She will snap and say ‘what, you don’t think I’m capable of shutting a window?’ And I am starting to become a bit frustrated at her lack of care. She STILL doesn’t shut the bloody windows! I have never ever taken my upset out on her- she is the love of my life- but I am absolutely not about to trust her with the locking up of the house.

I asked if one of my friends could make sure that the table wasn't filled up so I could sit by them. Instead she invites a date to come and reserves them tonsit at the spot where I was going to sit a day before I bought my tickets. 

I was upset I wasn't going to sit by my friends because it's the only prom we're ever gonna be at. She said it'd be fine and I forgave her. Well flash forward to yesterday, a few days before prom. I got the news that her date isn't coming. I had heard that she knew for a few days already (she hadn't even told me herself) and I got excited. I asked her if I could sit at that table now and she got mad at me because I wasn't super upset her date wasn't going with her now.

Wife and I have been together for almost 7 years (married 8 months). When we started dating we both lived at home and her family has always had cats, where my family were dog people. We moved in together 3-4 years into dating, to a place that didn't allow dogs but allowed cats. I was adamant I didn't want a cat, but deep down I knew she would be over the moon if we adopted one from our local shelter. So for our first Christmas living together, I surprised her and gave her some cat food and food dishes to unwrap. I told her to go adopt the cat she wanted and I would pay for everything, including the pet deposit at our apartment. She was so excited she cried.

Fast forward to summer 2018. We live in our newly purchased home and are set to be married in September. Her sister brings over an abandoned kitten (approximately 2-3 weeks old) that was covered in dirt and oil from being stuck God knows where.. I get home from work and see the cat there and immediately tell her that we aren't keeping him. But as the night went on, every time I looked at my soon to be wife her eyes were saying ""pleassssse"" without her actually saying anything at all. So of course I gave in and we kept the cat. On the condition that she makes sure our house is well kept and doesn't smell like cats.

We did the right thing and took him to the vet. Only to find out that he has an abnormal heart/possible heart disease. The vet says when he becomes an adult, his heart will not be able to keep up with his size and he will essentially just... drop dead. We were upset, but determined to give him the best life possible with what time he has left.

Here is problem. He is an asshole of a cat. He terrorizes our older cat to the point where she hates being in the same room as him. He constantly is leaving scabs on her. She feels forced to sleep in extremely high locations that are currently out of his reach, just to get some alone time. Worst of all, he is pissing every where and our house stinks. I am embarrassed to have anyone over. Having him fixed to combat his spraying isn't an option due to his heart condition. I finally had it with everything and told me wife to get rid of him. I love our first cat much more, and her life is reduced to hiding from him. But selfishly the biggest reason I want him gone is because he is making our house a pig sty.

I have known this teacher for two years now as she taught my child in both junior kindergarten and senior kindergarten (we have two levels of kindergarten in Ontario, Canada where I live). So I know this teacher fairly well as my wife and I share the responsibility of dropping off and picking my child up from school. I like the teacher and would be happy to go to a retirement party and celebrate her as an educator and important influence in my child’s life.

This teacher’s retirement party is being organized and thrown by another mom who has a kid in my child’s class. I think it is great that this mom is organizing this party in the first place. So I give her a lot of credit for this. However, on the invitation it specifies that this is a mom’s only event. That is the part that troubles me. To be clear, I think the idea of ladies only get togethers are great and I am always glad when my wife gets the chance to get out of the house and not have to be a mom for a while. My issue here is that it is a retirement party for my child’s teacher that is excluding the dads from attending. I would certainly go to this teacher’s retirement party as I assume many other dads would. Why does this need to be mom’s only? Naturally, this other parent can invite whoever they want to a party they are throwing and I have no right to be there. And of course I can always congratulate the teacher on her retirement at a different time. But it seems strange to me to exclude dads from the retirement party when they are going to be just as grateful to this teacher for the work with their children.

But since it is a retirement party for my child’s teacher, I feel left out as a father not being able to go and thank this teacher at her retirement party.

I asked him why he was doing that and he said that he wants an easier time paying for college and the free medical insurance. Now, I've never been in the military, but I've dated a few soldiers and also have a few family members in the military, so I know some details. He was absolutely GLEAMING when he talked about the medical insurance, because he said he'll never have to worry about anything anymore.

1112,Not the A-hole,"My cousin is autistic. We are super close as my mom and his mom are sisters AND literal neighbours and he’s always at our house. He’s like a brother to me and I do love the little kid a lot. He’s 13 and I am 19.

My cousin has SEVERELY destructive tendencies  but when I adopted my cat Cookie 6 years ago he absolutely fell in love with her and he seriously showed us a side that we never ever saw with him. He’s non verbal but he has learnt to say a few worlds ONLY to my cat, comes over and legit will be QUIET as a mouse so he doesn’t spook her, and he has never lifted so much as a finger in her direction. He’s also incredibly protective over her. Cookie (who is naturally nervous) will also go over to him when he’s having a meltdown and headbutt him or wrap her tail around his leg until he pays attention to her. She only has eyes for him and they love each other so so much. 

Basically, I’m moving out of my moms house and halfway across the country in a few weeks and my aunt asked if I could give my cat to my cousin. I said yes without hesitation. I’ve seen them interact for 6 years and I know their relationship. 

I told my girlfriend in passing who is really into animal rights and she was really shocked and told me it was a recipe for disaster. She said that I was condemning my cat to death over an accident waiting to happen which really made me feel uncomfortable because I love my cat so much but I also know that Cookie and my cousin have kind of saved each over in a weird way. She said I should give the cat to her but I’m really really not cool with that.

1113,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR:  Dad helped finance my younger brother's (22M) first car with agreement  to pay him back. Offered me (28M) a similar deal but let me sell a 3rd  car he did not need to help finance my second car and I pay him back the  difference. Now wants to split the difference of the resale car between  us after-the-fact as it would be fairer to my brother. I'm a bit  annoyed as it doubles my debt and he currently pays for all of my  brother's college expenses while I pay my own way.

After my mother passed, my dad got engaged and sold our house. With the money, he offered to help buy both my younger brother and I cars (Bro's first and mine to replace a 2006 model). When I was pitched the idea, he had already purchased my brother his first car with the stipulation that my brother would pay him back after he finished college and got a job. I was offered a similar deal though at this point he had a 3rd car he needed to sell (fiance's drug addict son's car that he wrecked). He offered to either sell me the repaired car or resell it to help buy a different one. I sold the step-son's car and bought a 2015  model for a difference of around $3.5k which was my debt.

This  is where AITA comes in. My dad now wants me to split the  difference on what I got the resale car for (approx. $9k) with my  younger brother, effectively more than doubling my debt from $3.5k to  about $8k despite both deals being established prior. I can 100% see where he is  coming from but can't help feel a bit put off.

A  big part of my personal issues is that I received virtually no financial help for undergrad/grad school and earned my way through with scholarships and part-time work since I was 16. My parent's could not afford it with medical bills at the time. My dad can now afford to put my brother through and he does need the help due to a possible learning disability. However, I do feel that he could work during the summer/winter breaks and he chooses not to. I feel my dad babies him still and it's slowed him down even more (hasn't applied for jobs yet after graduating; switched majors 2x).

So,  I'm really conflicted on what I should do. On one hand, I see my dad's  point in that he wants to split the sale as that may be a fairer deal in an isolated scenario. However, I  feel this is somewhat unfair in that he sprang the idea after establishing the $3.5k debt with me. I don't know if I would have gotten a 2015 model if I knew I'd owe $8k instead.",41,191,0.94

1115,Not the A-hole,"I used to date this girl, and we did not last very long. After about a couple months of dating, she decided to just be friends for a while. She felt she was not ready for a relationship yet and wanted to get her life in order first. So i respected  that. We ended up being best friends for about the next year. 

By about this point, to me at least, it looked like we weren't going to get back together. We were fine with being friends, to me, it looked like it was going to stay that way. We talked like best friends, acted like we were brother and sister, and even talked about other crushes we had. Around this time, we decided to go to our prom as friends. Nothing more. We had a good time, nothing romantic, done. 

About a month after prom, i had fell in love with this other girl. Me and this other girl were close prior to our relationship and had the samw friend group. We kept our relationship from our friends because it was only a couple of dates, we were testing out the waters, and we weren't entirely sure yet if we were good together yet. We didn't want our group of friends to think we dated for like two weeks or just had a one night stand. After a couple weeks, we decided to break it to our friends that we were dating. We were really in love.

The first text I get was from my best friend. My ex mentioned first in the beginning. She went on and ranted about how I did not tell her about my relationship. I responded by stating the same things i mentioned earlier about why i didnt tell my friends. She was furrious and had thought i had really disrespected her. 

What really changed the story was that she admitted she was starting to have feelings for me again. After we went to prom together, she decided that she would slowly come back to me. However, I did not know any of this because she didn't tell me until then.

She was upset i was with another girl and was subtly telling me to basically be with her and drop the other girl.  

After a day of arguing, i had enough of her. I felt like she had really disrespected me in wanting me to leave my new girlfriend. So i ghosted her. I dropped her as a friend and cut her out of my life. I felt like she was being really rude and toxic.

Was i an asshole for doing this? Was i too harsh?

1116,No A-holes here,"Both my girlfriend and I are early 20s for context. She has two female friends that often come over her apartment and stay the night, one sleeps on the sofa, one sleeps in her bed. While I am not sure the exact sexual orientation of either friend, neither is fully straight.

Yesterday, I expressed to her the idea of her sleeping with her friends makes me uncomfortable— I didn’t give an ultimatum or anything, only expressed my discomfort. She said she understood me feeling that way and acknowledged that probably most people would, but said that nothing would ever happen as they all see each other as sisters and that it’s a girl thing. She also brought up the idea of having a group discussion with her and her friends about it as a group, but I quickly shut that down because I feel like that would be inappropriate and extremely awkward.

I trust my girlfriend and her friends both not to do anything like that; however, I still find myself being uncomfortable with the idea and I somehow feel like my feelings are being disrespected/disregarded (I recognize that they’re probably not) and wanted some insight from some strangers. Honestly, I would like to outright ask her not to sleep with other people, but I feel like that would be controlling.

I would also like to stress that there is seldom an opportunity for them to sleep together recently because her friends come over when I am there too. 

I’m not sure it would even matter if her friends were completely straight.

Edit: I would like to add part of the purpose of this post is to understand if I am in the right to have these feelings, I think it’s important to note that I have a problem with dwelling on things, so for anyone who commented, “You’re probably overthinking it.” You’re probably right, I’m working on it.

1117,Asshole,"so usually I'm that one kid who does a very small amount of work in a group project \[normally it's because I'm not assigned to any work in the group or everyone already picked out what they want to do and there's nothing left for me to work on\] this time it was a pair project and the teacher was pretty clear they wanted the work split 50/50 when answering questions.

&#x200B;

my partner and I started the model part of the project together and decided that we'd finish the questions at home on a google docx. The project was due the next day and neither of us had done the questions so at school before we both left I let them know I was going to do my part after girl guides\[or scouts depending on where you're from\] and if I didn't start them by 9:00 send me a text to remind me to do them.

&#x200B;

I get home from guides, open my laptop ready to do my part but noticed my questions were already answered and it was only 8:30. I text my partner 'wth, why did you do my half?' to which they reply 'I thought you weren't going to do anything like you normally do'. I didn't text them back but when we saw each other I let them know it wasn't okay they did my part and they should have contacted me like I told them to before taking the initiative.

I guess I should have expected them to be slightly paranoid about me not doing my work due to past experiences but I'm wondering AITA for being upset they did my part of the work?

1118,Not the A-hole,"My mom is pretty hard on me, pushes me to do well in school and is always on me making sure I do everything I need to do, and I am grateful for it. At times our relationship has gotten tense, but I have always appreciated how much she does for me and my 5 siblings. So when I made my senior quote “You are the smartest stupid person I know”-My Mom (Which is a real thing she said to me) I really thought it was just a funny quote, with no ill will. The quote describes me pretty well, and everyone I talked to liked it. Until I showed my mom. She said the quote was a reflection of her and her parenting skills, and that I was trying to get in a passive aggressive dig on her. That wasn’t my intention, but am I the asshole for making that my quote without consulting her?

Edit: Feel like I should add some context. First off, this was said as a joke. Second, my friends believe that my mom is too hard on me, and some of their parents have said things to her about it,  which I think is idiotic. They have no right to tell my mom how to parent, and I think she believes I’m the one complaining about her to my friends, which admittedly I do at some times. I understand my moms method of parenting and it has produced 5 great kids, and the constant pressure has helped me have success.

Last month i come up to my parents and said that i no longer belive in Jesus or any god anymore, i want to be unreligous and i have more interest in science. My parents got very mad and scold me, told me that i'm a disgrace for saying that. And they made me go to church to confess my sins. I didn't do what they asked.

So after that day, they would force me to go to church every Sunday to think about what i've done even when i don't want to. And i told them once again i don't want to go to the church because: ""No, i'm old enough to decide what things i should believe in""

The fight got to peak last Tuesday when we have a family reunion. Seems like my parents tell everyone that i don't believe in Jesus anymore.

1123,Asshole,"My best friend (21M) and I (22F) haven't had sex before that night. I liked him, and I knew he didn't like me back. 
There was this hotel party that we were both going to. I was dressed up, and went to his hotel room (thought he was also ready for the party) but he wasn't. He asked me to stay there and wait for him to shower and prepare himself, which I did. When he got out of the shower, I expected him to be at least in his boxers. He was just in his towel. We haven't seen each other naked before so him changing in front of me was a bit weird. So I said i'll go out and wait for him outside. 
He agreed, but then he got closer and said ""or maybe stay here I dont mind"" 
Me, being rational, said that we shouldnt do this as I have gone down the ""fuck your best friend"" road since I've been there before and it didnt turn out so great.
He agreed at first, but then said that it will be a one time thing and nothing will change after that. 
I clearly liked him, and I wanted that to happen honestly, and the fact that he wanted it too made me feel desired. 

So we did it. Twice that night. 


After the second round, he asked me if I wanted a drink, I confirmed, so he brought his liquor bottle. Now I remember that that bottle was full that morning. Now it was basically empty. 
I asked, ""when did you drink all this?"" 
He said that it was basically before I arrived to his room. 

The thing is, when we woke the morning after, he had no idea that it had happened. 

I would recognize a drunk man, especially my best friend drunk, but he was acting so normally before we had sex so I didnt even consider the thought of him being drunk.

When him and I spoke of the matter, I told him that I didnt know that he had drank all that. I told him what happened exactly, and he was okay with it. We're still friends, and sometimes we joke about his ""forgetfulness"". 

AITA? Would this be considered as taking advantage of someone?


EDIT: 
- He didnt smell like alcohol, not even a bit. 
I have seen him drunk before: he loses his reflexes, starts laughing too much (or crying), cant walk properly and ends up puking and going to bed. That night he was okay. He made sense, I didnt doubt for a second that he was intoxicated.  
- I didnt drink beforehand. Him and I and the whole squad were supposed to drink after the party. I was shocked when I saw the bottle after we had sex. 
- He never said "" i dont like you that way"". He also never said he did. Before that night, we have never been together alone. He had always (throughout our 2 year friendship) made remarks on how sexy I look, complimented my body and so on. I assumed he didnt like me that way since he was hung up on his ex. 
- He did mention the fact that he would be up for it again, multiple times. 
- He also makes sex jokes with me, and states that ""i would be good in bed"" based on some shit astrology (he doesnt believe in horoscropes-determine-who-you-are but none of our  common friends know that we hooked up so it was his way of throwing shade without giving too much) and he smirks at me everytime he makes a joke.",164,56,0.85
1124,Not the A-hole,"It's not too long of a story, but this happened over a year ago.

So, back in 2017, I had moved away from my family for college reasons and was just living my life as I could while trying to maintain my grades at school. Not too long after, I found out my sister had moved there for a new job. Not too bad. She mentioned wanting to meet up so that I could show her around the city. Mind you, I don't know much about this city either, but I knew there was I river, so I decided I would take her there. 

Now begins the fun part, she told me that would invite her friend with her. I agreed, not thinking too much of it.

So, I take them to the river, it's not too long but there is a a small island of sorts that rests in the middle of it. So, we go there and the are other people there. It was a well known place to relax, and it was a great place to relax.

Anyway, as we are walking around I had to help both her and her friend jump on down from a 5'5"" jump down to the bank of the river. So, I helped them out and caught them as they jumped down.  I thought nothing was wrong, but I was so wrong. 

Later on that night, I get a call from our parents calling me to tell me that she and her friend had called then and said that I had groped both of them. Naturally, I was fuming and nearly threw my phone at the wall. I was able to calm down and listened to the rest of the story, all while explaining that I did nothing of the sort and was only helping them. All the while my dad was the phone with my sister, wanting to hear her side of the story, which I might add doesn't even line up with the original story she had told. She, literally, messed up her own lie, digging her own grave. 

After listening to sister's tale, my parents hung up the call and told us that they'll visit us and figure out exactly what happened. 

So, one month later they came up, listening to both of us to figure out what happened. And guess what? My sister lies again, not even remotely close to what she lied about the first two times. At this point, my parents cut her off and mention what she had talked about first. After seeing her eyes go wide, they told her to apologize to me and that she has to make it up to me somehow. Don't know why, but her apology went along the lines of 'I'm sorry that I almost called the cops on you.'

At that point, all I could feel was anger. Nearly yelling at her, I repeated what she said, confirming what I thought I heard. While my parents were still there, I told her 'Never text me again, never call me again, don't even talk to me. We may share blood, but we are not siblings.'

I stormed off, leaving a crying sister with our parents comforting her. 

I didn't know until later, but apparently my parents, though heartbroken, had agreed with my choice. 

So, AITA for doing that to family?

Edit: Guys, I know this doesn't sound like a real story to some of you, but I promise you, this happened. I just wanted outside opinions on whether or not I was wrong for doing that. My family says I'm not but some friends say I am.",134,1179,0.97
1125,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll keep this as brief as I can. I'm pretty sure I am TA here, but I want some outside opinions. 

3 months ago I [19M] met this guy. I work in a pub, and he started coming in regularly, we got to talking, one thing led to another, we start seeing each other. He's about ten years older than me so I felt a little weird about it, but he was *gorgeous*, super sweet and kind to me. Not about to throw myself a pity party but that was a pretty welcome change in my life at that time, so I kinda went with it. He also helped me with stuff like paying my rent/bills and buying groceries (I live alone and am no contact with my family for various reasons so really struggle with both). He even bought me a proper bed as I was previously sleeping on some crappy fold out campbed thing. 

I did not know when I met him that he's married with three children. He told me that he was single and that he was gay. I found this out when his wife found out last week that we were seeing each other. In hindsight there were things that should've been red flags, including him insisting we always go to my place and our dates always being in the nearest city instead of our town. I guess I was blinded by the idea that this handsome, lovely man was into me and ignored those things. 

I feel *awful* for what I've done. The wife doesn't believe that I didn't know about her. She knows some of my co-workers, and they're also not having that I thought he was single. Work has become a very hostile environment for me because of this. Her entire family hates me, and I keep getting pretty angry Facebook messages from her various relatives over this. Their marriage is in tatters and their kids (all under 10) are in the middle of it. 

I really wouldn't have gone for the guy if I'd known he was married, but then again this is on me for not seeing the red flags/looking into him more, right? I feel fucking horrible for ruining that marriage and for putting those kids through this, but I think I might be redeemed slightly by the fact that I didn't know? Idk. This is all a big mess, and I guess I just want opinions from people who aren't emotionally attached to the situation.",59,80,0.91
1126,Everyone Sucks,"I had a BBQ over last weekend and invited many of my coworkers. One of them, I'll name Emily, is ""devoutly vegan"". I don't mind/care, I still invited her. I even went so far to ask what kind of foods she'd like to eat so I can make sure I a) buy the ingredients, b) think of a recipe specifically for her, and c) make it. No one else who came is vegan or vegetarian.

So Emily tells me some things to get, and I don't know if many of you know this, but vegan food can get expensive. I get some seitan hotdogs, some tofu for stir fry, and mock hamburgers. My expenses at this point is $60 for 12 people including myself, and then $25 for just Emily. It's fine, I want everyone to have a good time and ultimately it's no big deal.

So I prepare some meals in advance and I'm grilling things as requested during the night. I even went so far as to thoroughly clean my grill so 1/4th of it is just vegan stuff so it doesn't get cross contaminated as well as use separate utensils/tongs/etc.

So color me surprised when I see Emily come by asking for a meat hamburger. She's already got pulled pork on her plate as well as salad with caesar dressing and bacon bits.

I asked her what she was doing, none of that is vegan, and she said she's only ""sometimes vegan"" (verbatim her words) and today she wanted to have meat. I reminded her she asked me to get vegan food for her and she said ""well, other people might like it"". No, no one had any, not even myself.

I stewed a bit but vowed my ""revenge"". When everyone is leaving, I held her keys hostage. ""You're not leaving until you pay for this food I bought specifically for you which you ate precisely none of"". It took all of twenty minutes for her to relent and give me $20 (not $24.44 which was the full amount but I'm not a level 100 asshole) and off she went, spewing obscenities at me.

AITA for doing this?

**EDIT INFO**: She told me beforehand what vegan things to buy. I even phoned her while I was shopping and telling her the prices. She told me to get all of that stuff, saying she'll bring the rest home. It was explicitly told of me to buy these exact things, and what I bought were the smallest amounts you could buy. Something like $11 for six seitan dogs, $4 for the tofu block, $10 for four vegan burgers.

As for the keys, I didn't steal them out of her purse or anything. Everyone put their keys in a basket for me to hold onto in case they drank too much so I'd stop them from driving inebriated. I called Ubers for the two who drank too much and left their car here and offered to call Emily an Uber too. I paid for the Ubers, by the way.

I didn't stop her from leaving, I just withheld her keys yet gave an alternative. It would be a hassle to take an Uber home and then get back here to pick your car up. I could claim she was drunk and I refused to give her her keys to keep her safe.

My intention was to inconvenience her, not keep her hostage, which is a huge stretch some of you are arguing. I don't care if people don't eat the food but I do care if they explicitly tell me to go out of my way to cater to your needs and then don't eat the food.",772,1686,0.91
1127,Not the A-hole,"So this story happened about 2 weeks ago.

First a little backstory; Im a student living alone. i was raised in a small municipality outside the city i live in rn.

So when i first came here, it was good. I was sick of high school and was ready to move on. . I found several people that had the same interests as me ( in the same class) and i enjoyed spending time with these ""friends"". Keep in mind, that these people was already acquainted with each other before i came. I found that i fit well with the others and i had a great time in general the first 2-3 months.

This, however is where all the happy memories end. Because somewhere between december-january i found myself growing away from these so-called ""friends"". We started disliking eachother ( me vs. the 3 others), we exchanged insults, I felt more and more outside (as i wasn't included in outside activities) and they had a knack for talking behind my back. (something i discovered as my closest friend studying the same as me) told me so. These classmates also had  influence over the others, making other people within the same study line dislike me off their lies and fake rumors.

So you could imagine the spot i was in.

\-1-3 close friends (spread out between different schools, lines of studies and parts of the city)

\-i hated my classmates (& they hated me)

\-too shy to make new friends

Now for the main story.

So in norwegian culture, you can become a ""russ"" the same year as you graduate (russ are often 17-19 years old). (these people are notorious for partying, dressing up, acting wild and doing irrational things). And these people decided to throw a huge (unofficial) party in the city park. a short walk from where i live

So then, a week before the party, my ""friend"" who lives 30 minutes (by car) outside the city asks my if he could crash at my place until the morning. I agree to this, as this was the ONLY guy who ACTED genuinely nice towards me. (and i was greatly deceived by this act). I then hear from my real & close friend 5 days later, that this guy had also been talking smack behind my back. Mentioning how much he despises me and that he was planning to ""Steal whatever is loose around"" and ""Take some of his things and burn them"" Whenever i fell asleep.

In that moment i was furious. Both because i had been bamboozled so hard AND that he had the nerve to plan something like this after i showed such hospitality. I then immediately messaged him saying that the deal is over. No sleepover, no nothing. (no mentioning of my precious insider). 

I should also mention that this guy was quite intimidating. Weighing 260-ish lbs (120-ish kgs) and being 190 cm tall.

I contated my teacher

&#x200B;

So then when the party came, i heard that he didn't have any place to stay, and so he had to sleep at a bus stop. I later discovered that someone had stolen his cellphone and wallet while he was asleep.

That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

&#x200B;

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here? Am i an asshole?",4478,33862,0.95
1131,Asshole,"My wife and I were walking home today when a thunderstorm came out of nowhere. It’s not uncommon around this time of year due to the extreme humidity, so I obviously had an umbrella with me. 

So my wife and I were walking home safe and relatively dry under said umbrella when I saw a young lady with a toddler looking quite distressed under some shelter from the rain. So I went over and asked if she was okay and she explained she had been caught out on her way to a doctors appointment and was now running late as she waited for the storm to pass.

The rain is really heavy and it was definitely not goinggn to stop any time soon. My wife and I are only three or so blocks away from our apartment building. my umbrella is a cheap one from a Sunday market so I say she can have it. She’s incredibly thankful and goes on her way.

As soon as she’s out of earshot my wife blows up at me calling me an inconsiderate asshole. That it’s not my choice eto make and that now she will get soaked.

I suppose she is right I didn’t consider her feelings. I just assumed she would be okay with it because:

1. Our apartment is literally like three blocks away 

2. We’re healthy/fit in our 20s and a bit of rain won’t hurt us (we didn’t have anything with us that would get ruined)

3. She was literally with her toddler on her way to a doctors appointment. I would feel like an asshole if I DIDNT offer it

Since then I’ve heard no end of how I’m a prick. Give my judgement because I don’t feel like I can give an unbiased view after all the names she has called me

1132,Asshole,"Me and my wife have 3 kids, a 19 year old daughter who has moved out, a 16 year old son, and a 14 year old son. This story involves my 16 year old son, Edgar, now edgar is very responsible for a 16 year old, he has never broken our trust, he has a job, he is very responsible with his money and hes an honor roll student.

Edgar recently came to me and my wife, asking if he could go to a party with 3 of his friends and his girlfriend, my wife objected but we talked about it and i convinced her to let him go, i asked him if he was going to be drinking or doing drugs and he was honest, he told me he was going to drink a bit and maybe smoke weed, i told him be safe and know he will not be in trouble if he needs help becuase he tried something, and if he needs to call us no matter the time i can come get him.

My wife and i talked and agreed that he is responsible and shouldnt have to sneak around that stuff, and his safety is more important to us than stopping him from doing something we did as teens, and that all his peers are probably doing, we gave him the safe sex talk and all that and told him he can always call us, and he was on his way.

My wife started getting worried, and i told her to calm down, i trust he will call if he is in trouble, and of course he came home the next day safe and sound, although a bit hungover.

Now the part that may make me an asshole happend last weekend, well my wife was out of town, me and my younger son were planning on leaving town aswell to get some bonding time, edgar asked if he could throw a party and i said sure, but let him know it had to be cleaned up by the time we got home the next day, and that all of the upstairs of our house is off limits, he agreed and of course everything was fine.

I told my wife about it, and she went postal, telling me i betrayed her trust by not telling her, and im a huge asshole and i put our sons lofe at risk. I told her shes overreacting and that made things worse (stupid thing to say on my part). 

So AITA for not letting my wife know my son was throwing a party when we had said it was ok for him to go to parties before hand.",50,68,0.92
1133,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend’s sister has a few health issues. Whenever she gets pregnant, her body kills the fetus because her body thinks it’s a foreign object. Her uterus is also a heart shape, which makes pregnancy hard to keep. 

My girlfriend told me a long time ago that she offered to carry a baby for her and that she had one month to get back to her. I didn’t really agree with it, but I didn’t argue. I wasn’t too familiar with what kind of a person her sister was back then. 

Fast forward many of months, her sister treats my girlfriend like shit all the time. 

Her sister and mom live together and they’re the perfect toxic duo, it’s ridiculous. 

I’ve held my girlfriend while she cried about the stuff they’ve said or done to her. 

Then just a few days ago, my girlfriend told me that she told her sister that she would carry a baby for her again, but this time she didn’t say she gave her a time limit. I’m not gonna lie, I flat out said, “No.” straight to her face. 

I said no because we are thinking about expanding our family soon. We’ve been talking about a baby for a few months now and figuring out the financial costs. She really wants another baby and I’m ready to be a dad to my own baby as much as I’m a dad to her kids. (My girlfriend has 2 kids from a previous relationship. They call me dad.)

I also said no because of the way her sister has been treating her like shit. 

I also said no because her sister isn’t dating anyone, isn’t married. She just literally wants to get some guys sperm and fertilize an egg for her. I personally think she should start dating and find someone who wants to raise a family for her. 

When I told her no she said something like, “What? Would you not love me if I did?” 

Of course, that’s a silly ass question, I’d still love her but I want to move ahead with our relationship. 

Am I an asshole for telling her I don’t want her to do it?

Edit: I just want to point out that I did indeed say, “No” as my initial reaction when my girlfriend first told me about this. I was shocked and against it so all I articulated was “No”.

In no way, am I gonna try to control her and her body. In the end, it’s up to her. I’m not gonna tell her she can’t because I don’t want her to. I’m not the controlling type and I promised myself I would never control my partner in any relationship. So you guys can stop telling me that I can’t control her and that it’s her body. I know that.

I work in a small retail store with a lot of regular customers. We try to maintain a very friendly and helpful environment, and as part of that will often call people ""hon"". We all do it, and with everyone. No particular age or gender. I've only ever heard of one person complaining about it, and i think he just didn't like the associate who said it to him (she was notoriously abrasive, he's often very surly). I stick with ""sir"" for that particular customer just in case. 

The use of ""hon"" isn't particularly common in my area, but not unheard of, and again it doesn't seem to upset people in general. I just hate to think I'm offending anyone when my intention was to make them feel welcome.",46,26,0.87

1137,Not the A-hole,"I married my wife three years ago. We have a one year old daughter together. I have a 12 year old daughter and she has an 18 year old son from a previous marriage.

Despite being married we both agreed to keep our finances separate as our divorces were extremely long and messy/toxic. We both work full time however I make substantially more money than my wife which is where this dispute is coming from.

Her son wants to go to a college which is well outside of his mothers budget. Rather than talk him into going to a cheaper college, she told him it was fine with the expectation that I would pay for it.

I disagreed with this since her son has a father of his own. I think my wife and his dad should be paying for it. I would not expect my wife to pay for my daughters schooling. 

This has become a big point of contention in our marriage. She will bring it up and get mad at me. I will just refuse and reiterate that his father should pay. She starts Yelling at which point I will walk away (I do not want to yell back at my wife)

1138,Not the A-hole,"So I am hanging at home tonight with my fiance (apartment building with 4 units) and the door buzzer goes off at 9PM. We are not expecting anyone and this happens all the time - sometimes as late as 10. Probably at least 50 times in the 4 months we've been here. We usually just ignore it. 

We had thought previously there might be an issue with the buzzer system or maybe that people were just buzzing all the apartments to get in....who knows. So this time my fiance gets pissed and says through the speaker to whoever it is to stop. They keep buzzing for about another 10 seconds so I go out to the door and it is my neighbor across the hall. We have said hello to each other before but that is that. 

She says (super bitchy-like) ""yeah, hi I'm not buzzing to be a bitch, I need to get in"" - I say whatever and apologize for my fiance not buzzing her in but say ""this happens all the time and we weren't expecting anyone"". 

She starts in that her boyfriend wasn't responding to her buzzer or her calls and that they only had one key. From time to time she needs to buzz our door so she can get in. I clarify that she has been doing this for a while, she confirms.

I say ""a heads up or clarification that you would be doing this would have been nice"" and she responds ""I DONT HAVE YOUR NUMBER DUDE.""...lol - they have had plenty of time to exchange info if they needed a favor!!

Again I tell her we weren't expecting someone and it's a little late to just get a random buzz. She responds with ""ITS ONLY 9PM!""

At this point I'm pissed and have so many things to say but instead I just shake my head and go for the door. 

She says ""WHATEVER DUDE"" and I head in. 

...

A. Get another key made! It takes 5 minutes at Walmart. You're a mother for christ' sake. 

B. Approach us during the day when you see us outside and actually introduce yourself. Or come to the door, whatever. Ask if this type of thing might be OK from time to time. 

C. Dont be an asshole when I'm annoyed that you're relentlessly buzzing my door at 9PM on a weeknight.

I feel like I'm not the asshole here...right?",18,53,0.93
1139,Not the A-hole,"I was at work today and I saw someone who I thought I would never see again.

Some back story, this girl was my best friend from 3rd grade all the way up to Senior year in highschool. We dated off and on in HS and we were still together when I left for the military(this was 2009 and I was 19).

About 6 months into my time she was working as a flight attendant and I started noticing some dude posting stuff onto her Myspace wall like ""I can't wait to see you again, we had so much fun last night,etc,etc"". I am not a jealous guy so I politely inquire wtf all this stuff he was posting was and she said that she had reconnected with a friend and they had been hanging out but that nothing was going on.

Then two days later I got the ""Dear John"" email and she admitted to have been cheating on me since the day I left.


Fast forward to this day some 10 years later, and I was working and I see her face. I make like I didn't recognize her right off the bat and kept working,she then calls my name, I acted like I didn't hear her and she just called it louder so I turned and faced her.

She greeted me and then said ""Do you remember me?"" and I said ""I am so sorry but I don't"".

She looked really hurt and tried to continue the conversation but I said that I needed to get back to work (which I did I was trying to finish a project).

My coworkers said that I was cold hearted, but being cheated on is up there on my ""relationship mortal sins"" and frankly I had no desire to reconnect.

Well, I made good on my promise. After I noticed my toothpaste continuing to go down, I got some very concentrated ghost pepper extract and put a decent amount near the top of my toothpaste. Well, last night I was walking down the hall, and I see my roommate bursting out of the bathroom, heading towards the kitchen. I follow him down there, and saw him downing his gallon of milk straight out of the container. I started laughing and said that now he should buy his own toothpaste. He looked at me and said ""What the fuck, dick"".

1141,Asshole,"My kid, a five year old who's moderately autistic, goes to a daycare before and after school every day. From the get go, we've had issues with this place left and right, I don't know how to say it--poorly foreseeing his needs? Giving him too much credit when assuming his level of functioning? Not accommodating him. He's come home with marker all over his clothes and body, including his goddamn face. Multiple times he's ripped his own shirt off. Weird stuff. Their excuse has always been that they have 22 other kids and given the nature of daycare, shit happens. We've tried in vain to argue with them about him needing more supervision and how they need to come up with something before he has a serious accident, but it's fallen on deaf ears. We have already been looking for a new daycare. 

Monday when we get to daycare in the afternoon we are pulled into the Director's office. It turns out our son was let to use the restroom during nap time, and flushed diapers down all four of the toilets in the restroom, causing a massive flood. We are told my son's being exited and they're sending us a multi-thousand dollar bill for their bathroom and the carpet outside, as well as for the diapers of over a dozen families that were in the bathroom--which they will need us to pay for within the week. They said they would give us a list of types and sizes and we needed to return with them or they would sue us. 

We apologized for what our son did but told them we weren't paying it, nor would we be going diaper shopping or even paying for those either--suggesting that the daycare should eat the cost of replacing the diapers, and use their insurance to repair the flood damage. Our justification was that we've told them multiple times that our son should not be left unattended, especially in the kitchen and the bathroom where there can be major hazards and accordingly it wasn't our fault. We pay them to supervise our son, so if they didn't and he damaged something, they clearly weren't holding up their end of the bargain. 

We've received mixed opinions about this, with many people saying we should at least pay for the diapers because the other families didn't do anything wrong, and a lot of people we know saying we need to take responsibility for our child. Wife and I are on the fence. We already quickly spoke to a lawyer (due to them threatening to sue) and he says he doesn't think they would be able to make a case legally. 

TL;DR son flooded bathroom at daycare, we say they should have supervised him better but they say it's our fault and we need to pay",337,533,0.87

Hi guys this is a throwaway account because my husband knows my reddit.
The people involved in the storey are

* *me, my hubby: D, his sister S and his friend A.**

I met my husband in highschool but we didn't date until mid 2017. Shortly after beginning to date he went to another city to spent holidays with his mom sister and A.

 Now let me tell you... A and D have been friends for over 13 years. A was there for him when his ex cheated, when his dad died and was the only one that took care of D when he was in the hospital.

 She moved to another city 3 hours away but was going to drive to his mom's place to spent Christmas together. I had never seen her, just heard from her from him and his friends. 

When I went to pick up D from the station I saw her for the first time ever. Let me tell you she is pretty. Not like sexy pretty but she is literally one of the most beautiful beings I have ever seen. They had been fighting. 

A looked at me smiled bitter sweet and wished me and D a happy new year and stormed of. D wouldn't tell me what happened. 

A few days after that, his family came to visit but they visibly didn't like me. I caught his aunt saying ""why her? A is so much better... I wish he just had stayed with her"". That hit me so hard. Where they a thing at some point? I didn't ask.

 I tried bonding with s but she rejected me and would always call A if she needed something.

 Then a few days ago his mother died from a heart attack. My husband was destroyed of course. 

When he came home crying I tried to lift him up. When I went to make dinner I heard him talking. He was calling A. He cried like never before and asked her to come because he needed her! 

They hadn't talked since I saw them at the bus stop. I was livid!

 Soon after she arrived with S and she basically took over. She organized the funeral, made D his favorite dish and I even saw D, S and A all together on the couch crying over his mom.

They practically shut me off. I was non existent. A didn't stay at our place but she was nearby. 

All came to a boiling point when I was snuggling with hubby yesterday and he didn't say my name but hers. I exploded into tears and started telling him I was not confortable with how Intimate he was with a... And why he didn't marry her. I was so done.

He tried calming me down but I was having none of it so it told him :I don't want you to see her ever again after the funeral ""

He just walked away and won't take my calls now.
AITA? I just think he has feelings for her and I am just a consolation price for the one that got away... I am scared to loose him.

Edit3: thank you so much for your kind words and for silver. I didn't expect to get more than 5 answers. As for the situation, this morning S came to pick up some D's things. We didn't talk much she looked mad at me and before she left she said ""I can't believe that in order for my brother to stay with you, he has to loose another family member."" and then left... I feel like shit

Edit 4: this happened half an hour ago. My sister and I went out to grab some food to get my mind off the situation. When we were on our way back from the restaurant, as luck would have it, we saw A in a coffee place with S and a guy I didn't recognize. I wanted to ignore them but my emotions got the best of me and I started crying. My sister was livid and made a huge mistake. She charged to their table and started reprimanding A. Telling her if she had no shame getting in the sheets with a married man, that she was an asshole for pushing me out of my own family and that she should just leave and know her place. I wanted to take my sister and apologize really... But I couldn't. I know I shouldn't be angry at her like a comme t pointed out but I just can't help it. The Guy got up and told my sister to back off and never talk to his girlfriend that way ever again. I grabbed my sister and bolted with her. Now I am scared how the story will be told to my husband.",85,159,0.92
1144,Not the A-hole,"I very off-handedly shared a tweet I read protesting the new ridiculous anti-abortion law in Alabama where I live as a Facebook update, and one of my distant relatives (the son of a great-aunt) wrote some weird rambly soapboxing comment on my status talking about the morality of ""killing innocents"" and basically calling me and everyone who believes in reproductive rights an idiot in a vague passive-aggressive way.

I deleted the comment. I feel pretty guilty about it because I believe in the value of dissenting opinions, but...

He just gets flustered and upset.

Anyway, after I told him I was pregnant he turned into a massive asshole. He told me that he’s not ready to be a father and by not getting an abortion I’m trying to force a relationship with him and force him to marry me(??? No idea where that came from). He told me he doesn’t want anything to do with me or the baby and to have fun being a stereotypical single mom. That was a week ago and I haven’t heard from him since, he blocked me on everything.

I have a friend who’s a single dad and we were talking about the situation. He’s telling me that it’s MY responsibility to make sure my child has a father in their life.

I disagree. He’s a grown man and I’m not gonna force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do. I didn’t block him, it’s the other way around and my line is always open for when he decides to grow up, but I’m not gonna chase him. He said some pretty hurtful shit to me that I won’t forget.

1148,No A-holes here,"Hi all,

Our daughter just graduated from University with a degree in art. We (the parents) work as doctors and always tried to steer our daughter towards a high paying profession but her passion for art throughout school was very strong. When it came time for her to apply to University we told her that we won't pay for tuition if she studies something that doesn't have a good rate of return. She borrowed around $150k (NZD) of student loans to do her art degree and now she has a job that pays significantly less than the average wage doing some casual painting for small studios and her overall prospects don't look good - almost 100% of her paycheque goes on a rented apartment that she shares with two other people.

We haven't told her, but we're going to pay off her student loan debt this year so she can be debt free.

We (parents) want to sell our house and leave the country, we're looking at moving from New Zealand to Europe so we can enjoy skiing in the winter and french vineyards in the summer. We're in our 50's now so we feel like we've earned the right to start enjoying our lives rather than continuing to live in the city.

Our daughter recently asked if she could move back in with us in order to reduce her living expenses, we told her that we are planning on moving to Europe. She suggested that we let her stay in our house after we leave; we really need to sell the house as we need the money. She is incredibly angry at us for ""abandoning"" her. We feel that as a 22 year old adult, she should be able to take care of herself, we gave her access to the best private schools in the area, the best after school tutors and her grades were A's across all subjects. She chose to live the life of a suffering and poor artist despite us trying to get her interested in medicine, law, business etc. We tried not to push her too hard towards things that she had no interest in but we really did try to show her that art isn't going to let her live the kind of life that she became accustomed to when she lived with us (ski trips, nice houses, restaurants etc).

Are we the assholes?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just want to point out that we HAVE NOT had an ""I told you so"" moment with her where we make her feel bad for studying art. We love our daughter greatly but we really want to retire and get out of this city living.

&#x200B;

Second edit: looks like I need to add some more context in order to stop the accusations of abusive father. I have supported her passion for art her entire life with every fibre of my being. When she chose her degree and her University, I just sat down with her to look at average salaries over the lifetime of various careers, she still chose art, we supported that choice despite being worried for her. She completely supported us retiring to France, she was excited for us and for all the skiing she would get to do with us. She only got upset when we told her we are selling our house (not her childhood home). She studied at Oxford in the UK, she tried to live in the UK post-grad but couldn't get a good visa due to not securing work with a company that could sponsor her, turns out there's not much demand for what she does.",402,327,0.89
1149,Asshole,"Hi, I'll try to keep it brief but I tend to be long winded, sorry!

I love staying in hotels, and it's not something I do very often. I booked a room out of town, where I need to go return one of the wedding dresses I had bought for our wedding last fall. The dress and the room are both about $150 so they kind of cancel each other out, and it's all bought on my card with my own money, which I'm not super hurting for. I got the idea to go out there for the night when we were fighting and I really needed space, but I took a while to pull the trigger on doing it, and since I had to book a few weeks out to get a decent price, now enough time has passed that things have been back to normal between us.

&#x200B;

So I've got this reservation and this plan to take the day to myself, go wander around this mall (which he would hate), maybe swim in the hotel pool and have dinner by myself, on my own time, with no one else to answer to. I want to take up the whole hotel bed, watch whatever bullshit TV I want to watch, and be able to shamelessly fill the duvet full of farts.

&#x200B;

But I can't help feeling like an asshole for not including my husband, and now it's already coming up on Friday and I haven't even mentioned it yet. I just can't make up my mind on weather to invite him or not, and I feel guilty for spending money on myself and excluding him, and I'm not even sure how to tell him that I've already booked it. Today is my last day to cancel my reservation but I don't really want to.



&#x200B;

Anyways, would I be the asshole if I didn't invite him and just said I'm going to go relax by myself? Do I tell him I'm staying the night at a friend's house? I hate lying, though. I feel like it sounds reasonable to want space and to treat yo self, however if the tables were turned honestly I would feel bummed to not be invited or have him want me there.",42,48,0.88

1151,Asshole,"TLDR; I was stuck on a plane surrounded by babies. I reclined my seat because the seat in front of me did, and the mother and baby behind me ended up with less space than they wanted. 


I am travelling alone and specifically picked a window seat so that I didn’t have to keep moving for people who needed to get up. I generally hate to be bothered when I fly and ideally the goal is to sleep the entire way. I remember when I was a kid, flying was difficult for me (motion sickness) but my parents didn’t take me on a plane until I was 3 years old and had my own seat. I slept across laps and on the floors because there was never enough space to get comfortable.

The mother and baby sitting directly behind me are also travelling alone and the baby was young enough to fly free on a lap. I understand that travel with a baby is stressful, and I overheard that this was the first time she was travelling without her husband. 

Even before takeoff, the baby (approx 9 mths) was already grabbing my headrest, reaching for my hair, and occasionally kicking the back of my seat. I let it go because you can’t really stop a baby, and who’s going to ask a mother to stop their baby from doing baby things? She did make an effort to stop the baby when she did and I didn’t mind. At this point I didn’t recline my seat because I had enough room. 

Halfway through the flight, the seat in front of me (also a mom and a baby) reclined their seat and having just woken up from a nap, I reflexively reclined my seat in response. I could hear her exasperatedly go “no please!” and I momentarily had second thoughts...until she asked the flight attendant if there was anything she could do about it. I’m feigning sleep to see how this plays out, but the flight attendant just sympathetically said it was a tricky situation. 

The baby then proceeds to try grabbing at my hair again and I can hear the mother saying (probably just exasperation) that she didn’t care anymore...she usually does but she just doesn’t care anymore. At this point I decided to keep my seat reclined and she can just deal with it like how everyone else deals with economy class. She made a couple of passive aggressive comments to her seat mates about space, but quieted down eventually. The baby was super well behaved, but the mom wouldn’t stop talking. I listened to the mom blab, white noise, Moana, and Frozen for the entire 3 hour flight. 

I can’t decide if AITA for wanting the space I paid for, or should I just have been the bigger person and dealt with the reduced space because I can empathize that travelling with children sucks infinitely more than travelling solo. I am not a large person by any means so it wasn’t a matter of needing the space physically, but just wanting the space.",188,135,0.85

So I’ve been dating this girls well call E casually for about two months. Things are good, but I honestly can’t see it going anywhere. She’s a great woman though.

She has this friend well call H. Dude, lemme tell y’all, she’s my dream everything. We have a much better connection than E and I do. There’s attraction and chemistry between us I can tell. Plus there’s just little things I she has done I can tell she’s into me. 

So I really just want to be with her. She’s the woman of my dreams. The only thing is I don’t really want to hurt E. She’s a good person who has done nothing to deserve this to happen to her.

I hate my dad and want him to disappear from my life tbh for wrecking my moms heart but my mom INSISTS I go over on the weekends because she wants me to have a relationship with my dad. She is always so sad and I love my mom more than anything in the world, she was always there for me and my sis and I feel like my dad just used her to be a house sitter for him and yeah. I’m just not cool with him. 

He is with the lady he was cheating with and every time we go around she’s there getting jealous and angry that we are around my dad.

When they came back out my sister called the lady a skank to her face cuz she was so mad. His gf burst out crying and my dad told her to leave and spent the day trying to be all nice to us. but since then I just pretend this woman doesn’t exist and told my sister (who is actually really cool and I never saw her that mad before) to follow my lead which we do.

1155,Asshole,"Been dating my GF for the past year and a half. I fell head over heals and she became the center of my universe, as was I to hers. We spent all of our time together and have been inseparable since our love came to be. We enjoy going out together from time to time but for the most part live very quietly and comfortably spending our time with one another doing whatever. 

We recently relocated to a new city and she has acquired a new group of friends through work. They are all single and like to party on both weeknights and weekends. They ask her to go out on a regular basis and she is most definitely a people person who does not like to say no and has fear of missing out with her new coworkers. 

She has not been going out with them ALL the time but I feel like the requests to hang out come up very often. I fear that our valuable quality time together is going to get less and less and that she would prefer to spend her time with them.

She has said things like “you get to have me during the weeknights so let them have me on one night of the weekend”. This is upsetting to me because my job is currently very difficult and don’t really get to enjoy my nights during the week due to stress. I look to the weekends and my time with her as my only kind of relief. I understand a weekend every now and then but I fear that it will be every weekend. 

I feel like a dick for always having a problem each time she asks me if I am okay with her going out but at the same time I feel like my needs are not being completely met anymore. She offers for me to go out with them and occasionally I am up for it but not at the same frequency that she is. I am rather introverted and the idea of going out and getting blackout drunk is no longer as appealing to me as it used to be prior to when I met her. 

I would also like to mention that my GF received a DWI in the early days of our relationship so the constant partying thing is concerning as I fear that she will eventually get another one if she is always spending time with these people. 

I also hung out with her and her new work colleges   recently and got a very bad vibe from one of her new male coworkers. He said things throughout the course of the night such as “does your GF do anal” and out of the blue said “don’t worry about me man I won’t try anything with her” . I was basically black out drunk when these statements were made because I had been trying to keep up with the amount of booze this crowd was drinking. Otherwise I would have beat his brains in. Unfortunately, this dude is always a part of the group that she goes out with and he comes off as very creepy. I trust my GF that I have nothing to worry about on her end. That being said I don’t trust this guy at all and to be totally honest I get very creepy and manipulative kind of vibe from.

1156,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé had braces in high school (he’s in his mid-twenty’s now) and a few months ago he complained of pressure between his upper teeth and thought his wire permanent retainer must have broke. 
I am a dental assistant at a general dental office and took an X-ray and saw that the wire was, in fact, frayed. So, my doctor instructed him to make an appointment with his orthodontist to get it replaced.
It’s really hard for my fiancé to take time off of work but he was finally able to get into the orthodontist and they ended up telling him that it was fine and turned him away. 
Flash forward to now, his teeth have shifted due to the wire being frayed and now has a pretty good sized gap between his front teeth. I think it’s cute but he hates it and we’re getting married next summer and wants it fixed. 
I just called his ortho office and made an appointment and basically said I’d like to schedule an appointment with me there so we can try to make this right. 
My question is, WIBTA if I held my ground and demanded they fix his teeth for free? It’s not their fault the wire broke, but this could have all been avoided if they would have believed him in the first place and replaced his wire before his teeth shifted.

1159,Not the A-hole,"I'm planning to go to my high school's junior prom this year, and I haven't picked out my dress yet. I was planning to just go this weekend and buy a dress less than $200 for the event.

&#x200B;

I don't have many regular female friends that I hang out with, but in class today the topic of prom came up and I was talking to a few classmates about buying a dress. Someone asked me if I had checked the Facebook group, and I told her that it really wasn't a big deal to me if my dress matched with someone else. All the girls were taken aback and shocked that I matching dresses wasn't a big deal to me. They then tried to explain to me how upset someone else would be if I wore the same dress as them to prom, and I really can't wrap my head around it. So what? We're wearing the same style dress, or we're wearing a similar color. Why does everyone else make it a big deal? I even asked them (rhetorically) ""what would the other girl would do, deck me? Cry?"" and to my surprise they answered yes. I can't fathom how materialistic someone has to be to react so seriously to wearing similar clothing.   


I personally just felt that if I liked a dress, and if that dress looked good on me, I should get it. I don't like that fact that I have to change my choices based on other people's choices. The other girls can wear whatever they want, and I can wear whatever I want too, so why is it such a big deal? My classmates also told me that it's ""inconsiderate"" because I'd be ""ruining their night"" or whatever. But seriously? Wearing a similar dress to some other girl is going to ruin her night? That is another level of petty, from my point of view. The only people that I'm making a conscious effort not to copy would be my two close female friends. Other than that, I don't really understand why it would be a big deal to, let's say, a student that I rarely interact with that goes to my school or something.  


Would I be an asshole if I just went out and bought whatever dress I liked, and didn't bother checking the Facebook group (since it wouldn't matter because I would just pick out a dress I liked anyway?) because there are like 150 girls part of that group and I am *seriously* not about wasting an hour to look through all of those dresses.",53,71,0.87

1161,Asshole,"Very complicated post. 

Me right now: I'm 28, have a great job, marrying an amazing guy who is an officer in the Marines. I have a loving stable relationship and my fiancé is everything I could ask for in a guy. Our very small wedding is scheduled for next weekend (May 25th). 

Me six years ago: in a crazy unhealthy relationship with my ex who was addicted to every substance known to man. We were both physically and emotionally abusive. Even though the relationship was terrible, I could not let him go. It was actually his parents who stepped in and ""saved"" me from their son, as such I've always had tremendous respect and love for them. His dad gave me 10 grand and a plane ticket across the country to start a new life while they put him in rehab. I never saw ex again but stayed in touch with his parents from time to time and they came to see me every other year or so. 

I saw on facebook that the dad passed of a heart attack on Sunday. I called Shirly and she said that he walked out to get the morning paper and she found him literally dead in the driveway. He had no warning signs and had just been given a clean bill of health from his doctor. It's an absolute shock. 

I want to go show them the same support they've shown me over the years. I brought this up with my fiancé and while he didn't say no, he just doesn't quite understand why I would want to spend time with the family of my abusive ex-boyfriend. I have tried to explain it just like I did above and he still just doesn't get it and thinks I can send a donation to the specified in-lieu of charity. It's even more complicated because Shirly says my ex will be there and I guess he's still not doing well and this really bothers my fiancé. Fiance is also super stressed because it means most of the last minute wedding stuff will fall on him, he is 100% right about this.  

I can't just see anyway I can't go to the funeral after everything they did for me. Would I be the asshole if I go to spend a few days with them and go to the funeral?",77,31,0.82
1162,Not the A-hole,"Update: Thanks for all the helpful comments, everyone. While I was reading through everybody’s replies and thinking hard on what to do, a possible compromise occurred to me. Husband’s grandmother had a favorite flower that she always grew in her garden, loved to have in vases around the house, etc. You know how old ladies are, LOL. Whenever we come across that flower it reminds him of her and makes him happy. He always associates it with her. And that flower happens to also be a perfectly nice girl’s name, e.g. Lily, Jasmine, Rose, Daisy, etc. So when we both got home yesterday I proposed that we make it our daughter’s middle name. He thought it was a brilliant idea and he was very touched that I had really tried to find a compromise we could both live with. So it’s settled! He’ll still be able to think fondly about his grandma when he hears the name and feel like he’s honoring her memory, but it’s far enough removed from her identity that I don’t feel like we’re naming the baby “after her”. All worked out.
---
My husband and I (32M, 32F) met around 12 years ago and have been together since. His parents were in their early 40s when he was born and sadly they both died in a car accident when he was very young. His grandmother, who was in her mid-70s at the time, took custody of him and raised him, alone (she was widowed). She had some money so she was able to support him comfortably, buy him a decent car, pay for his college, etc. They were very close and he loved her to death.

We met at age 20, when his grandmother was in her mid-90s. At the time, he lived with her and commuted to our college. When we met, she was extremely racist and wouldn’t even allow me inside their house because I’m not white (I’m Latina). She constantly told him not to stay with me because I’m ugly, dirty, would ruin their proud German bloodline, that I couldn’t come inside because I would steal her stuff, etc. It was pretty over-the-top. He was mortified and assured me repeatedly that she wasn’t like this when she was younger and he had no idea where that came from. I don’t think she was ever formally diagnosed with dementia, but he swore that that’s what it was, he didn’t recognize her, she didn’t raise him that way, she used to be extremely welcoming and kind to all, had friends of all races, etc. I know it wasn’t his fault and you can’t reason with dementia, so I never gave him a hard time and just avoided her.

Eventually we moved in together, though he went to her house frequently to help her with stuff. She died a few years ago at age 100. Two years ago, husband and I got married and now we’re expecting a daughter. Husband wants to name her after his beloved grandma. In his eyes, she came out of retirement to raise him and gave him a loving, wonderful life and set him up for success, did everything for him, etc. I get that. He has a lifetime’s worth of reasons to love her. But I don’t want to name my kid after somebody who wouldn’t even let me in their house because of my skin color. Husband says that wasn’t “the real her” and it was just because of dementia, that if she’d been younger when we met she would have loved me. I have no reason not to believe him, but still. The person I met was really awful to me. He thinks I just don’t understand how much she did for him and how good of a person she was before her brain turned to mush. He offered to compromise by using it as a middle name, or using a close variation (Marie vs. Mary, Alice vs. Allison, that type of thing). That misses the point. We’d still be naming the kid after her in spirit, if that makes sense. He sees my point but says I should still ""meet him halfway"". AITA?",260,626,0.94

Although she still has her own place, she spends around 4/7 nights a week at my apartment. She doesn't pay any rent, because we've talked about her fully moving in and we both feel like we're not ready for that level of commitment yet. She does however occasionally buy groceries that we both use and picks up other small things to contribute to the apartment.

However, I still feel like this is my apartment and is still mainly my space instead of a totally shared space. We have this huge argument over whether the toilet seat should be placed down after use. Of course I understand that it's common courtesy to put the toilet seat down after you've used it, but part of me feels like this is still my space and as a guest it's rude to tell someone how to handle their apartment.

Occasionally I'll forget to put the toilet seat down and she sees it as a sign of disrespect and me not wanting to have her in my apartment, when in reality it is more due to absentmindedness. On the other hand, I'm beginning to resent her constantly telling me how I should operate and run my own apartment even though it's seen as ""common courtesy."" I personally don't mind having the toilet seat up, it doesn't bother me.

Me and some friends were returning home from vacation.  It was a VERY long international flight, like 13 hours.  It was a flight that you couldn't reserve your seat online ahead of time, so we purposely got their early so we could request seats with more leg room, or at least things like aisle, window, etc.   I ended up very lucky and got a seat in the front row of my section, so it had much more leg room and was very comfortable.  

Well, as we are waiting to leave, they make an announcement that we are holding for a group who was late, but coming.  This wasn't like they were on a late connecting flight, just got to airport late.  As they are getting on, I see its a family with a baby carrier.  The flight attendant asks me if I'd be willing to switch so they could have more room for the baby.  I ask which seat I'd switch to, and it was a middle seat a few rows back.  So I declined.   

I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, I purposely went early to get that spot.  Even if they were willing to move me to a comparably comfortable seat, I may have been willing to.  But I had no desire to spend 13 hours there.  Had they decided to get there earlier, they could've had a better seat as well.

1169,No A-holes here,"My wife and I got into a little argument the other day for the amount of time I take to take a dump. She thinks I’m just dilly dallying so that I don’t have to spend time helping her with our daughter or chores around the house. 

Well, it is true. I do sit on the toilet doing absolutely nothing after I poop but I don’t do it for the reasons that she thinks. I spend the majority of my day on the road for work (150 miles on avg) 5-7 days a week. I hate taking a dump while on the road and rarely do I ever do it. For some reason civilized humans turn into rabid apes as soon as they walk into a public bathroom. Piss is everywhere and shit is in places that seriously leaves me in awe. 

When I get home to my nice clean bathroom I like to kick back, relax and unleash havoc on my toilet. That usually takes less than a minute or two. Once the damage has been done I like to browse the internet or chime in in group chats because I really can’t do that while on the road. Sometimes I’ll just sit in silence because rarely do I ever get time to myself after the birth of our daughter.

First off I want to make clear that I’m not immediately rushing to the bathroom as soon as I get home. Normally the first few things I do when I walk in the door is kiss my wife and talk to her about her day. Then I’ll sit down to do an activity with my daughter or if its a late day I’ll give her a bath and get her to bed.  THEN I mosey on to the bathroom to decompress.

1170,Not the A-hole,"This all happened last night and seeking judgement and advice.

So I'm in college (22m) and went out to the bars to celebrate the end of school with a group of friends. My good friend (21f) and I ended up getting split from the rest of the group around 1am and went to a different bar. One of the reasons we got split up is because she was really drunk and could barely walk and the rest of the group wanted to meet up with more friends, so I said I'd make sure she got home safe. Well when I was trying to walk her back to her apartment she had to lean on me and hold me the entire time and eventually I just told her to hop on my back and I gave her a piggyback ride.

We were close to her apartment when she insisted we go to the bar close to her apartment. She got off me and started walking in the direction of the bar. Maybe i should have just made her go home, but I followed her into the bar. I told her I was really tired and was going to go home. At this point she seemed barely awake and some dude in his mid forties came over an started to flirt with her and hold her and she seemed to want to go home with him. She's pretty attractive and I got the feeling this dude didn't have great intentions so I then stepped in and grabbed her by the hand and said she was my GF and we were going home. I forcibly led her out of the bar and I basically had to drag her back to her apartment. Well we got back and I made sure she made it into her room and was in bed before I left back to my apartment. I didn't think she would remember any of this but I was kind of pissed at her for her actions.

I got a text from her this morning and she remembered me ""manhandling"" her and she was really disturbed that I thought this kind of behavior was okay. I responded saying if I didn't you would have been hurt or would have passed out in the street because you could barely walk home. I was upset and told her she put me in a bad situation.

1171,Not the A-hole,"I've been with my gf for three years. When we got together she was vegan and ate a pretty normal vegan diet. I'm a ""flexitarian"" in that I'll eat vegan food at home but I have whatever I want when I go out. It just makes life easier living with my gf if there's no animal products at home.

The issue is that in the last six months, she has gotten more and more obsessed with her diet. She's become a 'raw vegan' after watching a bunch of youtube channels that claim only eating raw fruits and vegetables is the most natural way for people to eat.

I'm not down with this way of eating at all. I want to eat some real food. She is spending a shitton of money on organic fruits and veggies. We've always split the grocery bill and it's seriously tripled in the last few months. I can't afford to spend this much money on food and I'm really fucking tired of eating what is essentially the same thing over and over again. Salads, cut up fruit, smoothie bowls, ""noodles"" that are just spiralized veggies, etc. Everything is cold. I constantly want to go out after dinner and get something substantial. 

I started buying my own groceries and told her she can do whatever she wants, but I'm not going to keep eating raw vegan food. It was fine for a little while but I lost like five pounds and I'm just not into it. I want some fucking pasta. 

My GF feels like I've abandoned her and I'm not supporting her ""health journey"". She wasn't so obsessed with food before and diet has never been an issue prior to this. She's lost a lot of weight, I would guess probably 10 pounds on an already slim frame. I don't like it and I want her to gain the weight back.

She's saying if I don't support her in this, it's like I'm encouraging her to be unhealthy. She can't afford a raw diet on her own and feels like I should keep contributing to the raw grocery bill even if I buy my own food.

I was hesitant (my house is small, had reno projects, settling into life with a baby, etc.), but agreed on the condition that they be out ""shortly after the holidays."" ILs agreed. We asked if they would be able to contribute financially, they said no. 

I won't go into all the details, but we had constant issues regarding boundaries, personal space, privacy, etc. We decided to let a lot slide since it was a temp situation. We put on a good front, and counted down the days until 2019.

 ILs did not tell us much about their job/apt searches.  Gave us one word answers when we asked. We offered to help with resumes, applications, apartments, etc., but they declined.

They made multiple comments about their bad financial situation, but they bought a new (2019) car and sold their house (for no profit, because they ""didn’t want to be bothered with the mortgage anymore""). They ate out constantly, at nice sit-down restaurants.

My FIL got a min-wage job. My MIL submitted job apps but was ""being picky"" (her term), and didn't send out any apps for 2+ wks because her computer was broken and she ""didn't think"" to go to the library or ask us if she could use ours.

So early Jan ILs tell us it's been harder for them to find jobs than they thought, they are in a rough spot financially and ask us if they can stay until ""March or the end of April at the latest."" We discussed boundaries. They agreed to make changes, and we agreed to let them stay til April. 

Things did not change. The stress was nearly unbearable but they moved out late April. 

I thought all's well, but on Monday MIL tells H, ""families should be able to count on each other and right now I can't say that I can count on you (meaning H)."" We knew they were struggling financially and were having a hard time finding jobs, yet we made them move out. We should have let them stay with us for as long as they needed, because that's what families do. It's not like they weren't trying.

Now, H feels like he let his mom down. 

AITA for setting deadlines for my ILs to be out the house and sticking to them, regardless of their financial/job situation?

Tldr; agreed to let ILs live with us and insisted they move out by deadline, despite them being in a bad financial situation.",41,145,0.97
1175,Not the A-hole,"This just happened and this exchange happened entirely on Facebook. 

So I'm in a community Facebook group for a small town near me. Earlier today someone posted that there was a missing toddler and asked people to start looking. They got this information from a police scanner so it was happening in real time. This person was in no way affiliated with the family or law enforcement. No description or information was provided and the police hadn't made any type of statement. 

So considering this is a smallish town and people truly care, alot of people were commenting asking for the location and making statements that they were going to head down and help look. Keep in mind, police hadn't asked for help yet, this was about 10 minutes since the police had been dispatched and there was no description of the missing kid. 

I made a comment to the effect of ""maybe people shouldn't head down there until the police have asked for help since random people that show up could hinder things.""

PEOPLE LOST THEIR MINDS! I got alot if rude comments and people calling me ignorant and others wanting me public Shamed. I didn't berate anyone or insult anyone. My thinking was that random people showing up to the early stages of a search could be distracting or could hinder efforts. I know everyones heart was in the right place.

And the kid was found safely about 20 minutes after police arrived. 

So, AITA for commenting that people shouldn't go to an active search for a missing kid until police asked for help?",30,28,0.9
1176,No A-holes here,"A few weeks ago I went to see Endgame for the second time. It had been released 3 days earlier so, naturally, the place was packed. I always get there with enough time because I hate being late - and even then I only made it inside the room a couple minutes before the movie started.

So the place is almost full and I'm on the right corner all alone. Then comes this guy and starts talking to me. Convo went like this: 

- ""Hey, are you alone?""

- ""Yeah, I am"" 

- ""Well, I came here with my friend but the place is full, we couldn't get tickets to sit together so would you mind going to my seat so that I can sit here with him?""

- ""Sure! No problem""

- ""Okay, my seat is that way""

At that point he's pointing to the far left of the room. Meanwhile, the last commercial is playing and the movie is about to start in 10 seconds (I know cause I had already seen the film and I knew it was the very last one). Since I was in the far right this would require me to take my stuff, get out of the room, go that way, check what number/row the ticket is for, go there and sit down. There's absolutely *no way* I can do that in 10 seconds because the room is big, people are still going in and I don't want to miss a thing. So I tell him:

- ""Sorry but the movie is about to start. If you had come here with more time and your seat was nearby then sure, I would move, but it's too late now""

He proceeded to stare at me, complain to his friend that 'I wouldn't move' (said in a disgusting voice as if I was some sort of evil witch or something) and went out of the room so that he could go to his seat. As he was talking to his friend the movie started so by the time he went out and came back in I'm pretty sure he missed two or three lines. And this is slightly unrelated but his friend did sit next to me and spent most of the time on his phone.

1177,Asshole,"Hello guys!

&#x200B;

I know this title makes me look like a massive asshole but please read the full story.

&#x200B;

So basically me and a girl used to hook up every 1 or 2 weeks, it was basically just sex since none of us wanted a relationship.

&#x200B;

Before we were sexually active, we had a chat and we both agreed that none of us wanted kids at the time and even if we did it wouldn't be obviously with each other since we weren't really a match, we just had a sex life and nothing else in common. She guaranteed me she would get an abortion as long as i'd pay half of it.

&#x200B;

Unluckily she ended up getting pregnant, she says she always took the pill but clearly something went wrong so it happened. 

&#x200B;

I'm sure you can see where this is going.

&#x200B;

She changed her mind, she wanted to keep the baby because it could be her only chance of her having babies. I explained I wasn't ready to be a father and I couldn't financially afford to raise a baby. 

I was 19 at the time and I was 6 years younger than her so she kinda understood.

&#x200B;

She said she wanted to keep the baby regardless I was going to support the baby or not, she asked me to move on with my life and to never look back, to go back to Poland and just forget this happened.

&#x200B;

She also didn't want child support because money was never a problem for her and she was making a lot more money than me.

&#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, the baby was born and she messaged me saying she doesn't want her baby to raise without a father, and if I could help her raise the baby.

I explained things haven't changed since we last spoke and I still had no intention of raising a baby, she got really mad because I didn't care for the baby so she changed her mind about child support and she asked me to pay it which I have been paying since obviously it's my legal obligation.

&#x200B;

The thing is I'm going back to Poland and I'm not going to make nearly as much I make here. I will not be able to sustain myself on my own if I keep paying child care so I'm just considering stop paying when I move back.

so tell me Reddit, what's your take on this, WIBTA?",77,36,0.83
1178,Asshole,"I got engaged about six months ago and about three months ago, we set our wedding date after conferring with all our closest family and friends and finding the best date where no one had conflicts. We wanted to leave ourselves time to plan everything with no rush so we gave ourselves more than a year with a date set next spring.

&#x200B;

Last week, my older brother announced he had gotten engaged. Great! Then he texted me to ask if we were planning a honeymoon because he wanted to have his wedding the week after ours. My fiancee is in academia and has to do an insane amount of grading in those few weeks. Adding a multi day out of state trip right then would erase any moment of relaxation directly after our wedding and honestly make the whole time around our wedding more stressful for her dreading that crunch. My fiancee is from a very family-oriented culture. For her not to attend a wedding of a family she just married into would be unthinkable. When I told him that would be really tough for us, for a bunch of reasons he more or less said ""I understand if you can't make it"". We're not the closest family, but I couldn't miss my brother's wedding, even though this will be his second one. And since our family is scattered and our weddings would be in different parts of the country I think doing two in a row would be a real hardship for other family members getting off work, getting their kids out of school etc. My brother's fiancee is starting a new grad program this year which has classes through the summer and he says the only two breaks she gets are Christmas and right after our wedding.

&#x200B;

I'm generally the kind of guy who avoids confrontations. And I hate the idea of telling anyone what to do with their own wedding (Just like I get annoyed at people trying to tell me how to run my wedding). But I kind of think my brother is pulling a really dick move timing his then. And I can't imagine it's the only possible date in a year.

&#x200B;

I feel like I've already told him how difficult it would be for us (Although I left it to other family members to tell him that travelling to both would be difficult for them). Would I be an asshole to press the issue and tell him he's being an asshole with this timing?",47,38,0.88

1180,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have four kids, all grown up. Three of our kids turned out amazing, our fourth has had an extremely troubled past. We definitely bare some of the blame as parents, which is why I am conflicted as to whether this is justified.

For sake of clarity I'll refer to the son in question as John. We found out John was smoking cannabis when he was 13, we don't know when he actually started. A few years after that he went on to start using crystal meth. Ever since he started using meth his problems, and the problems he causes for those close to him, are never ending and they only get worse.

We've tried to help him countless times. We really have. But every attempt as been met with resistance, or with him pretending to want help in order to get money. He steals from us and his siblings for drug money. Everything he does is to get his next fix, and he long since stopped giving a toss about  us and his siblings.

The straw that broke the camels back happened last week. He stole my father's service medals and (presumably) pawned them off for drug money. We don't know where he is (a recurring theme) and have no way of contacting him. Those medals are presumably long gone.

At this point I have just given up. He's not the kid I once knew, he hasn't been in a long time. I honestly want nothing to do with him at this point because all he does his steal and manipulate those that try to help him.

I have given up on him and have cut him out of my life for good. I am asking whether I'm the ""asshole"" because as his parent I clearly fucked up somewhere and set him on this path. Kids don't just become drug addicts for no reason. But at this point I feel there's nothing I can do to correct past mistakes and everyone's better off without him in our lives.",129,539,0.97
1181,Asshole,"I have a friend, let’s call him Jack. I have known Jack close to 18 years since we were in Elementary school and we have been great friends ever since. Jack hasn’t had an easy life, his mother wasn’t the best role model growing up (drugs, bad with money, frequent moving, depression issues), he has had physical abuse from a distant family member, and has never really had any stability/consistency in his life. Jack is also gay and has had hurdles to overcome emotionally there as well throughout high school. Because of all this, Jack has a fairly jaded cynical personality and will quickly judge others based on short interactions with them and will cut them out of his life quickly if they do something he deems inexcusable. An example of this would be, they have to reschedule a date or say something small that he doesn’t like and he won’t talk to them again.

Now with that as backstory here is where I feel like I may have been an asshole. We and another close friend went to dinner and were chatting and Jack asked as a joke “Would you guys date me?” (He had mayo on his face) and I said dead panned (half joking, half not): “You have too much emotional baggage to be dateable...” He obviously was not expecting a real answer. I then explained to him how he dismisses people too quickly and he hasn’t had a healthy relationship yet because of his past trauma and needs to work through those first.

He recently started seeing a therapist and mentioned what I said. The therapist looked at him funny and asked “He is your good friend?” 

So that made me think I’m probably the asshole but wanted input.
So, AITA?

EDIT: Just to clarify, I've always suggested therapy to him but I was not the direct cause for him to go. I also accept I'm basically the asshole here and could have phrased it better or done it in a better context. But it did come from love for wanting to see my friend happy.",112,437,0.94
1182,Asshole,"I (37M) have been married to my wife (34F) for 10 years. We have three children at the ages of 7, 5, and 2. She was a teacher before our first child but then chose to be a SAHM (something she's always wanted to do). Once all of the children are in school, she intended to go back into teaching. However, recently she has decided that she wants to go back to grad school to become a professor, meaning she wants to get her PhD. This would likely be a couple of years down the road, but I'm not particularly keen on her plan, and for several reasons:

1. In her field, professors only make $10-15k more per year than teachers do, so the ROI is minimal. (The cost of the PhD over four years is certainly in excess of $150k).
2. If she wanted to do a fully-funded PhD, then she would be spending countless hours per week studying and working in a fellowship, which would make raising children extremely difficult. She knows this and is therefore not interested in this route.
3. I make $350k a year, so the long-run benefit of that additional schooling is marginal. It would take a decade, at minimum, to recoup the costs of her grad school. Add in the additional costs of daycare, and I'm not sure if we'll ever make our money back.

I realize that this is a goal of hers but it seems fruitless, other than for her to have a PhD next to her name. I told her that once our kids have graduated from college and we've covered those costs, I'd be happy to invest into her schooling. She seems less than enthused, as she would be in her mid 50's at that point.

I'm trying to sympathize with her goals, but with how young our children our, the cost of education, and the cost of schooling... it just doesn't make sense. If she wants to continue to be a SAHM or go back into teaching, then more power to her--whichever she chooses. But I can't in good faith spend ten's of thousands of dollars per year when it will detract from her ability to be a mother and my ability to pay for our household.",491,189,0.81
1183,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys, first time poster, long-time lurker. Sorry about formatting, this is my first reddit post and I’m on my phone.

I was out with my girlfriend and her family at a baseball park in my state. I never told anyone we were going, no one from my friend group nor family knew we would be there. When I arrive, I get a text from Mom:

“Hey are you at (Baseball Park)?”

I responded with a generic “yes” response but after thinking about it, I became really creeped out. I know that my phone is tracked by my parents, we use it to check on each other during flights and stuff. But why would she be looking on a random day, at a random time, when nothing was going on?

So the next day, I responded,

“Hey Mom, I know we have tracking on our phones, but it really weirded me out that you texted me where I was. It made me feel uncomfortable, like you were watching over my shoulder. I don’t want to be rude, and I don’t want to be disrespectful, but please don’t do that, it makes me feel creeped out.”

She took exception to that. Basically, her response boiled down to:

“I paid for the phone and the plan on it, I can do whatever I want. Mail me back the phone I paid for.”

Am I the asshole by telling my mom that she made me feel uncomfortable? 

Would I be the asshole if I did just what she wanted, and then proceeded to get my own phone and plan? I’m not living with my parents anymore, and I can definitely afford it. But they helped to pay for my college, and I feel really guilty.

Recently after we announced our pregnancy they wanted to make a customer rocking chair for us, great!

Well they know best apparently and just dropped it off at our house, this thing is huge, they had to take the hinges off our front door and the nursery door just to get it in and they chipped the wall. Her Grandpa wants her to rearrange the nursery to better accommodate it, well they want us too, they left after dropping it off and only put the front door back on. This bassinet is hard wood, corners are sharp, there is a loose custom made cushion that the baby is supposed to sleep on, to stop it from rocking too far to one side they gave us 2 little stoppers to put under it, I'm over 6 feet tall this comes up above my belly button while I'm wearing boots, it can hold my 95lbs dog comfortably.

So, I work in a restaurant. I would like to think I’m a pretty hard worker who helps out everyone no matter the circumstances. I’ve been in management as well, so I understand how to deal with customers and coworkers alike.

Yesterday, I had a table of 5. The ladies were extremely nice, but they required a bit more attention than a typical table. I wasn’t worried about accommodating them since they were very pleasant despite their constant requests. Two of the ladies sent their food back because it wasn’t what they were expecting. When their new orders came out, a different server ran the food. Up until this point, I was the only server to touch the table. 

When I returned to check on them, they were pissed. They said the other server had an attitude and threw their food at them. I didn’t see anything, but I got the manager who then spoke to them. After speaking with her about it in the back, she came out laughing which angered my table even more. They were so pissed that they didn’t want to finish their food and that prompted them to demand to speak to the GM. She continued to laugh while all of this was happening. He comped all of their food and as a result, they didn’t leave me a tip. 

Obviously, that pissed me off because I wasn’t the one who antagonized them and I worked extremely hard to make sure they were taken care of. They told my GM that I did a great job and them still not tipping is a different issue. However, I’d like to think that they would have if things did not go awry. After they left, another server asked why was she laughing. Her words were, “I thought it was a funny situation.” She kept saying she didn’t care and didn’t say anything to me until she left. I spent the rest of the day silently seething. Now, I’m not really the type to hold grudges. After I told my manager why it pissed me off, I went home and let it go. However, the fact that I lost money because of it makes me not want to talk to her.

Today, I‘m doing my usual thing. I ran some of her food, bussed down a couple of her tables when I had time. I’m just not interested in talking to her until she apologizes to me. One of my coworkers asked why I haven’t said anything to her, and I remained silent about it. I don’t want to add more fuel by talking shit behind her back. A mutual friend/coworker said that I’m being petty and that I should just talk to her, but I’m confused since I didn’t do anything wrong.

1188,Not the A-hole,"The other day my roommate (30f) stopped me in the hallway and asked if her mother, sister, and 4 mo old nephew could stay in our apartment for 5 days. 

I gave it to her straight and told her that I was uncomfortable with a small child staying at our apartment for days at a time given that I share a wall with her and that they're visiting from the UK (the baby could be up and crying at weird times) and that she should send the request out in the group apartment text to see what the other two guys think (there are 4 of us in the apartment). Instead, she sent a text telling us this was happening and hoped that ""this wouldn't be a problem"". I responded telling her that I wasn't okay with it and after talking with my other roommates we agreed that it made us uncomfortable (note that she shares a bathroom with one other person in the apartment).

We live in NYC and while our apartment is big by our NY standards, it's definitely not big or well equipped enough to deal with two extra bodies and a child living there for a week. On top of this she's had friends from home staying at our place every week since the end of February. I'm sick of playing hotel for them but I've put up with it because she's new to the country and apartment but I draw the line at having a jet lagged baby sleeping in the next room. The rest of us are in our mid 20s and only know each other as roommates. Our place is pretty quiet on the weekdays and weekends because we work ridiculous hours.

We agreed on the group text that her and I would have a conversation that night. 

She doubled down about being homesick and started crying telling me that I was being cruel to not let a baby sleep in the apartment and asked me to justify my reasoning. I didn't feel I needed to past saying ""it makes me uncomfortable"" but I expressed my concerns to her about the baby crying and being jet lagged to which she responded ""oh don't worry he's a quiet baby"".

Now I'm not a baby hater by any stretch of the imagination, but this seemed fucking ridiculous to me. This baby will be out of its element in a new place far from home  with strange people and stimuli. There will definitely be some crying and immediately my mind flashed to me not being able to fall asleep and being tired for work the next morning. She pushed for 15 minutes for me to justify my viewpoint and I finally snapped and said ""there is no version of this conversation that we can have where I'm comfortable with a baby spending even one night in this apartment."" She replied that if I was entitled to shut her down she was entitled to do the same and that she might just do it anyway. I told her ""don't do that"" she replied ""don't tell me what to do"". I told her to continue this conversation with the other two roommates and that it wasn't fruitful to continue talking because there is no compromise I can come to where I'm comfortable with a baby and two grown women being in my apartment for almost a week.

1189,Not the A-hole,"Six years ago I was at a friend's place for a party. It was a BYOB kind of affair. Basically it was a bunch of early 20-somethings just hanging around and drinking on the host's living room floor. It's kind of stupid in retrospect. I brought a bottle of scotch with me and that's all I was drinking throughout the night.

I guess I went a little overboard so my friend decided to hide my bottle on me. He hid it in a basket used for dog toys (my friend didn't have a dog anymore and it was kept in their living room as memory). That's the end of the context.

Now six years later, my friend moved out of his parents house but his sister still lived there. His sister had a baby two years ago and I guess at the toddler stage she's exploring the house and comes upon this basket of dog toys.

I have two children of my own and they very much enjoy ""Dad's Famous Mac and Cheese"" (it's super basic.. they're just easily impressed).  It's a guaranteed meal to be made each week and is one of the few they'll actually fill up on as finicky eating has been a life long issue for both (actively working to improve this, but that's beside the point).  Most of our current diet is dairy laden, but transitioning from that isn't impossible.  If I were to tell my sons that mac and cheese is off the table, however, they'd probably be distraught.

When we have meals with GF and her son, I have no issue making lactose free meals.  We've started keeping lactose free alternatives stocked up as they have been over frequently enough, recently, to justify doing so.

1194,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend (21F) and I (22M) have been dating for two years now. About a year into our relationship, my ex-girlfriend tried to re-enter my life. She sent me some emotional texts but that was about it— she didn't try to hit on me or anything. Obviously I turned her down but my girlfriend was pretty upset. 

My girlfriend is also involved in a lot of feminist causes. She's volunteers at a domestic abuse center and she also mentors elementary school girls. She shares many social media posts championing women. I respect her for this and I truly believe she cares about the survivors and children she works with. 

However, my girlfriend has gotten into a habit of referring to my ex derogatory names, like whore, slut, etc. For example, ""I saw that slut at X's birthday party last night."" Her friends do this as well. They go to the same school and she also talks about my ex more than is necessary so this happens on a fairly frequent basis. I will say that she is always nice and civil towards my ex when she sees her. 

Last night when she was doing this, I just got annoyed and questioned whether she was really a feminist when she constantly refers to my ex in very misogynistic terms. She said that she's allowed to be upset about some girl hitting on her boyfriend and that it's not like she says this stuff to my ex's face. She also said she doesn't call anyone else by these names, which admittedly is true. We got into a fight about me ""defending my ex"" which I don't think is true, I was just pointing out her hypocrisy, and she was in a bad mood for the rest of the night.

1195,Asshole,"So my gf and I have been together for almost two years (tomorrow is our anniversary). I took it off from work specifically to spend it with her and have been saving tips from my job to buy her something nice. We don’t make a lot and we are tight on money right now, so I hadn’t made any plans. We have a 16 month old baby together and she has been on an app that pairs you with other moms with babies to make play dates, which is great for her. It gets her out of the house, she meets some other moms, perfect. 

So this morning she texts me while I’m at work asking if we have plans for tomorrow. I tell her not at the moment why? She wants to set up a play date with another mom tomorrow. I remind her that it’s our anniversary and she can’t honestly be thinking about spending it with someone else. Her argument is she doesn’t just want to sit around the house on our day. I think it’s rude to ask to spend a day with someone else rather than the person you’re celebrating your relationship with. It seems selfish to me but she doesn’t seem to understand why I’m so upset.

It was no big deal because I have 4 boys and one more did not make a difference.  This summer she called and asked if I would take both of her kids for a week.

1201,No A-holes here,"So basically the title says it all. But my wife has played a couple different games on her phone and usually they are puzzle games where you get so far and then they don't let you proceed unless you wait or pay for ""gems"" or whatever.

So I have brought it up to her before that I think it's a scam and a waste of money to be spending money on these items that are basically just throwing away money it my eyes. Don't get me wrong we can afford it, but I am anti micro-transactions because of what games have done like Star wars battlefront from EA. I go out of my way to not spend money on useless items that maybe I will enjoy but I realize it's just throwing away money so I don't. Such as weapon skins or buying characters for games like Rainbow Six Siege with real money.

**(Edit: I do not spend money on micro transactions at all. People are getting confused thinking I spent money on Star wars. I was giving that as an example as something I do not spend money on that I think is wasteful.)**

&#x200B;

Usually when I have brought it up she gets irritable because her argument is we can afford it and she works too so what difference does it make if she wants to spend money on it. Which I understand, she works as well. However I didn't think she would spend too much money on the game.

So I get an email every time she spends money on the game because we are using my paypal. I looked at our account history and she has spend $30 on the game just this month. Which to me is insane. If she continues on this track she will have spent $60 on useless currency for a mobile game. I could buy an entire game or several on pretty much any platform including mobile for less than that and never spend money on it again.

I am considering bringing it up, but I don't want to be the asshole.. Should I not let it bother me? am I being unreasonable?

&#x200B;

**(Edit: So here's the consensus. I am an asshole for being controlling on what she spends money on. I agree. that's wrong and I shouldn't do anything like that. Being concerned about finances and overspending is reasonable though so I will probably propose a budget and we can discuss what's fair. and She will perhaps have a happy medium or another idea.

Background: 18 months ago I started working as an intern at a company. During that time, my supervisor was a complete no-show. He cancelled meetings with me, delegated review of my work, and eventually moved to a different department without bothering to write an intern review. 

That's where my mentor, let's call her J, came in. J was a teammate of my supervisor and voluntarily setup time to review my work, give me feedback, and even submitted a final review to management. I guess it was a good review because I got hired full time a year ago to work on the same team with J.

Starting a few months back, our supervisor has been coming to work less and less. (Sounds familiar, right?) As a result, the even-higher-ups started requesting that J take over leading the team while they ""handle the situation."" Six weeks later, our team's productivity has gone up, our whole team is happy, higher-ups are happy, and they announce that they're looking to hire someone new to run the team. 

I've only heard secondhand what happened next, but basically J asked if she could have the title and salary of the position since she had been doing it now for months. Higher-ups told her they would be hiring a new guy starting in March instead, but they still wanted her to stay on and run things for another  6-12 months while he got up to speed. J gave them her two week's notice on the spot, and higher ups were *livid*. Publicly livid, going so far as to call her an ""emotional woman"" and vowing to call up her new company to make sure they ""know about her insubordinate attitude""

**Here's where being a potential asshole comes in.** In our department, it's tradition to buy someone a goodbye card before they leave the company. The card is left on a table in public view for people to sign over a week or so. Nobody signed J's card. J was pretty unhappy and even *asked* me if I would go sign her card.  The thing is, she already knows how positively I feel about her mentorship and didn't see why I needed to put my name down on a goodbye card for my superiors to see. Also it seems kind of weird to me that someone would ask someone else to sign their goodbye card....But anyway, on J's last day, a higher-up personally delivered the empty card to J in front of everyone, wished her good luck, and walked off.  said her goodbyes, and I haven't been able to get in touch with her since.

Anyway, he moves in and it's been a few weeks and I've noticed the roommates 8 pets (cats, dogs, chickens etc) are all scratching in a way that I know means fleas (I work with animals, I don't even need to search a pet at times because their behaviour gives it away).

I mentioned again to him that his pets have fleas, and given their current health have probably also got worms. I get the same spiel about how they were only done last month, but they're probably due again now.

So we are going on a family holiday next week. It’s not a fancy abroad holiday but it’s a little family friendly resort and as we all have kids it’s a great place to go. We’ve been going on these holidays when we were kids and now we all go together with our kids. 

My sister has been struggling financially due to the split up between her and her boyfriend. She really wants to go and she said this over the weekend when we saw each-other that she won’t be able to afford it. She was so upset. 

So when me and my partner were home we spoke about it, and we were willing to pay for the holiday for her and she can pay us back when she can. I couldn’t ring her because it wasn’t a good time for me, but I sent her a Facebook message. She’s online a lot so I knew she would see it and it would give her time to think about it without putting her on the spot if we asked in person.

She saw my message.. and I didn’t hear one word from her. So I took that as her not wanting to accept our money. Fine by me. I asked on Monday and it is now Wednesday and I haven’t heard one word. So now me and partner have decided to use the money for something else. (New monitor for his gaming)

Now, if she decides to reply to me and accepts the offer, am I the asshole for having to say no? I feel like the asshole, as I haven’t told her I’ve taken back the offer I’ve just spent our money on other things. So if she does want us to pay for her, that can’t happen any more.

I have this one friend, who is fully Christian. I dont mind this, truly I do not. However, all she talks about is god, and it gets pretty annoying. She contradicts herself a lot, with the things she says.

She will pull out her mini bible, at random and will just start reading. We were in a others friends car driving home from the beach, when she just randomly pulled it out and preached to us. Once, the top I was wearing had a bit of cleavage, because generally I just dont care. It is just skin. Plus, I'm not too attractive so trust me no one is looking. She asked me if I was wearing a bra, and scowled at me with a disgusted look. 

I don't mind this occassionally, her reading, but it kills the mood, and gets really annoying. I dont want to try and suppress her religion, or put it down. I also do not want to start anything, and am awkward. We aren't even that good friends.

I also want you to know, I too believe in god, and regularly pray to him. I do not believe in the bible, because it was not written by god, but instead man.

1213,Asshole,"A couple of months ago I woke up with excruciating pain that had me screaming and writhing on the floor. My wife took me to the emergency room and they found an 8mm (0.315 inch) kidney stone. This stone was entirely too large for me to pass on my own so I needed outpatient surgery to remove it.

I get the total bill a couple of weeks later and it is over $22,000. My insurance covered none of this because at the time I needed 300 work hours for it to kick in and I only had 156 hours. I already know that it is going to be basically impossible to pay this because I can barely pay my rent as it is. Bankruptcy is not an option because I already went bankrupt 3 years ago in a similar situation over a 13mm (0.512 inch) kidney stone.

So am I the asshole in this situation for saying to myself that there is absolutely no chance that hospital is getting paid by me? I hate that I'm not able to pay them. Every single person involved in my care was highly professional and they deserve to be paid well for the work they did.

However it's a fucking fantasy that money is going to come from me. I would be ecstatic if I only had to pay $10/month in taxes for healthcare like some countries have managed to do. I would gladly write the check each month to the treasury if it were an option.

Edit: Thank you everyone for their responses. I'm going to attempt to do the right thing and contact the hospital to see what my options are. I want to see the everyone at the hospital get paid but I honestly cannot see how that can happen. I will at least make a good faith effort to reach out and talk to them.

And to everyone saying I need to change my diet and drink more water to prevent these stones, fuck you. I hydrate just fine. I have a family history of kidney stones so there is a genetic factor in why I get these. Though to be fair I haven't been able to get a personalized diet or have my stones analyzed because that costs money I do not have. The ER doctor did tell me however that the cause for 90% of kidney stones is not known.

It is a good idea overall to drink more water though so in that light I appreciate the suggestion.

Before the trip, she told me on the phone that she doesn't really have any electronics aside from her phone, so she does literally everything old-school (walking to the bank, snail mail, pre-netflix tv). So I got the idea of fixing up the old laptop in order to give it to her as a present since I didn't sell it yet, which she was happy to hear about. I still needed the money, but considering how much my mom's done for me over the years, a \~$200 craigslist sale didn't mean anything.

I told my step-mom what I was planning on doing with the laptop after all, and she got mad over text, telling me why I didn't want to give it to my little brother in the first place. I told her that I never stated I would give it to him, and she told me that I should've said **no** in the first place. Apparently she was telling her kids that they'd be getting a new laptop.

After a bit of arguing I let her know that my decision was final, and I took the laptop with me across the country to give to my mom, albeit feeling like shit. However, after seeing my mom learn how to bank and watch movies on it, I couldn't help but feel like she wanted a computer but never got to acquiring one cause of money. It really balanced out the feeling like shit part.

AITA?

I swear I'm not validation seeking (after seeing the unanimous judgments below). There's been instances where I've been a clear-as-day asshole to my step-mom, and didn't know about this particular situation, especially since it involved my brother. Seeing it now it's clear as day that she shot herself in the foot when telling the kids about the laptop and took it out on me, but I initially thought that in not giving a clear answer, I led her and my brother on to the idea of getting a laptop.",48,255,0.95
1228,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: My boyfriend and I were dating 2 years before moving in together. He is younger than me (29m) and him (23m). Before we moved in together, he was living at home and had not lived by himself before. His mom was doing his laundry, cleaning the house and doing the dishes. He said before we moved into together that I shouldn't expect him to clean, since he didn't have to at home and never had to before. This was a red flag but I reluctantly agreed (I actually enjoy cleaning while living alone).

We have been living together 1.5 years now and I have done all the cleaning, dishes and laundry as agreed. He normally doesn't say thank you and often complains if I don't do it how he wants it or often enough. I've had enough now and changed my mind that it's okay for him not to contribute in this way. 

If he was grateful and nice about it, I would continue, but not only do I have to do all the cleaning, he isn't even nice about it to me. I beg him to help out now or at least say and thank you, and he always says we agreed before we moved in together that he wouldn't have to clean. I know I agreed and enabled him but people and situations change. Just because we agreed 1.5 years ago, now am I stuck forever? This has actually become a deal breaker for me and I am willing to break up over it or at least not live together anymore. It's not the cleaning, it's the lack of gratitude or respect. 

He says I am the ass because I knew and agreed to it and am the one changing what we agreed to (I created the situation). I say he's the ass because even though I agreed and knew what I was signing up for, there is basic decency and respect and he's not showing it. He said I have to accept it and I said I won't accept it and can't live like this anymore.

This story is about my wife’s parent and their ""retirement plan”.

A key detail: For years her parents have been pressuring us to buy a house with extra rooms. I didn’t know why until not too long ago.

So last year my wife explained to me that her parents were retiring early to enjoy life (they’re around 50). They sold their house and most of their belongings. Decided to spend their summers at the camper. So far so good.

But here’s the kicker xD - The basis of their plan is that they plan on living with their kids for the rest of the year where the camping grounds are closed. The grounds close in September so this means they need somewhere to go for the remaining 8 months of the year. Now I should mention that they only have 2 children; my wife and her sister. This is their plan…until they die. All their money is going to seeing the world and camping – nothing else. If they ever get sick and can’t travel anymore? You got it, its now your responsibility cause they’ll have no money for a special care home or nurse by then.

I told her that I’m not ok with this. We have a child and I’m looking forward to the day when we are done raising him and get to do the things we want. To me, living with her parents, seeing them every day, at every meal, watching tv with us…. Is a fuckin NIGHTMARE scenario. I do like them so that’s not the issue. I just don’t want to be burdened by an older couple that I would essentially be responsible to feed and house.

Thankfully, my wife totally agreed that it’s a garbage idea. We have our own life to live. They don’t show it much, but I can tell they are offended and feel rejected. But honestly, this is a take/take situation and when I get to be that age, I won’t have the luxury of living off my kid and I certainly would feel like a POS if I expected that of him. And no, you're not going to mooch off of me when I'll probably have to work till I'm 75.

So my question to you is; am I an asshole? I feel like if I’m going to work my ass off, I want to enjoy my free time. I don’t want to take care of an older couple that decided they should just quit their responsibilities and pawn them off on their kids who are just starting their married lives. The sister is ok with this and they spent all of winter/spring there but not without issues.

Personally, I feel this is a gross entitlement. Seriously… of course I would take care of my parents if they fell ill or on hard times…. who just decides to live off other people just because?",28,66,0.94

1237,Asshole,"When I got home from work today, I decided to treat myself and order pizza for dinner tonight.  There was a nice deal for a pizza, side and 2-liter, and with the tax and delivery fee, the total came to $24.29.

I've ordered from this company several times before, and in spite of the fact that the store is less than a mile away, it almost always takes at least an hour for the food to actually arrive.  I generally don't mind because it's still reasonably warm and is within the time frame for me to eat dinner, but the delay is definitely noticeable.

Anyway, I was paying by card, and there was an option to tip the deliver person, so I figured I'd go ahead and round the bill up to $25.00.  The deliver person (male, 20-24ish) arrived approximately an hour and twenty minutes after I received my order confirmation, and handed everything over.  However, after I said thanks and went to shut the door, he mumbled something, put my receipt on the pizza box, and then put three quarters on the box before turning and walking away.

I couldn't hear what he had said, and my initial reaction was to think that they had somehow overcharged my card on accident.  But after a few seconds, I realized that he was essentially rejecting my tip.  

AITA?  It wasn't a ton of money, but I didn't think it was offensively small (like a few pennies), especially when I had no obligation to tip in the first place.",207,37,0.65

Then he promptly said “wow I’ve never been with two seniors at once before” and began laughing. I left the area, obviously uncomfortable with this comment and reported it the next day to the head of the school.

1240,,"I often walk my dog around the same times in the afternoon and the evening. Almost every day for the past 2 or so weeks, there’s a strange car from \~8:00PM to 12:00AM (my neighbor Matt works graveyard shift). I don’t really think anything of it (because who really concerns themselves about a neighbor’s car), but like an hour and a half ago, I saw Matt’s fiancé talking to some dude. They didn’t really notice me (or if they did, they didn’t care) as I was walking my dog, but I distinctively heard her say “bye sweetie” and gave him a kiss. 

Well I fucking despise cheaters so I loitered for a bit until they went inside and then I took a picture of the car and texted a picture to Matt. I said and I quote

>hey dude, sorry to bother you, but there’s this car that’s been here every day and I saw some dude kissing your girl. Just thought you should know, sorry if I’m intruding or anything. Hope im just overreacting

He didn’t say anything yet (I sent it 7 minutes ago) but I’m playing the situation in my head and wanted to ask Reddit if I was an ass for sticking my nose into their business.

Edit: He responded saying ""Are you sure she wasn't hanging out with a girl"". Apparently she was supposed to be hanging out with her girl-friend. I said I'm 80% sure because they have short hair (It was night time, after all) but I KNOW I did see her kiss and say bye babe. I have to go to bed at 11 but I'll try to update as I can until then.

**Huge update:** She came to my door (I have a sill that opens up) and she starts screaming at me to mind my own business and why would I be so cruel to her and I don't even know her and why would I try to ruin her marriage and what I did she ever do to me. I said I'm sorry; I just don't like cheaters, and if she does not leave now, I will call the police. She said ""let them come"" and that she was going to call them for ""harassing"" her and to go fuck myself and I'm a piece of shit for trying to destroy her life for nothing. I start recording her on snapchat and putting it on my story laughing (okay I might be TA now) as she's tantrumming and crying and screaming. She said ""she'll be back soon"" and left. Now I'm glad I told him so he can get away from batshit insanity.

**LAST UPDATE: PLEASE READ**. 

So I’m going to leave this up as a lesson as myself and to others. I acted like a HOOMUNGUS douche-cannoe and I deserve to be shamed. 

Apparently his question was supposed to be literal. She was supposed to be hanging out with a actual girlfriend; apparently she’s bi and he’s straight and they both could have girlfriends. He expressed reservations in the past because he didn’t want her to sleep with another guy and she assured him that she’s completely okay with girls. That’s why he was asking “am I sure she wasn’t hanging out with a girl”. So when I said 80%, that really pissed him off, and he called her and told her off. 

They had a huge fight and after they hung up, she came to me and told me off. That’s when I started laughing at her and recording. She was pissed off and humiliated and she left, and shortly returned with the “guy” I saw which was a pretty, butch-looking girl with short hair. Soon afterwards, a police officer came and she said I was stalking and harassing her. 

She told him about the photos and the videos and the snapchat story and he asked to see my phone. I told him no, I know my rights, but he said if I didn’t, he was going to make this a lot bigger of a deal than it has to be so I eventually caved. He did see all my pictures (the 5 or so of her car, a couple I tried to get a glimpse in her window, and the videos I had of her crying). He asked me what the fuck I thought I was doing, and I tried to explain my side of the story. He wrote up a report and went to go talk to her and that was a couple minutes ago. I’m scared shitless that they can press charges and IDK what happens from here.

Just wanted to share this and somebody can learn from this experience. It’s getting late and I don’t feel like Redditing so maybe I’ll come back to this tomorrow.",461,1034,0.91
1241,Not the A-hole,"I (19M) live at home with my mom (50F) and step-dad (49M).

They're both serious green thumbs and so is my biological father (56M) who absolutely love to mess around in the garden all day. Gardening in particular is my mom's favorite hobby.

I'm the complete opposite of all 3 of them. I absolutely LOATHE yardwork. It actively makes me angry when I'm forced to do it.

We used to live with a family friend and the whole time we were there she complained about not being able to garden and when searching for a house would always say ""Wouldn't it be great to have a yard of our own?"" I would always be dismissive and say I don't like yardwork to which she always responded I was just lazy and will change my mind.

I'm on the lease of this new house with them. I work and pay rent for myself ($300 a month). I pay for my phone and theirs as well as the house's internet. I also keep their beater car running.


As soon as we got here she was out in the yard from day one and is every day I come home from work. And every day she wants me to come out and help her plant and shit.

Now when I come home from work I just want to relax and play games with my friends. Not be out in the yard till 10pm every night and on my days off doing things I hate doing.
But she has other plans, she thinks I should be out there with them at all times.

Today I finally lost it, I came home after a particularly stressful day and my mom was already on me about helping her rake. I did a bit of it and said my step-dad could do the rest when he could get home. The conversation basically went like this.

Me: ""I'm done.""
Her: ""No you're not.""
Me: ""Yes, I am.""
I admittedly tossed the rake down like an angry child. But I had a long day and just wanted to relax.

She told my step-dad about it and was expecting him to come home and tell me to get out there. Thankfully he's indifferent and thinks I shouldn't be forced to do something I don't like when I do a lot of other things for the household.

My mom doesn't see it that way. No matter how many times I say I hate it she continues to insist I'm just being lazy.

She came into my room after she realized I wasn't gonna be punished by him and said I need to help out more and I act like I don't care about the yard. So I said she was right. I don't. I couldn't give less of a fuck about the yard.

So she went off crying to her room and now I'm expecting my step-dad to be angry. I told one of my friends about it and he thinks I'm acting childish and should just help.

On the way home (mind you I was still coming off the meds, in pain, and very confused about where my teeth had gone) he pulled out of the lot and misjudged the timing and just barely tapped another truck. No damage on either end but he did get a ticket and needs to take defensive driving. Today he was lecturing me about his financial situation, reminded me of that incident and what it cost him, and said that I was ignorant and rude for not even offering to help pay for it since it happened while he was helping me. I don't agree but I gave him money to avoid being called an asshole. Opinions?

Edit: yes, the accident was 100% his fault and I had no cause in it. No question there. I'm just not sure if I, his appreciative girlfriend, should have at least OFFERED to help him out. I had the same thought process, you break it you buy it.",125,434,0.96

1244,Not the A-hole,"I (M24) have been dating my girlfriend (F22) for over a year now. I am working full time and earn roughly $60k per year and she is still in college. We wanted to travel domestically for a long weekend to see a new area of the country. Once it came time to purchase flights, she started to just... wait. I had my laptop open and ready to buy my flight and she was still browsing. I told her that we should both get ours ASAP so prices don't go up. This is roughly how the conversation went:

Her: ""Aren't you going to buy the tickets?""

Me: ""\*Pauses\*... wait what?""

Her: ""I mean I don't have a lot of money right now.""

Me: ""If you're in a tough spot financially we don't have to go. We can wait.""

Her: ""I don't meant to be rude, but you have the money to cover us. If you pay for the plane ticket I can do more while we're there.""

That's when I started to get pissed. I come from a family where asking for someone else to buy you something--especially something that isn't cheap (tickets were like $300 round-trip each)--is just disrespectful. I told her that I would not buy both of our tickets because I don't have the money for that. And that's the truth, from my perspective. I put a lot of money into savings, 401(k), good health insurance, etc., so an extra $300 is a good chunk of change. That's more than I typically spend on entertainment for myself in a month. So when she said that I could afford it, she basically meant that I could be less conservative with my money and pay for instead of saving my money like I always do.

And I was serious about waiting. She graduates in about a year and I'd be more than happy to go then if she's more financially stable.

He also threw an entire temper tantrum because I didn't tell him it was my 18th birthday and then said I didn't want to go out with him (he does this to all female employees). He also has REPEATEDLY walked in on both me and the other females changing. On top of all this he CONSTANTLY does what ever he can to annoy and pester the bosses. All the info I have is he has kept his job because our old boss is was his friend and our new boss doesn't want bad PR of firing someone who has something slightly wrong with him mentally. I and MANY others have repeatedly told him to stop and that we are uncomfortable and we've gone to HR but they keep just giving him warnings/write ups.

1247,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone,

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 18 months and we've had our ups and downs.
She comes from a bit of money AKA the middle class and is a bit of a daddy's girl.

Her and her family go on about half a dozen vacations a year and honestly I'm all for it but for the most part it costs me an arm and a leg.

I come from complete poverty working since I was 17 and have 2k in savings literally all I have.
Her family has been planning going on a cruise for her sister's high school graduation since we started dating and about 6 months into our relationship she invited me to go.

We discussed it and it sounded like the room and drink package for us would be about 2.6k.
Now her dad is officially planning and he says since they filled up so fast just the room for us will be about 3900.

I've had about 5 vacations my entire life and yeah it sounds fun but I can live without going on a boat.
Not to mention the plane costs, food, walking around money.
There is so much I could do with the 5-6k this 3 week trip would cost, maybe a ring for example, so I told her even if I could save up another 4 grand I don't wanna go.

She threw such a fit. (She's a crier) and keep pestering me about trying to make this work.
I decided to be brutally honest about how I feel and told her she's not welcome to stay her tonight.
I'm mentally exhausted from thinking about all this.

My main argument is she can go with HER family and have a blast but I'm more comfortable saving money and staying at home.

Am I the asshole in this situation?
I feel anytime we fight she cries and I bend toward her will to keep her happy because she is good to me but on this I just don't feel comfortable doing.

Edit:
The main reason I asked and felt like a possible asshole here, like someone pointed out in the comments it was probably a little harsh to kick her out of my place but I'm upset that she's turning this vacation into a thing about us.

Her family is going on a cruise to celebrate her sister graduating high school I don't know her sister that well but I'm sure she couldn't care less if I went or not but she loves her sister and if she didn't go because of me that makes me feel awful.

1248,Not the A-hole,"My son just turned 14.  His dad and I split when he was 3 so he doesn’t remember much about us being together.  When we were together, his dad was neglectful of our son.  I was the one who had a steady job most of our relationship. After my ex got out of the military, he could only keep a job for a few weeks before quitting or being fired. When I would work, he would take care of our son. Most days when I came home from work, they would still be in bed, my son’s diaper close to exploding, and my son not been fed since the night before or my ex sitting at the computer playing video games while my son sat in a chair next to him watching.  We lived with my mom at the time and she got fed up with him not having a job while I worked my ass off to support us and she kicked him out.  I chose not to go with him because I couldn’t make my son homeless and I was tired of supporting him.  
  A few months after getting kicked out, he called me up to say he found someone else and was moving 3 hours away with her.  After that he saw our son twice in 6 months.  The second time he saw him was over a long weekend (Thursday night until Sunday night). As soon as I got my son back I had to rush him to the Er where he spent a week in the hospital with pneumonia.  I later found out my son slept all weekend (at age 3), and my ex was smoking in his house and car while my son was with him(Son has asthma that ex knew about and was told multiple times by multiple doctors not to smoke around him).   The next time my son went with his dad was over a year and a half later by his dad’s choice.  That time when my son came home he was cover in hives and almost had to go to the Er again.  
   Towards the end of our relationship my ex was abusive in every way but physical with me.  I see him doing the same things with my son.  If my son does something wrong or doesn’t want to go with his dad for the weekend he gets ‘screamed at’ (his words). I called the cops once because I went to pick up my son and I could hear his dad screaming at him outside their house with all the doors and windows closed.

I received an email from an unfamiliar but normal-looking address. The subject said something along the lines of “Hey \[my name\], how are you?” I felt a little rush of excitement, thinking it might be an old friend/flame of mine who wanted to reconnect, but upon looking at the email was disappointed to see that it was an obvious phishing attempt; giving information about some company and asking me to click on a link and provide personal information. I clicked it off and forgot about it for a while.

That night, I did some porn-browsing. I ended up downloading about five photos to my desktop, to be put in my “saved” folder later on. These five photos were all VERY, VERY graphic. Just as I was about to file the photos, I went through my email to do my daily “cleaning out” of my inbox. I came across the phishing email from earlier, and just as I was about to delete it, I got a sly little idea. Instead of delete, I hit “reply”, selected the five porno photos on my desktop, pasted them into my reply email, and sent it. I took some pleasure knowing the asshole who sent me that email is going to get a nice little surprise the next morning.

The next afternoon, I checked my email and saw that I had a response from that email address. It was a **furious** rant from a woman, saying that it’s a family email and that her young son clicked on the email and saw my porno pics. She was absolutely losing her shit, asking me what kind of sick freak I was, etc; and I couldn’t help but facepalm at her hypocrisy. I sent the following email back:

My dad has a really deadpan sense of humor and made a joke about decomposing in a body farm or being dissected by med students. Hearing this made my stomach churn because I always imagined that they would be buried or cremated and I would have a site to visit or get to perform a ritual of closure (scattering the ashes). In the past they had both mentioned that they wanted to be cremated if they passed away. I’ve always dreaded the passing of my parents because they mean the world to me I know their eventual passing will be extremely hard as I have no siblings and few immediate family so I will be going through that alone. I know that it is completely up to them what happens to their remains after they leave this earth and I feel selfish imposing my own feelings on their decision but WIBTA if I asked them to reconsider?,74,103,0.85
1252,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have a daughter who is the absolute light of my life. My girlfriend has always been more of a hands on parent, but I am actively involved in our daughter's life and do things with her every day. However, my girlfriend often nags me about doing more for our daughter and yells at me for not anticipating what our daughter needs all the time. I pointed out to her that motherhood and fatherhood are fundamentally different from a biological perspective; from the beginning, she needed to have more hands on time with our daughter because of post partum depression and breast feeding and such, and these types of things carry on through childhood as our daughter is naturally more used to physical contact and comfort from her mother than from me. My girlfriend did not like this at all and blew up at me and accused me of being sexist. I am not sexist; I just think there is a fundamental difference between a mother and her child and a father and his child, and some things that come naturally to her don't come naturally to me.

Here's where I might be an asshole, if she can't afford the hospital bill, why did she have a kid?  I feel like if I donate to it, I'm only enabling her to ask people for more money. I assume, if she can't afford a $2,500 bill for her kid once it arrive, how are you going to afford the kid in general? Are you going to make more gofund mes every time your kid needs something? If I don't donate, she is going to probably ask me why I haven't yet, and I don't want to be an asshole and tell her my logic.  Would I be an asshole?

Some more info that was requested: She planned for this child, this isn't some surprise to her, she wanted to have kids before she turned 30 and so her and her SO planed this. Which is why I don't get the whole gofundme thing. She is my best friend from child hood, and we seem to have been growing apart over the years because she lives a very different lifestyle then me. Don't get me wrong, I love her to death, but I'm also sick of her entitlement. She has NEVER had a job, and has always been dating someone who takes care of her, her current SO has a decent job, but isn't making six figures. 

&#x200B;

Gofundme's should be reserved for unexpected things, like medical emergencies or stuff like that. Not for just giving birth. I'd be more then happy to donate if something unexpected happened medically and she needed help covering the unexpected cost. But I don't feel like starting a gofundme just for simply having a child is appropriate.",896,3136,0.93
1255,Not the A-hole,"Hello Reddit, first time long time.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday was my wife's first Mother's Day, and she was pretty clear she wanted a present from me (we typically don't exchange gifts on birthdays/holidays).  I have been dealing with some pretty terrible anxiety issues (I am in treatment for this) over the past few months, so I asked her for some guidance when it was becoming clear we were in the home stretch and I still hadn't bought anything. My exact words were along the lines of: ""I know you like surprises, but could you at least give me a nudge in the right direction?""

&#x200B;

She was NOT happy that I asked that and didn't help. So here's what I pulled together for her present:

&#x200B;

* Our friend is an artist, and we have some of his art in our house.  So I commissioned him to paint a portrait of our son.
* My wife loves homemade gift baskets and crafts, so I went to Michael's and put together a gift basket of yarn, teal ribbon (her favorite color), and mason jars which she uses for her homemade remedies.
* I put a frame into the gift basket, and in her card, I wrote that the frame was for the future painting of our son.

&#x200B;

She was not happy with this. The painting is obviously not finished yet, and she said my gift was ""thoughtless and showed no effort.""  I told her that I had indeed done this last minute, and while I disagree that it was thoughtless, I never actually said that I disagreed.  Instead, I apologized. Over and over.  It's been 48 hours, and the only words she's said to me have been ""Good morning,"" ""Goodbye,"" and ""I'm going to bed.""  

&#x200B;

I know I could have done better had I gotten the painting together earlier, but I don't think this was the abject disaster she is making it out to be.

&#x200B;

AITA here for asking for gift guidance, getting none, then doing my best in an admittedly-short timeframe?

&#x200B;
&#x200B;
EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback thus far - I do want to note that my wife is usually not at all like this, and it’s a big part of why I was caught SO off guard by her reaction.

1256,Asshole,"My husband's mother passed two weeks ago. We got a 3 year old. I should say we're atheists. Or agnostic? I'm anti-theist, my husband is questioning but atheist leaning. **edit:** my ideas are ""there is no god"", my husband's is ""there is no proof of god but we shouldn't discount the possibility"". What terms describe us, I don't know.

Our daughter went to the funeral but obviously a 3 year old isn't going to grasp what's going on. Since it's my husband's mother, he wanted to sit down and talk with her and I was all for it.

He went on about heaven and how she'll meet grandma later in life and that grandma's in a better place, is the happiest she can be, and is just waiting for the rest of her family to join her. Our daughter took it well but it was very hard on my husband to talk about since it was still fresh to him.

When he was done and we convened ourselves, I told him half jokingly ""that was mad cringe bro"" in a caricaturized voice and he didn't take it well. I tried to argue we're teaching her make believe and while the sentiment is nice, isn't rooted in fact. There's no need to beat around the bush. His only rebuttal was ""she's 3"" and hasn't been too pleased with me since. Not quite silent treatment, but passive disappointment.

1261,Not the A-hole,"My grandfather passed a month ago, shortly after my (21F) 21st birthday. My dad left when I was 7, and my mum passed away when I was 11, shortly after my grandma. My granddad took me in straight away despite his age, even though he was still mourning both his wife and daughter.

Though still deadly sharp, his physical condition wasn't great in his last few years. I'd express my worry for him sometimes, but he'd always tell me to get lost and assure me he'd ""see me through 'til 21."" He was the light of my life.

When he died, I didn't shed a tear. It's hard for me to explain why, but he was still giving sass on his deathbed, and pinched my arm and told me to not cry because he wasn't crying.

After I left, I received a text from my aunt later that evening that she was disappointed at me for not being visibly mournful and apparently him telling me not to was a very poor response. I ignore this, since we were all grieving.

I didn't return to the house for three days to avoid being alone again. When I did return, I found the shelves empty, bits of furniture missing, and photos taken from the walls. I confronted my aunt immediately, who after some arguing returned most of what was taken.

Maybe she didn't think I'd notice, but not only had she taken both my granddad's and his dad's service medals, she had sold them as well.

Luckily, I found the selling post on Facebook quickly enough and the man who bought them was happy to return them to me. I refunded man, and don't plan on asking my aunt for repayment since I'm just so glad to have them back in the first place. I did not confront my aunt about this.

The funeral arrives, and I'm straight away hounded for going through with a cremation. I keep telling her that it was my granddad's decision, not mine, but apparently this contradicted his Catholic values (???)

I'm an extremely mellow person, but this continued into the gathering afterwards. She told others how selfish I was for not letting her take any of his belongings, and how she thought I pushed him into signing his house over to me.

I was soon invited to sit among a table of some of his old friends, at which my aunt was sat too. I tried to not pay her any mind, but the conversation soon devolved and she slipped up and told the table that I hadn't even let her take a single medal.

I lost myself at this, and erupted into a slurry of profanities. My aunt immediately starts crying, and I seize moment to call her out on her selling the medals in the first place. 

I'm not sorry for the things I said to my aunt, but I'm deeply ashamed of my behaviour given the setting. Some people have approached me offering support, to which I have not replied, but I have this immense feeling of guilt in my stomach that I can't shake.

1263,Not the A-hole,"I've been so conflicted the past month about what occurred during my wedding reception with my mother. 

I got to marry the love of my life and the evening was going picture perfect and we were all having a great time. My mother walked up to my wife and told her ""I want to do a speech"" out of no where. Our wedding was on a strict time limit and everything had to go as planned to where we didn't have any time for extra speeches. My wife came up to me and told me my mom wanted to speak and that there was no way that we could make that happen, she wanted me to talk to her. So I do, and I explain the strict time schedule to my mom and for her to just make a toast at the brunch everyone was attending the next morning.... and this is where she flips a switch, gets up storms over to the bar for a drink and makes a scene and leaves. My step-dad came up to me and said, ""big mistake"", which pissed my wife and I off.  So everyone at the reception pretty much knows what happened and it was embarrassing and were both pretty angry but we weren't going to let it ruin our night. We continued the evening and everything went so smooth after my mom left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then the text....

&amp;#x200B;

She sends a text to my wife late that night, I'm sure shes drunk and emotional. She told my wife that, ""I do not give you my blessing and this wedding would not have happened if it weren't for me.""(she contributed $3k of the total $20k it cost for everything) 

She bashed my Father-in-law in the text for being jobless and not being able to pay the full amount himself, which made my wife despise her even more. Along with more details that I wont dive into due to being more personal. 

I was angry,  I blocked her that night and haven't spoken to her since. It was the first ever mothers day that I haven't seen her and I'm feeling a little shitty about not even sending her a text, but deep down I'm still fuming for how she treated me and most importantly my wife on OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

She could have reached out to us a few weeks in advance to let us know she wanted to make a speech/toast and we would've let her, I guess since she paid for a small portion she just assumed we'd allow her the night of... who knows. 

  
My mom and I are really close which makes this even harder. But I'm not sure I can ever forgive her for what she said to my wife. Her walking out of my wedding reception before toasts was embarrassing and made us mad, but the text is what really got us fuming. She could have at least waited until the next day... not try and ruin our wedding night.

&amp;#x200B;

AITA for blocking my mom for 5 weeks, missing mothers day and not being the bigger person to try and resolve this issue?

Edit: ESHers make a lot of sense here. But I’m going to clarify why we didn’t let my mom speak. My MIL knew going in that she wasn’t going to be able to speak, so she spoke at the wedding rehearsal dinner which my mom backed out of last second because I’m sure it’s because she’s not too fond of my in-laws.(completely different people when it comes to lifestyles and politics which is dumb). I was hoping she’d make a toast there. But since she backed out last second when she was supposed to go, it messed things up and for my MIL to make a speech at the rehearsal, and my mom to make one at the wedding, it’d come off as a slap in the face to my MIL, so we’d have to let them both do it. 
My mother played no part in our wedding prep other than giving us 3k. I told her if she had any questions, please bring it up to us. 
But if I knew that all of this would happen, I’d probably go back and change things, but I can’t. And I’m trying to figure out what is the best course of action. I want everyone to be happy, but it seems like that’s almost impossible at this point.",109,458,0.96

UPDATE: IATA. 

The comments (except for the unnecessarily ad hominem ones) were helpful. Even ignoring my door-holding intentions for a moment, it really is lose-lose. Either I ""win"" by getting the ""thank you"" and making a distracted decent person feel shitty, or I engender bad will with a stranger in a delusional attempt to teach them my form of manners. Both betray the spirit of manners and being polite: low effort tit-for-tats intended to spread goodwill. 

To /u/relachesis who asked why I care -- I don't really. Holding doors for people in appropriate and convenient circumstances is no skin off my back, and I'll continue to do it thanks or not.

In retrospect, I do agree that any kind of expectation in that situation is a premeditated resentment.

She's about 10 feet away, but there is another door immediately to the left of the secured door that I need to enter, so I can't enter without cutting her off and blocking her exit. So, I wait and hold the door open for her and she walks through, ignoring me. About a foot after she clears me, I say, ""You're welcome."" Audible but not obnoxious. She says, ""Oh thank you."" I could tell in her voice she felt bad, which made me feel bad, which made me post here, which made me feel....enlightened.

1272,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend (23) and I (21) have recently been approved for an apartment. The landlord is currently writing up the lease for us to sign. Outside of renting apartments during college, this is our first time moving out and living on our own, more specifically on our own expense.

To sum it up, his mother is not happy. She is extremely controlling and pessimistic about pretty much everything if it doesn't fit her high standards. With her, everything is about image and status. But, with that being said, our apartment is actually decently nice and perfect for first time renters. There is no reason for her to degrade it. We are both over the moon and excited as all hell.

During her tantrum over the apartment, she asked my boyfriend if she would be able to see it with him. Without me. The only reason she wants to do that is so she can say whatever she wants about it, negative of course, without me there; In addition to probably try and talk him out of it. Personally, I am NOT okay with that.

I have spent the past 21 years living under roof of a family who did not make my house feel like a home. Me moving out was, and is, the best thing I can do for myself. The entire environment is toxic and horrible for my mental health. I could sit here for days telling you why.

Anyways, this apartment means a lot to me and I'm so excited to have the freedom it will give me. The last thing I want is someone to walk around it complaining and ""poo pooing"" everything they see. I feel that's extremely disrespectful. I wouldn't walk around your home telling you everything I don't like about it? So, when my boyfriend asked me if it was okay for him to see it alone with her, I said no.

This is about respect, and about ultimately putting my foot down and making a line that his mother needs to learn not to cross. I understand my boyfriend is the one who needs to be doing this, and he does, but after so many years he sometimes is no longer able to recognize what is normal mom behavior and what isn't. He is aware she invades everything and tries to control everything my boyfriend does, but of course, it's his mom, which makes it 10x harder.

But anyways, his argument here is that this is his first apartment and she just wants to be apart of it. He says that in the long run if we do not at least slightly include her it will take a toll on her mental health given how neurotic she can be. Ultimately, I agreed on a compromise. She can come see the apartment with US when we go to sign the lease. I refuse to let her go alone. This is my home and I won't be told I can't be there.

Of course, she hates the idea and has shit talked about me to my boyfriend about her wish not being granted.

So, AITA? Should I just let him take her without me? Should I not let her go at all? Is my compromise fair?

1275,No A-holes here,"Ok so here’s the thing, as of recent DnD in my area is incredibly lacking in DMs. I’m one of a very few DMs who show up to help run adventurers league and I also run 3 homebrew games on the side.

I’ve easily invested more into this hobby, regarding writing and research and buying table top materials along with providing food and drink for people. For the most part people are decent at bringing their own beer or bringing chips and soda and stuff but I’m still spending quite a bit on providing actual meals and stuff.

This idea was brought to my attention after a few of my players kept talking about Endgame, don’t worry no spoilers here, and they were talking about seeing it several times. There’s only one theater in the area so as you can imagine it can be kind of expensive, so like $20 to see the movie and $15 for popcorn and soda. This is easily a $30+ experience and a few people talked about seeing it 4 or more times at a minimum.

So my predicament is that I also put quite a bit of effort into creating a universe that is designed for 5 people I invest hundreds of dollars and hours into this for other people to come and enjoy, and don’t get me wrong I enjoy it aswell but I’m doing like 90% of the work here the most my players have to do is write up a backstory and show up and know how to do simple math.

To answer a few faqs here.

I feed the 3 homebrew groups each week, usually it’s chicken or rice that I buy in bulk from Costco along with different gravies, sometimes I do Jumbalaye(?) it’s usually relatively cheap food that would be easily be brushed off as part of the $5 Buy in. I’m not sure where else you could go and pay $5 and get 4-5 free meals a month. I tried getting them to buy pizza themselves and they just bitched and moaned about the price and I don’t want my players leaving for an hour and a half in the middle of a 5 hour session to pick up food.

Another user said there’s 3 responsibilities in DnD: Hosting, DMing and food/drinks. I do all 3 and also provide a shower to 4 of my 15 players.

Also when I say I’m providing my players with entertainment I’m not sure the point gets across that I 3d print custom figures for games, I spend money on tiles, none of my maps are hand drawn sometimes set-pieces are re-used but I think so far this year I’ve spent probably $400+ on materials that were necessary for the campaign.

IDK maybe I’m over thinking this but I think the “hobby” of dming is underappreciated, in this day and age a lot of people don’t mind dropping $15 for skins in video games or $2 to unlock the next area in candy crush but god forbid a dm asks for $1 per 5 hour session to justify all the time and effort that’s put into it along with the out of game stuff of feeding people...

TL;DR: I invest quite a lot into building a “cinematic universe” for my players every week. Is it out of line to ask for atleast $1 a week from each of them for the entertainment that my sessions provide them?",116,183,0.94

I know that she comes from a family where she has something like 42 cousins, all of whom live locally and she says she hangs out with them all the time. And the guy had more than a passing resemblance to her so I figured that must be the answer. I had planned on going over and saying hi when a lull happened at our table but in that time I saw the dude like pin her wrist to the table with his hand and she was trying to pull it away. Then he tried to really forcefully grab her behind the neck and pull her in for a kiss. I lost my shit and went charging inside and sort of grabbed the guys wrist and arm and told him to leave her the fuck alone. 

Elle screamed something like holy shit what the fuck are you doing? I was like I'm helping you! She said she was just flirting with him and they were there together. At that point I was like what in the fuck are you talking about? We're dating! She said that yes we are dating but she's still dating other people. I was so freaking embarrassed because the entire restaurant was staring at us and I wanted to crawl into a hole and die. I left without paying the bill (I sent my friends money on apple pay so I didn't stiff anyone) and got an uber and went home and figured that was that and figured I'd never see her again. 

Well I had tickets to the Sharks game and Elle was supposed to go with me but I just wanted to wallow in self pity. But sure enough the showed up at the exact time we agreed decked out in blue and black complete with her shark pasties so she could flash the camera. She basically just said ""hey I need you to know I really like you but I'm still seeing other people"" I asked her I thought we were exclusive. She said if she choses me to be exclusive, I'll know it but I acted like a real asshole at the restaurant the previous night. I asked her what the deal with the grabbing was she said that was she and Ken's ""love language"" (great I know another guys name). She asked if I could be cool, so I said yes. The game was fun and she acted is if nothing whatsoever happened and was like the same, super cool, fun, loving girl she always had been. I felt like there was a 2000lb weight on my back. 

to help me find some clarity was I the asshole for assuming we were exlusive? Was I the asshole for how I acted at the restaurant?",502,880,0.94
1277,No A-holes here,"For some background: My husband (37M) and I (35F) have two sons together, aged 15 and 13. We have a great family and relationship, and I’m so lucky to be married to the man I am. He’s an amazing husband and father. However, when we first began dating, he was dealing with some problems with substance abuse. Specifically, he was a recovering heroin addict and fell off the wagon a few times, but was able to stop after our first son was born. He’s been clean for 15 years now, and I’m so proud of him. 

So recently, my kids have been bugging me about what life was like when my husband and I were younger. Now, I had my fair share of struggles but my husband had it really rough. He grew up in the foster system and was homeless for a while before we met, and he told me all this in confidence. He’s been in therapy to work through the trauma and has been working on bettering himself for years now. But I wasn’t sure if I should tell my kids these things about their dad, especially since they really idolise him. 

So I asked my hubs about it, and he told me that he didn’t mind either way if I share that piece of his life with the boys. That he’s not ashamed of where he came from, and he’s fine with them knowing as long as they’re willing to learn and be openminded about it all. 

So the ball’s kind of in my court now, and I’m not sure I’m comfortable with telling my kids this right now. It kind of feels like I’d be betraying his trust in a way? I know he said it’s fine, but I also know he still struggles with some of the hard memories, he’s told me that more than once. I’m worried if I tell our boys, they’ll bother him about it/be insensitive (like teenage boys often are) and bring up bad memories. I’m considering being vague, but I know they’ll press for more details. 

So WIBTA if I choose not to tell them about my husband’s past? I’m honestly super torn, and would love to hear back about what you would do.",61,208,0.96

&#x200B;

So the other day I was at my GF parent's house and we were having a conversation with her sister (who doesn't live there) about cost of living in our town and other things (the sister had recently moved, so we were getting her perspective on the whole living alone thing).

At one point my GF said that she has a lot of expenses with a bunch of meds (apart from the pill, she also takes stuff for stomach problems and depression) and that was one of her main concerns in the process of analyzing if she could start living alone and still pay all the bills, but then her sister flat out told her something along the lines of ""but doesn't (my name) share the costs of the pill with you? I've been doing that with my boyfriend for a while now since it's something that benefits us both and it's only fair that he pays for half of it"". She then acted really surprised about learning that I didn't share the cost and called me an asshole for it.

We were kinda dumbfounded from that revelation, because both of us never actually heard of that at all (is that even a thing?), but we didn't discuss it further, because we were getting ready to leave for the movies anyway so we just left it at that.

Back at home though she asked if I was willing to do that and it made me really uncomfortable, because I didn't share her sister's sentiment at all (that it benefited them both). So I gave her my reasonings for not wanting to, which were pretty much the following:

She takes the pill to avoid menstruating, that's a fact. She flat out said that was the case back when we started dating. She hates menstruating, so she just takes it in order to avoid that and the cramps, PMS and stuff.

So I asked her if we broke up the next day if she would stop taking the pill and she said she wouldn't, because not getting pregnant wasn't the only reason she took them. So I told her that I didn't think it was fair for me to pay a permanent expense of hers that she had before we even began dating and that would continue even after we broke up. It just made no sense.

She reluctantly agreed and we haven't talked about it since, but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong here.

To be honest (and **I** **DID NOT TELL HER THIS**), if anything the pill makes my sex life worse, because it pretty much ruined her libido.

&#x200B;

P.S. We do also use condoms, which I buy along with lube, so it's not like she's the only one paying for contraception, but yeah, sure, it's nowhere near the same cost.

1281,Asshole,"My wife and kid get along swimmingly usually. He’s 13. I had my son on the weekend and he was in my and my wife’s room playing video games. 

My wife doesn’t like it when he’s in there because she’s kinda OCD about germs and she especially hates when he’s on our bed. To be completely fair to her she also doesn’t let our 6 year old sit on the bed unless she’s had a bath so it’s not just my son. Her reasoning is that ‘outside clothes’ are dirty and my son likes to always sit on walls and chairs and stuff in public which my wife avoids as she hates the idea of germs. 

Well over the weekend my wife went to visit her mom taking our kid with her and when she came back my son had left glasses and tissues on her side of the bed.  On Sunday evening after I dropped him off and my wife was home she got really mad at me and told me she wasn’t my sons mom and I hadn’t done the washing in the sink, I had just left the dishes in there, and she was REALLY mad about the stuff on her side of the bed. 

She changed all the sheets, wiped down the side cabinet, and told me she found crumbs everywhere. My son had only had a small snack and I knew it wasn’t those crumbs. She said ‘I’m not his mom to be cleaning up after him every time he’s here, you need to tell him to throw his trash away or clean it yourself’

Here's the simple version of the story, I went to a guy who prepares tax returns. He runs his own business and I've been going to him for years. Google and his voicemail indicated that his business hours were from 2pm - 6pm. I showed up at 5pm on a Sunday and his business was closed.  I then went next-door to the neighboring business and asked if anyone knew where he was. The lady there said he had something come up and left. I expressed frustration that he wasn't there and said ""this is no way to run a business"". She pointed out that I was one to talk, considering I was trying to file my taxes after the deadline. She also pointed out that I arrived in the last hour of a business being open. She revealed she was the businessman's aunt. We bickered and then she said coolly ""have a good day sir"".

&#x200B;

The next day I tried to talk to my friend about it, and he smugly pointed out that this is a recurring issue with me. Showing up in the last couple of hours of a business being open. \[He's referring to my behaviour during grad school where I would show up at our lab at 2pm-3pm when the lab would close at 5pm\]. I tried to explain myself and he went on explaining that I'm trying to massage the facts to make myself look better.

&#x200B;

My complaint is two-fold: It took me a bit of a commute to get to the business. I should have restrained my frustration, but the neighboring business owner could have expressed her disagreement without attacking me. Also, my friend could have empathized more and not used my complaint to point out my flaws.

My child is 6. Suddenly she laughed and pointed at one of the houses. Inside there was a completely naked woman leaning down to pick something up right in front of the window. We could see everything clear as day. 

I know the woman, she is one of my wives friends. I laughed along with my kid as she clearly wasn’t bothered but inside I was a little WTF. 

I saw her at a coffee and cake morning  at school a few weeks later and she and my wife and I happened to sit on the same table. I tried to be as tactful as possible towards the end and say hey, Sophia and I kinda saw you naked a couple weeks back, maybe since you’re near the school it’ll be less awkward to just draw a curtain? 

She was very offended and told me I was being inappropriate and I was floored. I was even more floored when my wife agreed with her. I told my wife later that if it was a naked dude all hell would have already broken loose. She wants me to apologise to her friend.

1284,Not the A-hole,"I used to work at a food chain. I started from the bottom and worked my way to management. The food/bev industry has a high turnover rate, and our store lost more employees than it gained in any given month. I put in extra hours to help, as did the rest of management.

&#x200B;

Eventually, I was exclusively working the closing shift, and worked from 12 or 2 to about 11, 6 days a week. The skeleton crew that was needed to efficiently close the store consists of: Manager, Line, Orders, Dish, and Salad Bar. The non-manager positions can run the store effectively, but the manager works on what is needed the most at any given time.

&#x200B;

Our store had reached a historic low of employees, and the majority were ""needed"" for the morning and afternoon, since those were the busiest times. However nights could generate up to $2,000 in sales. Due to staffing, nights tended to consist of me, Dish, and Salad Bar. I had to take orders and make food, with no help since the other 2 were not trained for either position. After several complaints from customers about the wait times and my no-nonsense approach to the situation, my boss ripped me a new asshole. I told him I needed more people, and he said everyone else could manage that sort of situation perfectly fine (I doubt it because the other managers pretty much refused to work the closing shift, but whatever) and that I have no excuse. He told me I had better not get one more complaint or he would take drastic action.

&#x200B;

The next night, same situation, this time several customers left the building without ordering because I was making about 20+ orders for customers who had just ordered and had to sit and wait for me to get them out. One wrote a particularly scathing complaint, making up all these lies about how I refused to help them, and I was just fucking around instead of helping customers. He swore to never return to the store.

&#x200B;

That was the night I snapped. I had been talking about quitting for about a week leading up to that night, and it was just the straw that broke the camel's back. I sent an email to all the managers announcing that I would not be returning to work, and that I would give my keys to the general manager. The next day, the same general manager who had just tore me a new asshole treated me to coffee and spent over an hour trying to convince me to stay. He said he had huge plans for our store and that I was a key part of it. I knew it was BS and he would be looking for my replacement and firing me as soon as he could, despite his claims that he would just forget it ever happened. The other managers and the employees called me asshole for not sticking around and just quitting without even a 2 week notice.

1285,Not the A-hole,"I was hanging around with a group of friends at University when out of nowhere one of the guys (let's call him Steve) brings up something pretty weird. It's pretty sudden to go from uni deadlines to dating success. He starts a tangent about how no girls like him despite being everything they need, he begins his list with being 6ft tall and carries on to say other things but I tuned out.

I'm 5'11 so I often pass for 6ft in shoes (especially in a world where lots of guys around 5ft9+ claim to be 6ft) and Steve is a good handful of inches shorter than me. If we stand side-by-side he'd be at perfect forehead kissing height. I'd guess his actual height to be around 5ft6 give or take an inch.

It doesn't seem like anyone is planning to speak so I break the silence. I said it was a little embarassing that the first positive trait he can think of is height, not only because people can't control it but also because he's not as tall as he said he was. I said there's nothing wrong with being average height because there's something for everyone and average is the definition of average so expecting anything more is a bit iffy. I guess this was my attempt to encourage him to be honest with himself?

He absolutely insists he's 6ft.

Prone to exaggeration, I claim to be 5ft9 and then stand next to him, visibly taller by half a head. He says that he's 6ft and I must be at least 6ft3 and lying. [I make this face and drop the issue.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CcWbMnrWoAALlX9.jpg)

He was pretty quiet and a little withdrawn for the rest of the afternoon, and I got a message when I got home from him saying I'm a dickhead for lying about how short I am and that he is in fact 6ft. Someone else in the group (let's called her Sarah) also messaged to say that I was a total asshole to shame him for his height because I should've known he's insecure about it.

I admit I was tempted but I didn't let myself forward the insecurity message from Sarah to height complex guy Steve. It would've been especially harsh since I know Steve likes Sarah. I'd wager that Sarah likes Steve too, but doesn't like his height complex.

This year we had some extra money, so I thought for Mother's Day, I would suprise her with a family necklace with our kid's birthstones in it.  The birth order of our kids would make the stones Opal, Sapphire, Sapphire.  After I start searching designs, she announces that this is what she wants for mother's day.  Since I already found a design I liked and the kids liked, I showed her in private, she says she hates it.  Fair enough, money has not been spent, I ask her to give me some ideas of what she likes.  She sends me a couple designs.  I work with the kids, try to place the stones S, O, S to give the stones variation, my oldest is upset and wants the stones to be in birth order.  I find a design that looks nice (one that she sent) and lay the stones out in birth order so my kids can feel like they designed it as well.  Order the necklace, am happy to suprise her with it.  She gets it on Mother's day, complains that the chain is too thin (no shit, it is the free chain, that can be fixed).  Then, when kids are gone, tells me she hates it, it looks like a set of blue balls and she won't wear it.  Now I am in the process of going through the return and feeling like I don't EVER want to buy her a piece of jewelry again.  AITA for being upset that she acted like it was total piece of trash?  It was not a cheap necklace and it looked good in my opinion.

We mostly talk while in bed before sleeping.

   I had a secretary that I got along really well with but she recently quit due to health issues. So it clicks in my head that I could hire my wife as my new secretary, that way we'd spend a lot more time together and she'd have an income at the same time. Win-win. I run it past her and she agrees. The job basically consists of fetching documents, making calls, and brewing coffee, all of which she can easily do.

1290,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory mobile and throwaway disclaimer (my gf has reddit, and she isn't aware of all the drama at this point)

This whole debacle revolves around my dad's upcoming birthday party. He's turning 60 in August, so we're planning a big party for him. We're renting a hall, doing catering, hiring a band, the whole shebang. Some old friends of his will be flying in from out of state, as will me and my sister (we both moved away after college).

Anyway, since I don't get to see my family that often, I decided to invite my gf to come along with me to the party. We've been dating for about 6 months now and are pretty serious, and my folks have told me several times that they'd like to meet her. I thought this would be the perfect time to make that happen, but my sister seems to think otherwise. Her problem is that she broke up with her fiance last month, and she feels like me showing off my girlfriend to the family would just be rubbing it in her face that I've got an SO and she doesn't.

Now, I think this line of reasoning is petty af. First of all, by the time August rolls around, her break-up will be old news (and she could possibly find someone new by then). Also, this isn't an event revolving around her, so it's not like I'd be upstaging her or stealing the show or anything. She's acting like me introducing my gf to our family is a smear-campaign against her or something.

My mom and pop said that they'd be more than happy to have gf at the party, but ultimately it's a decision that me and my sis have to make (something about keeping the peace or some shit). My sis hasn't exactly put her foot down, but is really hinting that she wants my gf to stay at home. WIBTA if I just invited her anyway?

Tl;dr - Sis recently broke up with her fiance, so she thinks me bringing my gf to my dad's b-day party is out of line. WIBTA for inviting gf anyway?



____________________

UPDATE: So I've been texting my sis back and forth all day, and we've cleared some stuff up. But I do want to say that, contrary to some of the opinions expressed here, she's not the stuck-up brat that some of you are imagining. She's usually pretty down to earth, and while her request was definitely unreasonable, both me and my parents know full well that she's not a spoiled princess who will throw a temper tantrum and ruin the big day.

Anyway, like some of you suggested, I reached out to my her with my thoughts, and a few things have come to light. I let her know that I understand she's in pain, but me wanting to bring gf along isn't in anyway to spite her. In the process though, I learned that sis had no idea that I'm as serious about this girl as I am. I don't blame her for that either, because in the past I haven't hidden from my family that I mostly date casually. My current gf is different, but sis just thought she was some fuck-buddy I've held onto for a long time. Once I told my sister that there's a good chance this girl could become her sister-in-law someday, she was more understanding. Still, as some of you have pointed out, this is my dad's party, not 'show off OP's gf' party, so I suggested that maybe we come down a day or two early to meet the parents and extended family ahead of time. That way a good chunk of the party guests won't need to be introduced to her, and maybe we can steer clear of the whole SO topic. Sis seemed to be content with this compromise, so I'm hoping this puts an end to the whole affair.

1292,Not the A-hole,"Disclaimer: I found out about this sub through watching Cuestar on YouTube and thought it could be a good place to take this issue. I've never used or even really browsed Reddit before, so sorry if I get anything wrong. 

So here's my situation. My mother and I have never really seen eye to eye. We just have wildly different worldviews. Our rocky relationship hit its peak when I was 17 and came out as gay. She kicked me out and we didn't speak for three years. We reconnected about a year ago and, while I didn't move back in, our relationship is a bit more stable than it was previously. 

Throughout my teenage years, I would get pretty sick almost every time I ate and as a result, didn't eat a lot and was pretty underweight. Since leaving my mum's house, I've made several lifestyle changes and concluded that I'm probably lactose intolerant, as the sickness after eating went away after I cut out dairy. Thing is, Mum doesn't believe me. She thinks my boyfriend (who is vegan) is ""brainwashing"" me into thinking dairy is poison and accuses me of having an eating disorder. The comments I can brush off, but the issue comes with food she makes. She *always* manages to sneak dairy products into somehow, as if she's trying to ""catch me out"". The one time she witnessed me being sick after eating something she'd snuck quite a lot of milk into, she accused me of forcing myself to vomit. She did say she would stop doing it, but I know she hasn't because I *still* get sick every time I eat at her house. I've asked if I can just bring my own food and she said no, so I've just stopped eating at her house. 

My stepdad, my grandparents and my aunt have all text me to tell me how offended my mum is and how much of a difficult brat I'm being. I've tried explaining that dairy makes me sick and she keeps sneaking it into my food. I've essentially been told that if I want to have a relationship with my mother, I need to suck it up and stop being so selfish and think of her feelings. Are they right, or should I stick to my gut?

ETA: okay this got more response than I was expecting haha. Just wanted to clear up something I thought I'd added, but forgot to (sorry!) Mum has told my family that I have, essentially, an eating disorder (i.e. I'm making myself vomit after eating), and that I'm using allergies as an excuse. They aren't the type to really take mental health issues seriously, especially when it's a man having them, which is why I was told to ""suck it up"". Obviously telling someone to ""suck up"" a mental illness is no better than doing it with a physical one, but I just wanted to clear that up as I forgot to include it originally.",363,1474,0.94

I said no. Husband felt he had to help so gave her our small savings but told her it was our rent so she would actually pay us back by the end of the month. We also suggested all of her adult children (6of them) pay £20 a week so she doesn't  have a big lump sum to pay and it's not just us paying it.

End of the month has come and gone and she has come crying and begging again for another substantial amount of money and none of the others have paid anything either.

Husband paid the whole debt on his credit card this morning....

1297,No A-holes here,"Ok so I got us an Oculus rift last year. So far, I've played a few games and took it out when we had guests to make them try it. My so has motion sickness so he's tried it maybe once or twice. I got him games that were easy on the movements, but I guess he hasn't shown a very big interest in it. We share an Oculus account. So today I get a confirmation e-mail from Oculus saying I bought some video player. Weird! My first thought was that my account might've gotten hacked. I look up the name of the software online and find Reddit threads explaining how to watch VR porn on Oculus. It rubbed me the wrong way, but tbh I don't really understand why.

I watch porn, my partner watches porn, we both know we watch porn so that's not really the issue. But I watch porn to get in the mood and masturbate and get some physical release, I'm not actively looking to make the experience ""real"" so I really feel like I'm fucking someone else...? On the other hand, we both get super excited about technology and I understand the curiosity. I think it's also because he didn't show much interest for the VR system I got us despite my efforts to include him, except for porn, which he did behind my back when I wasn't there. Hell, maybe it could've been hilarious to discover VR porn together! 

AITA if I tell him it makes me uncomfortable? Or should I just suck it up and let him goop up the controllers?

Edit: We had a conversation about it, it went much quicker and was much easier than I thought. I explained my thoughts and we talked about our limits and what makes us feel weird and what makes us feel ok, trying to understand the subtleties. He didn't expect me to get an e-mail and said he understands it's weird for me to learn about it this way. I'm so glad my partner is this easy to talk to and so empathetic! I literally do not know what I did to deserve him. <3",82,179,0.91
1298,Not the A-hole,"So I’m in my last week of work. This was a temp job to finish my last semester of school. It’s a pretty crummy minimum wage job, and I really don’t care about it. It was literally just to pay the bills so I don’t have to dip into my savings. 

So yesterday I customer came in and wanted their order back before the promise date. I told them that I unfortunately could not rush their order for them. They got super rude and condescending telling me that it’s my job. It’s not, my job is to relay the information I’ve been told to the customer. 


So I told them straight up. This is my last week, I’m not going to go above and beyond for you because you feel entitled to it. If you had been polite I would have helped you out, but I’m not in the mood to help you out now. 

The look on their face was priceless. They left their order for the regular turn around time. Apparently they called to complain, and my manager mentioned it this morning. I didn’t get chewed out or anything though. They know I’m out the door anyways. 

I’m not planning on using this place as a reference, it has no bearing in my trade. If I burn bridges here it won’t impact me. But AITA?

1302,Everyone Sucks,"About 4 months ago, my (F23) friend (M25) told me that he had feelings for me and asked if I wanted to go on a date with him and see where things went. I had recently got out of a 4 year relationship and wasn’t ready to even think about being with someone new so I told him that I couldn’t, with him or anyone else. He said he understood but to let me know if I reconsidered. 

I ended up developing feelings for him, but still didn’t feel ready to actually be with anyone. I told him this and he said he would wait until I felt ready. I felt uncomfortable with that and told him not to wait because I didn’t want to feel pressure to hurry up and get over my heartbreak, but he said waiting was his only option as he couldn’t see himself with anyone else. I didn’t push it and our friendship continued as normal. 

Skip to a couple days ago - after spending a nice day together he said that he felt like we were already in a relationship considering how close we are. I disagreed since there was no physical aspect, and since I was fooling around with other people on a purely NSA basis. He flipped out on me and told me he had waited long enough, and done everything he could to support me through my heartbreak and help me feel ready to date again and unless I gave him a chance he would cut off contact with me. I said I was sorry but I just couldn’t be with him like that, and that I felt he was being a manipulative POS by backing me into a corner like that. He stormed out and blocked me on everything. 

He has now told all our friends that I’ve spent the last few months leading him on, and I feel awful. I think maybe I screwed up and should’ve been more forceful about telling him not to wait, or not even told him I had feelings for him in the first place. AITA??

EDIT - several of you have asked why I felt the need to tell him I had feelings, which I think is a valid question. It happened after he got really upset one night, he literally burst into tears and said he was finding it really humiliating to have such strong feelings for someone who didn’t have any for him. He said he felt pathetic and thought everyone was laughing at him behind his back. I felt shitty about him feeling that way, especially since I DID have feelings, so I told him. As I’ve said in the comments, that was probably a dumb decision looking back.

ANOTHER EDIT - would I have dated him if I had felt ready? Yes. 100%. I had genuine feelings for him. 
Did he flip about finding out I was hooking up with others? No. Or at least not to my face. He told me he didn’t care about hookups and he knew they didn’t mean anything. He flipped because I disagreed that we were basically together already.
Finally, the telling him not to wait wasn’t as simple as ‘you shouldn’t wait because that makes me uncomfortable and puts pressure on me’ ‘no I want to wait’ ‘okay cool’. This conversation went on for hours before I dropped it.",285,256,0.89
1303,Not the A-hole,"First time posting here. 

Some BG: my mom and I have a distant but decent when we actually speak relationship. My childhood was full of abuse and neglect and she enabled the abuse as well. I am very low contact with her but she does tell me she loves me and to have a good day. It’s basically a cut & paste convo. 

My mom has always been bad with money. We were always in poverty or near it growing up. It fluctuated. I have since joined the Navy and since I have a stable paycheck with good benefits, she always asks me to “borrow” money. 

She very rarely pays me back and if she does it’s when it was small amounts I gave to her, like $50. But she asks me all the time. 

It makes me feel like I’m an ATM because we don’t even talk about how I’m doing/how she’s doing or about anything at all. 

For Mother’s Day the past years I would usually send a nice card and a gift card to a nice restaurant and arrange it so my older sister (mom to a young child) and her could go out and bond and just get away without any worries since I’m footing the bill. I should note I’m overseas so that’s why I would arrange it for them and just them. 

This year my moms asking for $200 VISA card for her and some money for my sister. I’m asking because I basically avoided giving an answer because I was uncomfortable and now she’s asking me where the cards are everyday and has been before Sunday even.

1305,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because some of my friends have reddit too. 


To start my story off, let me give you some background info. I am a woman. My husband is a bisexual male leaning more towards straight, but is still bi. We have only recently gotten married, about 9 months ago. Before that we dated for a couple of years. My husband has always wanted to have a threesome with another bi man, as he could please both of us. I wasn’t too comfortable with doing this, but last week, I finally agreed. My husband is very in with the lgbtq+ community in our area, so he knew exactly who he wanted to join us right away. We scheduled to have this event partake three days after my agreeing at the friends house, who we will call jim.


Now fast forward to four days ago, the day of the threesome. I was very nervous, but my husband was excited to “ finally be able to have a good man in him” as he said. We got to jim’s house, and were brought inside. We had a few drink and then started. I don’t want to make this too NSFW but what i will say was that both of them were involved with each other and me in multiple ways. But I guess my husband wanting for men was more than i expected, because after a few minute of foreplay and intercourse, it turned into my husband and jim just having normal sex. I saw what was happening, grabbed my clothes, ran out the house and into my car, and drove away almost in tears. Some people might see this as an overreaction, but in my mind, all my husband was doing was cheating on me with another man. I later texted him and told him he could stay at jim’s house overnight, he wasn’t welcome here. Later the next day jim dropped my husband off, who was not apologetic at all. He was mad at me for driving away, saying that he did nothing wrong, and that he just wanted to satisfy his needs. Most of our other friends also sided with him, saying that he needs a man every now and then.


So what do you think reddit, AITA for having a “threesome” with my husband and his friend?

1306,Asshole,"Throwaway in case anyone recognizes our situation. 

My boyfriend and I of 3 years are finally moving in together. We live in a really, really expensive city where rent can be exorbitant. I currently live in a smaller flat with 3 roommates and my bf lives close to the city center in a small flat he bought 2 years ago. 

We’ve decided that we’ll look for a new, larger place that’s just “ours” and my bf will sell his flat or rent it out (he hasn’t decided yet.) 

So right now we’re looking around but we can’t decide on a budget. For one, he earns 7x what I do (45k vs. ~300k) and can afford so much more in rent. I want to look at larger places that are far out of my price range ($800-1000) but he could easily afford ($4000-5000) because these are the only ones that are close to both of our work and large enough to live in comfortably with two people. However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. 

We had a fight recently where I said I’d like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I’d afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I’d like to pay what I’m paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income. I feel guilty to asking him to pay more but I feel upset that he’d rather live in a smaller, shittier flat just so I “pay my equal share” than spend more so we could both be comfortable. AITA for the suggestion?

**edit:** sorry I got the math wrong, he wants me to contribute 35-40% not 25-30%. So our budget would be $2200 a month if I contribute the same as before ($750). This cost is essentially nothing to him though but I feel like he’s sticking to it for the principle which makes me feel really shitty.",458,441,0.84
1307,No A-holes here,"Last year my wife and I moved in with some friends. Before this, with no breaks between, I had:

1) Lived several years cleaning up after someone else's incontinent border collie every day,

2) Spent a year living with five dogs (one shedder, three chewers and a yip-yipper, all of whom would pee/poop in the house at random times), and

3) Finally spent a year living with the precious feline baby of a shitty roommate who'd crucify us for giving the damn thing tap water.

So one of the big pluses for me was that none of us had pets this time! ... For a while. Some months in, one of our roommates rescued a cat out of the cold. He was just a kitten and he'd been crying for hours, likely would've died if she hadn't picked him up. She was gonna take him to a shelter but finally got the okay from the rest of us to keep him.

A month and a half later we have a house talk and the others all decide he's going to be *our* cat. Not just hers. The house cat. So everyone has to chip in for vet bills and shots and stuff he needs.

I agreed to let him stay because everyone else fell in love with him but I didn't and don't want a cat.

I have a small business making puzzle boxes. They are custom made, intricate, and fairly expensive. My brother has always thought they were cool and wanted one, but they take a long time for me to make and cost quite a bit of money. In my free time over the course of several projects I made a puzzle box for him, and gave it to him as a birthday present. It’s quite difficult to solve, but certainly not impossible.

Now, I never give the solution with my product because I think it ruins the fun. I always give multiple disclaimers to my customers, and they know what they’re getting into and enjoy not having the solution. My brother knows this is part of my brand. He’s had the box for a couple months now, and he’s asked me several times for the solution to it and I’ve refused. I told him that part of the brand is that it doesn’t come with a solution, and he’s getting annoyed about it and acting like I’m in the wrong for not telling him. He thinks that since he didn’t buy the box and it was a gift that I should do whatever makes it more enjoyable for him which is, he thinks, giving him the solution.

There is no extra present inside the box—the present *is* the box. I don’t think that giving him the solution would “hurt my brand” but I do think that if he wants one of *my* puzzle boxes then part of that is not getting the answer. He didn’t specifically ask for one of my boxes for this particular birthday, but he has inquired before and said he would buy one if it wasn’t so expensive and he wasn’t a broke college student, so I started making him one in my downtime and gave it to him at the next holiday that came up after I was finished.

1317,No A-holes here,"So at our wedding, my mom gave my wife a number of dresses (it's a cultural thing. her mom did too.). Unfortunately, my wife didn't like any of them and refused to wear them. Although I was a little disappointed that she didn't like my mother's gifts, I understood that they have different tastes and didn't push it. At a later time, my mom asked my wife why she never wore those dresses and asked if she'd wear them at so and so events. On two occasions my wife wore them for my mother and on a third occasion, when she really didn't want to, we told my mom that we don't want to and my mom said okay.

Now we have a event coming up and culturally, the elder of the family (in our case, my mom) would gift clothes to all their children and grandchildren etc. My mom gave clothes to all my siblings and their kids. When our turn came, I got clothes as usual but my wife got money instead. It's worth noting that my mom gave us our things separately, so that everyone would not see. When my wife asked her why she's giving her money, and not clothes, my mom said that since she figured they have different tastes (my mom figured out that the wife didn't like the clothes and that's why she wasn't wearing them), she didn't want to gift something my wife wouldn't like and felt that it's better if my wife gets something of her own choice. 

When this happened, my wife got visibly upset and remained that way for the entire duration we were with my family (we were all supposed to go out for dinner together). Everyone noticed that something was off and I whispered to her a few times not to make a scene.

Once she moved out our fighting didn’t necessarily stop but we became more civil. She’s been married to her husband for 7 years now, for this post we will call him Ryan. Ryan was always toxic from the start and I never really seemed to get along with him. He had a pretty toxic childhood which possibly explains his current behavior.  My sister and Ryan are constantly fighting but typically tend to keep them to herself (except for some occasions when she begs to stay the night because she can’t handle being around him) cool. Their life, their problems. Ryan doesn’t work And always finds and excuse not to help out with his family, and let’s my sister do everything for him. When I mention any opinion that suggests Ryan is root cause of any problems she gets extremely defensive and I’m the bad guy. So I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut. 

Recently, we were out of town enjoying a family outing and it was a wonderful day, except Ryan has a severe drinking problem and both my sister and him deny it. On this outing Ryan began drinking and got a bit too drunk for comfort. He became extremely loud and very obnoxious. This was the first time my brother had brought his girlfriend around our family, and Ryan was making a complete fool of himself and it was extremely embarrassing for everyone. By the end of the night (9pm) we dropped my brothers girlfriend off. At this point a fight broke out between my sister and Ryan.

For 3 hours we searched for him and everyone began to worry. At this point we were 2.5 hours away from home so we couldn’t just leave. Finally cops were able to find him and he contacted us and we picked him up. My sister acted like nothing happened and blamed herself while Ryan made up this big pitty story about how he was so scared that he thought we left him, (he never once attempted to come back to the car, we waited for over an hour before driving off to search for him) and my sister saw no wrong in him and apologized to him? By this point it was 4am and I was meant to be home at 11pm because I had finals in the morning. This particular fight got my entire family and our guest involved which is why I’m so upset and she doesn’t get why we are mad.

I tried to help her but if I pulled, it hurt her way too much. She had texted me to alert me she was stuck, and she told me she was there for about an hour before she decided to text me (kind of raised to not rely on others).

So, it's late at night, and the only people awake in the house is my father and me. So, I go downstairs to ask my dad to help her get out of her situation, and he starts *yelling* because he's really angry. ""Why isn't she asleep yet? How did she get stuck down there?""

And he comes upstairs, sees her stuck where she is, and starts yelling at her for not going to sleep. He also yells that she should've just slept instead of charging her phone (she has after school things, so she needs to call our parents or grandma about when to pick her up). 

Anyway, Dad keeps yelling, which wakes up my mom from down the hall so she comes in and actually gets my sister out.

""Alright, cool,"" I think as I'm ready to leave and continue on with my studying for finals along with friends over Discord, but then my mom mutters to me ""I don't know why you decided to call your dad.""

That made me feel a little bit guilty, but I rationalized it with ""Well, I thought he would be mature about this, like a dad"" in my head.

But I got back onto discord with my friends and they were like ""Bro, I could hear your dad and family. Your dad fucking scared me.""

I go ""Well, he does that usually? He always yells.""

And they go ""well alright"" but then after the call, I lie down in bed and I'm like ""Wait what the fuck *is that not normal""*

Like, I'm wondering if I should've thought of the fact that my dad is always angry beforehand? I honestly couldn't get my sister out and my dad was already awake. I'm also thinking about how my dad ""joked"" around before by saying he didn't want my sister, and it would've been better if just me and my two brothers (17 and 7) were born.

1321,Not the A-hole,"So for the past three years i have been with my fiancée. In this time i have always tried to be a good step mom. I try to plan activities that are fun and free because tight on funds. I do not talk about their mother or the realtionship with father and mother. Things were pretty good until my son was born.


 Since he was born the trouble began. Myah aged 10 when this started would come for visits with brother aged 6. When they would come over visit would be like usual nothing wrong, fun had by all. Then she would go home and tell her mom all kinds of lies about us.

 She would say i called her names and was mean. She also started saying her dad was abusive, cps ruled out any abuse on our end. Mother also calls calls local cops to report harrasment by me when i go out of my way to avoid that woman. The mother has always been a piece of work so i avoid her if possible. 


The last time i saw the kids i decided that would be the last time i visit with them. They came over for the weekend like normal. We went to a movie one night and then the park second day. Then they went home. As soon as she got home the phone rang. It was the mother. She is calling me names and threatening me. The reason you ask. 


Myah told her mom that i had hit her and brother. That i had ignored them all weekend. That i wouldnt let them eat. That i refused her a shower. The one that dug the deepest she said i told her i hated her. 

I never did any of these things and now i do not want to see the kids. If he sees them for a day i stay home. If he had them overnight i go to my moms. I am so tired of being demonized for things i never did. I am tired of being lied on. Fiancée has brought this up with kid and ex and it gets thrown on me. 


I feel like an asshole because i dont want to see the kids until something gives. I love myah but i cant keep dealing with this. Am i the asshole for not wanting to visit with kids. I do still let them see their half brother but not me. They do ask for me but i dont want to visit.

The tuxedo wasn't great quality or designer but still cost me several hundred dollars.

Well after 6 months, I put in my 2 weeks notice and not surprisingly they just fired me on the spot and then demanded the tux back.   At the beginning of hiring you are supposed to sign a separate form that basically said ""I agree to give the tux that I paid for and now own back to the owners so they can re sell it to the next employee"".  Well I didn't sign it and slided it in with the rest of my paperwork and they never noticed it.  They said you signed a legal contract so you have to give it back or we call the police.

1325,No A-holes here,"Some history....My husband and I rent a 2 bedroom apartment and a few years ago decided that, to save money, we'd get a roommate. A friend of my husband was moving to town, he moved in, it went poorly, he moved out, he and my husband are no longer friends. In this case I think everyone was kind of assholes. 

When he moved out we weren't in a great place financially and needed to replace him. A work acquaintance of mine posted on social media that she was looking for a new place.  Long story short she moved in. Things haven't been perfect, but they have been better than with the previous roommate. And she and I have become good friends. 

In the couple of years she's lived with us our finances have improve due to raises/more hours/promotions. However my husband and I are having some relationship problems. We love each other very much and want to work things out. This would be easier if we had more privacy/space to ourselves. So, back in November we explained our situation and told her we would appreciate it if she could move out by April 1st (giving her about 5 months to find something).

She has 2 cats and a large dog, and I believe the person she's planning to be her new roommate also has pets. So she is having a hard time finding a place. April arrived with no moving. We said she could stay another month. We also offered to let her leave some or all of her pets with us ( and of course be able to come visit them).  

It is now the middle of May and still no moving.  I know that she is looking at places and filling out applications.  And I don't want to kick somebody out into a situation where they are homeless,  especially someone I care about and consider a friend. But my husband and I talked and we really feel like we've done what we can and if we don't stick to a hard deadline this will drag out forever. 

We talked to her and said she really needs to he out by the end of this month.  And reiterated that we could take care of her pets if she can't find a place that will take them. And asked if there was anything else we could do to help. She cried and then basically shut down. And now I feel like an asshole and like she probably hates me.",29,48,0.93
1326,Asshole,"Before you jump down my throat for being a sexist asshole, let me explain.

My wife is a stay at home mom to our 7 and 9 year old kids. I love her to bits but her cooking is atrociously bad. I don’t mean it just doesn’t taste good, I mean it’s often bordering on edible. Her serving undercooked or over cooked food is the norm, and there’s been a few times I have had to take food off the table to cook it more (not to be mean, but because I don’t want to risk serving our kids undercooked food).

So for our anniversary I thought it would be nice to enroll her into a couples cooking course with me. I figured it was a nice gift right? We get to spend time together, and she can learn how to cook properly.

Backstory;
There was an owner with a kitty who told me that he would have thrown her away if I wouldn't take it. I was forced to take her to my house. She was something like 2 weeks old. I tried calling animal shelter and they wouldn't take her ,, I tried having someone adopt her but couldn't find. So I took her as my project and took care of her, every day, despite over worning and barely sleeping I wanted her to live. I got attached to her...

2 weeks ago(kitten being something like 1.2 month old) I had to to abroad to see my girlfriend. I begged my mother to take care of her. I told her that I will put the kitten at the garden and all she has to do is put her food.
After endless arguements of how she's a victim about the situation she agreed. 2 days after I'm at the other side of the world I call my mother to make sure the kitten was ok. She said she couldn't feed her cause she doesn't want to buy her food so I Had my friend buy her cans and then she wouldn't feed her because it smell awful,,. So I had my sister do it. The kitten ran away (obv) after 3 days. And I was worried about her. Apparently my mother has already threw her little house I made for her to trash, the kitten was found by my sister at the neighbours. They fed her and my sister took her back.

I made a deal with my sister that I will pay her 300 dollars if she will take care of the kitten and feed her untill I come back.
She agreed. And well,, apparently my mother decided to take the kitten to some place and leave her there. She ""closed the deal""



The point:
Haven't spoken to my mother for the rest of the time I was abroad, completely ignored her and treated her like shit since I got back. She is non existent for me

My whole family don't understand why I find it so horrible, they say I should be thankful that she even agreed to have a outside cat in her house (yeah they don't fancy animals)

One day I was talking with my friends and the topic of showering came up. Everyone said they shower every two days or something and she straight up said she didn’t shower for around 2 months because she didn’t have the time (her Snapchat and Instagram stories say otherwise though). She definitely has the time for it and she comes from a rich family so she can afford the best products. I knew she didn’t take care of her hygiene but never expected it to be 2 months.

Some have been honest and said they're just not comfortable with that, which I understand, while others have waited a couple weeks before coincidentally dumping or ghosting me. I have no doubt it's due to my brother's career because of the timing. I normally wait a couple of months before disclosing this (otherwise I'd never get a second date...) and then get dumped only a week or two after disclosing this.

She's also done other stuff that's super awful and manipulative that would put me WAY over the character limit on this post. There's a lot.

She also has anxiety which means that she tends to disappear when she's done socializing (not an issue, I have anxiety, I get it) but she won't tell anyone and then we have a massive hunt for her (one time in the midst of my grandmother's (not related to her at all) funeral). 

The rules I want to impose are:
Do not go into the main cottage on the property (that's for everyone outside the wedding party though)

My husband currently has to commute about 3 hours per day for work. We live with my parents in a suburb far away from the city with most of the opportunities in his field, because housing is just too damn expensive to accommodate three kids and a dog in the city, even for just a two bedroom apartment. 

There’s an opportunity to get on a wait list for affordable housing, a place of our own, in a posh suburb much closer to the city.

Bit of history - Biomom and dad divorced when I was 3, dad got custody. Dad went to prison and mom got me for a year then she left. Stayed with my aunt for a year. 

Fast forward #1 - age 7, dad out of prison, Biomom back from Indiana, live with dad, dad marries stepmom who treated me far better than my Biomom (even if she was a bit over the top), and then at around age 12, Biomom vanishes off the face of the earth! 

She comes back at age 18. I had a good 10 years with her in my life, straight with no breaks. She even came to Texas to see me, something dad didn't do. 

It's now 2011, and biomom vanishes again! My half sister knows where she is, talks to her, sees her, etc. but wont tell me. I've somehow done something. I dont know what. My biomoms sister tells me this, cause half sister is now no longer speaking to me either. Aunt wont tell me what it is. She tells me that all it will do is anger me, as it is so mundane that I probably didn't even realize I had done anything wrong at all. 

Whatever, fuck it. It's not my fucking loss anymore. Right?

Stepmom just passed away, and I dont have it in me anymore to deal with whatever has caused this. Will you tell Biomom to call me please?"" Few days pass, and I get a response of ""Sorry for your loss, but we're not talking to you.""

I love her a lot, but she is very spoiled and her behavior when she’s all alone with me can often get quite terrible. She doesn’t give me **any** respect or view me as any type of authority when she’s in my care. She seems fearless; but just not too long ago, I found out one thing I **can** scare her with, and make her do I as I say.

Recently, she watched “Honey I Shrunk the Kids” for the very first time, and was both fascinated and terrified by it at the same time. My mom told me that she started nervously asking tons and tons of questions about shrink rays, and if it would be possible for somebody to shrink her, etc. In particular, she was freaked out by the scene in the movie where the boy falls into a bowl of Cheerios and almost gets eaten by his dad. She enjoyed the movie, but became really freaked out by the notion that it could happen in real life.

One day when watching my sister, I told her that I installed a shrink ray app on my phone that can resize different objects. She seemed a little skeptical at first, but I found a way to convince her. I went in her room, played some loud “zapping” noises for a long time until she came in, and before she got in hid her giant stuffed Scooby Doo, and replaced him with this extremely tiny Scooby Doo toy (that I found rummaging through my old stuff). She became convinced I’d shrunk her toy dog; an hour or so later, I “resized” him.

I told my sister a new rule for when I’m babysitting her - if she repeatedly acts up or disobeys me after many warnings, I am going to pull out my phone and use my shrink ray on **her**; and stick her in whatever meal I’m planning on having and eat her. She seemed **terrified** by that threat, and since then has been much, much better behaved.

From then on, every time she acts up and won’t stop, I’ll shoot her a sly little smile, and start reaching into my pocket and pulling out my phone. She’ll instantly start pleading not to shrink/eat her and apologizing. Whenever I make references to foods I’m having during our time together, I’ll work her name into the food name pun-style, and say things like, “If you act up tonight, I’ll be eating some delicious \[my sister’s name\] flavored ice cream.” My mom has yet to find out. Every time she comments on how it seems like we’ve been getting along better, I comment, “Her bad behavior has really **shrunken** this past month, hasn’t it?”, and shoot my sister an evil grin.

1341,Not the A-hole,"I’m a bridesmaid for one of my best childhood friends. She was engaged in February; wedding is in August, and she asked me in early March.

Shortly after, the bride texted the bridal party with instructions for buying our gowns: she’d placed the order at David's Bridal for one of three dresses, all the same color and length, but different necklines. All we had to do was go in, give her name to the employee, and they’d bring out the selected gowns to try on. We’d then choose our neckline and the person would access the bride's account and order the dress from there.

I did all of this within two weeks of receiving the information- tried on the dresses, told the girl my size/style, and paid. It was expensive ($200) but I brushed it off. About a week later it comes in and I pick it up.

Where things get messy:

A week or two after that, it comes to light that the store gave me the wrong dress- I was supposed to get a $100 knee length version, and they had instead ordered the floor length gown, causing the high price.

I had no part in this. The dress had been ordered directly from the bride’s account.

The bride tells me I have to exchange the dress ASAP. I told her directly - It’s busy season at work and I’m struggling. I work two jobs, so I’m often going from my office to my second job. On top of that I’ve been horribly ill - essentially, I can't make any promises, but will return the dress when I can. She gets upset and tells me that all the other girls have lives too, but all managed to make time for this. I remind her that I DID make time, weeks ago. She urges me again to make it a priority and we move on.

Which brings us to last Saturday. I tell the bride I’m returning the dress that day. She replies that it’s too late- the day before, the last bridesmaid ordered her dress and David's told her it was the LAST one of that type for the summer. I assumed David's bridal / the bride had ordered the short version of my dress immediately after learning of the mistake, and I simply had to drop off the dress I had. Apparently, this didn’t occur, and now the bride is saying that in order to be in the bridal party, I need to pay to have my dress altered to knee length, which will cost an additional \~$75. She’s telling me it’s my fault for procrastinating.

We’re all a year out of college. I’m broke, in student debt, and trying to start my career. This wedding will already cost me $500+ dollars in time off and travel. $275 for a dress I’ll wear once is insane. Also, the bride's pregnant sister is a bridesmaid and wearing the long version of the dress.

So far I haven’t responded beyond ""Let me see what I can do”. I’m considering telling my friend that I'm won’t pay for alterations- either she can pay, I can come in the long dress, or she can cut me from the bridal party. ☹ I’ll try to get David's to resolve this issue, but if they won't, WIBTA for not picking up the bill?

&#x200B;

EDIT: As almost all suggested, I went into David's and essentially did not leave until I was properly helped. It turned out they DID have a knee length version of that dress in my size after all(!). So the bride was not only incorrect, but freaking out over basically nothing, and that whoever I talked to on the phone multiple times simply did not understand what I needed somehow, or was looking up the wrong dress. Happy ending is that the short dress will be in my hands in 2 weeks, and that I was partially refunded (only $20, but still better than nothing) for the long dress. The only catch is that I still have to decide how I want to deal with the bride. I think I will let this one slip without making much of a fuss (especially as I am excited to see not just her, but many of my friends from my home town that I haven't seen in 2 years), but if she continues to be difficult leading up to and after the wedding, I will reassess the level at which I want the friendship to continue.

As we are walking, 3 kids (about her age or older) on the other end of the sidewalk were walking towards us, and called my sister fat. My sister is 100% self conscious about her weight because she is a bit on the heavy side, she told me after the confrontation that these boys were constantly bothering her and this wasn't the first time. The kids were laughing and actually stopped us from walking to continue making fun of her, every attempt we made to try and get around, they stopped us. I asked them to ""just have some common courtesy, and let us go on our way"", one of the kids had a basketball and started rubbing her stomach with it, he then bounced the ball off her head. I got in front of her and tried to just go through them, but one of them punched me in the gut, it didn't really hurt but I could feel the wind coming out of my stomach.

I stepped back and the kid did a baseball throw with the basketball at my face, but I put my hand in front of my face and blocked the throw, I then had a hold of the ball. I held the ball when one of the kids told me to ""give the fucking ball back so we can throw it at your sister"" while laughing, I looked at this tall fence that had tall grass and weeds on the other side, and threw it as far as I could over it, the owner of the ball ran toward the fence and his friends just stood on the street looking at him, while they were distracted I took my sister to the car, and drove home.

I left a message on the phone to the school about what happened, but thinking back, I feel like I made a huge mistake throwing the ball. I felt like I could have handled it better, AITA?",25,92,0.86
1346,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post...ever so please be gentle

&#x200B;

First a little back story, my mom and dad divorced when I was 3 and got split custody.  For 6 weeks every summer I would spent time with my dad but the rest of the time I was with my mom.  As a kid it was great, but as I got older, I started to see things you don't really notice as a kid.  For example he was 45+ years old and still lived with his mom, he couldn't hold down a job, he was almost $18,000 behind with child support, he complains about everything I have and do even though he has nothing of his own.  One year I decided to slack off in high school so I could stay with my friends instead of going to see my dad, and I figured if I used summer school as an excuse I didn't have to hurt his feelings because it wasn't ""my fault"" I couldn't go.

&#x200B;

The same year I didn't go see him I also signed up for the Army and as soon as I did that my father legally disavowed me.  He still talks to me and I still try to make things work with him but it stings knowing what he did.  Over the years he has come to visit (always on my dime)  but every time he comes to where ever I am stationed he does nothing but complain.  I am in Hawaii at the moment and last time he was here he said the beaches were to dirty (from natural things like tree nuts and sticks) he never wanted to do anything and shot down every idea my wife and I came up with.  Its to the point now that even my daughters (6, 4 & 4) understand that you can't make papaw happy.

&#x200B;

Now the reason for the post,  someone he works with has a lot of airline miles and just gave my dad a free trip to Hawaii for Memorial day.  He called and told me this a few days ago saying when his plane lands that I will need to be there to pick him up, even though its in the middle of the work day.  When I told him I was working and there is no way I could get away  he told me he expected my wife to take my daughter out of school early and then go pick him up and that I could walk home from work to meet them at my house.  This was the last straw for me and I told him no and that if he shows up that I'm not coming to get him and he would have to find someone elses weekend to ruin.

Of course now I feel terrible about what I said but he makes our lives miserable when ever he is around.",47,322,0.96
1347,Not the A-hole," So  we (Husband 32M, self 29F) have found evidence a couple times of the  neighbors behind us  sneaking into our yard. Yesterday I was in the  kitchen when one of the  kids took one of those emergency ladders that  hook onto windowsills and  climbed over the fence with it. I rushed out  saying ""what are you doing  get out."" he continued and ignored me.  Husband came out and told the kid to  leave and he did yelling that he  just wanted to get his ball, which he  left. Husband grabbed the ball  and left it on the front step  with a note saying ""next time ask"". The  mother than came into their  back yard and rather than apologize she  said ""the previous owners let  them do it all the time"".

2.5  months ago when it snowed we saw the footprints, that was the first  time we knew  it happened, and this was the first time we caught them in  the act. Are we in the wrong to think if they had asked first we would  have  considered it but since they did it without asking and then to  excuse it  that way, no apology nothing, that we are going to keep any  balls they  toss over from now on? Also the mother blamed us for getting  irritated by saying that the previous owners said it was ok. they are  not us.

&#x200B;

Basically AITA  for using the following plan - when they toss toys in our yard, we keep them, and they eventually have to walk around and ask for them. we state that we do not want them in our yard period. we are going to be getting a dog in the next year and we are stating they can't be in our yard and if they are we will call the cops.",101,204,0.96
1348,Not the A-hole,"Ok this one definitely needs some backstory.  So about 3 months ago my Husband was in an accident that left him with a concussion. Ever since this accident he has been telling people we have never met that he was in the Military. He ONLY does it to people he met AFTER the accident.This is basically the only lasting side effect of his concussion. At first I assumed it was a weird joke (he is like that sometimes) but then as it has continued I have had to tell people in private after about his accident. Up until now it really was not an issue.

Until 2 days ago, at the airport... While we were at our terminal, about to board, they called for Military service to get on the plane first. A lady in full army attire (camo) stands up and goes to the front. And, as you probably guessed, my husband followed behind. I kind of saw this coming, so I instantly tried to get my husband to sit down without making a scene. He hit my arm away and just looked confused. He continued walking towards the gate. At this point I am super embarassed and have no idea what to do. 
He gets in line and I again try and get him to come sit down without making a scene. He says ""leave me alone"" and I, in frustration, yelled ""YOU WERE NEVER IN THE MILITARY!!!"" 

As you can imagine, everyone stared and it was terribley embarassing and by far felt like the longest plane ride of my life. Ever since he has been mad at me but he seems incapable of seeing my side of things. 

Edit: he KNOWS he was not in the military. It is purely a social thing.

Am I the Asshole?",272,1318,0.96
1349,Not the A-hole,"My husband gets home much earlier than I do, typically around 3pm and I get home after 4pm. We have two dogs and they are usually fine roaming free in the house. They're both adult dogs and know not to make a mess in the house, etc. Sometimes accidents happen, I realize, but few and far between. Not enough to crate them the entirety of the day while we're at work. They're alone from 8am to 3pm.

But that isn't the issue. The issue is sometimes they *do* make a mess and I get to hear all about it like I took a shit on the floor myself.

Example, today my husband calls me and tells me they both had pooped on the floor. I told him I walked them this morning (which I did) and again at 11 on my lunch break (which I did) and neither of them squeezed anything out. He sat on the phone for several seconds in silence. Then he said ""I guess i'll clean it up"" and went silent again, to which I replied ""Well that looks like your only option.""

What I *wanted* to say is it's not going to clean itself the longer you're on the phone with me. Also, why are you holding me responsible for the mess the *dogs* made?

I am leaving to go home soon and I know he's going to have a sour look on his face when I get in the door. WIBTA if I told him to not call me at work again if it's about some dumb shit that he can handle on his own? I don't have anything to apologize for, do I?",89,354,0.96
1350,Everyone Sucks,[deleted],22,30,0.86
1351,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years, married for 7. We switch off spending the holidays with each other's family each year. This year, we had planned to spend Christmas with my husband's family. The majority of his family all live in the same midwest state, are super conservative, super into Christianity, and very much anti anything that doesn't align with that.

His family and I really don't see eye to eye on anything and they have made some seriously derogatory and anti-semitic comments regarding me and my family (I was raised Jewish, but don't currently have a religion). Needless to say, sometimes holidays with them are kind of tense, but I love my husband and I want him to have a relationship with the family.

We recently found out I'm pregnant. It's super early and we're really thrilled but my due date is literally the day after Christmas. I assumed that we would be spending it in our home because I would either have given birth or be about to but my husband seriously brought up travel plans last night for Christmas and what we were going to do. He figured that it would be perfectly fine to drive 16 hours up to see his family, spend 2 weeks there, and then drive back the day after Christmas. He was serious. I told him that his plan probably wasn't going to work and that my doctor probably wouldn't even approve travel plans that late on in my pregnancy. He could have cared less. Our discussion then turned to all the scenarios and reasons why I shouldn't go and why there are literally a million things that make this trip a terrible idea. The best case scenario is that I don't go into labor, but have to spend 32+ hours in a car when I'm 9 months pregnant to go see people who praised the synagogue shooter and who think I'm going to hell for killing Jesus. That's the best case. I tried to reason and compromise by telling him I would be willing to spend some time up there this summer and that we could spend the next Christmas with them. He would not budge.

Our discussion then turned into a full-on blowout where my husband told me I was being a selfish bitch and I told him that I wasn't going to risk my health and the health of our unborn child so that his racist parent could have a happy fucking holiday. There were other hurtful things said on both our parts and he stormed out. We haven't talked since but I did receive a passive-aggressive text from his mom saying how wonderful it would be to see us during the holidays and how it's their turn, so I'm assuming he told them something.

Family is important to both my husband and me, and I know a baby is a huge change. I genuinely want my child to have a relationship with their grandparents even if mine is strained but not at the expense of their and my health. Plus this should be a really happy time in my life and I just don't want to deal with that bullshit. Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE:** 

**I really appreciate everyone taking the time to chime in. My husband came home last night with flowers and potato chips (it's my snacky weakness), ready to sit down and talk like adults. He admitted he's a little bit overwhelmed with the idea of a baby, even though it was very much planned and we're very much excited and that he lashed out about Christmas because he feels like the baby is going to change everything. (which it probably will but in mostly good ways) He understands that is was an incredibly stupid idea for him to suggest going up there for Christmas and apologized for having his head up his ass. I apologized for calling him a dipshit and the other hurtful things I said. We ended up having a serious discussion about his parents and their viewpoints too.  We're planning a trip up there in June to announce the pregnancy and to hopefully have a productive conversation about boundaries and their horrific viewpoints.  I have mixed feelings about how that conversation is going to go but am hoping that they'll be open to hearing what we have to say, for me and our unborn baby's sake.  I would like to say I'm 100% sure of my husband and our marriage. This argument was stupid and really hurtful, but at the end of the day, we both were able to sit down and talk it out. No relationship is perfect but he was able to admit to his mistakes and I do believe with all my heart that at the end of the day, I'm his priority just like he is mine.**",73,101,0.92
1352,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR Kinda spazzy friend broke my living room window and wall while trying my VR system, didn't properly apologize or offer to help pay, cussed me out and said she wasn't in control of herself so it's not her responsibility.

My friend, ""Jan"", came to my house one afternoon to photograph my girlfriend, and afterwards, as she had never tried VR I thought I'd show her what it's like. Now, a quick background on Jan. She is a bit... spazzy. She gets over excited and is very physically animated, and all of our friend group knows it to be part of her character. I put her into a tutorial game and after she got acclimated, dropped her into SUPERHOT VR, which is a game where you shoot at and attack enemies who can run at you and shoot back. I have a relatively empty living room, which gives a VR roomscale playspace of about 7' by 10' to move around in. She played for 10 minutes fairly calmly, and all was well. However, during this time it seems she may have forgotten that she was even in VR at all. 

In a moment of sudden panic, Jan ran down a ""hallway"" in game -- which was actually straight into my living room window. She broke a 4'x5' window and put a hole in the wall with her knee. She was uninjured thankfully, but psychologically shocked by the situation. She kept saying ""why am I like this?"" over and over, as she apparently knew she could turn into a spooked feral cat. My girlfriend (who was there for the whole thing) and I both consoled her, took her out to lunch, bought her a beer and calmed her down. Afterwards, she went home. We didn't discuss how to handle the damage.

When several days passed with no text from her, I decided to reach out and ask if she was okay, adding further that I would pay for half of the damages. I was expecting a thank you, but she replied saying that we're seeing the situation differently, and that she doesn't see things as being her fault since it was my VR system and that she is ""not sorry because she had no control over what happened."" Those are her words, referenced directly from the texts. I explained that I don't believe that her loss of composure indemnifies her from responsibility, and stood by that it was generous and in no way required for me to offer to pay half. She cussed me out and agreed to pay for half the window. I turned her down and told her the money isn't the issue any longer, but rather that she wouldn't admit her mistakes and tried to turn things on me, even going so far as to text my girlfriend urging her to break up with me based on this situation. I never once said anything heated or rude to her, and maintained a rational perspective throughout our entire conversation.

My girlfriend and I both feel she is in the wrong here. Needless to say, she never apologized, but has repeatedly tried to have conversations with us at parties and gatherings as though we'd eventually just forget.",43,67,0.94
1353,Not the A-hole,"I love my parents more then anything else and we have a realy good relationship, thats why i live with my parents still in the same home, they are getting older you know...

My girlfriend accepts that and we all live in the same house.My gf has a brother and lets face it ""i dont like him"" is a euphemism for ""i hate him so much that iam sometimes mad at my gf for having this dude as a brother""This dude goes on antifa demonstrations like a champ and never worked a single day in his life, his parents alway´s gave him money and he owes nearly everyone of his friends money because of his drug abuse(only weed but still). He even asked me for money because his car broke down and i gave it to him after my girlfriend/his sister pleaded me to give it to him. To be fair he repaid all the money but it took him nearly 1 year and i dont know how he got the money.

On saturday  i witnessed a phonecall between my GF and her brother in which she said, that she cant let him become   homeless and she will ask me immediately. As soon as i heard that i walked up to her and said that i will not accept him anywhere near this house, she said that her parents kicked him out because he refused to search for any job´s but its her brother she cant let him become homeless and she begged me realy hard. I got realy angry and told her that i dont give a shit about him and when her brother lands on the street freezing he may think about his realy badlife decisions.But she kept begging me and even said she is about to jump in the car, get her brother and give him the key for the big guest room. I got even more mad and told here that i would throw her out before i let her brother take a single step over my threshold. She got mad i was already mad and we ceased talking for the rest of the day.

The next morning she begged me again and said her parents are kicking him out and that i just have to help him because he is a good dude. I laughed really hard at that because her brother is the biggest douch i know. She got mad again but i couldn´t care less. I asked my father for advice and he told me that it is my decision.

AITA because my decision is that i will not help this guy under any circumstance and will even throw away my relationsship for that?

1354,Not the A-hole,"So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for about a month, but we were talking for an additional month. He's really fun to hang out with, and is attentive and good in bed. The only problem is that he keeps bringing up kids.

I have said that I didn't want kids every single time he brings it up. He keeps saying that ""women change their minds"" and that ""everyone doesn't want kids at 19."" I keep reiterating to him that I will never become a mother and he has to be okay with that. He says he's okay with me not wanting kids, but he keeps bringing up a hypothetical future with kids.

On mother's day I reached my breaking point. He asked me what I would want for mother's day. I said I wanted nothing because I will never become a mother. And then he ASKED AGAIN. I sent a pissed off looking emoji and was distant to him the rest of the night.

AITA for being pissed that he won't drop the subject of motherhood/listen to my wishes? I'm not that experienced in the relationships department, but I feel like one month is WAY too soon to be talking about marriage/kids, especially because I'm 19.

I do his laundry, help him with food, help him buy what he needs to survive, and let him shower at my house. We are no longer together but I still try to help because he is my daughters dad! I want my daughters dad to be okay. 

He in turn just starts expecting more and more from me. He also pisses all his own money on cigarettes and booze. I try to help but he doesn’t seem much grateful for it. 

Mother’s Day rolls around and he asks if I want to sign a card for his mother so I do. Then he gives me a quick happy Mother’s Day and that is that. No card, no letter, no flowers, NOTHING. It’s not like I was expecting the world because I know he is jobless and homeless. He did nothing for me.

I texted him and told him he hurt my feeling and he said sorry for not getting you a card. Have a great day. Basically shutting the conversation down.

I decided not to tell her then, but instead tell her after she is done with her classes and has some free time before she meets up with a friend for dinner, and so she doesn't have to stress over it in class.

I let her know that she has a few hairs on her chin, and reassure her that I do not care that she has them at all.  Upon telling her she tells me it was rude to bring it up to her.  I thought she would want to know before she met with a friend.

So, after I got home from work 3 days before Christmas, there was a party at my house. Before dinner was to be served, all the children, one aunt and my grandmother were downstairs playing this game with bells that were supposed to sound like Christmas tunes. I get asked to go downstairs and play the game. After about 2 minutes, my (17M) head was hurting and I was getting a sensory overload. At that point I had no tolerance for that noisy crap because I was tired from work after opening the store at 8 that morning and working til 4:30. My grandma said that being tired from work was no excuse to not participate in a simple activity like that. My mom said I was not the A because the game was annoying her too.

I am going out of town for a week and after that she is going away for two weeks so we won't see each other for awhile.  So the intention was for this to be a nice evening together. I paid for the dinner and it was my idea, if that is relevant.

Anyways I went to pick her up and she came out and she looked... like she didn't care at all.  Jeans and a hoodie, maybe a little makeup.  So I commented on it, like ""Geez I thought you might want to get done-up a little bit tonight.""

Anyways she totally lost it and started calling me an asshole and telling me I ruined the evening and made her feel like an idiot. Now we're going to be apart for several weeks, so obviously not the best way to leave things.

She's generally not the type to care much about looking great, but she is a good-looking girl and she is more than capable of putting it together for one night.  I just feel like she takes me for granted and doesn't care anymore.

AITA here?  I don't ask for much, but I just figured a night like that would justify a little effort.

EDIT: I am adding in this small caveat. I was not upset that she didn't look good, it is more that it just seems like she doesn't care enough to try and impress me anymore. Anyways it seems like the verdict is already coming in loud and clear, and I am the asshole.  Lol oops.

EDIT 2: Well I accept the fact that I am the asshole for saying something. But I am 100% not accepting of the idea that I should just accept my girlfriend no matter what.

1362,Asshole,"I graduated high school last December and as sort of a fill in before I start college in the fall, I took a job as a receptionist at a day spa. Most of our clients are pretty cool and I have no issues with them. However there is this guy ""Ron"" who always requests the ""prettiest"" therapist and he just gives me the massive creeps. 

Ron had an appointment yesterday with our therapist named ""Jenny"" who is one of his favorites. Well in the morning Jenny called in sick. I made several calls to the number on file for Ron to let him know but kept getting a number disconnected message. Ron showed up to his appointment and I told him I'd had to swap him with ""Amber"" who is absolutely the number one therapist in the place. 

Ron told me he was not happy with the change and wanted to reschedule. I told him that we require 24 hours notice to cancel. He said that can't possibly be true if its ""your mistake.""  I told him he could either take the appointment with Amber or pay in full. He asked to meet Amber first. Well as soon as he saw Amber (she is very overweight) he said that he was sorry but he just couldn't take the appointment. Amber said it was fine but I could tell it really hurt her feelings, so as soon she went in back I asked Ron if he'd like to explain to me why he wouldn't take the appointment with Amber. He told so rudely that it was none of my business.  I told him he's literally standing in MY business. He was so rude I finally clapped back at him and told him either he take the appointment with Amber, he pay for it I would put him on the ""never serve"" list. He asked what my owner would think about this. I clapped back that my owner doesn't tolerate prejudice of any kind and Ron walked out. I immediately put him on the never serve list. 

Well this morning I got a call from my owner saying I didn't handle myself well at all and my employment is under review. I guess Ron called her this morning and absolutely lied about what happened yesterday. So I know how to approach the owner when she calls me back, can people give me feedback if maybe I was wrong yesterday? To me prejudice is never ok and it doesn't matter why.",484,445,0.8

I (29f) have an 11 month old son with my fiance (30m). We've been together for 8 years now. We both work full-time, and our son goes to crèche. When we're home, I do all the cleaning, meal prep, dishwashing, laundry, tidying of baby things, etc etc. I also get up at night for the baby (teething, amirite?) and take care of the basic baby bathing, feeding, changing, playtime, etc. My fiance helps with bath time, and sometimes helps with meal times, but generally, it's mostly my ""job"" (I've always wanted to be a mom, thus job is in inverted commas). 

This past Mother's Day was my first Mother's Day, and I got nothing. Not like I expected a gift (I didn't), but I expected a gesture or anything really, to make me feel special. It's not like we're not observers of Mother's Day either, because we always spend the day with my fiance's mom. (My mom lives super far away, so we generally spend the Christmas season with her.) 

We went Mother's Day gift shopping the day before, where he kept asking me to choose a gift for myself from our son, so I insisted that I a) didn't want to choose my own gift, and b) it's not only about the gift, he could also let me sleep in and do breakfast in bed, as an example. Roll on Mother's Day and we're up and about with baby, prepping stuff for lunch at his moms. I'd wrapped both his mom's and my stepmom's gifts the night before, so we could hand each mom their gift fairly early on in the day. On that afternoon, his mom wished me happy Mother's Day, and I said ""thank you, [fiance] hasn't even wished me yet, so it's nice to hear"". Oh how they all laughed. 

When we got home that evening, I told my fiance I was really upset he f#cked up my first Mother's Day, to which he said ""but I told you to choose a gift and you didn't want to"". I said the gift wasn't the point, it was about the effort, and he put in zero.

1366,Not the A-hole,"Obviously this happened years ago but it still makes me feel guilty. 


The day Hurricane Sandy was supposed to hit, my mom and her husband realized they were in a flood zone. I wasn’t, and told them they could come to my apartment. They wanted to go to a shelter instead, packed up their three kids (ages 1 - 4) got in the car, and my mom’s husband said he isn’t going to the shelter, he’s staying with the house and my mom will have to go to the shelter on their own.

My mom panicked because she didn’t want to go to a shelter with three kids by herself so I got a phone call demanding I go to the shelter. I told them again that my apartment is in the safe zone and I’m not going anywhere, but they can come to my apartment. I also had three cats that I wasn’t willing to leave alone during a hurricane or crate and take to a shelter for who knows how long.

We argued but eventually they gave in and came to my building. I went downstairs to help them bring the kids in, but the kids were fighting me and my mom and making it really difficult to get them into the building. While my mom and I struggled with the kids my mom’s husband just sat in the car and watched.

When we got the kids to my apartment I found out my mom’s husband told the kids that if they come to my apartment they will die. 

Once at my apartment my mom was panicking, I had to argue with her because she wanted to go back to her house to be with her husband and I thought it was a bad idea. Her husband was calling every half hour, if not more, and once he called while my mom was in the bathroom I picked up the phone and told him that my mom was in the bathroom and couldn’t come to the phone, and he just hung up without saying anything. 

The next morning when I woke up my mom started screaming at me because while I was asleep she went through my computer and found chat logs where I was complaining about everything that was going on, and my mom was mad that I was ‘telling other people about family things.’ 

By the time my mom’s husband came to pick them up I was just emotionally exhausted and wanted to get away from them. My mom’s husband told me that the house was damaged, that there were holes in the walls, and they needed my help to clean up the damage. I couldn’t handle the idea of being around them any longer and said no.

Now I feel like an asshole for not helping them because I know they were panicking and not handling it well but it’s also been so long since I talked to them that I think I’m just not remembering how exhausting they are. Also with all of his phone calls to my mom why did he spring it on me that he needed my help instead of giving me some warning. Maybe I could’ve mentally prepped for going with them instead of spending the morning just looking forward to being alone only for him to tell me he had other plans for me.",58,231,0.94

Couple of nights ago, my 2yo sister refused to go to sleep. I (15m) was babysitting her while our parents were out. She wanted to keep playing and cried dramatically when I put her in bed. I tried telling her stories and showing her YouTube videos but she kept trying to sneak out. I was really tired and frustrated from everything. That's why I told her a witch would come and scare her unless she closed her eyes. After that she fell asleep within 10 minutes.

1371,Not the A-hole,"  Mother’s Day is awkward when all your mom wants to do is sit by the gate with “the equalizer” across her lap.  🤦‍♂️

  

  I was assigned to make a persuasive presentation for Friday about something I feel strongly about. (this is for high school elective.) Since I live on a family dairy farm, the topic I chose was the Increasing Herd Sizes and Decreasing Number of Herds in our industry—in other words, family farms changing or dying! So as part of the presentation, I went around my family’s farm and photographed some of the daily life stuff with the cows: the feed racks/stanchions, vacuum pumps, veal housing (think a bunch of doghouses with chain dog leashes)

While presenting you would think I was talking to an alien race who had never bought a cheese stick before. One girl asked why there was so much calf housing, and I was like seriously? You know why. And she keeps asking, so I explained that the cows have to give birth every year to make the milk, and obv 🙄  we can’t keep the calves because not killing them costs money, first in the milk they would drink and then the incredible amount of grain a grown a-s cow would need, and we would double the herd size every year until the world was full of cows—it’s simple math.

 I think some people just pretend not to know it so they can drink milk in peace. But she and some other girls acted soooo horrified  😱  and sooo surprised  😱 , and my presentation got derailed, and I ran out of time. I didn’t even show the last three pictures. It's the insincerity that bothers me--I don't like ppl being FAKE.

When I went home and told my mom about my frustration, she freaked out about me sharing pictures of the farm with “outsiders.” She seems to think that animal rights activists are going to descend like an army and vandalize us or free the calves before we can do what we do with them. But my whole lie she’s told me to be proud of what we do and that we do it better than other herds, so why not show it proudly? And why would I KNOW it was a secret if she never told me?",93,64,0.84
1372,Not the A-hole,"My STBXH gave me a Mother's Day gift yesterday... it was supposed to be from our daughter, to me, but she's in preschool, and obviously needs some help.  I was thinking he'd help her pick out something small.  Maybe a bath soap and lotion set or chocolates, nothing outside of the $25-$35 range.

Instead, he got me an annual pass to a popular local theme park (over $500).  In the card, he wrote that it was so I could take our daughter to said theme park.  However, he did not pay for her annual pass.  He expects us to ""split"" her pass.  WIBTA for telling him his gift is inappropriate?  Yes, he spent several hundred dollars on me (and I neither expected nor wanted that much spent on me), but on a gift that forces ME to spend several hundred more dollars before I can use it as intended.  And that money is before we factor in $25 parking for every visit, plus ridiculously overpriced concessions.

1374,Not the A-hole,"I'm asking because I'm autistic and never know what's rude and what's not. I thought my brother was being a douche at the time, but now I'm not so sure.

So my brother offered to drive me down to the store. It's a five minute drive. I thanked him and climbed in the car. Here's something I said that might've been bitchy: ""wow, you've got a lot of stuff in here."" I didn't say it condescendingly or anything, it just kinda came out. My brother laughed at this and replied with ""yeah, I need to clean it out sometime."" He didn't seem bothered at all, and he's not the type to care what people say.

So he turns the car on and starts playing the music. It's LOUD, like loud enough to vibrate the car. I'm oversensitive to loud noises, so I immediately cover my ears and say, ""Jesus fucking Christ!""

Brother turns to me and says, ""you know that being in my car is a privilege, right? I'm driving you out of the kindness of my heart. I could kick you out and make you walk.""

Confused and angry, I ask him if he wanted me out of the car. I say I wouldn't be mad and if he wanted me out, I'd get out. 

I ask if me swearing at the sudden loud noise was the reason. He answers with: ""just remember that I'm being really nice here. I could kick you out right now"" and drives me.

1376,Asshole,"Going to start this with I know I'm an asshole. In this case, I also know I am part of the asshole to blame. My wife wanted me to post this because she thinks it is all on me. I am willing to find out if the majority think with her or with me.

Some background so that you realize I am not here looking for relationship advice. My wife and I have been married for over 20 years and with dating up to about 30 years. Our relationship is anything but perfect and our primary dynamic is bickering. Also I am a certified Lazy POS and my wife is a workaholic who will invent work to do if she doesn't have anything to do. So there is a rub as well.

On to our story. Arrive home from Costco. Unload the car and get everything inside, either on the counter or stacked up just inside the door. Wife starts working on the kitchen items and I start lugging all the heavy shit downstairs and putting it away. I get done with the heavy stuff, see that she has about 7-8 items left and I go sit down and turn on the TV. She see this and tells me that we aren't done and that she is still working and I need to come help. I tell her that I am done with my part (yes I know it is all part of it, but hmmmmm) and that she can finish up the light stuff. Here is the crux of the argument. I say that I finished moving the heavy things that she can't (or at least not without great trouble) move and I don't think I need to come help her with the rest. She, well within her rights I don't disagree, tells me to ""get off my lazy ass"" and help her with the rest. Bicker mode ""Engage""!

I say that if she doesn't like the arrangement, I will unload the lighter stuff, which will take longer and she can deal with the heavy shit and that is acceptable to me, OR we can do it all together, meaning that we can both start with either heavy or light and do it all together. I said that either of those are acceptable to me, but griping at me that I am not doing my share when I am doing the things that she will struggle with or will be incapable of doing are not the same. She is not on board with either of those because the heavy stuff is too heavy for her.

So there we have it. Yes I know I am an asshole already. Pretty much prepared for that, but what I want to know from the community is if I am the sole asshole or is this an ESH where she bears some of the blame.

We both eagerly await your judgement.

EDIT- Trying to clear up some things.

1. I AM LAZY! This is not from her calling me lazy. Or anything exterior. This is self-actualization. I KNOW I am lazy. I would rather not do things. This is not to say that I don't take care of my responsibilities. I am lazy when it doesn't matter. Clean the garage or play video games? Not a competition. Both cars fit in the garage. Nothing is in the way or causing danger. Fuck that. It doesn't have to be done right now. That kind of lazy. Not the snort cocaine, sell the TV and not have a job lazy.

2. Relationship, therapy and counseling - LOL. Thanks for everyone's advice that I/we need to seek counseling immediately. I tried to make it clear that this relationship dynamic is part of who we are as a couple. It may sound bad to you, but it works for us. We actually love each other. We are each other's best friend. Let me know if you never argue with your friends. Now live with that friend for 20+ years and see how it goes. Not to mention, if you haven't before now, please see above. I AM LAZY! Divorce would be a complicated, time sink pain in the ass! Not to mention I would then probably have to date and try and find someone else. Then I would need to spend a year getting used to all that person's weird idiosyncrasies. Not to mention dating and all the hassles that come with that. PASS. 

IATA -  Looks like the consensus is I am pretty much the sole Asshole here. Damn. Fine. I will help her with the small shit. (Not that I normally don't anyway, but apparently it will look better to the therapist if we play the ""he never helps put away the groceries"" card instead. ;p) I maintain my right to bitch and complain about it however!

Thanks everyone. Today my wife gets to be the mayor of ITOLDYOUTOWN.

Final Edit - Shit goes DOWN! (aka the only place 

So the wife came home and ...

Sorry. No big drama here. Just a regular old married couple talking to each other. Here is where you can turn back to 18 and Knocked up if not interested in the mundane details of couples doing normal couple shit.

Wife walks in. I immediately announce that I have posted our question to the rabble, ( I talked you all up a bit more than that.) and the verdict is in.

She comes around the corner and gives me a cool stare. ""Aaaand?"" Because she already knew the answer because by now you would know my wife is wicked smaht. And of course I LIED MY FUCKING ASS OFF!!! Told her that barely anyone was on her side and that most people said if I didn't divorce her she should be so goddamn lucky!

Game! Set! Match! ASSHOLE!!!!! We always win!

And if my comments hadn't been downvoted into oblivion by some crazy ass mofo's you would already know that nothing of the sort happened because DUH. Actual couple. Actual life. Actual husband and wife that oddly aren't just the one little snapshot we present as a little glimpse into our own personal fucked upedness (not a word), but rather a complex intertwined web of two individuals who, over time have made a whole.

Anyway so of course I told her that she was overwhelming correct and I am in fact, no shock to anyone in that room, an asshole. Not all the time, but definitely in this case. At which time we got to sit down and have a nice chat about our relationship. Which is something I know many of you will find shocking, but we do quite a bit.

I told her that everyone online (with a few exceptions of what seems to be mostly older married couples oddly enough. not odd) thought our relationship was dysfunctional and that we needed to seek professional help immediately. To which she didn't immediately respond that's stupid. (Duh duh DUHHHH!!!! Now we are getting to the juicy stuff. I knew this guy was a real dick. Interwebs JUSTICE! (Parenthetical break inside a parenthetical break? Is this even legal? Think Deadpool here. I have to explain my humor to some folks because even after all this crazy shit I have typed, they still don't seem to get it. So just dropping this off here. The previous parenthetical break was as if I were speaking in the voice of someone with a justice boner for this post and that was hoping I would get my comeuppance (<-- real word. How deep does this fucking go. Inception post)))

Where did I drop that train of thought. There it is. So yeah she gave me the thoughtful silence for a few moments before responding. I wasn't running a tape recorder so all of this is paraphrase (with my own voice since I done spent all them college years learning to write good), but she said that there would be no point because what would we be trying to solve? We know each other. She says what I lack in our relationship is perspective. With regards to us, I only have myself and I always think I am right. I need outside perspective often because I tend to be my own echo chamber. (She's spot on with this one.) As for the rest, she knows I am a ""lazy"" (man that word sure launched a thousand tirades. Triremes? Helen of Troy? Trojan War? Too much?) bitcher, as in one that likes to bitch. But she has shit about her that I have to deal with as well. Basically we aren't the exact same people we were 20-30 years ago, but we are still them. Our edges have filed away over the years. Especially the ones that bump up against one another. If I was still the same person that I was 20 years ago, we would be divorced. But the opposite also holds true. If she would have remained the same, I would have been gone (me here: Didn't you say you were too lazy to get a divorce?? Remember, if you can follow my twisted train of thought, this is me paraphrasing my wife). But we have mellowed a lot. Said that when we first got married, she wouldn't even ask me to take care of even trivial married stuff because she didn't want to endure the bitchfest I would put on.(Interactive mode back on)

Of course I wasn't standing for that because it didn't ring true. We talked about how I always had to do the appointments for our first house because I had the flexible schedule and I was always doing stuff. To which she thought and responded yes. And then after a little more back and forth we decided that the purchase of our first home was sort of a watershed moment in my penchant for lapsing into grousing. (Felt like bitching was getting played out) And again ( I really can't stress this enough) since we are adults in an almost loving caricature (you don't know, until now, but I had to google how to spell caricature. I totally spaced it) of a romantic relationship, we determined that I definitely took on much greater responsibility in the relationship as a consequence of our first house purchase. (That place was a dump by the way and we polished that turd up as shiny as we could get it given our limited budget and still burgeoning total ignorance of anything home care related.) ""You resigned yourself to your fate."" Direct quote which I thought was hilariously true. For which she determined that she was happy that it happened before we got our daughter, because if I had still been the same procrastinating, ""don't bother me with that shit"" jackass that I had been before my metamorphosis (hah. But seriously. How often do you get to use that word. I'm keeping it just for that reason alone) or acceptance of my fate, if you will, then I would probably be a weekend dad at this point. So for those of you who think I suck now, I used to be worse! But then again so was she. And to those of you that think we are self centered. You are right. We have always been jealous of our time alone as much as we have been of our time together. We found the balance that worked for us. Because we are both a bit self centered, we get that trait in the other and can work around it. See how it works? Her need to be a control freak dovetails nicely into my ""I don't give a fuck about (Insert something that doesn't matter and that I truly don't give a fuck about HERE)."" (Again, for the humor impaired, she really isn't a complete control freak and I give a fuck about a lot of stuff in our relationship.) And while presented humorously, it is also true. 
For example. She loves planning trips. I don't mean, we should go to Disneyland. Let's look for some hotels loves to plan. She LOVES TO FUCKING PLAN! I am talking binders, travel times, bus schedules, full itineraries, hours of operation for the sites we will visit. Embedded pictures and maps. Yes I am talking in the age of tablets, we still get binders. The electronics just opened new vistas for her planning. And I like to not do any of that. I know. Knock you off your perch with a feather right? But I LOVE to drive. And she would rather not. So BAM! Couples therapy avoided by getting to know your spouse. Amirite?

So if you have somehow read all the way down to here. Just know that after our nice little chat, I looked over at my wife and she said, ""You realize there is a price for all this don't you?"" And I said, ""No I didn't actually. What price do I have to pay?""

She looked at me and said,"" I need about tree fiddy.""

Can you imagine reading thru all of this bullshit and this is just some shitty meme? It's not, but man that would have been absolute GOLD, Jerry! Yep with the exception of the Loch Ness Monster at the end, the rest of it is all true. Sorry. Sometimes us folks on the internet are just folks. Sorry our fucked up relationship doesn't match your fucked up relationship. Or that you feel we are just deluding ourselves still after all this time. Thanks everyone for your concern. As you can see, my wife knows my shit inside and out. Sometimes she just gets to let me hang myself and lets me play out all the rope I want.

I'd keep going, but I think Kylie Jenner is about to reveal something about a new foundation. Can't miss that.

1378,No A-holes here,"So a few months ago for Christmas, I got a giant bear (about the size of me, 5 ft tall) as a christmas present from a friend, because we always called each other bears (he was my big brother bear and I was his cub).

Background info: I'm a student in uni, and i live about 700 miles away from home.

&#x200B;

However, as the semester is ending, I have no where to store the bear over the summer and I can't ship it home. I don't really need a giant teddy bear in my dorm room/room at home and while I really appreciated the gift, it was obvious I needed to do something with it.

My sister suggested just throwing it in a dump, but I emailed around and found an organization that helps kids/families dealing with pediatric cancer. A person from that organization that conducts fundraising reached out to me saying they auctioned off a similar bear for $750 last year, and the money would be put to a good cause.

&#x200B;

However, I can't help but to feel a little bit guilty, since this was a big bear + probably costed a lot of money + kind of sentimental. I asked my friend what he thought, and he seemed kind of ambivalent /maybe a little sad?

AITA for giving away this gift?

1379,Not the A-hole,"Let me start off by saying that I am absolutely a feminist and believe in equality for everyone. Many of my best friends are women, and while I will never truly understand what it means to be a woman in America, I'd like to think I'm at least empathetic to their struggle.

With that said, last night at dinner a female friend of mine was complaining about how stressful work is and how understaffed she is. I mentioned that I have a (male) friend who has a lot of good experience and is looking for work, and she said thanks but she's not interested in hiring a man for this position. She's not really interested in hear about his experience or meeting him, even if he's perfect for the job, SOLELY because he's a man. 

That quickly spiraled into a very heated argument about sexism. I thought it was fucked up for her to completely write off this prospective employee because of his gender. She said that while she has hired men for other jobs in the past, she needs a woman for this particular position. She said that she's going to be spending 10 hours a day with this person and wants it to be woman. And eventually she proclaimed that women have been suffering injustices in American society for a long time, and that it's morally important to her to hire women to sort of fight for an underprivileged class that she identifies strongly with.

I mean, imagine if I needed to hire somebody for my company and she said her friend would be perfect. And then my response was ""Thanks but I'm really not interested in hiring your friend because she's a woman, and I need a man for this job""... I would be practically crucified on the spot.

So Reddit, am I the asshole here? Do I need to be more sensitive and understanding in regards to the female struggle for equality in America? Or is this some weird reverse sexism that's being slowly normalized in our culture and needs to be called out and corrected?

​

TLDR: Friend owns a small business and refuses to hire my other friend solely because of his gender and I called her out for being sexist.

Edit: Since people seem to want more context, the businesses is very small. 2-3 full time employees + contractors, in a traditionally male-dominated industry that involves driving trucks and physical labor in a large American city. The position she would be hiring for is a contractor. Also, she’s attractive and has been sexually harassed and has been in some uncomfortable situations with men a few times since she was a teenager.

1389,Asshole,"Alrighty, before I launch into a more long-winded version of my question, let me state for the record that I haven’t done this *yet*. I’m just wondering if I would in fact be the asshole if I *were* to. 

That being said, here’s the scenario: I work the graveyard shift at my city’s hospital doing glorified janitorial work. I have very little (almost non-existent) oversight from management, and am pretty much left to my own devices, so long as I complete my assignments by the end of the shift. 

The problem is, I’m significantly quicker than my peers, and often find myself finished with my route several hours before the end of my shift. On most nights, I’ll use that time to do extra detail work, or catch up on homework. 

Some nights though, like tonight, I just can’t keep my eyes open. If you’ve never worked nights before, it’s hard to explain the never ending exhaustion that comes with it. But suffice it to say that every once in a while you just need a place to nap. 

Which brings me to my question. There’s a mother’s lounge tucked away in a quiet part of the hospital for nursing mothers to feed their babies. It’s small, meant for only one person at a time, and has the most comfy looking recliner I’ve ever seen. I’d normally feel just fine taking a quick power nap at work once I’m finished with my work, but I feel kinda of off about napping in there, given it’s intended use. 

So, Reddit: WIBTA if I napped there? (For the record, I sanitize the room anyways, and figured I would just clean it again afterwards)

Edit: Alrighty, it looks like so far the consensus is that IWBTA. Which I can agree with, I kinda felt that way beforehand. That’s why I came to Reddit in the first place, I wanted a non-biased 3rd party opinion. 

However, some things I need to clarify: I didn’t mean sleeping there for hours, I meant during my scheduled breaks, so no more than 30 minutes per shift. And when I say “quiet corner of the hospital”, I mean it’s closed down at night, and there’s no way to get in there unless you’re staff. If I see anyone back there, I’m supposed to call security. 

I still accept the judgement so far, but a few comments and PMs are getting kinda nasty/irrelevant",161,271,0.92
1390,Not the A-hole,"I live by myself in a one bedroom apartment in an old building in NYC. My daily routine includes getting up early to go to the gym and then cooking myself breakfast any time between 7:00am to 8:00am, depending on the day. I eat the same thing everyday: a three egg Denver Style omelette. My kitchen is close to the my floor's hall and I don't have a range or hood over my stove; whenever I cook, the smell tends to linger around my apartment. To mitigate the smell, I tend to leave the windows open, but that's about 50 feet away from my kitchen.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last week one of my neighbors on my floor (who I don't know), yelled out as she was leaving for work: ""It smells like shit to whoever cooked that."" She was probably referring to me. I shook it off, but also took care to make sure I wasn't burning my food. Sometimes I burn the omelette (such as the peppers or onions), but I don't mind because I like a firm omelette. There is never any smoke coming off the pan that would indicate intense burning. I also stopped running the pan directly under cooled water after cooking because that kicks up a lot of steam, which made the problem worse.

&#x200B;

That comes to this morning, while I'm sitting here eating my breakfast and I overhead the same neighbor again mumble this time: ""It always smells awful everyday"". Again, I don't know her and I have no interest in discussing the matter with  her. However, I do feel bad that my cooking may be affecting my neighbor negatively. I've lived in this building for two years now and have been cooking this breakfast repeatedly for the past year and a half. This is the first time I've heard any complaints.

So am I the asshole? Should I change what I eat so they don't have to smell it?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I cook the same breakfast nearly every day, but my stove doesn't have a hood to collect any smoke that comes off the pan. The smells waft into my apartment's hallway. Neighbor audibly complains about it, but does not know me or know that it's me.

Edit: Yes I realize now that I shouldn’t run a hot pan under water. Thank you for everyone who mentioned it. I have stopped doing that.",236,622,0.96

 It was also during testing, so she was disrupting other classes as well. This school does not have doors on the classrooms. It's an open environment, they all share a hallway, which makes it even more disruptive. 

There was also a student of hers crying right before parent teacher conferences because they were so scared of what the teacher would say. Im sorry, but conferences should NEVER be that stressful to a 3rd grader!

Many (5-7) years ago I was seeing a girl briefly that I did not treat very well. I've done a lot of growing up since then, and have been in a happy relationship for 4 years, and I now recognise that I absolutely was a total asshole to her and sincerely regret how I treated her. I've always wanted to apologise to this girl, though I have no way of getting in contact (she seems to have deleted her FB from what I can tell). More recently I've been thinking a lot about her, specifically how I treated her, and really would like to get in touch to let her know how sorry I am and make amends if I can.

The issue I have is, I'm not sure how much the apology would be for her, and how much would be for me to feel better about the past. So WIBTA if I tried to get in contact and apologise?

Edit 3: removed previous edits to keep the post concise.

I've reflected on this a lot from your comments and I think a lot of people are right and the apology would be for me and would likely not benefit her at all, and at worst bring back feelings that had been dealt with.

Background Story: My sister got me an expensive gift for my 21st (around £400), so when her 21st come around she mentioned how she was expecting something in a similar price range. Her birthday was just one week before my wedding so, bearing in mind I was spending thousands on this one day, I told her I couldn’t afford a big gift so I’ll get her a small one this year and then get her a big one for her 22nd. She reluctantly agreed. 

So now we’re coming up for her 22nd and she keeps bringing up this big present I’m supposedly getting her, but you know what - I don’t wanna. 

I have a wife, a family and a home to pay for and I’m trying to save for a house. I’ve paid probably close to £1000 for her college courses in the past 4 years, and I always get her a decent present. As soon as I opened my present she mentioned how I better give her a good gift when her 21st comes around. She gets me one present once and now it’s like I owe her? You shouldn’t give only to receive. 

Am I the asshole for telling her she’s just getting a regular present?

Edit: My sister has never paid me back for college, and I don’t want her to, and I’ve never taken money off of her. She’s on more money than anyone in our family but still takes from everyone. 
She got really angry at the time when I said I couldn’t afford the present so I guess I just promised her a big gift next year to keep her quiet so I could get on with planning the wedding. I was stressed. 

I guess the thing that annoys me the most is the principle. We’re not kids anymore, we don’t need, or should expect, big expensive presents.",38,90,0.92

I have two dogs also, and I love them and I know how much care they need, still I know that having a pet doesn’t make you a mother: you don’t suffer for 9 months, you don’t get into labour, you don’t wake up at night for months to feed him, you don’t spend every day of your life hoping for him to be successful.

You may love him, but he’s not a kid and humanising your pet is kinda creepy to me,
So this friend of mine pretended me to wish her happy Mother’s Day, as a joke at the beginning but then she became quite oppressive with this request till I got pretty upset and told her that she’s not a mother, she’s just a pet owner that loves her dog very much as many of us do but this doesn’t make her a mother.

Obviously she got upset and called me A-hole, so here I am asking your opinion: AITA?

EDIT: apparently I badly expressed myself. I thought that “spend every day of your life hoping for him to be successful” was pretty inclusive of all kind of parenthood, not only biological.

Then my MIL arrived from overseas for her 4 week holiday with us, cue shifting the 2 teenagers into one room. Hub can take no time off work (new job) and refuses to not attend the volunteer work that he does on the weekends and some weeknights. So I was in host mode for the whole time. She’s a lovely lady but quite confused as to why Hubs was always not there, and teens were... well teenage girls rather than the little girls who’d run around after you. Essentially it was fine but I was feeling under some pressure. So a week after she left I’d friends coming in from overseas for 10 days that had been in the planning for years. Due to some visa problems the date kept changing but we finally had it nailed in. I was going to have them crash with us - lounges, tents and so on - when I realised I was really not looking forward to them arriving. This made me really sad. At the same time hubs informs me that a couple we know and their one year old would also be staying with us for 2 nights mid that week. It meant that we would have had 3 couples, 2 singles 3 teens and a toddler in a house with exactly 4 rooms plus a bathroom. During school term. Nope nope nope. 10 days ago, I decided my friends could rent a house in a nearby beachside town and all hang there as needed and my house remain a sanctuary. Hubs friends could also find their own place. I told mine and they are so awesome about it and it’s working out great, I left hubs to tell his friends. He didn’t.

My dad died a few years back and my mom had no friends or family nearby, so I [25F] and my then-boyfriend now-husband [30M] moved in with her from a few states away. So I live with my husband and mom. Mostly we all love each other, but sometimes my husband feels like I choose my mom over him because my mom can be very needy and gets lonely easily, and we have had several fights over it.

We have two cats also, that go in a very large kennel at night because they are also very needy and will wake you up every five minutes to be petted. My husband usually rounds them up and gets them in there.

We're going on a 6 day trip in a day because my husband's sister is getting married a couple of states away, and up until now my mom has said that she has felt okay putting the cats to bed by herself for the days we'll be gone. But tonight she suddenly threw a huge fit, saying that she doesn't know if she can do it and she's insulted we didn't think of her.

I told her I can board the cats in a local kennel, but she says that's unacceptable and will traumatize them. My only other option then would be to stay home and take care of them.

1404,Asshole,"A bit of context:  I'm Filipino-American. My parents are both from the Philippines, moved here about 30 years ago, VERY intelligent and understand American culture. We are very much culturally Filipino. As any Asian culture, there is A LOT of emphasis on respect. In our family and extended family, it's almost imperative to greet each other warmly as well as well as saying goodbye to each other when leaving. Her mother had her very young (at 20) and my mother had me much later (in her mid 30s) so as you can tell, the family dynamics are very different. I am very close with her family.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 4 years now. She is American, born and raised.

I was raised to always greet everyone in the household and properly say goodbye and ""thank you for having me/having me over."" This is normal for my family. Honestly, for me it's a fucking no brainer. When we first started dating, she was having trouble grasping this, especially when it came to saying the goodbyes. Often she would just walk out and leave without acknowledging my parents. My parents pulled me aside and told me this. I thought OK that sucks but we can talk it out and I can make her understand. I know we are all raised differently and have different customs, so I pulled my GF aside and explained this to her. She was receptive and she began to greet them and say goodbye properly. Initially she was a bit cold/shut off to my parents but they gradually warmed up to her. Not that they didn't get along but she just had her walls up for some reason. I think she was probably intimidated. But almost 4 years later and they get a lot quite well now.

Last week, I noticed her grandfather was really in the need for a TV upgrade. It just so happens my parents have a old 40"" plasma sitting around so I asked if we could give it to him. They said sure. My GF and I went to pick it up from my parents, then dropped it off at her grandfather's. He was super happy and appreciative. Not long after that, my sister texts me and says that when we were there at the house picking up the TV, my GF didn't say goodbye to my father or thanks when she left. This pissed me off. First of all, it's super embarrassing and we've had this issue before, she knows better.

We talked tonight and I chastised her. How on earth could you go into someone's home, take something and not even say thank you? I told her I was tired of hearing it and being embarrassed. She retorted with, ""Well I'm tired of being nitpicked at. It's always going to be something."" She got defensive and pissed off. Apparently she said thank you to him, just not when we left. The talk did not end well. I just can't get it through to her head that this a big deal in my family. I wouldn't even dream of treating her parents the same way.

1409,Not the A-hole,"I suppose I will just provide a list of details describing my situation. For reference, I live in a college dorm with about 5 people in my hallway.


1) In January, a new person moved into the dorm above me. He paces very loudly and frequently throws things on the ground in the afternoon into 2-4 in the morning. Our ceilings/floors/walls are quite thin, so it's very loud and resonates into the hallway/bathroom across the hall. I actually have a recording of the thumping I hear, and my next-door neighbor slams his door shut in the same recording. From my room, this thumping is *as loud as a door being slammed next to me*. 

2) I repeatedly went to his room to speak with him, but he always has headphones on so he doesn't answer the door and probably doesn't realize how loud he is. At one point I waited outside until he opened the door, so I saw that he had his headphones on and that he was tossing stuff around. He seemed genuinely startled to see me and promised that he was just moving in and it would ""never happen again."" It's been more than 4 months and the pacing continues, often rattling my shelves.

3) I've left notes on the floor lounge above me to be courteous of the people below, and I've reported this to the RA of my floor several times as well as the RA on his floor twice. Both times resulted in a stern talking to and a report, and the noise stopped for about 2 weeks before it started again. I don't know how the university housing system works, so I didn't talk to the RAs about it anymore in case it could cost him his housing.

4) Since he doesn't seem responsive and waiting to talk to him isn't a sustainable option, I've resorted to taking the handle of my swiffer and hitting my ceiling one time whenever the pacing gets too loud. It usually keeps things quiet for at least 10 minutes or so, and I can get some peace and quiet. However, I mentioned before that the walls are quite thin. This means that my next-door neighbor very likely hears it whenever I hit the ceiling, but I'd also like to reiterate that I never hit it more than once and hour *at most*.

5) It's finals now, and the pacing now regularly continues into the morning. I'm sure he probably has a lot on his mind right now, but I'm also more agitated by his pacing than usual.


My boyfriend gets very upset whenever I hit the ceiling like this because he thinks it's a dick move that my neighbors probably have to hear it. I don't see why it's such an issue because his pacing is so loud that I can hear it when I' just walking around in the hallway, so it probably resonates into their rooms as well.

So, I got my first car my sophomore year of high-school (I am now a sophomore in college). My parents bought it for me as a birthday and Christmas combined and I was eternally grateful.
I have an older sister, who at the time of me getting my car was a junior in high-school.
She did not have a car as she did not get her license until after I got my car. 
So this last year, my freshman year of college, I stayed with my parents (as my sister did her freshman year) and my sister moved into her university’s residential colleges. My mom asked me if I would be willing to let her borrow my car since she had gotten a new job and she still had not gotten a car because she found other ways to get around town (bike, carpool, etc) to save money instead of buying gas. 
I agreed because I did not need my car for the time being as I worked on campus after classes and could take the public transit, plus it saved me from buying an expensive parking permit.
Within 2 weeks of having my car, my sister ran a stop light and totaled my vehicle. I was upset with her but not mad because I was thankful she was okay despite my car being salvaged.
So, I have gone without a car for over a year now. My mother promised me, at the time of the wreck, that she would help me buy a new car but I told her I wanted to pay for more than half because now she is dealing with the damage my sister has caused to her insurance.
(Fast forward 11 months) about 2 weeks ago I told my mother about a car I had found for a good deal and I had about 3/4ths saved and she agreed to help me purchase it. Last weekend, she told me something came up and she would need extra time to get the money and I was completely fine with it because the car was on a lot and I was sure it wouldn’t be gone if we waited another 2 weeks for her next paycheck. This weekend, my mother bought my sister a new car and paid for all of it. 
Am I the asshole for being upset that my sister totaled my car and then got a practically brand new one without paying a dime? She didn’t help with insurance prices going up at all after her wreck, I chipped in with what I had left over every month because I knew my mom needed some extra help plus my dad is disabled and can’t work. I only needed 2,000 to pay for the car I found in full and she spent 12,000 on a new car for my sister instead.
My friends and I all think I deserve the car especially since I want to now move out of my parents house and into a flat with my friends. My parents called me spoiled because I had already been bought my first car, despite her totaling it and despite the fact I was paying 6,000 of it.

Her and I are very close and she has grown a lot as a person in her views despite still living in the south. She has come up north to visit me a few times and has met my boyfriend too. 

My boyfriend “Alex” is African American and him and I have been together for a little over three years. He grew up in what was essentially “the Projects”, in poverty and surrounded by gangs, etc. He got out and hasn’t really been back since but has a few issues due to growing up there that he has been working on. 

My sister was getting married and she invited me and Alex to her wedding. I was nervous about having Alex there but I wanted him there to be a part of this in my life. I was nervous because most of the people and family that my sister invited is either overtly or subtly racist and I didn’t want to ruin my sister’s wedding by causing problems. Alex knew this about my family but wanted to come anyway. 

The wedding was last week. When we got there, I could immediately tell that we were getting looks from people but nobody said anything as the ceremony started pretty soon after we got there. 

At the reception however, I was standing with Alex near the bar as we ordered drinks when one of my aunts and uncles came up to me. I knew they were about to cause some trouble.

Alex started to respond but I kind of cut him off and said that both his parents are lawyers and he grew up in one of the wealthy areas of NYC and went to a private school there. 

Alex kind of gave me a side eye but went along with what I said and the conversation ended without much trouble. After my aunt and uncle left though Alex asked me why I lied about where he grew up and I said that he knows how racist my family is and if they actually knew where he grew up they would treat him horribly and it was best to just lie and keep the peace until we could leave. He got kind of upset and said that it seemed like I was “ashamed of him”. I tried to explain that wasn’t at all the case but he wouldn’t listen to me and the rest of the night was super uncomfortable between us and we’ve barely talked since the wedding.

1419,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account and altered background since my main account has identifying information.

I am a mid 20sF. My brother is in his early 30s. He was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic when he was 16 years old. I am his younger sister by seven years.

When I was growing up, I took the brunt of the consequences of his illness. We never went out for my birthday since my brother refused to leave the house. By default, my brother became the GC and I the SC. If I ever complained, I would get told by my parents ""Your brother is mentally ill - you need to understand."" 

I just finished getting my Master's degree and have a part time job. I am in a serious relationship with a great guy -- we're coming upon four years and have spoken about marriage.

My parents have always expected me to be my brother's guardian when they pass. I would be OK with this except that my parents have enabled my brother to be 1000% reliant on them. My mum cooks for him and waits on him hand and foot, and my dad is pretty much his chauffeur, driving him to wherever he needs. My brother is a smart man (builds computers) but my parents' infantilization of him have made him dependant on 24/7 care. I cannot be his nonstop carer (I work) and although my BF feels bad, he also works and doesn't have the time to be a full time aide. I blame my parents for making him essentially useless due to their enabling and even though I feel awful, I do not have the financial, emotional, or time capacity to be a full time aide like my parents are to him (they're elderly and retired). 

AITA if I send my brother to a facility where he can be taken care of, rather than living with me and BF? I would make sure he gets the best care I can afford, but I cannot be an on call carer like my parents currently are.",49,37,1.0
1420,Not the A-hole,"Just to give some context I'll give a quick rundown on my family. We have a family of four where I am the oldest child (M24) and one younger sibling who is still in college. I've recently moved out from home due to some conflicts with my parents and the relationship has been somewhat rocky.

My younger sibling made arrangements for Mother's Day dinner at a restaurant. They contacted me to tell me the time and location we'd be eating at so we met up to eat there. Dinner went fine and everything was going well until near the end of dinner my mom looked at me and told me the dinner was good and thanks. I was taken off guard as I did not know that I was expected to pick up the bill. I probably reacted a lot more poorly than I should have with an ""oh I'm paying?"" My mom then made a sour face and said whatever she'd just pay but obviously I wasn't gonna let her do that so I just took out my card and said I'd pay. I then asked my dad and sibling if this was the plan all along that I was gonna be paying because I never said that I'd be treating beforehand or indicated anything of the sort. They both just said yeah and made jokes about how it was mother's day and I was being way too serious about it. I ended up just paying the bill but I'm still pretty pissed off about the expectation that my whole family had that I'd just be picking up the bill. I know I might be sounding super petty but the principle of how I was just expected to pay was what really pissed me off about this whole situation. 

Am I the asshole for getting pissed about paying for mother's day dinner with no heads up?",133,1033,0.97
1421,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the weird name but it’s a throwaway account. So basically in my art class we are working on this art project that some people were almost done with including me. This guy ( let’s call him John) has also finished his and put it away so the teacher could handle it. Then, this girl ( let’s call her Liz) apparently had destroyed the project by stepping in it. Prior to me knowing that, when John found out about the fate of his project, he was incredibly upset and was about to cry. He went to the teacher and she was livid. It’s also worth mentioning that John suffers from some kind of condition. I don’t know the name or the full scope of it but I do know he’s in a special Ed’s class and a friend of mine also confirmed it. Now Liz has bothered John ever since our new project started. She always picked on him and made really nasty remarks against him. She was always a bit of an ass and not gonna lie I was also always annoyed at her too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Anyway, a day after John finds his project, I overhear liz talking to her friend about how she accidentally stepped on his project which ruined the whole thing. I highly doubt that it was accidental since John had said before about how he had put his project in the very back. He was always one to be very careful with his project. After I overheard lizs conversation, I turn to a girl I know since she was suspicious that Liz was the culprit before. I tell her and she said we should go tell the teacher. We did and when we came back, liz asked what we had told the teacher. I made up something about how we were both concerned about how projects and just wanted to make sure that everything ran smoothly. I don’t know if she bought it but idk.

1424,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory I'm on mobile apology


My bf and I have been dating for a little over 4 years now. He masturbates on average once per day (using porn if that matters). I don't really have a problem with the idea of him masturbating or watching porn, except for the fact that I think it hinders our sex life.

In order for him to finish, I have to do kegels every day for about three days in a row in order to be tight enough for him to feel it enough. If I miss a day, he can't finish. I don't mind doing this except for the fact that I have to be so tight that it very often hurts me and I get torn a bit down there. Sex for us usually lasts about 20-30 minutes before he is able to finish, if he's able to finish at all (he isn't able to finish a significant amount of the time, not a majority of the time but often enough to be a problem imo)

I've brought this up to him before but he always gets mad at me and accuses me of trying to rob him of his bodily autonomy and tells me that I have no right to tell him how often he can and can't masturbate. He also says that since he makes me orgasm every time that I have no right to complain about the sex being insufficient. 

We have had sex before where he hadn't masturbated for two days prior (it was coming up on our anniversary and I asked him if he could stop for a few days as a present for me) and it was amazing sex. It was more passionate, not too long like it usually is, and it didn't hurt me. 

I fully believe that if he masturbated less often that this would solve all of our problems, but he won't hear it. So AITA for wanting him to masturbate less? And if I'm not TA, how do I bring it up again without him yelling at me/starting a big fight?


TL;DR: bf masturbates every day and as a result I have to do kegels every day to the point where sex hurts me in order to be tight enough for him


Edit: okay, some edits for you guys. He doesnt demand that I do the kegels. I have stopped doing them before and he just isnt able to finish when I don't do them. He has told me before that he doesnt mind not being able to finish. I am the one who likes to make him cum so I do the kegels so he can do that. He doesnt have a porn addiction cause he can still masturbate and get off without porn, porn is just the most accessible way. The kegels are mainly self-imposed. This also doesn't affect us every time we have sex (it doesn't always hurt, but it hurts often enough to warrant me bringing it up) and in every other way he is perfect. 

Edit 2: so I talked to him and told him i want to stop doing the kegels cause it hurts me after sex (during sex it's fine but it starts hurting afterwards) and asked him to consider reducing his masturbation habits. His response was that he does a lot more work during sex (which is true, hes always finding new positions to please me and he always takes the extra time to make sure I finish) and so I should do the kegels since it's the one thing that actually works to make him finish. He said that masturbating actually increases his sensitivity and that he naturally isn't very sensitive at all. He said I'm free to not do the kegels but hes free not to have sex with me as a result since he wont enjoy it as much.",291,630,0.93
1425,Not the A-hole,"My brother (24) and i (F, 19) share a house with two other roommates. He tends to bring his GF over and thats fine.  Shes a cool girl my age and we actually are pretty good friends. 

Since we are sibling and there are two bathrooms we decided to share a bathroom between us (which happens to be the suite (my room) bathroom). Hes fucked up plenty and ive kicked him out of the bathroom several times. But always went back on it because I am too soft and belive he got his lesson. 

Today i came back home and went studying as i have an exam tomorrow. Its 3:50am right now. The exam is at 11am. Could only shower now. 

Low and behold, i find a bottle of Lube in the bathtub. Thats not very nice of them to leave it there (and a bit disgusting to see) but whatever. I picked it up (with toilet paper) and put it in their room quietly. 

I get in the shower. I wash my hair, body, go on to grab my face wash and bam. A used condom. Untied. Right there. In front of me. In the bathtub. I flipped out. 

I stormed out of the shower got a towel around me and went and woke my brother up. Not scraming, nothing. Just knocked on his door and when he woke up i said ""its 3:30 am and there is a used condom, in my bathtub"". He looked at me got up and said ""You woke me up at 3am for this??? Go fuck youself...."" cursed me a bit more (go fuck youself, fuck off, fuck you) picked the condom up and left. 

So now im sitting here still in my bath towel needing to talk to someone and wondering if i should have waited until morning. I dont think i could even if i wanted to. If it adds to anything ive never even have had a boyfriend and he knows that.

Edit: Im going to add in the fact that right now hes not exactly in education (he thesis presentation was delayed from march to late june) and he doesnt work at all. He just stays at home the whole day. If he had a schedule or work to go to in the morning, i would probably have waited until then to ask him to take it out of the bathtub.

1426,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit,

&#x200B;

Lots of context that I'm going to omit because I think it's causing me to be biased, I'll update in a few days with these extraneous details (if anyone really cares) but for objectivity I just want to roll with what I think matters, because I want some objective perspective.

&#x200B;

So I have two kids, my wife and I separated in 2015 then divorced one year following (we share the kids 50-50), and my son starts high school next year.  ""Jeremy"" is a great kid, he's got ADHD (he is on medication, with a tutor and a counselor) however he's made incredible progress over the last several years and I'm extremely proud of him; for all his hard work and because I realize how much more effort he has to put in just to keep pace with his peers.  In Jeremy's case, while he does a lot more than he used to, one of the behaviors of ADHD in his particular case; is that he doesn't want to do anything 'not fun'.  This includes schoolwork, chores and personal grooming.  

&#x200B;

As an aside, a few weeks ago he came over from his mom's place more than a little ... stinky.  I told him that he needed to shower, and he said (verbatim) ""DAD it's FINE I had one LAST WEEK""...  So yeah I made him shower.  :-)

&#x200B;

Anyway this weekend my ex and I got into an argument over Jeremy, because I made him get another haircut (2nd time this has become an issue).  Jeremy doesn't like haircuts, and he doesn't like brushing his hair, so after several weeks he somewhat resembles Toad from Mario-kart (big poofy mushroom head).  I love Jeremy but this isn't a style, it's laziness and I know he's a sensitive kid; I don't want him getting picked on or ostracized because of his hairdo (or distinct lack thereof).  When I take him to the hairdresser, I tell him you can choose any style you want, but you have to take care of your hair.

&#x200B;

Am I wrong on this?  I mean, he starts high school next year, and he will be 13 this summer.  I guess I just think of haircuts as part of personal grooming or hygiene, you know?  I insist that he takes showers regularly, brush his teeth, etc etc but, am I going too far with the haircuts?  Is this part of his body image that I should let him decide for himself now?

1427,Not the A-hole,"Yeah, I'm probably a major asshole here, but let me explain my reasoning.

I came into her life 6 years ago when she was 11. Her father is still in her life and visits her frequently (at our house, not a problem though, he's a nice guy). Her mother is not happy. She hasn't been happy for a long time. Her daughter is one of the worst behaved kids I've ever seen, and it stresses my wife (we're not divorced yet) out every single day.

She's made it no secret she hates me. I remember when she was 13 or 14, I paid for us to go to Disney land as a family vacation (cliche, I know). She refused to go unless it was just her and her mother. I was hurt, but since the trip was solely to make her happy and was largely paid for already, I went along with it and stayed home.

Stuff like that is the norm. She'll demand her mother put her before me (**edit: as in excluding me from every family event**) and my wife can't put her foot down. She'll treat her mother like a maid and nothing more. It's not my wife's fault, she has emotional issues that make it hard for her. But it's ruined the marriage, because I've grown to resent coming home to be around my step-daughter. Anything I do to try to bond with her is met with resentment. Though, she's 17 now, so bonding is probably no longer a possibility.

Anyway, my wife and I separated over this. It's just too much for me to bare. But I'm not mad at my wife, I'm sad that she has to put up with her daughters behaviour for the rest of her life.

I decided to give my step-daughter a dose of reality and explain in no uncertain terms she is the reason for our divorce. I didn't do this to spite her, because frankly I'm ready to move on with my life. I did it so that she understands just how bloody selfish she is, and how much emotional pain she puts her poor mother through. I did it so she doesn't ruin her mother's future relationships like she did ours (she isn't moving out any time soon...)

Wife and daughter's father are furious at me for telling their daughter this. Say it's going to emotionally scar her. But quite frankly, I think she needed to be told.

At first he acted shocked that was even possible since I'm bi, I explained there are many LGBT-affirming Christians and churches and I go to one. He said that he still thinks such churches are stupid and hypocritical and tried to pull a sort of ""gotcha"" on me by bringing up various Bible verses that many think condemn same sex relations, like I've never heard that before. He also said that such churches still worship a fairy tale, and would frequently talk about how he thinks believing in God is so stupid and how he won't show any respect for religions because to him it'd be like respecting an adult who believes in Santa Claus. I've never asked him to go to church with me, but he makes fun of when I do, describing it with things like ""singing to the invisible sky daddy"", talked about how Easter was celebrating ""zombie Jesus"" and being very disrespectful and sacrilege.

A few weeks ago he was talking about how I struck him as ""too smart"" to believe in God, and I pointed out that the woman who spoke at my church the last Sunday who has a PhD in Sociology is no doubt far more intelligent than both of us and she clearly believes in God. To which he replied that she probably is but it boggles his mind that anyone that intelligent possibly could believe something so stupid. I was dealing with this for awhile and got pretty angry, and then screamed at him about how I wasn't stupid either and pointed out that I had a college degree and decent job while he's a college dropout who works retail.

Later he brought up about how hurtful that comment was. I apologized and said I didn't want to bring it up but noted that he had been making me very upset for awhile attacking something that was very important to me, and personally insulting my intelligence and reason. He said I should've just tried to debate him on religion's merits instead of insulting him like that, and if I couldn't defend it then just admit it's all bullshit, but what I did was way worse because he can back up his insulting of religion with logic and reason and I just did an ad hominem insult.

1430,Asshole,"Alright, so here's the scoop. I'll try to be as objective as possible as I'd genuinely like to know if I was the asshole here.

A few years back, I had bought a shirt that I really liked. Nice, tidy black shirt that fit like a dream- you know the type. The kind of shirt that hugs you in the perfect way and makes you feel like a million bucks. Comfortable, stylish- everything you could want from a shirt. For a wonderful few months, it was my go-to for when I wanted to look good. But slowly, as time went on, we drifted apart.. Well, it was more that I gained some weight over the next year or so, to the point where the shirt wasn't so flattering anymore. Broken-hearted, I gave it to my friend, who it fit perfectly (after all, if I couldn't enjoy it, at least someone should- and he looked damn good in it, too). For some context, I give him gifts every now and then just for fun. He's not a big gift-giver, and seldom gets me anything, but that's completely fine and I don't expect him to. I just like to give stuff to my friends.

Fastforward to last night- I've been working out and eating healthier, and have dropped the weight I'd gained. I have renewed confidence in my body, and as such have been thinking about all the clothes I used to wear that I can fit again. So, naturally, the holy grail of black shirts is emergent in my mind- I must try it on again! I headed to my buddy's place and looked in his room for the shirt (he was at work), but had no luck. When he got home, I asked him if he knew where the shirt was, and he came down soon after, wearing it. Anxious to know whether it would fit again, I asked him if I could try it on, which he obliged to. And BOY, did it fit! I was ecstatic, and checked myself out in the mirror- very happy with how I looked. I realized that I really wanted to have the shirt back, and stated this to him and another friend. He seemed taken aback, as he really liked the shirt himself, and initially said I could borrow it for the night (we were going to a party), but I insisted that I wanted the shirt back for good. He gave me a bit of a hard time about it (as friends do), but eventually relented and said it was fine- even saying himself that I give him plenty of gifts, so it’s not a big deal to take one back. Still, I could tell he wasn’t thrilled about it. My other friend who was there was more adamant about it, saying that I was being an asshole. She said that a gift given is a gift given, and I don't have the right to take it back. I brought up the point that the first friend had made himself- I do give him plenty of gifts- what's the big deal to ask for one back? Especially since he relented. We had a bit of drama over it, but in the end I took the shirt.

It wasn't the end of the world, and of course we're all still friends, but they maintain I was in the wrong here. So please be honest, AITA?",30,27,0.87

At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description. The comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result. I've actually gotten some books and resources to read about the issues with the relationship but sometimes don't get time to read them because we have a long drawn out conversation about something she read on there, usually a topic we've already discussed.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set some boundaries and one was not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, and how he she relies on that group for support because of my behavior so it's all ultimately my fault. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does. I've told her that it's still a hurtful thing to constantly discuss if she wants to remain in it for now, which she insists she does, and is taxing on my emotional health and making it difficult to make the changes she wants.

On the other hand, my roommate comes from a terribly abusive family, receives no financial support and has basically been financially independent since she was 16. We used to be best friends, until we had a falling out over her thinking I was trying to steal her boyfriend (which is a whole other story, but trust me when I say, I've been with my own boyfriend for 5 years and had no interest in her man, she let her own insecurities got the better of her and ruin what was an excellent friendship). 

&#x200B;

Present Day: After our falling out, my roommate began to be really abusive: she poured hair dye in my shampoo, burned a bunch of my school notes, went to our professor to try and kick me out of a group project we were in for claiming I hadn't done any work (when I had the evidence to prove I did) and would constantly yell and threaten me. What really bothered me though was that I leant her a really expensive curling iron that was around $200 and she refused to give it back despite me asking multiple times for it. Around the 4th time I asked her to return it, I found it broken outside my door. I was furious, but calmly asked her to pay me back for it.

I know she won't be able to afford my portion of the utilities and will probably be evicted or go into deeper debt as a result, but she broke something of mine and was unwilling to fix or pay it and I figured this was the best way to even the score.

Before we got there she started to tell me that she doesn't want me to be with  her anymore. She wanted to send me to a camp which I was severely bullied at and no longer wish to go there. She wanted to send me to a boarding/military school in the US, so she didn't have to deal with me.  She wanted me to go live with my dad so I wasn't bothering her. When I told her I was being bullied at that camp, she laughed in my face and said ""You're bullying ME."". She clearly got her point across: She wished I wasn't there and possibly even born. I started crying, because when your mom tells you she doesn't want you, I don't know what else to do. She, again, laughed at me and said ""Keep crying, that's all you ever do"". When my godmother (Mom's best friend) got in the car she asked why I was crying. My mom lied and said ""He didn't do anything for me today  and didn't even do his homework, so he's being a crybaby"".

When she does things like this and tries to guilt trip me, I usually close myself and don't talk. I just don't reply to anything because I cry  and I just want to not be bothered.  So when we got to my grandparents' house, she told  everyone the same story. ""He didn't even MAKE A CARD for me. He didn't do his homework, and he's just been a crybaby, isn't that right, OP?"" I only started smiling when I came inside my grandfather's library and started watching John Wick with him. When we got home, she said  that she wasn't going to take care of me anymore. I was thinking of making her a card during the day, but this whole ordeal  has made me extremely saddened. I've lost all will to do anything except waste more time.",36,69,0.92
1443,Not the A-hole,"I am currently a high schooler, and we have the national anthem play  every single morning. When the anthem plays we are supposed to stand still where we are. 

The other day I was running a little bit late at school, I got all my stuff from my lockers and was about to book it to my first class on the next floor. We were going to have a test that day that started right after the anthem, and I really didn't want to be late for that test.  As I was walking/running, the national anthem started playing. Now we were supposed to stand still for the anthem, but if I did I knew I was going to be late for the test (it's an incredibly hard class and I didn't want to lose even more than 3 minutes of writing time). So I was like screw it, I'm gonna slowly make my way towards class while the anthem plays, so I can walk in right as it ends. 

Unfortunately, a teacher spots me walking during the anthem and flagged me down, and scolded me about how I needed to stand for the anthem. I apologized, and told him that I really needed to get to class.

He said: ""I don't care what your excuse it, you ALWAYS stand for the anthem. You NEVER disrespect our country. Give me your name.""

Now, knowing I'm about to be even more late, I responded: ""No I will not give you my name, and frankly, I don't give a shit about the anthem or this country"", and ran off to class. Surprisingly, nothing ever came of that, and I was able to write that test (it was extremely difficult). 

When I told my friends about that ""crazy teacher"" and what happened, one of them told me it was disrespectful. Perhaps it was, but I feel like I was justified because of the situation.",261,422,0.91

1445,Not the A-hole,"Last summer I moved into a new home with my wife. We have two adult daughters who are off at college and have no young children. The previous owner of our house had a basketball hoop installed in the front yard for his kids to play with and it became the neighborhood spot for all the kids. The problem is that our neighbors 3 young kids will use it from sun up to sun down whenever the weathers nice on weekends. They are usually outside by 8 am. My wife and I leave for work at 4 am on weekdays so weekends are our only days to sleep in. They are incredibly loud and the sound of their rowdy basketball games wake us up without fail every weekend.

A few months ago I decided I had had enough. I talked to the kids' mom and explained the situation and said the kids are welcome to use it after school but the weekends had to stop. She said it was part of the neighborhood (it is actually solely on my property), but she'd talk to them. They stopped for a few weeks and have started up again. At this point I am leaning towards just taking it down. My wife says that we should talk to them again and that just taking it down is an asshole move, as the kids really do love it. I feel like I already gave them a compromise and don't owe them any more explantaion, she disagrees and want's to ask politely again.

So, WIBTA for taking it down without warning?

Edit: Initially I told them they are more then welcome to take the hoop and place it in their yard because we have no need for it. They said thank you but then never did. The father later told me he doesn't want to have to install it, as it is bolted in the ground.",60,227,0.96

She works in theatre, earns decent money and loves her job. I’m extremely proud of everything she has achieved and the young woman she has become. She has tons of friends, is always out socialising when she isn’t working, travels a fair bit and lives with 2 of her very close friends.

This upsets my wife, she thinks in a few years she’s gonna end up alone and lonely? I told my wife that she cannot force our daughter into a relationship and if she’s happy then she needs to stop going on to her.

1449,Not enough info,"I work at a corner store part time and go to college full time. I come from a low income family and most of my savings are from redeemed empty cans and wine bottles. Two days ago my dad came in and asked me to do his usual combination (the one he's been doing for 10 years no less, with no luck) and for some reason the machine said there was a mistake THRICE in a row so I came up with another combination instead which was a little more expensive. Well turns out adding 4$ was a good idea because I just quadrupled the amount he won. And now well... I'm wondering if I'd be an asshole to ask him if he could share some of that amount with me because I'm the reason he won in the first place. We recently spoke on the phone and he didn't tell me he was going to give me anything... So AITA for feeling ''entitled'' to it in some way?

1450,Not the A-hole,"Today's been a crappy day with the rain all morning and I hadn't eaten all morning so I decided to place an order for pickup at a local restaurant.


I called in an order for 3 lomo saltados (rice with steak/peppers/fries) and I told the girl I spoke with I wanted the 3 with steak since sometimes the plate can be done with chicken instead. 


So anyways it's like a 30 min wait and by the time I go in I'm frustrated since it's been raining nonstop, it was hard to see since my car fogged up so much and I was hungry since it was 3pm and I hadn't eaten since the night before.



My total should have been around $38 so I only brought $40 with me. I got in and the girl at the counter told me that since I had ordered my dishes with extra steak, my total would be $60. I was so confused and asked her what she meant by that since I didn't order extra steak. 


We went back and forth with her saying the person who took my order put down I had requested each with extra steak. I kept repeating that I did not and that I wasn't paying extra for something that I didn't order. I suggested that they could give those to someone else and I wouldn't mind waiting for it to be remade. I also said I don't mind if they took the extra steak out, I just wanted to pay what for what I ordered and leave.


I was so embarrassed by this point since the restaurant was crowded and I had all the employees plus the owners with me trying to get me to pay extra. They shot down each of my suggestions, saying the food was already made and they didn't want to remake it.


The owner finally say he would compromise and offered me ""10% off my order, saying my new total was $52."" I was getting visibly flustered by this point and said fine, I only had $40 with me so I had to go back to my car to get my card.


But when I got back to my car I just got more angry at the fact that I was being forced to pay extra for a mistake on their end. I know what I ordered and if the employee had been confused on the phone, I feel they should have asked me for clarification. I've worked in customer service and if that had been me, I would have apologize and either remade the order or given them the wrong one for the regular price.

1453,Not the A-hole,"I definitely feel like the asshole but here we go.

I’m number 4 out of 8 kids in a blended family. Because of this, I’ve never had my own party. Number 7 and number 6 have their birthdays within a 5 day period before mine, and since they go first and they’re younger I don’t even get to pick cake flavor. Last year I opened birthday cards at the kitchen table alone and only my parents and one sibling gave me a gift because the household gets tired of birthdays by the time mine roles around. 

Number 8 has never had that issue as she is the only child who has a birthday in June. Additionally, she has 7 older siblings, is the only member of my household to be blood related in some manner to every single other member, and our parents had her at age 40 so they get exhausted with her antics very quickly. As consequence, she usually ends up getting whatever she wants from someone or another after a tantrum or two. 

I graduate high school two days before her birthday and she’s started demanding that I “share” my grad party with her. In theory I wouldn’t mind and I feel awful saying no to a second grader, but I don’t want her little friends underfoot, I don’t want birthday candles on the cake that I got to pick out, I don’t want everyone to be focused on giving her gifts and forgetting about me again, and I don’t want her monopolizing attention. I know high school isn’t a big deal but I’ve had some significant mental health problems throughout in the past couple years and I’m very proud of how well I’ve done. Am I the asshole for wanting my accomplishments acknowledged, even at the expense of a little kid’s feelings?

1456,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago my fiance and I moved in together and got a Queen-sized bed. We decided we wanted to upgrade to a California King and bought one a few weeks ago. We have a guest bedroom that we've converted into my niece's bedroom for when they stay the night. They are about 2.5-years-old and were still sleeping in these Pack-and-Play things my sister gave us. They were great but my nieces have outgrown them.

&#x200B;

When we were taking our old bed apart I had (what I thought was) a brilliant idea. We were just going to get rid of the Queen mattress but it's not even a year old. I suggested we use the mattress for my nieces. My fiance thought it was a great idea and custom built a frame for it. (We didn't want it to be too high off the ground or be dangerous, so it's basically just a platform that elevates the mattress a few inches off the ground.) I kind of went crazy on Amazon and bought them some super cute sheets, an adorable comforter, new pillows, and way too many stuffed animals to match the sheets.

&#x200B;

I was really happy with how it all came together and was excited to show them their new bed. We already had plans for family to come over to our house this morning for a Mother's Day brunch. I offered to take care of my nieces last night so my sister and her husband could have a nice night out then come over this morning.

My nieces LOVED their new bed. They absolutely loved it and my fiance and I felt really good about it.

I admitted to watching porn on occasion because “getting a load off” helps relax me, and I figure every other guy on earth my age does it their fair share.

This conversation erupted into how big of an asshole I am and how disgusting I am... I was accused of “cheating” on her (she believes me watching porn is cheating on her).

Niece: “NO! You need to clean my butt.”
Me: “Why can’t you clean yourself? You are almost 9 years old”

1463,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I both have really BIG families. I originally wanted a child free wedding, but hubby thought there would be too many hurt feelings over it, especially since I did still want my little sister there as a flower girl. My cousin, Anne, has a 5 year old son, let's call him Ben, who has autism. I love Ben to death, he's a sweetheart, but he has a tendency to act out and throw long tantrums, so I was a little nervous about having him there. I tried to have a heart to heart about this with Anne as delicately as I could, but she immediately got offended and told me she ""knows how to control her son.""

So it's my wedding day. I wasn't there to hear it because I hadn't walked down the aisle yet, but our officiant makes an announcement about our unplugged ceremony preference. A pretty common practice. My dad walks me down the aisle and I'm seriously overjoyed. And then I hear it. Ben has an iPad that Anne gives him to keep him occupied. He can sit in front of it for hours watching YouTube videos about trucks. She gives it to him all the time at restaurants and stores to keep him occupied. And she also gave it to him on my fucking wedding day. 

Ben is on his iPad, watching his truck song videos at a more than audible volume and Anne is just........ letting him. It totally throws me off and I think my poor officiant saw the complete panic on my face because he stopped and did another quick ""reminder"" about our unplugged preference. Anne didn't get the hint? My husband said it was fine and told him to keep going because he doesn't like making a scene, but seriously, all I can hear is this fucking truck song and the quiet chaos going on around it. At this point, people start telling Ben to shut it off and Anne is telling them to leave him alone. My stepbrother told her to take him out, which just made Anne cry, so then I have to say my vows to the tune of Truck Tunes and my cousin crying and the uncomfortable laughter from some of our other guests.

I'd definitely consider my wedding ceremony ruined, which we put a LOT of money into, and I'm still livid about it.

1464,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because this is a delicate matter. Basically, my marriage of 15 years has finally ended when I got tired of my husband's cheating, emotional abuse, and gaslighting. The last straw was when he was fired from his job as a hotel GM for taking up with a staff member 25 years his junior (he's 52, she is 26). After being fired, I filed for divorce, and he moved out and took a job in another city.

&#x200B;

We have one child, my son who just turned 14. Though I have full custody, he has always worshipped his father (ironically, probably because his father was never around -- working super long hours -- and so craved his attention and approval), and he blames me for the divorce. Recently, he has directed all of his anger about the divorce at me, yelling and cursing at me, and blaming me as the cause of our broken family. 

&#x200B;

He asked what his father had supposedly done for me to file for divorce. His father has told my son that he didn't want a divorce, and that ""Mom is crazy"". I told my son that I had my reasons, but he didn't need to know them, all that mattered is that we both loved him and needed to be apart because we were making each other miserable. This wasn't enough for him, so he kept pressing me. Finally, in desperation, and because I felt it was untenable to live with my son if he thought I was the one who drove his father away, I told him the divorce was his father's doing -- that he had been unfaithful.

&#x200B;

My son asked for proof. I said he had to take my word for it, and he called me a liar, and said that his Dad was right, I was just crazy and vindictive. So I asked if he really wanted to see the evidence and he said yes. So I showed him pictures of his father and his young staff member dancing together, a birthday card he had received from her that I had found, and other similar items. Nothing racy or sexual, but tokens of affection and pictures of them together from her social media. Since then, my son has been withdrawn and refuses to speak with me.

We’ve been trying to get pregnant for a year now and we just had our first positive pregnancy test 3 weeks ago. We have a discussion on what we were going to do (obviously weed was off the table); we decided we’re both going to take the opportunity to eat better as well as well as me taking up a bit more of the household chores as she focuses on herself. 

Well yesterday I came home early and I saw her clear as day vaping (weed) from our front porch. I got out my car and I asked her what the hell did she think she was doing. She told me not to talk to her like that and I tried to calm down and asked her why the hell was she using weed; that it’s horrendous for the baby, and she was supposed to quit weeks ago. She said she’s vaping so it’s “not that bad” and that she can do whatever she wants. I tried to calm down but at this point, I blasted her for being a huge hypocrite (small back story, but not even a month ago, she was making fun of her best friend behind her back because she was smoking cigarettes while pregnant) and said if she was having trouble quitting, we can see a therapist or something but she’s not going to sit here and continue to smoke without even *trying* to stop. She told me she has no intention of trying to quit so make of that as I will. I told her she had three options; get an abortion (I’m perfectly content with being childfree; she was the one who really wanted kids), stop smoking, or do neither in which case she does not respect me and we will be divorcing. 

She got **really** pissed. She said I was acting like I controlling asshole and went inside and I told her I was disgusted at her for prioritizing weed over me and our baby. She said she’s been nauseous all week and is using weed to feel better and she thinks she’ll need her for the duration of her pregnancy because her mom had rough pregnancies.

1466,Everyone Sucks,"The other day I was in a part of town I don’t usually go to, and went to a grocery store. As I walked in, I saw a huge box of watermelons just out front of the store, and a sign on the box that read, “GET A FREE \[local farm in my area\] WATERMELON WITH A PURCHASE OF $20 OR MORE! I fully intended on taking advantage of this deal, and planned on grabbing my watermelon on the way out.

I purchased about $25 worth of items, and was rung up by the cashier. I said something enthusiastically like, “Happy about my free watermelon,” and she looked at me as though I had three heads. “That deal ended two days ago,” she said in a very grouchy, condescending tone. I told her that I saw a sign on the watermelon box about the deal (with no end date listed), which she responded to with, “Oops, must have forgotten to take that one down. But it ended two days ago.”

As she continued ringing me up, I said to her, “So...you’re going to take that sign down now, right?” She gave me a little grunt, and I continued, “Cause I know that’s not *your* fault necessarily, but some other people might call that false advertising if it stays up-”

“Yeah, I heard!” she snapped back. “As you can see I’m quite busy here, but yeah, it’s on my to-do-list.” She finished ringing me up, and I decided to keep my mouth shut for the rest of the time in there. As I left and headed out the door, I saw her make no attempt to go take the sign down, even though she had no customers behind me; rather, she was counting/organizing cash inside the drawer.

After exiting the store, I walked by the watermelon box (still with the sign on it), reached in, grabbed myself the biggest watermelon I could find, and headed back towards my car. I figured that until they perform the simple task of removing the sign (it would take them literally a minute or less), that their watermelons are free game for people who have made purchases over $20. The watermelon has been a delicious and juicy treat, and I’m glad I snatched it. AITA?",138,457,0.9
1467,Asshole,"So me and my GF have been together for 4-5 years now. It's been a pretty smooth ride, not a lot of bullshit from her (or me), even though we are different people. She's very involved, she keeps up with a lot of topics, and is pretty political. Basically, she's pretty feminist, and I don't care either way. I like to think I'm laid back, just enjoying games and friends and shit.

Anyway, apparently there's some political controversy down south, and some celebrity or whatever suggested a sex strike (can't remember her name). My GF stayed over last night and we got to talking about this, somehow. She went on about it, and said a sex strike was a reasonable idea. I respectfully disagreed, a minor argument ensued, and it ended with her wanting to do the sex strike shit, to show solidarity.

Now I'm not just about sex and shit, but a sex strike, because of some celebrity seems to be insane. After she left I got to thinking, that she is basically supporting punishing men that aren't involved, and that our relationship is gonna suffer a shitload. 

So I'm currently not responding to her calls and her messages. She's getting upset from what I've gathered, but honestly, her just fucking over the dynamic because of some celebrity bullshit might be a dealbreaker for me.

But she went on to complain to my father that I dont appreciate her since I didnt get her anything. My father sent me to the store with 70 dollars to get her something. I got her a gift card to a store she likes but I was angry the whole way. If anyone doesnt feel appreciated it's me. I spent time and a lot of effort making that drawing. It's not spectacular but I'm in pain in my right arm and its hard to draw. But I thought I did good.

We went to the town and the first place we went was a very nice local bookstore.  She seemed to like this place but we did not even spend an hour in there before my brothers wanted to go.

The next place was a sports superstore.  There were camping gear, and guns on the walls.  My brothers and my father had stayed there to what seemed two hours.  My mother wasn't happy.  This day that was for her turned into a gunsighting day for my brothers.  Me and my mother just stood there, watching my brothers look at gun after gun after gun.  She wanted to do more with the day.

Afterwards, we finally left the store and started to decide on what we wanted to eat for lunch.  My father said that it was our mother's choice.

Not really....

My brothers pressured her to choose restaurants that they wanted to go to.  She wanted to have something new but they persisted.  She gave in and we ate at a chinese resteraunt which she had very few options to eat on since she is on this keto diet.  She had to break her diet that day because they wanted to eat chinese.

After that, I suggested that we go somewhere my mother wanted to do.  We went to a discount market instead, and spent a few hours there.

We went home and my mother looked distraught and tired.  I want to bring this up that yesterday was a terrible excuse for a mother's day gift, but I feel like I would be undermining all of the things they did do for her, albeit very small.  WIBTA?",35,105,0.98

When she was born, and I adopted her, I took her to the vet for vaccines and checks, but they never raised concern over her claws. 6 months later, at a different vet, they tell me her dew claw on one foot was growing into her paw pad; it was growing sideways. They told me I need to trim her claws every month to prevent that. I've been taking her for a claw trim every month for four years, but it's obvious she's been traumatized with having the procedure to remove the claw from the pad. She's more scared of her kennel every month, and she's so obviously stressed being put in the kennel and driving to the vet. It's the only claw she won't let me trim or touch without aggressively biting. Would it be worth it to find the most humane procedure to remove this one claw to save her from the stress of routinely going to the vet, or should I keep my routine? Thanks

Edit: I live in a much bigger city with more options now. The consensus is that I need to talk more with my vet and confirm that the stress is worth finding a procedure for the one claw. I agree.

1472,Not the A-hole,"A little background.  I moved into my neighborhood three years ago and immediately started looking for a home for my Father.  About a year after moving in a house came up for sale two doors down.  I purchased it and put an AirBnb in for about 6 months before my Dad moved it.  

The neighbors in between my house and my Dad’s house decided they liked the AirBnb so much they would build one in their backyard.  When construction started they told all of the neighbors they were building an addition to their home for their growing family, but when the plans came through it turned out they were building an ancillary dwelling.

At the beginning I really didn’t care, their property, no HOAs, do what you want.  However this changed as they were completing the structure.  

They put the only door in and out of the AirBnb as close to my property as possible.  They also made a small parking pad next to the AirBnb that no one wants to use in fear of getting their cars side swiped in the alley.  

Their guests use my garbage cans, park on my garage pad, and wake me up with their car alarm and engines starting at all hours.  My bedroom is the nearest room in my house to their AirBnb. (I’ve talked to them about their guests but there is a new guest every day or two and the same problems keep reoccurring.)

I want to put a shed on the edge of my property to try and block the noise to by bedroom and form more of a barrier between my property and my neighbors.  However if I do this they will not be able to get anything large (i.e a couch, refrigerator, etc.) in or out of their Airbnb because it would leave them with only two feet of space outside their Airbnb.  

I don’t remember having any issues when I had an airbnb, but we had a house with it’s own parking and it’s own garbage.  I feel like I’ve lost some of my privacy and space so my neighbor can make some extra money.

Am I the asshole if I put a shed next to their Airbnb?",119,815,0.98
1473,Not the A-hole,"Long story short my parents had a life plan for me that I didn’t agree with, and the past year I’ve abandoned their dreams for my own. I have a wonderful SO that they blame my “rebellion” on. They hate SO with more passion than I’ve ever seen them have. 

I had to have surgery in April and while I was under anesthesia, my mom picked a fight with my SO, and it escalated to my dad saying he would murder SO and told SO that they wanted both of us out of their lives. So, we decided to move across the country to where SO’s family is. 

Less than a week after, they tried to “take back” their disowning me and I wouldn’t have any of it. IMHO you can’t take something like that back. They’re saying technically they didn’t disown me (they never said the word disown, only that they wanted us out of their lives), so we can go back to having a relationship if I can accept they will always treat SO with disdain and disrespect. Obviously I declined, and we’re now far, far away surrounded by people who love and accept both of us.

My dad’s birthday was a few days ago and after much consideration I didn’t say anything or get him anything. I have a lot of hard feelings still and it wouldn’t have been genuine. Both my parents blew up over my blatant disrespect, so I blocked them on social media. They’ve complained to our whole family about how they don’t understand why I’m doing this over what they call a misunderstanding. Today is mother’s day, and I’m planning on not saying or sending anything to my mom. 

AITA for blocking and not celebrating holidays for people who quite frankly suck? I’ve asked some friends and gotten mixed answers on them being my parents no matter what and how they didn’t really disown me if they tried to take it back, and I have a lot of guilt for disappointing my parents, even if I’m doing what makes me happy.",25,32,0.94
1474,Not the A-hole,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I’m 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn’t give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that’s much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I’m living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we’ve started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I’m grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don’t. She keeps telling me that ‘even if I don’t forgive her I should look out for the kids as they’re innocent in all this’

1475,Not the A-hole,"A couple years ago I had - due to being new in town and some insurance issues - a complete nut job for a doctor and was struggling through insurance red tape to see an endo.

I wound up having a couple incidents at work (Company A) where my sugar got out of control and I’d seem off. I passed out a couple times. Ultimately it led to a well-connected coworker piling some strings & getting me to see an endo/ getting me the meds I needed. 

Unfortunately a lot of people either didn’t believe I’m diabetic (in my 30s, not a whale) and thought I was lying, or spread rumors that I was passing out due to an issue w prescription drugs. 

About 6 months after I got my sugars stabilized again, I got impacted by a mass layoff. Company A’s employees and my detractors scattered.

A guy who’d seen me pass out was on my panel, and made a sarcastic comment about how did he need to get me coffee, or would I be able to stay awake.

I responded that now that I have my diabetes under control I’m fine. 

He rolled his eyes. 

I showed him my medical ID bracelet, and he said something to the effect of “that shows me you bought a med alert bracelet”. 🙄

I did not get the job. 

I’m aware I’m blacklisted at Company C  for the same reason - their head of HR is married to one of my detractors.

November is diabetes awareness month and the ADA has some great articles about how to recognize someone is having a diabetic incident. It should ring some bells for those who saw what happened.

I told her no, and she got agitated and said that I was ""depriving my child of the word of God"". Her words, not mine.

My mom's car is pretty big and expensive and my dad just has a work car, so they asked if she could take my Chevy Spark out to get some practice. I hesitated at first, but they said she would only be driving around a parking lot with them, so nothing bad should happen. 

I got a call from my dad about 30 minutes later. Something bad had happened.

Apparently there was a chain-link fence around the parking lot they'd been driving in. Somehow she'd managed to drive my car straight under it and into the grass on the other side. While my car was still usable, there were some pretty nasty scrapes on the roof where the fence had dug into it. I know it was an accident, but I was still furious with her and furious with myself for agreeing to let her use it. She hasn't driven at all since then. I was able to get the roof mostly fixed up but you can still see some scarring.

Well, summer is rolling around now and my family is asking me if I can let her try again. I've said ""no"" to every request. My car is relatively new, I pay for it myself, and I honestly think it would be stupid to let her drive it again when she's had absolutely no practice since then.

I've logged into this throwaway a couple of times over the past week and honest to go have fifty DMs and comments asking me to update so here goes. 

Some of you may also know that my story got featured on major, major news websites and blogs. It was crazy. I left way too much identifiable info in my post so pretty much all my social circle knew it was me and it was also the way most everyone figured out ex had been cheating. We had a ""meeting"" among the four of us as to whether or not we proceed. We pretty much agreed that not showing up would cause more drama and ""whispers"" than if we didn't show up so we agreed to be civil and stay in our respective places. But having to spend that hour or so in same room with him just fueled me up with adrenaline and pure rage. 

That led into  bachelorette party that night where I got freaking hammered and honest to god made out with so many guys while dancing I can't even count. I also ended up having my first one night stand ever with a 20 year old super cute guy from our university's wrestling team who was so sweet. I'm not proud of doing that but I'm also not ashamed either because it made me feel desirable and almost like I was going into the wedding day and rehearsal with some ""parity"" since, he I can be ""naughty"" too.

Ex and I were of course paired up at rehearsal and I hate to admit this, we had an absolute blast with each other. It wasn't a mistake that we had such a great and fun relationship, we are very compatible. It probably also worked because we were able to put ""the issue"" on the side and focus on something else. 


Wedding was very much the same way. We walked arm in arm down the aisle with big beaming (and genuine) smiles since we were there for our friends. I had prepared a really nasty MOH toast that would have praised my friend and her loving relationship, loyalty and truthfulness (I even included a line about you never know who is going to call in the middle of the night) but as the reception wore on I could tell the weight of the situation was really getting to my ex and I felt like I really didn't need to twist the knife any further so I gave a nice but very generic toast. 

As night went on ex was more and more out of it and sitting by himself either on his phone or with his head in his hand. I didn't want people talking about him so I asked him to dance with me which was actually really, really nice since we both didn't say anything. At the end of it he but his hands around my face like he was going to kiss me (I would have totally let him, in that moment) and just whispered how sorry he was and walked away. I got distracted and turned around he had apparently left the reception. I hate myself for it but I was so sad to see him go. This wedding is literally the last thing we ever have to do with each other. There's no expectation of GOT Sundays or Bloody Mary brunches with his mom, we wont argue over how bad IPA beer smells or who forgot to put gas in the car. Like the reality of him just being able to leave without me arguing that I'm not ready to go yet (classic introvert/extrovert pairing here) sunk in that this is over. Like over...over. I went and cried uncontrollably  in the kitchen of the hotel until the bride found me and cried with for a good half an hour. With that I knew I made the right choice in being there for my friend. 

So that is that, wedding is over and done with. No real drama, lots and lots of hurt feelings and a huge broken heart that I'm not sure how it will ever heal. I wish I could just turn off loving him but it's not going to happen.

When I watch the garage sale, I never haggle with customers. Ever. I see it as a waste of time and I can’t stand people trying to nickel and dime me for something we already have marked for dirt cheap.

Then he asks me if I've showered today (which I did before I went out), which I thought was a weird question considering he's already been all up in my business and it clearly hasn't been a problem.

I don't grow too much body hair and dont bother shaving it because 1. I dont care to keep up with it 2. I like my body this way.

So we're half undressed on my bed and, since it's been an issue with people in the past, I let him know that I dont do anything to it. He takes a peek and basically does a 180 out the door. Which, whatever. He's allowed to have he's preferences and can end the encounter at any point just like I can. But it still hurt my feelings and made me feel like a gross, unattractive, non sexual entity.

AITA for ruining what could have been a successful, enjoyable time by having body hair?",124,174,0.89
1490,Not the A-hole,"We have a 6 year old who is truly one of the best children I’ve ever met. When we go over to someone else’s house we always ensure he cleans up the mess made as kids play. 

Three times in a row now our nephew has come over to our house and played with our son and absolutely torn up the game room, our sons room and our new baby’s room. 

When my nephews parents get ready to leave they ask him to go clean up over and over and over and over again but never back it up. He gets an attitude and throws a fit. His parents just state that “he is going through a toot stage and has too much sugar... there isn’t anything we can do.” Then they say their goodbyes and walk out leaving behind a total disaster zone. 

We are at the point now that we are just wanting to avoid inviting that branch of the family over due to the massive cleanup afterwards.

1491,Not the A-hole,"We went out for a night of drinks because we had a babysitter, starting from 10pm up until 6:30am she probably had 5-6 drinks, and was acting pretty drunk by 2am when she passed out and was too drunk to move from the couch. 

Eventually I got her to go to bed, but our baby girl woke up around 6:30am and she mentioned she could feed her if she was hungry. All I said is ""are you sure?"" And she replied with ""whatever"" and ceased talking to me. I said ""I just want to make sure because you had alot to drink last night (based on her behavior as well). She just stonewalled me so I had to go start a bottle from the fridge. She comes down saying ""really? That's how we are going to start our day? I dont want to go to your parents house"" (for mother's day). 

So am I the asshole for simply double-checking that she was okay to breastfeed? The reason I asked to begin with was mostly because she was acting very drunk last night, and because of this quote from the CDC website: ""...the length of time alcohol can be detected in breast milk will increase the more alcohol a mother consumes. For example, alcohol from 1 drink can be detected in breast milk for about 2-3 hours, alcohol from 2 drinks can be detected for about 4-5 hours, and alcohol from 3 drinks can be detected for about 6-8 hours, and so on. ""


UPDATE:

Thank you all for your valuable input into this topic. I think I learned a few things today. First of all, I noticed I did not mention our baby girls age, she is 3 months old. I'm not sure if that changes anything, but to give some brief history, me and my wife did research this topic beforehand, and had agreed that we should wait until she feels completely sober, or until a certain amount of time had passed based on the amount of drinks she has had. We had read the CDC website before and agreed with it's recommendations of waiting 1-2 hours if she had one drink, or more time as mentioned in the original post. The CDC website mentions that there could be potential issues with an infants sleep patterns and developmental growth if that was not followed.

That information, along with knowing she has not made the best decisions while drunk (insisted she put baby to sleep one time, she tried to go upstairs and fell asleep halfway up the stairs with our baby in her arms) is what prompted me to ask her if she was sure she could feed her.

Apparently, it sounds like it is perfectly fine to feed a baby if you are drinking, in terms of how much alcohol is being passed on to the baby. No where in the CDC website do they confirm this, so maybe their website needs to be updated or clarified. The safety of the baby being held by a mother under the influence is completely understandable. So that's news to me. Thank you for enlightening me.",98,162,0.92
1492,Not the A-hole,"I am 24. I have lived on my own since I was 18. Recently my dad, brother, and I received a free all expenses paid trip to Spain. 

All of us have been sleeping in the same hostel room (3 beds) since we arrived. He snores so loudly, that I have been unable to sleep at night since we have arrived. Basically I am forced to wait until he wakes up if want to get any sleep at all. 

Yes, I have earplugs. They are rated for 33dbs of sounds reduction. They are meant for using heavy machinery. They do not drown out his snoring. I downloaded a DB meter. His snoring peaks at around 91db. 

At 4am this morning. I booked an AirBnB in the city and my dad got extremely angry. He said I had no right, and that I was ruining the vacation. He’s been angry since. 

We are supposed to leave for Barcelona on Tuesday until we fly back to the states on the 17th. We are supposed to stay, in an 8 bed hostel  room. That is going to be disastrous. I’ve stayed in shared hostels before, snoring that loudly makes you a public enemy. I’ve booked an AirBnB in Barcelona already.

1493,Not the A-hole,"I’m in a hotel in Kyoto Japan. Very small, no staff (self check-in). 1st night here, 9:30pm, I start hearing banging on the floor. Me and girlfriend are trying to watch some anime nearing the end of the arc where epic fights are happening. Banging noise from above is super annoying and we can’t watch the show, so I put on clothes and head up a floor to ask for some quiet. I find the apartment and knock.

30 something Asian man with pretty dang good English so we speak - I tell him is there someone running around in here? It’s his 2 year old child, and yes “he’s running around” he says. He says sorry, I say okay sorry for being annoyed but it’s really loud pls stop your child etc. He says the kid needs to run around before bed to be tired enough to sleep at 10pm, I’m like well it’s really late, cmon man. Go back down to our show, floor banging continues for 20 minutes or so then finally stops.

Night 2 (final night) banging starts up again at 9ish PM. I’m pretty pissed, girlfriend is rolling her eyes. I get clothes on and head up. This time I bang on the door pretty damn loudly. He opens it, sees me, and starts apologizing again. I just stare at him and don’t say anything for what felt like an eternity. I also happened to bring up a laminated paper reading “No Children running/jumping! Noise carries easily in this building!” which was on our hotel table. I ask him “do you not have [this in your room too?](imgur.com/a/ho0kKzy)”

He says “I know, I’m sorry but I am trying my best, he’s 2 years old and he’s running around he’ll be tired for bed soon at 10” etc.

At this point I just start getting angry, “You’re his father. You should be able to control your child!”

He’s like “I’m trying, I’m asking him to stop”

I see his kid through the door and the father kind of starts waving him towards us, so I say “shhh” with a finger to my lips, then I point to myself and do the sleeping motion, saying “please no more sounds” and whatnot.

After this small interaction I think to myself what the hell am I doing? And I say “why am I doing this for you? He is your child, you’re his father, you should be doing this! You should be able to control your child.” I’m angry. He starts getting angry back.

He says “are you a father?” angrily.

I say “no, but I have lots of family and friends with small children and they can control their kids in public places.”

At this point it slows down and i realize I might’ve taken it too far. What do I know about 2 year olds really? Can I say “you should be able to control your child!” to someone? Is that true?

I start apologizing for getting so angry and start leaving, he just says okay, bye. I manage one more “sorry” as he’s shutting the door.

I feel bad because I made him get angry at me. I feel bad for insulting his parenting so directly, and for speaking about something I don’t know anything about. AITA?

1496,No A-holes here,"2 months ago, I received a strange email, in my spam box about an incoming foreclosure, from someone who apperently wanted to help. I dismiss it as nonsense, only to receive similar emails over the next few days. I ask my Mom about it and she informs me that the house is in danger of foreclosure.

I'm upset by this because I wasn't told. Turns out she's actually been behind on the mortgage since September, fell behind because of a car issue. Despite falling behind in the mortgage, she continues on with her plan to leave her job in January. She's a smalltime author who's gotten a niche Christian book published. She planned to quit and ""work fulltime as a writer."" When she got her first royalty check, she sold 24 copies and made a little over $100.

Over the past month, I've been freaking the fuck out, not knowing what to expect, calling dozens of apartments. I was looking for a solution for myself because she was convinced and my sister was enabling it. The complete irresponsibility led me to believe she's gone fucking mental. When I ask her what's gonna happen she says ""It's none of your concern."" Something along those lines. I do some online detective work and then find out the house has officially been sold. I get in touch with a realtor who explains it all. 

After scrambling to find somewhere to stay, despite not making enough to live independently, (or so I thought) I am now typing this from an apartment where I've subleased, with 2 months paid for through this grant at my college. I didn't tell my mom I was leaving until about a week before it happened. She took it pretty normally, which is bizarre to me because I expected her to throw my things onto the lawn and call me Satan ir something. When I packed all my things and left with my friends who were helping me move, I planned to never talk to her again.

I ignore her text asking for my new apartment number and then she calls me. I tell her I'm upset with her for her actions and needed my space. She goes on about me thinking logically and even once called it ""carnal"", while she goes ""God's way."" Even last year, when she told me her plans, I told her it would make more sense to wait until you make enough off of your writing and are sure you can make a living off of it before quitting your job. She just shrugged it off.

Throughout all of this, she believed her niche book would make her a millionaire and would even visit large properties in the boonies which she planned to have a custom built house. Now, she still is in the house, though I imagine she and my sister will get kicked out whenever the paperwork is processed. They're moving back to the apartment we left before moving into the house. Her credit is probably torpedoed now.",34,181,0.97
1497,Not the A-hole,"This happened almost a year ago. Some people say yay some people say nay. Let's see what yall think

I went to live with this friend last August for a few weeks while I was dealing with a health issue that needed to be monitored. During this time her dog had an unplanned litter of puppies. She sold all but 3 that July so 3 puppies and the mother was left. We live in the south, days here are 100+ degrees farenheit with 100% humidity. It's hot. Friend couldnt deal with her dog and 3 puppies and so they lived outside 24/7 without shelter, only dirty water (she would change it maybe once a week) and food tossed on the ground for them to eat maybe every other day.
When I started living there I encouraged her to allow her dogs to spend more time inside. Even if it's in their crates anything is better then being out in the heat (these are long coated German shepherds)
She wouldnt hear me out and say they piss and shit in her house and she cant deal with the noise.
I started bringing them inside when she wasnt home and trying to make the backyard better for them.
I started demanding that she sells all the puppies or give them away before she deployed in September.
Another friend of mine (call her W) and I adopted two of the puppies. Leaving the mom and one puppy to be under friends control.
I tried my hardest asking around for anyone to take the last puppy. I even went as far as saying I'd pay the fee friend wanted for it to go to a good home.
Fast forward a few days.
My new puppy and Ws puppy are shitting blood, puking, not eating. They are lifeless.
We rush them to the emergency vet to find out they have an awful case of hookworms. Normally not a big deal if caught early, but this was end stage.
My puppies gums were white. She needed a blood transfusion, all the stuff. W and I ended up paying around 1500 dollars each in vet bills.
I called friend, who was already on her deployment at this point. And said I needed to take the other two dogs to the vet but first I would need her credit card number or she needs to call the vet to give them her number ahead of time as I cannot front the bill. 
She refused. 
After another week and watching the last puppy dying in the backyard whilst trying to get friend to pay the bill I had enough. I asked her husband (seperated) if I could get rid of the puppy and if he could pick up the mom.
He agreed. He took the mom and I ended up taking the puppy to the shelter were she got care and was adopted a month later. 

I ended up moving out and friend broke all ties with me. Friend complained to some coworkers who say it was wrong of me to take the puppy to the pound. What do yall think? Aita?",30,44,0.85

1499,Not the A-hole,"I (25m) live with one of my childhood friends (24m). We’ll call him Dave. 

We both graduated about two years ago, but Dave has never really taken off. He still works full-time at the same job he did in college. I, on the other hand, work in the financial industry. Quite frankly, I make more than Dave or other people my age for that matter. I don’t bring this up or boast about it, but I also don’t really make an effort to hide it I guess. 

I’m a pretty big advocate for non-profits and charities. I donate approx 20% of my salary each year to various (non-religious) organizations. And when I’m not working, I volunteer some (about 10 hours a month, I work a lot). 

In October of last year, my roommate began dating a girl who attends the local university here. She is involved in an organization here that rides bicycles to Alaska to raise money for cancer. Come December, she asked if I would consider making a donation to her ride for June 2019. I said that I would look at if after the new year. 

March 2019, she lets me know they’re about 3 months out and wanted to know if I had made a decision. I get to do some digging and find out it’s a rather inefficient organization. Not to bore the non-numbers people but only about 1/3 of the proceeds ultimately end up being donated to the American Cancer Society. Also, about 1/3 of the proceeds are to fund the salaries of the 3 executives. 

I let her know that I had reviewed the proposal, but decided I would not be making a donation (no further explanation). She seemed really surprised, but didn’t say anything else about it. 

She gets to the end of April and is about $500 short of her fundraising goal. She asks me again if I would consider donating. I was a little offended she would ask again, but again simply said no I hadn’t changed my mind about it.

This last weekend, she’s got one of her friends over who is also going on the ride. I hear her telling this friend how I’m such an asshole for not donating, that I didn’t care about kids with cancer, etc. I honestly LOST it at this point. I came out and told them both they needed to leave my house. 

She says, “you make so much, it’s honestly just really cheap of you not to donate something.” And I followed with something along the lines of, “well maybe I would if more than 33 cents on the dollar actually went to cancer.” She of course refuted this statement, but I told her it was on the tax returns which were public record if she didn’t believe me. 

She got really mad and started crying. She hasn’t been back to the house or said a word to me since then. I don’t feel like I’ve done anything wrong or that she deserves an apology. Dave agreed that she should have dropped it, but says I went too far.  I’ve had a few people say that I’m an asshole for tearing apart something she’s spent 1.5+ years fundraising for and is giving up 90 days to ride for this summer.

Let me just start this off by saying that I love my kids, I would die for them.


I am a single mother of 2 kids, my eldest one is BB (Big brother) and my younger one is LB (Little brother)


BB is in the 11th grade, he has always maintained good marks and his teacher never complain about him. He wants to become a lawyer, and I really believe in him.


LB, However, is a polar opposite of BB, failing class, and being a trouble maker in his class, too. He wants to be a doctor. He is in the 10th grade, and he just isnt the type of person to become a doctor. 


Last week, LB came home with a note saying the teacher wanted to meet with me. This is not a suprise, as his behaviour warrants that. When I got to school, I was shocked to see that that principals were in the room too (vice principal and real principal) They started to tell me how LB cheated on a big exam he had. I was crushed. 

LB and I had a long conversation about his future and actions. He was so sure he could turn his life around in 2 years, but he said that in grade 9. 

I told him if he wanted to really change, he should get tutored by BB. I believe my exact words were ""BB is really good at school, he can help"" This set LB off. He started saying that he knew I didn't believe in him and that he hates me. 

I talked to BB about it, and he thinks that both of us were wrong, reddit, AITA?


TL;DR  My Younger Son is failing school, I told him to get tutored by older brother. He got mad.

1504,Not the A-hole,"Definitely not as dramatic as most of the other posts here but for context, my girlfriend and I have been going out for over a year. Prior to us dating she had been away on a semester abroad together with her best friend and subsequently they went travelling together after (8 months away total). However before she went away we had been exclusive for about 3 months but decided we weren't going to do long distance but stayed in close contact during this time and maintaining a good relationship. Furthermore we had agreed to effectively hide social media evidence from each other of us seeing other people to protect each other's feelings (my idea). Lastly its worth mentioning I never really felt that uncomfortable learning or hearing about my girlfriend's exes before we met, but hearing about stuff she did while she was away does get under my skin.

Following her and her best friend's time away we got back together straight away. However at every possible opportunity her best friend will tell everyone about all the sexually explicit details of every encounter my girlfriend had while she was away (both when its just us 3 up to groups of 15 of our friends). Now I was never under the impression that she wouldn't be seeing other guys and nor am I going to pretend I didn't see anyone either. However, I made it very clear to my girlfriend that I had no interest in knowing about what she got up to while she was away because I  find it upsetting. I have made it clear to on a number of times to my girlfriend's best friend I find hearing about that sort of stuff upsetting both when alone with her, but particularly in front of all our friends friends.

So about a month ago my girlfriend's best friend introduced her new bf to our social group. He is a nice enough guy who I don't have anything against. Now my girlfriend's best friend has a pretty extensive and colourful sexual history. Initially, it was never my intention to bring up some of these stories in front of her new boyfriend but as per usual we are all hanging out and she starts talking about 5 minutes worth of stories about my girlfriend I'd rather not hear. So I snapped. I replied along the lines of ""ahah yea, that's kinda of like the time you..."" and proceeded to make some pretty graphic references. Sure enough she pretty taken back by that and while the group laughed it off at the time. I get told by my girlfriend the next day that was totally not cool and her best friend is very upset with me. Ultimately, while I feel so petty, I have to say it felt great to finally give her a taste of her own medicine.

UPDATE: Points to commonly asked questions

1. GF gets upset with best friend for doing this but only seems to spur her on.
2. I think best friend likes me but not sure (is generally chatty and friendly outside of interactions described above).
3. Not implausible gf's best friend is keen on her. One story is they had a threesome with a guy. Also maybe relevant I had one night stand with best friend before dating gf (which she said she had no problem with/knew before we started dating)
4. Outcome 48 hours on, GF angry at me for potentially ruining friends relationship (never had long term boyfriend before) but ultimately on my side. Best friend still very upset at me and says I was serious when she was only ever joking and her comments never affected my relationship (not true).
5. Ultimately I feel AITA but don't I think I could have reacted differently given how upset I was but could have not put myself in that position by refusing to hang out with her as some have mentioned. Not apologising but do feel bad for affecting some else's relationship",183,1009,0.95
1505,Everyone Sucks,"To begin, I want to give a little bit of background. My wife and I have been married for five years. We live in a house that does not have a formal kitchen, but more of a kitchenette. It is a small enclosed walkway with the fridge/cupboard on one side, and the sink/range/counter space on the other side. In addition, I have claustrophobia. Why I do is beyond me, but I discovered it about a decade ago during an MRI. I panicked and had to be removed from the machine, to calm myself with deep breaths for 30 minutes in the hallway.

In the five years of marriage and one year of living together before then, I have told my wife at least 300 times not to come into the kitchen when I'm in there. This is not an exaggeration. It is at least a weekly occurrence, and more often than not a biweekly/3x a week thing. Over time, my way of saying the same thing has grown snappier.

Early relationship:

>Hey hon, please just wait a second. I have claustrophobia and don't like to be cornered in a room.

>Could you just wait a few seconds? I'll be out in a sec.

Middle relationship:

>You know that you're not supposed to come into the kitchen when I'm here. I've told you this.

Now:

>Leave the kitchen. Leave the kitchen. LEAVE THE KITCHEN.

I actually get something resembling a panic attack when I'm cornered in a small space. It takes all of my willpower to not just shove her out of the way and leave. 

And yet every single time she does it, it's the same response from her. She begins by [1] dismissing my concerns, [2] tone policing the way I said it (no matter how much effort I put into saying it nicely), and [3] brings up something that I did before that she didn't like. This is not an exaggeration. It's every single time.

Last night, I finally snapped. I threw down the dish I was washing because she had tried to shove past me again, and immediately as she went into her tirade, I walked out. She then *texted* me her tirade, and told me that I had to grow up and learn how to communicate my feelings better.

I don't understand. I'm at the point where I think I might be wrong, even, and that she could be doing nothing out of the ordinary. Am I the asshole?",57,53,0.85
1506,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday I treated myself to the movies & wine and decided taking a Lyft would be the safest way home. 

The driver was chatty. I asked him about the house music he was playing because I liked it too, in hopes he would crank it up. Instead, he began asking me what movie I saw, kept bringing up my ‘boyfriend’, asking me if I liked girls and so on.

I found this topic of discussion inappropriate & honestly I didn’t even want to talk in the first place, but since I was in a locked car with a stranger, I responded casually that I’m not interested in anything & that I enjoy time by myself. 

That did not deter him from asking me out right as I was going to exit the car. I reminded him that I prefer to be alone and left.

Part of me says reporting him would make the ride more comfortable for other girls & also appropriate for my level of discomfort but another says that this man made an error of judgment and I should just give him a lower rating instead.

EDIT:  Thanks for all your thoughtful responses. I sent the report in and quickly received a message from Lyft expressing concern and interest in resolving the issue. Do I want him fired? No, hence this post. I just want him to be reminded on how to prioritize the experience the customer is paying for.

EDIT 2: This is my final say on the matter. This was not a flattering event for me. My ride was uncomfortable due to the driver’s lack of awareness & decorum. I too, work at a job where ratings matter. I do my very best to make sure that my customers feel safe and comfortable. I was a captive audience the whole car ride, and that was taken advantage of. 

I did not expect this post to blow up, but since it did, please read these responses with empathy and learn something today. Thank you.",2394,12531,0.86

1510,Everyone Sucks,"This one's a sort of quick story but it requires a little background. 

Last year, my dad was in an accident where one finger was ripped off and the other was crushed so badly it had to be removed. It's been a really tough road for him because he works in construction but it's been just under 6 months and he's doing really well (yay, dad!). It's on his left hand so people don't see it much and because the middle two fingers are the ones left, it's sometimes not TOO obvious when you meet him. 

Now, fast forward to literally a few hours ago. We're eating at some diner and our waitress was lovely. She was super funny, super nice and just super until it happened. 

She's taking the plates away and my dad picked up his plate to help her. Once she took the plate she noticed, pointed at my dad's hand and said, ""woah! What happened?"" AND LAUGHED. Dad immediately hid his hand. The way the lady asked made her sound like a kid at the zoo. 

My dad is a very sweet man and doesn't like conflict so he kind of brushed it off with, ""I had an accident a while back.""

The waitress looks around then shouts, ""what happened? I didn't hear!""

Dad is obviously embarrassed but still, a little louder, says, ""I had an accident."" 

She starts talking about how she was a nurse in Canada, dad gave short answers until she walked off. We all sat in shock for a while then it came time to pay for the meal, I said I would VERY happily. 

The waitress brings me to the register and I pay, my family is waiting slightly off to the side. I saw the waitress looking at the tip jar (I live in Australia so tips aren't essential and workers get paid the same as retail workers), I laughed and shook my head, ""if you wanted a tip then you shouldn't have been a bitch and embarrassed my dad."" 

She got defensive, ""I was only curious.""

I quickly pointed out, ""people don't lose fingers for fun. If you were any good at being a nurse then you would know that, asshole."" 

I left after we paid and my mum reprimanded me for being nasty. She said I was an asshole for being rude which yes, I probably shouldn't have been but the waitress also shouldn't have laughed at my dad's hand.

After we ate, I took the extra chairs back upstairs and while I was up there I saw my uncle taking a piss off the bridge in the backyard (it's a big yard too). He's a typical asshole with zero respect for people's property and it's not mine, and I was still mad at my dad about earlier so I wasn't going to say anything. Then I saw my dog run up and start sniffing it. My uncle didn't shoo him away so he started lapping up this puddle of piss. I banged on the window, but only my uncle looked. He walked off like nothing happened. That's when I ran outside and confronted him. He said something stupid (I can't remember now, I was seeing red) so I got the hose and soaked him head to toe. He left shortly after that, but not before I embarrassed him by telling everyone what he did (and didn't) do. My dad wasn't happy with him either after that and I told him to choose his sides better.

Everyone basically stayed out of my way after that and avoided me. I left last just to show that I wasn't ashamed or sorry. I'm still not, but I'm curious if I was the asshole.",15,55,0.86

1513,Not the A-hole,"I am 30f. I have the reputation in my family of being the crazy hippie girl (raised in conservative southern baptist home). I usually dont shave very often (legs, pits, bikini area). Partly cause im a feminist hippie yada yada etc etc, and also cause it fucking hurts to shave and constantly have ingrown hairs and pokey stubble growing back in, esp. in those sensitive areas. Well its getting closer to bathing suit season and my mom has revealed to me recently that several people in the family have commented on my hairy bikini area when we go swimming and how they thought it was embarrasing that I dont shave it. My mom thinks it embarrasing for my 17yo nephew and my neice's husband and basically all the men in my family to have to see that. 
 
My initial reaction is, well so what?  They can just deal with it and accept that women arent bald little girls. THEY HAVE HAIR DOWN THERE. And some of them have a lot. If we as a society find it acceptable for women to wear bikinis in public then shouldn't we also accept the fact that women have hair down there too and stop trying to pretend like we dont? Why is it considered vulgar? Whats the big fucking deal with women's body hair? My mom made it seem like I was just putting these men in a horribly awkward position to have to look at that. And i guess for many of them it is, cause our culture has raised them that way.  On one hand I don't want to embarrass people esp. someone like my sweet nephew, but on the other hand I say, fuck that, they need to just learn to accept it and let me enjoy the beach and pool and leave me be.


Edit-  I imagine that you all picture me running around in my tiny bikini like this https://images.app.goo.gl/MJeg2HSJsdQwxuek6
I actually wear a very conservative vintage style one piece.  My actual crotch area is fully covered to my upper thighs and my vulva hair is contained in the bathing suit. No high cuts or string bikinis for me.  The hair that is out for the world to see is basically just my inner and upper thigh area. Also I have tried those little bathing suit shorts you all are suggesting but they all ride up and end up showing the same parts anyway.... I may just take some scissors and trim a little.
 
Edit #2- changed vagina to vulva so ppl wouldn't be assholes about me not using scientifically correct wording.   Also, thanks for all the input.  This has been fun to read. A few of the commenters are complete assholes, I'm surprised nobody picked up on my username and called me sascrotch or something (which I actually would have laughed at). I know its hard not to look at that area if it has hair there. I dont think anyone who notices it are pervs. Its ok, I know its shocking because its not normal. But im also not doing it for shock value. Honestly if I saw a woman wearing a bathing suit and was hairy I would do a double take and make some funny remark to myself in my head but also probably be happy to be in the presence of a kindred spirit. Most of you probably won't even read this edit cause the thread is dying down, but anyway, maybe I'll trim my upper thigh crease hair(not my vulva hair btw) to give my family a break, maybe I wont. If I do it won't be from shame.",344,506,0.85
1514,Everyone Sucks,"I run a small company & have a number of drivers employed who can be see around town in big white trucks sporting our logo. One of our employees, Joe, has been with us for 5 years and is definitely one of our best. After 5 years of knowing Joe, I can attest that he’s a very respectable & decent man & father. But recently, we received a complaint about Joe.

The female complainant claimed that she’d made a “small driving error” (which she gave very few details about) and that Joe yelled sexually harassing, obscene things at her (like c\*\*\* and tw\*t). She provided us with the time it happened, and we took a look at his dashcam. Watching the footage we can hear the woman (behind Joe) honking at him for some time even though he is clearly going the speed limit. We see the car blow past him, and Joe says he saw the lady flipping him off as he did this. She cut **very** aggressively and unsafely in front of him. So much so that he had to slam on the brakes like mad, and just **barely** avoided rear-ending her. This shakes up any vehicle, but had a particularly jarring impact on his big truck.

He moved to the right lane, probably thinking it a good idea to get to a slower lane after being so jarred. At the next light about a minute later, he ended up next to the lady, & screamed at her, “YOU FUCKING C\*\*\*!  YOU GODDAMN FUCKING C\*\*\*!” He did this multiple times, the lady started screaming back, & things ended with him pointing to a tool in his car and yelling, “Keep yappin’ bitch, and I’ll shove this up your fat fucking tw\*t!”

Even after viewing the woman’s driving, I apologized profusely to her and promised to handle it. Joe’s words and conduct were disgusting; there’s no doubt about that. He **was** disciplined for his behavior, but I stopped quite short of firing him. I have never, in all my time with him, heard him say anything of that nature before; it took an extremely aggravating circumstance to bring that out of him. I do understand the rage he must have felt in that situation, and while he didn’t handle it as maturely as he should have, I can forgive him in the long run. I thought this was over; but just a few days ago, I was proven wrong.

Our company received furious one-star reviews on multiple sites & a bunch of negative comments posted all over our Facebook page, all from the same person - the woman who complained. She saw Joe driving in his truck on the way to work (not bothering her in any way) and proclaims to be shocked and disgusted that he wasn’t fired. She goes on this big rant about how our company is sweeping sexual harassment and misogyny aside, & connecting it to the whole situation of sexual harassers in Hollywood/politics getting off easy.

I agree that what Joe did was bad, but he apologized for it. And he’s just a truck driver, not some powerful celebrity/leader/politician or a role model to millions. I feel that I made the right call keeping him at our company. AITA?",256,171,0.85

One day she isn't making fun of me on the bus and is instead talking to a friend about how creepy and intrusive her mom is, and how her mom threatened to ground her after seeing that she had received an email from some Viagra marketer, and how she should never do anything that could prompt an email like that.

The next day at school she tore up my homework, at this point I was fuming and realized how I could screw up her life. Later that day at home I found her email from a class group chat for sharing projects and stuff, I opened up pornhub and registered an account with her email, and of course the verification email was sent.

Finally the next day she was being a total drama queen in the locker room about how her mom grounded her from any internet for a month. Was this too much of a douche move?

After high school, we kept drifting apart as each of them joined the military. I couldn’t (and didn’t) serve, instead I went to college abroad after two years. Here is the case:

After my first year of college abroad, I go back to my home country. I get back reluctantly with my high school friends (3-4 of them, I don’t remember if they were all present). We were in very different places personally, but we opt to discuss a tough/hot political situation that is ongoing in the country. We always had our disagreements, but here it was a lot. At one point, one of the friends says something in the lines of: you aren’t entitled for an opinion on this matter, since you don’t know what it’s like to serve and confront the situation. It was a very condescending tone and I was extremely offended, not for disagreeing, but for telling me that i wasn’t entitled to an opinion.

Then he asked again later, and I declined to answer again. He said that he clearly wasn't the best since I wouldn't answer, and I just told him that that isn't what I said. He became insistent that I tell him, badgering me about it for most of the day. Finally I just straight up told him that it wasn't him, but I wasn't sure who it would be. That didn't shut him up because after that he kept asking who could have possibly been better. He isn't even that good in bed so I don't know what he was getting at. He kept going on about this until I finally just got so sick of it that I just turned to him and flatly said: ""Just because you have a big dick doesn't mean you know how to use it"".

When I was younger I was in a minor plane crash, nobody died but it has left me very anxious about airline travel. I haven't flown for most of my life because of it, but recently I decided to overcome this fear and finally take a trip to somewhere I've always dreamt of visiting!

&#x200B;

I want to precursor this by saying that I am by no means skinny myself and have no animosity or ill feelings towards overweight people. I was sitting at the window seat when a very overweight man sat next to me, I began to feel very trapped as his body was actually beginning to take up some of my own seat space and I was getting pushed against the plane wall as a result. I was beginning to feel very anxious and trapped, my breathing was heavily increasing. I could sense that my heavy breathing was making him uncomfortable as he could tell he was the result of it, but I was not in the correct headspace to explain that my anxiety was not due to him, but due to the circumstances.

&#x200B;

When the flight attendant walked by, I flagged her down and asked politely if there was another more open seat because I have a lot of airplane anxiety. I made no comment about the man's weight but he was very offended by this comment and called me a fat phobic asshole for ""demanding"" that I change seats. I felt horrible after he said that and wondered if I was the asshole? I did only ask to change seats because he was overweight, but it was not because I disliked or hated him for his size, only because being boxed in was giving me some anxiety. Please let me know what you think!

&#x200B;

Edit: To those of you asking about extra seating, there weren't any more available seats on the plane so I stayed put, but the airline attendant recommended to the both of us that if either of us wanted more space in the future we could always book a more expensive ticket, to which he responded that he couldn't afford more than one seat and shouldn't be denied airline access because of his size",206,683,0.94
1519,Not the A-hole,"so me and 3 roommates live together 

luke, me, Alice, Gary. 

so luke has always been a problem but nothing to major to worry, until last month. 

he decided to pitch less in the shopping pool, its 20$ a week to get things like toilet paper eggs milk ect... so communal items. 
his reasoning was that alice only pays 10$ even though alice is vegan so only uses the toilet paper. and alice makes amazing vegan meals for us that are not cheap to make up the 10$. 

me and Gary told luke he could pay 10$ but he could not use the cheese and milk  as they are expensive and that's what the money goes to. he then decided to refuse to pay anything and so we got what we would normally get we just had to pitch in more money. 

he then decided to take all the toilet paper he did not pay for and hide them in his room, meaning I had to get more. he cracked every egg down the sink and melted the cheese block on a pan so now the pan and cheese are burnt.  when he now eats Alice's food he talks about how disgusting it is and that its tastes like horse shit, but if we dont give any to him he complains. its hurting Alice's self esteem around cooking and that sucks. 

I called the landlord and told him what has been happening and the landlord has given luke his one month notice. 
luke will most likely be homless as his family do not want to take him in. they live in a one bed trailer in a trailer park.

We did bridesmaid fitting back in September. I am a bigger girl and I did not fit into the dress. I assumed it wouldn't be too hard to lose the weight. The dresses she chose were very cute but not fit for someone my size. She offered to get something a little more ""size neutral"" but I could tell she really liked the first pick so I said I would lose the weight (I've always wanted to anyways). 

Well wedding is next weekend and I don't even come close to fitting in the dress. It can't even be altered to accommodate me. My sister is livid with me. I told her that I really did try but she says she doesn't believe me at all because she claims ""it's physics, you eat less, you lose weight."" 

She is demanding that contact the designer and get him to rush a dress in near as my size as possible and she'll pay me ""back"" (yeah right, I've known her since she was born and she STILL owes me money). My solution is that I find as similar a dress as I can find but one that is appropriate and flattering to someone of my size. She says absolutely not, she would rather me not be in the wedding.

She mentioned she was going out with her friends last night and I was doing the same with another group of friends. My friends and i had been at the bar for a couple hours when she showed up.

Her and I said hey and danced for a bit, got some drinks etc. I then mentioned I was going to go hang with my friends for a bit and she said okay. I was pretty happy because things were going well. I’m talking to my friends for a bit and then turn around and there is she is full on making out with someone else. 

I was shocked to be honest. Were obviously not dating and she’s free to do what she wants, but I would never hook up with someone else infront of someone I’m seeing. Like this wasn’t discreet. This was in the booth right beside me... 

It’s fine if she’s seeing other people until we make a decision to be exclusive, but to hook up with someone right infront of the guy you’re seeing especially after two days ago she was really excited to “see where this goes”. This is also the second time we went out. The first time, the date was amazing, and she was really into it, then randomly just ghosted me a couple days later. She explained that she got scared and wanted to try again, and I gave it to her. 

I then tried to go talk to her, and I said “can I talk to you”. She said sure, started to follow me, but then went back to the dance floor. I was upset at this point, and told her, “okay I get the message” and she’s like “ok”. So I just left with my friends. It hurt.

Today, she texted me saying she owes me nothing since we only went out twice, and I responded with I was happy to see and spend time with her, I realize that we owe each other nothing, but I feel like I had enough decency to not hook up with someone else infront of someone that I currently am getting to know. Then I told her that if she doesn’t agree with that, then we clearly have different takes on morality and it’s best we go our separate ways. I then wished her the best, but it still hurt. 

The way she was so nonchalant and essentially made it seem like it was my fault for being upset has me thinking. AITA? My friends are saying definitely not and are proud of me for standing up for myself (I used to be a walkover), but I thought I’d get a neutral opinion. 

I really want to specify that I believe that she’s free to do what she wants. I just thought it would be respectful to not hook up with someone infront of someone you were seeing.

I struggled freshman year, but since I didn't have anyone to help me, I had to ""grow up"" and I don't think my brother has had that chance. 

I was returning his textbook today and he was really rude to me, I was at the front of a long line of students and I needed his student ID. I was calling him and texting him multiple time. He told me I needed to chill which annoyed me because I was trying to help him. I also just have a problem with telling people to chill in general, I just think it's super condescending, which I told him. I also told him I felt like he didn't appreciate me. This wasn't just one incident though. He really has been rude to me this year, never answers my texts, acts annoyed when I try and ask him how he's doing, doesn't show up for tutor sessions I organized/pay for. I was really shocked by his response- He told me to shut up, cursed me out, and was an overall asshole. The text conversation was so intense I started crying. 

I've temporarily blocked my brother's number and I told my dad he can figure out how to get home and how to store his belongings for the summer by himself if he's going to treat me like this. I know he hasn't planned how he's going to store his stuff (He never asked me, but I think he planned to store his stuff at my off-campus house) and obviously, he was relying on me to drive him home. 

Just because I'm his older sister and I'll always love him doesn't mean he can be rude to me, ignore me, and not put any effort into our relationship. I really don't let people treat me badly and I realized today that my brother is truly the one exception. 

So, basically AITA for showing my brother how much I do for him by not being there for him when he needs my help?

Side note: I sent my dad the texts, he agreed my brother should not expect my help if he treats me like that.

AITA - STORY and QUESTION

Its Mother's Day in Canada tomorrow.

My husband's birthday is May 14 and he was born on Mother's Day. We joke that he was the best present his mom has ever received (he's clearly the favourite child out of two). About two weeks ago, my mother in law said that she didn't care to celebrate mother's day this year, and we should just do my husband's birthday on Sunday instead. She didn't ask his sister or I. She justified it in saying that we should celebrate early because my FIL is going on a work trip this week and wants to celebrate his son.

I asked my husband if he'd rather open his presents on his birthday or on Mother's Day. His response was - ""oh, you mean on Sunday? I'll have the presents Sunday and we can have cake with our kids on Tuesday"". Clearly my hinting was not effective, and now by husband thinks he has two birthdays.

Now, I want no part of this so I arranged to go to Mass at 6pm on Sunday. My MIL changed our dinner plans to brunch.

Today my FIL told me that ""we'll be having steak and bacon for husband's special birthday brunch tomorrow"".

After he left, I politely asked my husband what we'd be doing for mother's day. His response was that his mother wants to have birthday stuff instead. When I asked about what he was planning to do for me - the mother of his two children - he looked like he was trying to do calculus in his head and didn't say anything.

Joe has a younger brother who’s autistic and can’t support himself. I’ll call him Tom. His parents have always supported Tom through everything.

Recently, Joe told me that once his parents get older, he’ll be Tom’s new caretaker. He doesn’t plan on finding his brother a place to stay. Basically he plans on watching him all the time, as Tom needs.

That being said, I do love Tom to pieces and he’s the sweetest, happiest person I’ve met, but I don’t think I can stay with someone if that would be my future. 

To be more precise, these are some of the behaviors I’m worried about:

• Tom has outbursts of extreme violence and he has no understanding of his own strength. He could easily take me down and hurt me, which scares me as I would have trouble calming him down if I were alone.

• He has no sense of privacy and constantly opens doors to come into any room with people in it, and if the door is locked he starts banging like crazy.

• Because he is in constant need of supervision, we would no longer have much alone-time since Joe doesn’t trust anyone else to care for Tom. In addition, someone would need to sleep in the same room as Tom just in case he wakes up during the night. 

• He has VERY MINIMAL communication. The language he has obtained has progressed no further than that of a 2 year old, and it isn’t expected to get any farther along than that, so having a conversation with him is almost impossible. 

As much as I care about him and would be perfectly fine taking care of him for short periods of time, I don’t think I could live with him.

1530,Not the A-hole,"Two nights ago I was out for dinner with my husband at this new restaurant we’ve been wanting to try for a while. It’s got a Michelin star so it’s always packed and the restaurant itself is pretty tiny and spans two floors. 

We got a great table on the first floor which is really just a bar, some tiny two person tables, and those standing tables for drinks. We essentially got the only table by the window for actual dining. We got this due to calling nearly a week ahead for reservations. 

Anyways nearly half an hour into our meal this visibly pregnant woman and her husband comes in asking for a table. They had a reservation but no request for any specific table so when the hostess starts leading them upstairs to the main dining room the woman says no, she can’t go up stairs in her current state (she looks VERY pregnant). 

Long story short, they end up approaching us asking if we’d mind switching tables with them so they could have our ground floor table. My husband is like ok I guess but I simply said no, I called ahead to get this exact table and I want to stay here. The hostess shrugs and the woman and her husband looks pretty ticked off. She rolled her eyes at me and they just left. My husband thinks we should’ve given up our table. AITA?

**Edit**: To everyone asking for more details, here’s a better breakdown of what happened. 

We had just gotten our starters and were still anticipating 3 more courses (pasta/main/dessert). We had also ordered an expensive bottle of wine so had no intention to rush the evening. The table I reserved was a bit special because it was the only one set in these huge bay windows that’s very iconic to this particular restaurant, looks very romantic basically. I had called previously just to ask for this table and was turned down (original date was last weekend but table was taken) but we went midweek instead since we weren’t in any rush and thought that window table was especially nice. Also the upstairs dining room is sort of grim compared to downstairs (smaller windows, used to be the attic). 

When the other couple came in we didn’t notice initially until they started whispering to each other and the hostess while staring at us. Eventually the hostess comes over with them in tow asking if we’d switch tables and they’d comp our starters. The pregnant woman tells us they drove over an hour to get here to eat and she can’t walk up stairs because of her knees (it was some medical condition I can’t remember). My husband and I talked it over and I said no thank you we’d like the stay here if possible. Honestly I didn’t expect them to just leave the restaurant. I assumed they would make do and just eat at the other smaller bar tables on the ground floor since they were mostly empty at this time.

This is where the couple kind of huffs collectively and the guy said “seriously?” under his breath and the woman very exaggeratedly rolled her eyes. I’m like “whatever” at this point and we go back to our meal. Some waiters come over and offer to piece together some of the smaller bar tables on the ground floor into one large table but I guess they didn’t want that (we weren’t close enough to hear why). Finally our waitress and hostess comes over (couple waits by door) asking if we can finish in ~30 minutes if they rush our order and bring all the food out at once. My husband and I are like “obviously not we’re not going to glug our wine and inhale our food” and they relent and go tell the couple we’re not moving. Then the couple leaves.

Actually, looking back now it’s possible that couple knew people at this restaurant since the hostess/waiters seemed exceptionally frantic when they couldn’t get our table and kept apologizing. I remember being kind of annoyed they were acting like that when they basically wanted to kick us out minutes earlier. Could be speculation but I wouldn’t be surprised if they were important somehow and the restaurant didn’t want to piss them off.",2841,12656,0.93

I didn't like the idea of moving back because I prefer rows nearer to the front, so I said sorry but I didn't want to move. He was visibly irked but didn't make a huge fuss. He motioned to wife to stay put. 

I admit that I didn't have a solid reason for refusing the favour. I mainly just \*felt\* like it was a demotion to be moved back—it was kind of a pride thing. I also thought it would have made more sense for \*him\* to switch seats with his wife's seat-mate.

1535,Asshole,"Before giving judgement, please read the post.

My parents are from China and emigrated to the US when I was seven. Growing up, people often bullied me for my race. They would stretch their eyes out, made fun of my last name, and laughed when I mispronounced words. The white girls in my class would always talk about how pale I was and that I looked like a ghost, while my Asian relatives always talked about how dark I was getting. Also growing up, my parents didn’t make a lot of money; we lived in a crappy neighborhood. People would always make faces when you told them that you lived there, because it’s known for being in the “unsafe part of town”.

There’s this kid in my class we’ll call Phil. Phil’s parents live in the very nice part of town. The most expensive house in their neighborhood cost more than all \~20 houses in my neighborhood combined. The average house in it cost $700k+. He always comes to school with new clothes, new shoes, and the newest iPhones. Meanwhile, the most expensive phone I can afford is an iPhone 6. I also work a part-time job after school and on breaks to help pay the bills while he’s never had to work a day in his life.

Phil got accepted to Yale with a 32 ACT while I was rejected from all of the HYPs with a 35 ACT (and probably similar GPAs). I wouldn’t have cared that much because I still got into a good school, but he talks about it **everyday**. I try not to seem jealous (even though I kinda am), so I don’t ever tell him to stop talking about it. This is relevant for later.

A scandal happened in our school where a fellow classmate posted on his Snapchat story some racist crap at a party where they were saying the n-word. Parents complained, and the kid was suspended for 2 days. Phil said something like “the kid deserved to be expelled for the things he said”, and I defended the kid and said that two days is already harsh, and they shouldn’t suspend him for saying words in the privacy of his own home. He responded that I’ve never faced discrimination, so I couldn’t really have an opinion. I said that’s bullcrap and that he has way more privilege than me, and that being black isn’t all that bad because it helped him get into Yale. He told me to fuck myself and even my friends also say that I was out of line.

Meanwhile, I used to get bullied everyday for being Asian. Nobody would say racist things to the black kids because teachers actually gave a shit about the black kids. I’ve actually experienced true hardship because of my race and class, and he was basically born into privilege. Maybe I just lack perspective, but he doesn’t really seem to be suffering because of his race, but I’ve experienced significant hardships because of mine.

We were pretty much a normal functional family before that, but the breakup was very tough for my mom. Shortly after I moved away to another country for university and over the last 6 years my interaction with him was pretty minimal. There was no major arguments between us, the way I see it, we just didn't have a lot of shared interests and topics to discuss. I am close with my mom though (regularly visit her, skype, even occasionally take vacation trips together).

About a year after the divorce my father remarried and had a kid. In the rare instances when would chat online (like on mine or his birthday), he would make passive aggressive attempts to introduce me to my ""brother"" (like sending happy birthday wishes from his 2yo son's social media page and then pressuring me about why I wouldn't reply to him).

I am soon moving back to my home country as I recently got a great job offer there. Here is my problem - I have no interest in my dad's new family, don't wanna meet them and just feel like I don't need to have any connection to them. Additionally, I am pretty sure it would hurt my mom if I decide to engage with them.

1540,Not the A-hole,"Ok so I have been working at this retail store for about 9 months, and back in November we got a new store manager (SM). At first she seemed really cool and nice, but then she started getting really bitchy and complaining about everyone and everything. Imo, shes a coward and doesnt want to confront the associated she actually has problems with, so she lumps us ALL together as lazy good for nothings.
I'm a hard worker. Everyone who knows me and my previous employer can vouch for me here. The company has some standards for processing shipments that is extremely unrealistic, and SM takes it to the extreme extreme. 
So SM was out for surgery for 3 weeks, and without her, our store was in peak condition. Our sales goals were amazing, everyone was happy go show up. Sure it was hectic because it was over Easter and we dont have a lot of employees, but we really pulled through big time.
When SM came back, the store fell back into ruins. She prioritized things that were definitely not as important and as a result, our store looked like a hot mess. It's been like this for the past 2 weeks. The worst part is that she takes NO responsibility for ANYTHING that goes on in her store. Everything is ALWAYS our fault. Me and my fellow associates try our very hardest to get done what needs to be, but nothing is EVER good enough for this woman.

Last week, Monday the 6th, I put in my 2 weeks notice because I canNOT stand to work there anymore. Apparently I had filled out the resignation form with the wrong date, so SM came to confront me about it (not in the kindest manner), and I, as best as I could, explained to her what I meant to put. She then chose to ignore me and tell corporate that I didnt put my full 2 weeks in. 
Last night, I was done. She was in the worst attitude I had ever seen her in. I was already feeling sick, and the anxiety that workplace gives me made it even worse. I even told her that I was feeling nauseous, and all she did was roll her eyes at me. At that point I considered myself absolutely done. I went home and cried to my mom who insisted I call out my last 3 shifts, because hell no was I going to subject myself to her tyranny again.
My mom was kind enough to call the store and call out FOR me, but SM was a bitch to my mom too, and had absolutely nothing good to say about me. My other managers love me, and everyone there agrees that I am a hard worker.

I'm terribly afraid that even tho I quit, she is still going to try to find a way to screw me over and get me fired for not coming in for those last 3 shifts.

1541,No A-holes here,"I'm a PhD candidate at my university and part of the ""gruntwork"" we have to do is monitor project courses. Some students opt for a project course, where you do one big project and submit it. It's not a popular option because a professor has to dedicate a slot to just this one student instead of a class of maybe 50-300.

If a student pushes really hard to do a project course and no professors are willing/able, we have to do it. I personally don't mind: it's not like I'm lecturing a class anyways, so it's good practice onto becoming a professor myself. I handle two or three of these projects a year in a student body of about 500.

So what a student does is at the start they bring me their own rubric on how they'd like to be marked as well as some deadline dates (have this ready by then, this other thing by this other time, etc) and we either ask them to change it or accept it. Then they work at their own pace according to their own deadlines and according to their own rubric. There's loads of freedom here.

Back in September I took on a course by Phil (name changed). Phil gave himself only four months until early January to finish his project. This is not unusual, usually it's 3-6mo. Phil started off well but near the end he asked for an extension of a month. And then another, and then finally a third. His project was due April 28th.

His work was fine originally but became sloppy. He was missing deadlines, submitting substandard work, not replying to e-mails. I gave him extensions not because I had to, it's that I had the time to extend them. Normally once a project is done the professor goes onto other stuff, but I had no other stuff. It didn't hurt to throw Phil a bone.

Phil didn't submit his project on the due date and at the push of my supervisor, I failed him. I gave him the marks he deserved for past work but ultimately not submitting your final portion which he himself marked at 50% weight netted him a 28%.

After marks were posted, Phil e-mailed me saying his daughter passed away and he's been dealing with it. He even provided proof. His daughter passed at the end of April. I sympathized and said just submit whatever you have and I'll consider it for marks but he claimed he wasn't finished. He said he had nothing to submit and instead asked for a two month extension.

According to my supervisor, I should have failed him in January as normally extensions are not granted. He mismanaged his time and the fact his child passed is irrelevant. It may sound cold but I told him the mark stands unless he can submit his work, anything of it, within two days of our last e-mail. I never got a reply and it's now May 11th.

1542,Not the A-hole,"So I live in a 6 flat (apartment) tenement building, 3 floors, 2 flats to a floor. 

The tenement has a communal back garden and storage shed. My neighbour booked a a guy to cut the grass without asking me or anyone else and expects us to cover his cost every month. 

I am taking my bin out this morning and bump into my neighbour who lives across from me. 

He tells me it's nice to meet me and welcome to the building (even though I have been here a year and a half and we have actually had multiple conversations but, whatever). Then he says ""I have been meaning to speak to you, I have hired a gardener to come and now the back lawn for us. He is charging £30 so I need £5 from each building"". 

I say ""excuse me, you did what?""

He repeats himself. I ask why he did that. He said because the garden needs mowing. I say to him that we have a shared lawnmower and we have a rota for mowing the lawn that we all agreed too. 

He says that it doesn't look professional. I say it isn't supposed to because we aren't professionals but the grass is cut. 

He says he wants it professionally cut. I say ""cool, but I'm not paying for a gardner that I knew nothing about. I don't care if it's £5 a month. I'm not paying someone to do something I do every 6 months for free and my neighbours do in the intervening 5 for free"". 

He says ""actually flat F doesn't have anyone in it now so it's between five of us. Which means it's actually £6 each. I'll pay £7 cos I booked him"". 

I say ""no, you'll pay £13 because I'm not giving you £6 a month. You booked him without consulting me. I already pay £25 for tenement fees (which includes repairs to the lawnmower and fuel for it) a month. I'm not paying any more"". 

He gets upset. Says he can't afford £13 a month. I said tough, that's what happens when you just commit the tenement to a financial agreement without speaking to anyone else that lives here. He says it's only £5. I say I don't care. Its extra money I don't need to pay. I don't sign up to anything I don't need or want. Period. 

I spoke to two other neighbours since then, and neither of them were consulted either. And neither want to pay it (though one just caved and agreed too).

In HS I used to be very insecure about it and got bullied for it. I developed an eating disorder which I had therapy for. 
Now I'm more confident and doctors assured me that it's not problematic. I'm not some ""health at every size"" chick, I play sports every day, I stick to the diet plan which I got when I got discharged and my bodyfat percentage isn't too high.

My friend is naturally skinny but weak and when we do sports she quits very fast. We often go bouldering and she gets tired quickly. 

One day she asked if we can go up the tall wall.They had to weigh us for the gear. She looked at my weight and gasped as if I'm 600 lbs. I'm 161 lbs which is a bit overweight for my 5'6 ft but just a few lbs. Since that day she constantly sends me links to weightloss apps, always judges my food like ""Uh honey that'll go straight to your hips."" and tells me about healthy swaps for my lunches. I'm like bitch I'm not even that fat.

Today we went to the mall with other college friends to get dresses for our graduation. I picked a dress which was flared but short. I showed it and that girl tucks on the dress and says tells the others that I should go for something longer cause I have fat legs. I found it a bit short too, put on a bunch of other dresses and she was critical about all of them. 
 
Then I find a dress I like. A long dress, tight at the waist but flared at the bottom. I go out and she fucking dared to pinch my belly in front of everyone and says ""Omg, why would you put yourself in that. I'm sorry, but you're huge. It's OK, everyone knows you have a few extra pounds but you really should pick something more discrete. You're always showing off all your bad spots and you can't suck in your stomach all day"" I dryly said ""I'm not sucking in my stomach"" and she just laughs like I'm an idiot in denial. 
She goes on about how she'll help me lose weight pick a dress later. After I've lost weight. I got mad. I told her that I like how I look and that I don't want to lose weight and look like her and made some jokes. She started to cry and said that she never said anything to attack me and only to help me.
I just told her she's acting like an insecure high school bully who's jealous cause she couldn't grow boobs yet and that I didn't ask for her advice. She said that since we're friends she can tell when I need her help.
I just left. The other friends are mad at me cause I'm skinny shaming her and she was just being nice. But I was so furious at that moment and don't think she was trying to help me but maybe I can't see it due to my HS bullying experience?

So, next weekend, my younger cousin graduates from high school (yay), and even though most of my family has moved from town, leaving me as one of the few within walking distance of the ceremony, a few of my family members are coming back into town. Originally, it was only going to be my older brother coming to town. When he told me, he ended up asking about hotel prices, and I immediately shut that down( no sense in spending money, he can just stay with me). The plan was fine until he called me a few days later, upset that our mother had invited herself, my step-dad, my sister, her boyfriend, AND the latter two's newborn son not only on the journey, but to stay with me as well. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to see everyone, but I wasn't so much as consulted about this, and only my brother seemed to see a problem with it.

Julie ran a really good campaign while Max did basically nothing. Julie is obviously more likely to win. However, during the elections, Charlie and Max were caught literally stuffing the ballots. This raised two questions in my mind: 1) why would anyone go so far for an election  for stuco president, which literally has no power? 2) why do be use actual ballot voting instead of doing it online?

&#x200B;

Anyways, stuco turned on Charlie and Max and started demanding them both kicked out of stuco. In one of ourt stuco meetings, a freshman member named Brianna accused Charlie and Max of sexism. Her logic was, Max didn't want to beat by a \*woman\*, so he turned to Charlie, who was also sexist and didn't want to be replaced by a woman next year, who agreed to help him stuff the ballots. I objected to this, saying this was kind of a stretch. I don't think it's a sexism issue, but rather something way, way simpler: Charlie and Max have been really good friends for a while, so when Max was sure he'd lose, he asked his close friend Charlie to help him out, and he agreed. So it's not a sexism issue, just two friends trying to cheat the system.

1547,No A-holes here,"When I was seventeen and a freshman in college, I met a wonderful girl at a pride club event. After hanging out with her some, we started dating in our spring semester of that year, and when we graduated last year, she proposed to me.

Now, Rosie (my wife) had cancer when she was younger. They thought it was gone, but late last year, it came back, and it came back in a big way. By February, it was pretty clear she wasn’t going to recover this time, and she asked me if I still wanted to marry her. I said yes, and we started making plans. We initially didn’t tell anyone what we were doing because it was a real concern that she wouldn’t actually live long enough for us to do it, and we didn’t want to have to tell people only for it not end up happening. But we got lucky, and she hung on long enough, and on April 17th we got married in her hospital room with an officiant and two friends as witnesses.

And then five days later she died. 

After that, I was caught up in dealing with all of that — even if we hadn’t gotten married, I was her next of kin, because her parents had kicked her out when she’d come out. So this was t something I was intentionally keeping a secret from anyone, I was just in the middle of dealing with what felt like my life falling apart, and it never seemed like the right moment to tell people.

A few days ago, my mother stopped by my apartment to check in on me and bring me food (because she knows how hard this has all been for me), and I had some paperwork spread out where I was dealing with it all, and she saw the marriage license. And promptly lost it. She wasn’t upset that I’d gotten married, necessarily (both of my parents have been super supportive of me since my own coming out, and loved Rosie), but felt hurt that I’d “hidden” it from her and the rest of the family. And I understand where she’s coming from, I really do — but at the same time, it was never my intention to hide this, I’ve just had a lot of stuff on my plate. I did apologize and try to explain myself, but my mother was having none of that, and left. Since then, the news has been disseminated to the rest of my family, and opinions are split — some people totally understand why I hadn’t told anyone yet (and big emphasis on “yet,” because I had fully intended to tell people once I had my life in order again), and some are absolutely furious and not speaking to me.

I'm doing a lot better now and my mental health is far better than it used to be.

One of the conditions was that I don't work while I'm in classes. I didn't like that part because I'm trying to attain financial independence but I accepted because school is more important.

Fast forward two months into the semester, my bank account is steadily dropping. It was mainly from necessary expenses since I'm no longer doing drugs and drinking a fifth of vodka every day. Finances give me a lot of anxiety, so this was weighing on me pretty heavily. It got to the point where I was checking my bank balance obsessively and counting pocket change.

Anyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his Switch the whole time and Michael was on his phone. I didn't think anything of it until the following Tuesday, when I found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an Instagram post made by Michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we BOTH follow him (as do his grandparents). 

He posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. My wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.

I'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. My wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen. I already told his dad and let his dad deal with it at home, but I'm still furious and want to cancel the account Monday.

WIBTA if I did this? Is it too much? He won't have any family money for school if I do but that isn't my problem if he comes into my home and violates my wife's privacy and disrespects her like that.

EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the number of kind and thoughtful responses I received and can't reply to all of them, but I really appreciate everyone taking the time. I didn't expect the thread to blow up like this so to say it gives me a lot to think about is an understatement. I have some thinking to do and will update in a few days when I've cooled down a bit.",2479,13402,0.96
1554,Not the A-hole,"This is interesting (Dumb?) cause I’m not even engaged, but it’s been an arguments between us for years. 

I want a wedding that is how my husband and I plan it. That means a specific guest list including absolutely no children, no exception. My mother says that’s now how it works and if I take her money for help pay for it, there are certain things I will need to do and certain people i need to invite, including a cousin who is 2 now so probably won’t be 21 by the time I’m married and some of her friends. 

I said okay than I just won’t take her money and pay for it alone. She thinks this is rude and selfish as a wedding day is about the people who watched you grow up and not inviting a young toddler cousin is horribly selfish. She said a wedding day is for the parents to celebrate their accomplishments of parenting and that it’s more about them. 

I feel the opposite. I think a wedding is only about my husband and I and our future. Yes you invite the people who watched you grow, but it is in no capacity about what my parents did. I’m not marrying them, I’m marrying my husband. 

AITA? I’m really not sure if this is a ridiculous fight and I’m being defensive (I think my mom is slightly narcissistic) and just going against what she wants out of spite or if I’m actually right.

Edit: for clarity, she’s not saying she gets to decide things like bridesmaids (though she did tell me my MOH has to be my sister who I never see and lives 3000 miles away, and not my best friend), color schemes, locations, decor, theme, etc. mostly it’s the guest list and only she and I are allowed to go dress shopping, no one else can come

Edit 2: because I keep getting told AITA cause I don’t want kids or I’m not even engaged yet so it’s a moot point. She brings this up, she mentions this, I don’t start this convo. She mentions it randomly often and then starts the argument. I don’t just randomly start talking about my wedding with her cause I’m not engaged so to me there’s no convo. This is just the first tine she told me I was horrible for not agreeing. The child thing is an example. My husband would have a say cause it’s his wedding too. It’s not like I’m picking everything and saying ‘screw your opinion’ to him. It’s the idea that she thinks she can control my wedding that’s the issue. And now that I’ve had enough people tell me, I know I’m not wrong so I’m not really worried about people disagreeing, however if you have an argument against me other than I should have kids there or I’m not even engaged so wtf am I worried about (since again, that’s not true issue) I would like to hear to maybe see her side of things.",141,468,0.96

Later I noticed that their fur was looking unhealthy and something about the kittie's demeanor just seemed off. A quick google search led me to the fact that cats are obligate carnivores and so I started sneaking them some meat here and there. They love me for it.

I (21F) enjoy cooking, and frequently do so for myself and my boyfriend (22M). My only problem is that he has a habit of asking me if the food is almost done, and how much longer it will take. 
I tell him that I’m not holding out on him and he’ll get it as soon as it’s ready. It makes me feel like a short-order cook, and I’ve asked him not to. He said “I can’t even check once?”

1558,Not the A-hole,"  I've always been an avid stargazer however after moving to the city I've slowly lost interest, partly because I couldn't see shit from my windows (the trees and neighbors' houses blocked a lot of the sky). My girlfriend rekindled my love for stargazing recently and we've started driving out to the country to stargaze. Yesterday however I was up to stargaze but our car was in the shop, so considering our view from the ground/windows was blocked, the next best thing was... the roof.

  After some very risky maneuvers we make it up and lay on our backs and look at the stars. The side of the roof we were laying on meant we were facing a certain neighbor's house. Also, the angle meant that we could look a bit into the upstairs bedroom but all we could see was the carpet. We have a great time and head back down thinking nothing was going to come out of it.

  Today my neighbor comes knocking on our door and chews us out for being pervs that are creeping on her teenage daughter's bedroom. I try to explain I couldn't even see anything but she wouldn't listen. She goes ranting about how we're not allowed to lay on our own roof and it's disrespectful; I had enough at that point, told her if she doesn't like it she can feel free to phone the police, and shut the door.

  I feel sorry she thinks we're creeping on her daughter but I'm not going to stop going to the roof to stargaze, sorry. We have a right to lay on our own roof and no other neighbor has complained. Plus, if she's so scared we're perverts she can always shut the blinds. AITA?",86,1001,0.97
1559,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. We’re both in our mid-20s. For a year and 10 months, we both believed that neither of us had kids. A message from my boyfriend’s sister to him 2 months ago changed that. His girlfriend from his home town was suddenly claiming that he was the father of her 6 year old son. They’d split up at 18 when they’d both left to go to college, and he’d never heard from her again. Boyfriend’s Sister had seen the old girlfriend out in the supermarket with her kid, and after a bit of small talk she just casually mentioned that Boyfriend was the father and it was ‘probably’ time for him to know. Boyfriend goes home ASAP for a paternity test, and lo and behold he is this kid’s father. A very important note - before this, both of us were child-free in life and mind.

&#x200B;

I left everything in my boyfriend’s hands since I was never going to dictate what happens, but after one ‘playdate’ he started going on about how he couldn’t wait for his son to come and visit us in our city and see the sights. I smiled and nodded, and the date was eventually decided for last week.

&#x200B;

It was hell from start to finish. Highlights include me waking up to the kid refusing to get in the shower, pulling my curtain down and spraying my toiletries across the shower wall, the kid throwing any food he ‘hated’ on the ground, and when his mom asked him (at my extreme pushing) to stop pulling the leaves from my plants, he smashed my vase. The mother did nothing and my boyfriend didn’t feel ‘Dad’ enough to discipline him, so I just had to deal with it (the mother made it clear she didn’t want me telling her kid off for being a brat).

&#x200B;

The reason I’m making this post, is because of my boyfriend’s insistence that we are all now a ‘family’. We were out last night with close friends and my boyfriend was telling them all about how he is loving being a dad and how he can’t wait for the kid to have a little brother or sister in a few years when we’re a bit more financially stable. … No. I’m not a mother, and I’m not a step-mother - I’m a woman who dates a man who has a son, and before this the only extension I would ever have to that is being ‘wife to a man who has a son’. I said to him after that my opinion on kids had not changed, and he just scoffed and acted like I was a child saying that I liked clouds because they were fluffy. I can barely handle the kid he has now being in my life, but this sudden change in him is what is pushing me to breaking point. I confided in a friend about how I feel, and they said that I would be the one firmly in the wrong if we broke up since what’s done is done and I should’ve decided that if I was going to break up with him over this then it should’ve been the day he found out the results of the test. I’m still not sure what to do, but AITA for wanting to break up over such a big life change that has changed my partner?",676,5344,0.97
1560,Not the A-hole,"This is causing me to seriously reconsider this relationship. 


In August I (23F) will be moving into a house with my best friend (24F). She is Hindu and vegetarian. As Hinduism dictates that cows are sacred, she is especially concerned with the cooking of beef in the kitchen where she will also cook. Because of this, I have agreed that I will not bring beef into the house (milk, cream, ice cream, all fine—just no beef steak or ground beef). We have further agreed that pork, chicken, turkey, fish, etc are all fine as long as they are stored in a specified drawer and cooked in separate pans (which I already do anyway because she eats at my house so often). 


I told my boyfriend this and he said that he would bring beef into the house anyway. He said he wouldn’t cook it but he would bring takeout containing beef home. I told him that I felt that this was extremely disrespectful, because she and I had agreed on this rule because of her religious convictions. I told him if he felt that he was unable to respect this rule, then he was not welcome in my home. 


It should be noted here that although she is vegetarian, best friend is not “militant” about other people eating meat. She regularly cooks chicken and fish for me, and does a damn good job of it (her Tandoori chicken is FIRE). I don’t think asking that beef be kept out of the house is in any way unreasonable, and I will cheerfully eat my damn cheeseburger in the McDonald’s drive through. 

Am I the asshole? Am I overreacting?

EDIT: I kind of figured I wasn’t the asshole, thanks guys. To one particular person trying to vilify my roommate and best friend: shame on you. I’m atheist but this woman has been absolutely nothing but kind, loving and understanding since day one. In fact when I brought up the whole beef thing her exact words were, “I wouldn’t be thrilled about [beef in the house], but I understand.” I am the one who decided not to bring beef into the house out of love and respect for her.

1561,Not the A-hole,"We currently have 2 cats, 2 bunnies, and a dog in our little 400sq ft apt that we are in while I finish up school. When we had the 2 cats and a single bunny we were looking into getting a dog together (something I wanted) and we spent a good while finding a breeder for the breed that we wanted. We were then on an 8 month waiting list. Then my wife wanted another rabbit to keep the first one company. I told her no, that we were getting a dog already, and that the second bunny would have to wait until we moved out and got a house so that we would actually have room. She went and got one anyway and made me out to be the bad guy and I had to end up comforting her for her decision to go behind my back. Whatever, I let it slide because it was so important to her.

 Now that our dog is a year old all he wants to do is play with other dogs and she thinks he needs a brother to play with. I agree that it would be nice for him to have a play mate but we need to wait until we get a house so that we have the room (again). The plan is to get a house by the end of the year. Well shes constantly online looking up puppies and put in an application for a rescue 12 hours away without my knowing. She came to me and said she got accepted and wants to go get him. I told her its an absolute no and we won't be having this conversation, that she needs to respect my feelings about this, and that it doesnt make sense to have 6 animals and 2 humans in such a small apartment. Now shes pissed, wont talk to me, crys to herself, and says its my fault she feels bad that she has to tell this lady no after being accepted.

1564,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying he’s okay. His parents don’t feed him McDonalds 24/7, but he definitely is gaining weight from the pasta at home and small bad choices he makes. Juice instead of water, video games instead of playing outside, and extra ranch when he makes a salad. My sister doesn’t understand that these things really add up in calories and the school P.E isn’t enough exercise. I don’t want him to get made fun of or end up super unhealthy so I grocery hauled a whole lots of better choices for him and only let him play xbox if he played outside for an hour or at least went on a ten min jog with me. Nothing too crazy but by the end of the week he was down three pounds, most of it was probably water weight, but he even said he felt better. Well my sister is now calling me an asshole. I just kind of figured the kid’s already a teenager he can take some advice on being healthy on his own? I mean maybe I’m wrong I’m not sure, so I ask you reddit. Am I the asshole?

Update: Thanks you guys! I apologized to my sister as did she. We both found a common ground and she’s letting him workout with me a few times a week starting next week and she’s gonna keep the diet the diet the same with the exception of only water, no juice.

1570,Not the A-hole,"My partner (29F) has had to go into hospital today from work, all I know so far is chest pains and other complications, which may not sound too serious but I'm worried because she is 7 weeks pregnant with our second child so obviously I want to be with her incase something has gone wrong (this is her first pregnancy, I carried out first son). So I call my parents who currently babysit our son once a week to ask if they could potentially take him tonight instead so I could be with partner. My mother said no, I pressed and asked why, she says because they have him Monday night. This riles me up a bit but I hang up so I can call round friends to see if anyone is available to help out. 
Before I can call anyone; she calls back, I pick up and she starts lecturing me about how Son #1 should be my priority (he was in hospital last 9 days ago but is fine now and as his mother I'm not worried about him). I was getting more and more riled up about this and it got to the point where I just yelled ""I need to try and call other people, go away!"" And hung up, my Dad called me shortly after to ask what had happened and then started to lecture me too about ""this is what parenting is, back in my day"" etc. etc. etc. I could feel myself getting angry again so I hung up without saying goodbye. 

Now some back story here for context: My mother still calls my partner my 'good friend' to some family members and I'm not convinced she see this new baby as mine at all (no biological connection) and she refuses to refer to my partner as my son's Mum (we got together after I already had son but we now share parental responsibility). So my anger comes from me feeling like she's refusing because she doesn't believe it's my baby so I have no reason to be there

Update: Mother just called me to try and guilt me into apologising so I turned it back on her (she didn't inform me when my son had a seizure last time she was with her) so in anger I told her she clearly can't be trusted and to go and figure out why I'm upset with her before she gets to see my son again.

1572,Everyone Sucks,"So I go to a pretty small private school with about 60 sophomores (we just finished sophomore year, juniors next year). Our last day was Thursday, with final exams up until that point. So I had a end-of-the-year party at my house. I basically sent out a mass text a week before telling everyone in the sophomore class where my house is in case they haven't come before, what time, etc, etc. I get along with basically everyone in my grade, which is why I invited everyone. The one exception is this one guy, let's call him Andy, who I don't like. He's obnoxious, and thinks and acts likes he's super cool and popular but isn't. You get the idea. So I didn't invite him. He asked me in class on Wednesday if I forgot to send him his text. I just told him sorry, he wasn't invited. He got pissed off for not being invited when the whole rest of the sophomore class was. I just told him I have no obligation to invite him if I don't want. 

He looked angry and just walked away, and I thought that was that. While the party was still going yesterday, I realized he had sent me q bunch of angry texts on snapchat. Basically, he saw stories I had posted with pics or videos of the party, and he saw those, swiped up, and sent me a barrage of texts talking about how it's unfair he was the only kid who wasn't invited. I just replied, 'doing shit like this is the reason nobody likes you in the first place'. 

But I've been wondering since last night after he texted me, is he right? AITA?

1573,Everyone Sucks,"Some background: I own my home and live with a girl (Lori) who moved in when her boyfriend lived here. They broke up and the boyfriend left, and she’s been a good tenant, mostly. 

The issue: in the early days of my current relationship (with Megan), I wasn’t seeing just one girl exclusively, and some days would have different girls over on the same day (at different times, of course). On Valentines Day Megan was over and while I was in the other room Lori showed her all of the gifts and treats I’d received from other girls that day. Megan was quiet for the rest of the night and it wasn’t until after some prodding that she asked if I’d been seeing other girls. I wasn’t ashamed to admit that I had, but it wasn’t easy to do so either. I didn’t feel it was Lori’s place to speak on that and I told her so. She apologized and we moved on. 

A few weeks later, Lori and Megan were hanging out and Lori mentions that I take muscle-building supplements. It’s something I’ve done for a long time that helped me lose weight and achieve a look that I’ve kept for a long time since, but I still don’t go around bragging about it, especially to my girlfriend. This time Megan casually mentions the episode with mild bemusement, saying she didn’t know I needed them, but mostly didn’t care. Regardless of Megan’s reaction, I still felt like Lori had disrespected me and I let her know, this time telling her a bit more forcefully to keep her mouth shut around my girlfriend. 

Finally on May 3rd, Megan goes out to Lori’s birthday party to celebrate with a bunch of people she has never met. While they drank and bullshitted, Lori says to the group (again, all Lori’s friends) that Megan’s boyfriend (me) likes to jerk off to Lori’s sex sounds, and that I had admitted as much. Which was a gross simplification of a hypothetical that arose during a little argument Lori and I had, but Lori knew that, and was just trying to gain some cred at the table amongst her friends at Megan’s expense. Megan basically shut down, had a terrible time, and was super withdrawn when she got home. She told me about the incident and, to me, this was strike three. I told Lori she had until the end of the month to leave, despite her being very contrite about Megan’s reaction and appealing to me to reconsider. 

I feel like she crossed a line and shouldn’t be given any more opportunities to negatively influence my relationship or my life overall. I’m not dependent on her rent, as it went into an account I just save for rainy days. Still, I can’t help but wonder if I’m being an asshole.

Edit: Since a lot of your decisions hinge on me “jerking off to Lori’s sex sounds,” I need to clarify that I don’t, and I didn’t say that I do. I used that phrase as an extreme example of what could happen in that situation, and in context, my point landed and helped Lori realize my frustration. I only mention it in the paragraph because Lori knew my intentions, and still joked at dinner about it with Megan, ruining her night by making her feel like a pariah amongst strangers.",598,1201,0.89
1574,Not the A-hole,"   I founded a company a few years ago with my wife that's really blossomed and doing well for itself, I'm proud of it. Back when it was first founded I obviously needed employees so I hired my aunt, brother, and sister as the first few. The company grew and so with it I started hiring qualified strangers to work, however all three of the relatives mentioned above still work there to this day. I try to avoid hiring other friends or family unless they'd die without some money because I don't want to be accused of nepotism. The employees however know that I treat my brother/sister/aunt the same as other employees in work, outside is different.

&#x200B;

  Here comes the part in the title. My cousin (my aunt's daughter) recently graduated high school and she doesn't want to go to college because she thinks it's a waste of time and money. Unsurprisingly she couldn't land a job other than a McDonald's because she has literally no qualifications whatsoever. So my aunt approaches me with this brilliant idea to hire my cousin and that we could all benefit from it, you know a win-win all around. Except I don't know how I would benefit, almost everyone on Earth is more qualified for this job than her. I tell her I'd think about it.

  If she were to be hired it would be in a starting position and my aunt would have no control over her (She manages another branch). I guess with enough training she'll be ready for the job and next thing you know she's employee of the month.. eh. Aside from the obstacles in hiring family/friends, I just don't like her. She spews homophobic shit and uses the word 'faggot' like it's a synonym for 'dude'. I'm bi but only my wife knows and I'm not out to anyone else because I don't think there's a need for them to know. I tolerate her because I love my aunt and barely see the cousin but if she's hired I'd be forced to interact with her. I already made up my mind and it's a no but I wanted to see what others think.

In front of this guy is a glorious empty space, just behind the front row. There’s a 10 year old boy at the rail on the front row having a great time. Behind him is room for 15 people... it’s 5 feet deep by like 7 feet wide. I think, perfect, I can stand in that spot, see everything, and still be like 2 feet away from the kid.

I step into the spot beaming, when suddenly a Karen gets in my face. “Sorry, but you can’t step past this line,” *gestures vaguely 5 feet back from the front row,* “because I have to watch my baby.”

My wife is Chinese and her parents are really traditional. Privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries.

1581,Not the A-hole,"So, I currently renting the basement from a family (a mother and her 5 year old son) for 6 months while I'm at university. We share the kitchen. I'm someone who likes to cook, so I've been doing a lot of baking. I also eat a lot of snacks, usually in the afternoon and evening.

After living there two and a half months, she gave me written note that says I'm only to use the kitchen from 12;00-2:00, and 6:00-8:00. I'm now no longer allowed to even get a glass of water outside these times. I'm to collect all the food I need and utensils I'll need and return them within these times. Even if the items are perishable.

It says in our contract that I have access to the kitchen. Her excuse is didn't expect me to cook as much. I'm only in the kitchen a couple times excluding meals. About once a week I'll make something like a desert, usually when she's not home, and I always offer her some. At night, oftentimes I'll make stove top popcorn, I times 10-15 minutes and I'm usually finished by 9:30. She's literally threatened to kick me out over getting a glass of water.

I should mention part of it may be cultural. I'm in France where they don't really snack. I also guess she just expected the kitchen hours to be implied.

I've been trying to be respectful of the fact that it is her house. I always leave the kitchen clean, usually cleaner than I found. I also watch her son quite often, around twice a month more than agreed upon, and I've cat sit for her over a week. I definitely don't want to take over her entire home, but she agreed to have a tenant. We agreed that I would have access to the kitchen. Am I the asshole for taking up to much space

As for how much space, there's always enough room for the both of us. Usually, I start cooking just before her, so by the time she needs to prepare something, I already have all of my things prepared and on the stove, leaving at least two burners for her. There are still plenty of pots and pans left. Usually, I finish just before her and finish with the dishes when she's putting her kid to bed. If she has company, I eat in my room.

As for the amount I'm using the kitchen, usually, I just have a piece of fruit or something else that doesn't need prepared. It takes about 5 seconds for me to get it and go to my room. As for baking, I've made bread just before supper, and cooked it as I was eating supper once or twice on a Sunday. All in all, it really didn't add that much time to my kitchen usage. I also made eclairs, once, when she invited to have supper with her and a friend. They were intended to a thank you. To fair, they did turn out poorly. Everything else I bake tends to be when I don't have class and she's at work.

Also, the noise of popcorn gets brought up a but. It's a little bit loud, but in my defense, it is a lot quieter than the TV that she watches every night. Her son has never woken up to the sound of either, to my knowledge. I also use herbs and salt instead of butter, so the smell is pretty neutral.

I've also asked if there was something else I could do, like if I wasn't cleaning up properly. She literally just says she doesn't want to see for the 5 seconds it takes to get a glass of water.",96,232,0.96

1583,Not the A-hole,"My brother has always been so irresponsible all his life. When he was 19, he dropped out of university because they found crack in his locker. And it was not the first time. I tried so many times to help him rebuild his fucked up life but it was impossible since he was always involved with street punks and spent their time pickpocketting or vandalizing public facilities. 
He finally got married but after 5 years together his wife dumped him and their 4 year old daughter.

Last month, while at work, I got a phone call from the police informing me that they had arrested him for drunk-driving. I bailed him out but later found out my niece had been left all alone at their home without food and electricity. This made me fly off the handle. I told him if he did not change, I would take my niece with me and try to get custody of her. 
He ended up crying telling me not to separate him from his daughter since she's the only thing in the world he would die for. 

A week ago though, I got another phone call from the police. He had been arrested again for breaking into a house at night. This time, I refused to bail him out. I told him I've had enough of his shitty behaviours and he will never see his daughter ever again. The next day I went to see an attorney to talk about getting the custody of my niece. 

My girlfriend thinks maybe I should give him another chance since the possibility of losing custody for his daughter seems to affect him so much that he has refused to eat for 3 days in a row. I love him so much but he's putting his own daughter's life at risk. My older brother is too busy minding his own problems right now for us to talk about it but he told me ""What if it's your kid? How would you feel being seperated from her? Stop trying to interfer in his life he's a big boy!""
Am I The Asshole Here?





UPDATE :

Thank You everyone for the feedback. First, I would like to explain that yes I am more than capable of providing  time, care, food, shelter, safety, and education for my niece. My gf works from home and she loves children especially my niece. They get along perfectly well. She doesn't mind taking care of her while I'm at work. 

The thing with my gf considering giving him a second chance is because she's feeling terribly sorry for my niece for not being able to be with her dad, whom she's been asking for ever since  I took her home with me. It just breaks her heart to see my niece like that. I have explained it to her that this may seem cruel but it's for the best, for my niece and also my brother. 

When I told my brother that he will never see his daughter ever again, I was only terribly disappointed and furious with him. I had never really intended for him to never ever see her again. That'd be awful. He's my brother and I love him with every atom of my heart. I am just feeling so disappointed with him ATM. 

I have been considering my options and my niece and brother's options. Getting her custody with supervised visitation by her dad seems like the best option for me atm. Any suggestion?",100,316,0.97

sisters bf, tom

so I'm most likely the asshole but here we go. 

so my sister started dating this guy 2 years ago, everything was fine until last week. 

now a few dates in Tom tells her that he is a father to a boy and a girl and that he has custody of them every 3d weekend and whenever he wants during the holidays. 
teri was ok with this surprisingly as she is subbed to heaps of child free pages. 

last week I found out that they wanted to move in together, he was looking for 2 bed places so the kids have a room.
I thought that she would be fine with this, turns out she is not. 

she complained to me a few days back that she hated that the kids had to tag along and that she hopes he looses custody of them so they can have more one on one time. I asked her if she was joking and she replied. no why would I want fucking crotch goblins living with me. I then repeated so it's a joke right? and she said no. 
so I asked her why she is moving in with someone who has kids, and her response was, he is hot. 

I told her that she should break up with him if she hates the kids so much as they are a package deal and she got mad at me and left. 

I then got a message where she sent me a photo of some weed and the caption, custody no more. (he has monthly drug tests)

I automatically called him and let him know and provided proof with the photo. 

tori is now a single woman and is fucking pissed at me, my mum has also taken her side and now I'm regretting it.

1585,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I pay about $120 a month for school lunches for two of our kids. Our district uses a website for the parents to load money onto their lunch accounts, and in March I loaded enough to get them through to Spring Break (third week of April). 

Their first day back to school I panicked because I hadn’t loaded any money on their lunch accounts because I didn’t get a low balance reminder email. I assumed it got sent to spam so I logged in to add more and they already had a good amount left in there. I chalked it up to me miscalculating and set a reminder for myself to log in at the end of the week to add more money. 

The end of the week came and the same amount was in each account. I checked the cafeteria purchases and they were buying lunch, but for some reason not being charged. The website still says “we’ll be down for maintenance April 9th and April 10th” and that looks like the last time they were charged, so I’m guessing something happened with the site that caused this error. I’ve been monitoring it to see if it kicks back in, but it still hasn’t. 

My husband says we should just be grateful we have one less expense right now and reminded me our school taxes are ridiculous (highest in the county, 9th highest in the state) so we should think of it as a rebate. But I grew up in a very religious family (although I’m not religious myself anymore) so the thought of not telling them about this issue makes me feel incredibly guilty. 

WIBTA if I kept silent?

Edit: One redditor brought up how their school had free lunches and she stopped being charged. I do remember getting a paper about free lunches and breakfast but I assumed it was for summer. I’m wondering now if they started it early and I just didn’t pay attention. It was really early for that type of notice. Also outside purchases are being deducted, my kindergartener bought an ice cream yesterday and he was charged 50 cents, but the lunch amount shows “$0.00” as the price.  I did just send an email through the lunch website to ask if this is a site error or if i should speak to the district. Thanks for all your input!",99,453,0.97

1587,Not the A-hole,"My partner and I are about to move into our first home and are both huge dog lovers. We intend on getting a golden retriever called Georgie. We both work full time and work at the same place together, about five minutes from this place is a doggy day care where the dogs are fed, walked, have access to a huge field to play in, shelter and of course other dogs to socialise with. He would need to attend five days a week, would be dropped off around 7:30am and picked up at 5pm.

My mum objects to this massively. She says it’s cruel to have a dog just to put it in day care, it won’t even know who we are and we’re basically servicing our own needs. My partner and I disagree totally. The dog will be socialised, looked after and never on his own. It’s worth pointing out that the dogs my family have had have both been rescue dogs with very particular needs I.e. no socialisation and terrible separation anxiety which I think is influencing her decision.

My words were “Hey, I was just wondering if I could get the rest of my change? Thanks”. I planned on tipping the waitress but I usually keep the change and use it for tolls.

1593,Everyone Sucks,"Backstory: My sibling and myself have a real turbulent but not always bad relationship. Thing is when fights happen they get nasty.

The most recent incident that caused her to take out a restraining order went down as follows: she is over at my place, I used her phone without her permission, she finds out and gets pissed and an arguement ensues, I go to drive away and she insists on following, at some point we're stopped she jumps out and slams the door so i drive home put her things outside and lock the door, she walks back to mine takes a rock and begins trying to break down my door, when she gets in she grabs the nearest item of value of mine and runs, I then chase her down and we wrestle until I pry my property back, then she storms off.

Then the police turn up gloved up and ready to arrest me, asking where the ""female in distress is?"" I ended up detained for an hour with no idea why, like there was a fight but I know I didn't hurt her physically and didn't know why this seemed so serious. 

I got let go and later served with a restraining order and it turns out that 1) She told the police that I physically undid her seatbelt and shoved her out of the car and 2) that when trying to get my things back I ""repeatedly tried to strangle her for 4-5 minutes"". Now the police incident makes sense. Thing is for 6 months I didn't get to give my side of the story - up until the day in court her statement on the application was treated as truth.

Her restraining order didnt get through but I signed a document agreeing to stay away from her. When I asked what happens if she contacts me they said it wouldn't matter, if I contacted her it could be evidence against me. I asked if she could sign the same agreement but reversed so she'd stay away from me and they said no I'd need to apply for a restraining order.

So, given the history of her coming to where I am and making false statements to the police AITA for applying for the restraining order to make it a mutual agreement to avoid one another? My fear is she could contact me then something happens and the police see I'm the historically ""violent one"" who broke the court agreement. My family aren't talking to me at the moment asking why I won't just drop the issue and are accusing me of doing this out of spite etc. Reddit AITA?",34,75,0.87

1596,Not the A-hole,"For background context, my MiL has ignored me since dh and I got engaged 9 years ago. Since, we've had three babies and she's turned up each time for cuddles and again not acknowledged me at all. If I greet her, she'll ignore me if DH and FIL are out of earshot.

We see the in laws pretty much every weekend, I'm not happy about that but I cope. The two weekends I put my foot down are Mother's Day (which is this weekend here in Australia) and my bday weekend. In preparation for having a weekend off from the in laws, I encouraged DH to take the kids to spend the weekend with them last week, that was my give to them so we could have this weekend to ourselves. 

I've just heard DH making dinner plans with them tomorrow. I'm not happy and have again said to him that I would like to spend the weekend to ourselves because his mother ignores me and that is not how I want to spend Mother's Day. I even 'reminded' him a few weeks ago so that we were on the same page. He's gone and ignored me and done as his parents want instead. I asked him what dinner they were making plans for and he somewhat reluctantly answered tomorrow knowing full well how I'd feel about it.

Now he's saying that I'm not letting him spend Mother's Day with his mum, I've also told him to go see her and never had an issue with that, but kids and I will do our own thing. He won't do it because the in laws only really want to see the grandkids and he knows it. He's told his sister that I want to stay home so won't be doing dinner, but this is his way of leaving it open for them to come over. This has pissed me off. Am I the asshole for saying that I want this day to myself? Am I being greedy by not conceding dinner? 

TLDR - MiL has ignored me since 2010, I refuse to spend Mother's Day with her. DH says it's not fair that we don't see her on Mother's Day. Am I the asshole?

1599,Not the A-hole,"I don't love my adopted mother. She's probably what we would label a narcissist and probably has Munchausen's. She's very needy, an attention seeker. She lives vicariously through our successes, loves to be talked about in a great way, and often ""snowballs"" issues. It's gotten so bad from ages 14 to 18, I installed a chain lock on my door because if we were fighting for whatever stupid reason she ""snowballed,"" she would try to follow me into the bedroom and pin me to the bed while screaming at me. It once got so bad that my dad gave me $200 once to go live in a hotel for a week or so. After that, I permanently moved out and it's been mostly freedom ever since.

Until recently, I suppose. I've recently gotten engaged to my best friend, confidant, and wonderful soon-to-be husband. I love him dearly, but there's a problem already: my mother. I've already talked to a close family friend about it: part of her job will (thankfully) be to ""distract"" my mother into not trying to take over the wedding planning process. I'm almost half-willing to pay a shit ton for the wedding venue with a bundle included so as not to drag the process out long enough for my mother to dig her claws into it. We already had issues at the start of this process--my fiance, when he asked for my hand in marriage, got drilled by my mother, asking if he was worthy or their fasting was worthy of me (to clarify, my Dad's a pastor and my mother is extremely religious). Of course...that made him uncomfortable.

Then it got even worse because my mom started trying to shove a venue down me and my fiance's throat. It was a part of a business deal my dad had made prior to the engagement, and of course, my dad was trying to cash in on it now. My parents demanded that my fiance make a decision about it right then and there, but thankfully, my fiance said hell no because he had to talk to me first. This was BEFORE he proposed.

Now that we're engaged, we've of course started the dreaded wedding planning and my mother is already sending me texts about feeling ""left out"" and ""sick, old and alone."" She's been sick about 90% of my childhood: chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, etc. She used to get very angry and scream at us if she felt she wasn't getting enough love or attention from us, particularly if she felt bad and we didn't notice.

I think she is starting to get upset already at the changes that aren't including her. I'm not going to lie--I'm REALLY fucking tired of it all already. And it's been less than a month into the engagement.

1600,Not the A-hole,"The only other person on my team at my level is a man who's muslim. This month because he's celebrating ramadan, he cannot work after 5pm(ish) because he needs to pray/break his fast.

Our job is demanding and requires long hours when work needs to be done (otherwise, it has a good work/life balance). We're supposed to take turns handling these things after hours, but because of ramadan, I have to do everything this month. And of course, we are insanely busy this month so I'm working 16 hour days, and I can't complain because it's his religion.

It isn't just this month, though. He goes to temple to pray at lunch and is gone for almost two hours. If meetings fall during that time (which they often do, we're in back to back meetings all day), he expects me to attend meetings for him. And he won't even give me a heads up that I need to cover for him - he'll just expect me to take all his meetings between 12-2pm (as if I don't have my own work/meetings to take care of). And again, I can't complain because it's his religion.

My boyfriend says I need to accept these things because he's a devout muslim. But where is the line of what's acceptable at work? We were told when we were hired that if work needs to be done, we're expected to stay late or work from home to get it done. If I said ""I'm not working after 5pm this month even though it's crucial to my department to do so in order to get our work done"" I'd be fired.

AITA for not being more understanding about his religion? Do I need to be the one to make accommodations at work? I just feel so resentful at having to pick up his slack.

I should give a disclaimer that I also dislike him in general because he's not a good worker or good at his job, so these issues are fuel to my fire.

&#x200B;

Edit to add clarifications:

* I am not religious at all. Our company gives everyone paid holiday's for Christmas - that's the only 'religious' holiday we have off. Other than that, we have the regular 'bank holidays' off.
* We're in northern CA. Sun doesn't set until 7:30/8pm here, but he leaves at 5pm.
* He goes to temple every day, not just Friday. We do have a private room in our office that other muslim employees use to pray. 
* Part of my annoyance is that he was supposed to be hired to a role senior to me. I was hired before him, in a junior level so my manager could train me. Then the other guy we worked with was promoted to a different department, so my manager said she wanted to find someone with experience who could step into a senior role and mentor me. He supposedly came with a lot of experience, and yet he's TERRIBLE at his job. In our 1:1 my manager even said, ""Yeah, you caught on a lot faster than him, I'll need you to babysit him a bit longer."" He's been there for nearly six months. If he really had experience in this field and was hired in a senior role, he should not need to be watched/trained by me, who only stepped into this field a few months before he was hired but was somehow able to pick everything up.
* Our salaries are high, because of the field we're in/job we have. And part of the high salary is the expectation that this job requires a lot of work - something that was stated in all my interviews. I came from a different field and my salary doubled when I came here - and I was hired in a junior role, not a senior role. I'm assuming he makes more than me because the intention was he was supposed to be senior to me. (This, again, adds fuel to my fire because I know he's making more than me while I do so much more work and am a more valuable employee.) 
   * We also get comp time though we're salary. So if I work 16 hours on a Tuesday, my boss encourages me to work a half day on Friday. But because we're insanely busy this month and I don't have help from him, I don't get to have comp time because I'm consistently covering.
* Our department is small because it's new. We don't have exec approval for any new hires at least until EOY. This is fine, because most of the time this isn't an issue. But the storm of being so busy this month with him basically working a 6 hour day is what's causing me frustration.
   * Before he was hired we had a different, experienced person in his place and everything went along GREAT. While I was training under him, I would join late night calls/meetings just to shadow him while he did them and I picked it up really fast. 
   * And the issue I have is: we wouldn't seem to need another employee if he was able to work normal hours. Or, if he just did his job better. I'm honestly wondering if this would be an issue with another person who had the same hours (2 hour prayer break, won't work after 5pm during ramadan), but was a better worker. Some examples, just because I'm feeling rant-y?
      * He has over 700 unread emails the last time I saw his computer. I could understand the insane inbox if we were execs or something getting CC'd on 100's of emails a day - but we are not managers, we have no direct reports to us. We get maybe 40-50 emails a day, and immediately I will label and archive them (if they don't require a response), or label/flag them if I need to do an action on them. But he doesn't. even. read. them. And then he has the audacity to come to me and say ""What email are you talking about? I don't think I was on that one."" - No, you were on it, I can see that you are copied, but you just haven't looked through your emails.
      * If we're on a call or in a meeting and someone says, ""x needs to be done"" - and x is related to his project, he doesn't think, ""Hm, since x is my responsibility, I should write down the action item and get it done."" He needs to be explicitly told by our manager, ""I need you to do this today."" So because I don't want shit to fall through the cracks because it comes back looking bad on our whole department, I will take note of the task and remind him later about it. A few times I've tried not doing this, just to see if he'll actually do it on his own, and he won't. He's at least 5 years older than me so it's not like he's new to this and again: he was hired in a senior role.
      * He will ask me how to do something, and even though I have step by step instructions on processes that I send him, he will still - after 6 months - ask me to walk him through it. So I do, verbally. He will look me in the face and nod as if he's listening - while not taking any notes - and then when he executes it... it's totally wrong. Didn't take notes while I was telling him or showing him what to do, didn't follow the process document. At this point I'm just like, ""Are you stupid?""

&#x200B;

**So here's where I'm leaving off:**

While I may not fully understand the time necessary to take off due to religious obligations (prayer time, being home to break fast, etc), I do understand it's protected by law. My personal feelings of ""that's not fair"" are, in this case, more related to the person, not the religious holiday/requirements.

I'm not an asshole for feeling annoyed, but I am an asshole for not addressing his work ethic with my manager directly. My annoyances are less about him taking time off for his religion and more that I just don't think he's a good employee and hate working with him because he doesn't do his job well. He's constantly dumping work on me and it has just become more pronounced this month. 

During my next review I'll find a way to bring up my concerns about the even workload and how quickly he's catching on, and if he's truly the ""senior"" person on our team. My mom, who's my venting board for most day to day things, keeps telling me to parlay this into a raise.",201,530,0.96
1601,Not the A-hole,"I’m using a throwaway because family knows about my regular account. 

I’m a 17 year old girl living in NYC, but my mother lives in Rhode Island - she moved there from NYC to be with her now-husband. 

During the custody battle 16ish years ago, my father was given full custody of me and my mother was ordered to pay child support (she was a doctor and made more money than my father - my father was a firefighter for 35 years). She never paid the child support (totaling over $90,000 as of now) and the only reason my dad never pursued it is because we were doing okay financially and she had kids from another marriage. Example 1 of my dad being the bigger person. 

When I would visit her I would always get sick of arguments between her and my older brothers, resulting in me not wanting to go to her house anymore (she was living upstate at this time). When I was 13 we had a fight and I stopped going up there for about a year. I eventually went back up and was civil - as my dad said, I just played the game. 

Then when I was 16 I was going through documents and I saw the custody papers, and saw that my mother was ordered to pay child support every month until I was 21 years old. I asked my dad about the money, since college was right around the corner and I had my heart set on going to college in Texas. My dad sat me down and told me how she never paid a dime, and I started to realize things. 


I would always leave things at my mom house (clothes, video games, etc) and my mind would think my mom bought them. My dad bought everything. He essentially bought me two wardrobes and never said a word. He never told me about this and even after the conversation we had, he told me he still wants me to love my mother. 

I just... I can’t. I can’t sit by and look at the life my brothers have and think that my mother cares the same for me as she does them. 

She was supposed to pay child support and she didn’t. That money would be enough to pay for my entire 4 years at Texas A&M with the scholarships I have. But my dad told me he can pay for it.

She had been violent, unfaithful, and honestly she's a very negative person. He had her blocked on social media for the last several years.

My mother feels that she should have dad's wedding band. I won't give it to her. I want it for myself, and I feel certain my dad wouldn't want her to have it. But one of my siblings insists that I should give her the band. His reasons: ""She's gotten nothing since Dad died... you're being cruel... She needs closure... It's more hers than ours.""",27,175,0.96
1603,Not the A-hole,"I’m getting ready to leave my husband. Applying to jobs, looking at women shelters near said jobs, but I haven’t told my husband I’m leaving him yet. 

Today I’m getting ready to go to the gym, and I notice that our car is gone. I ask my husband and he says his sister and law took it because she has a doctors appointment TOMORROW.

Here’s a little background:
We’ve been supporting his sister financially for 4 years now. She has severe mental illness issues. She’s 30, 4 years older than me. She dropped out of school(that he was paying for) and just completed a 6 month certificate program this month. 
A year ago my husband lost his job. Right when he lost his job, she crashed her car that he paid for. He was really upset, because she is always tailgating the car in front of her and would get very aggressive if someone criticized her driving. She totaled her car and FUCKED the car in front of her(she’s fine, and so is the other person thank God). He said that she would get my car and he would use the insurance money to buy me a new one. 
6 months ago, my husband started a consulting position that rendered his car useless since he’d be in a different state every week. So instead of getting me a new car, which I never asked for in the first place mind you, he gave his sister his car. 
1 month ago, he drove my car to the doctors office AND TOTALED MY CAR. Since then, her and I have been sharing his car during the week and all three of us have to share it during the weekend. Luckily I am abundant with good supportive friends who offer to drive me around during the weekends. But during the week it’s a mess since she lives 30 min away. So I have to drive 30 min, pick her up, and she drives me 30 min back to my place. I recently quit my job to pursue my own education, and I used up all of my savings to support all three of us while he was jobless. She refused to get welfare because she wants a certain kind of job and refuses to work anywhere else. I recently left my job to get an accounting certificate. 

Key takeaways: she crashed her car, then he crashed MY car, and now I have to share one car with the three of them. 

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY. 
If we’re all sharing one car they should at least keep me in the loop right? Well today I finally made the comment “she really needs to get her own car” and he STORMS OFF. Like left our place. 
Then I get a notification from my bank, and he just transferred 8k into my account. I message him asking what it’s for, and he said it’s to pay me back from when I was supporting them both so I can “buy my own fucking car.” 

I mean I’ll take my savings back to start a new life. 
But am I the asshole for thinking his sister should finally act like an adult, get a job, and get her own car? In the grand scheme of things it won’t matter, but I would hate to look back on this and think I’m the selfish one.

Edit: a lot of people seem to think she totaled both cars. She totaled my own, my husband totaled mine. I just wanted to make sure he doesn’t turn this on me during the divorce. Like make me feel like I was a greedy wife or something.",61,269,0.97
1604,Not the A-hole,"My mom calls me at 7pm last night and says my 73 year old father went to a Drs appointment at 1pm and hasnt returned home or called. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis almost 20 years ago and it has slowly been breaking him down. He walks hunched over and uses a cane and also seems less lucid. 

I live 3 states away so I dont see him regularly but I have noticed the changes when I do visit. Hes mostly retired so he only leaves the house occasionally. Other than that he stays in his room. My parents have also been emotionally divorced for about 25 years, they are just roommates who share a last name now. They hate each other. Mom has no idea what his dr name is or where it is. Nothing.

Anyways so my sister and I start blowing up his phone. Goes straight to voicemail. She lives there so starts heading over to their house while I call the city hospitals. Hes not there. 

Finally at 745pm my dad calls my mother to say hes coming home and he'll explain when he gets there. An HOUR later he arrives and said he got lost going to the appointment. Apparently he drove around for 7 hours but during that time he did manage to call the dr to reschedule. He didn't think to call any of us for help or anything.

My sister and I feel like he shouldn't be driving by himself anymore and we need to get power of attorney while he is still competent to sign. Our mom said she will drive him but we have a feeling eventually she will get bored with being nice and send him off by himself just so she doesn't have to do it. He can be very grouchy and mean so I dont really blame her for not wanting to go head to head with him.

My sister has 2 kids and 2 jobs and I live far away with 2 kids so neither of us are in a position to be his driver/help right now.

1607,Asshole,"Will keep this short because otherwise I’ll write a whole novel. I have two kids (12 and 9) and two years ago my ex and I divorced after I discovered him cheating on me with his 27 yr old assistant. They both conspired to get me to divorce him first so they could be together. Felt like I was in a terrible lifetime movie but there you have it. 

He has married this woman and now they live ~2 hours away. He makes very good money and her family is very wealthy so their lifestyle is leagues better than mine. This is important. 

Last year my kids went to spend the summer with their dad. He was still dating her then but told me she wouldn’t be around. My kids ended up telling me the truth, that she was living with him. I blew up and we had a massive fight over this and I told him that I won’t be sending the kids over if he continues to lie about her. 

Then he married her last fall and the kids went over to his place for Thanksgiving with their grandparents (his parents). They had an amazing time there because they A) got tons of presents from his wife and grandparents and B) as per the words of my oldest “everyone is happy not like mom who’s always sad and gets upset at us all the time.” My daughter apparently told all of them what a sad sack I am and how depressing I make their home to be. I was humiliated. 

AITA if I want my kids to spend less time with my ex and his new wife? I admit part of it comes from selfishness and insecurity (I’m worried they like their fathers home more) but another part is because I don’t want to tell them the details of our divorce (the cheating, etc) but I feel like I’ll be tempted to the more they talk about how cool their dad’s new wife is. My daughters have become completely enamored by her glossy, trendy lifestyle and talk about her ALL THE TIME. It makes me want to gouge my eyes out. I wish they were on my side more but it feels like I’m losing them just like I lost my home, finances, and happiness two years ago.

Edit: my kids know about the cheating but they don’t know the other nasty details. Thanks to a bad therapist a while ago, they have the view of “daddy cheated and was wrong but he and mommy weren’t meant to be, so now they both can be happy.” So they’ve completely forgiven him. I feel like they’re too young still to fully understand the hurt I went through and simply see it as “dad and mom didn’t work out but now dad is happy with his new wife. We like spending time with dad because everyone is happy now.”",126,98,0.85
1608,Not the A-hole,"Some context/backstory - I (23F) am currently pregnant and also have a 3 y/o child. My husband (34M) is a disabled veteran, and stays at home with our child. We are very fortunate that I have a great job that when coupled with his veteran disability benefits, provides a modest but comfortable life. I do work A LOT, and am in graduate school full time, and have voiced that I feel like I don’t have much time to rest or relax.

Here’s where I’m not sure if I’m the asshole...
We went out today after I got off work to find some new storage containers. My husband asked me if it would be okay to go to his moms house on Sunday to cook dinner for her. I was not invited.

I asked “Why Sunday?” because I was hoping he would remember it’s Mother’s Day for me as well. He says “Because it’s Mother’s Day?” as if I had forgotten. He will be cooking for his mom at her house, I will be home with 3 y/o.

When we got home, I went upstairs to our bedroom. I am not a screaming/throwing/slamming doors type, but I did slam the door and do feel terrible about it. However, I’m upset that there are no plans for me for Mother’s Day. I will be home entertaining our toddler while he loads up our outdoor smoker and smokes meats for MIL’s special dinner at her house. I haven’t left my bedroom or spoken to my husband, he hasn’t spoken to me.

AITA for expecting some sort of a Mother’s Day celebration? I don’t want him to disregard his mother, but I would like to be acknowledged as well. I work so hard and go to school full time so that we can have and continue to have a comfortable life, and have truly been burning the candle at both ends lately. I am so disappointed that there are no plans for me, but feel like an asshole for being upset that someone isn’t doing something special for me on a Hallmark holiday.  I truly am not a “look at me, give me attention” type but I was really hoping that I would get a day just for me. I always go all out on Fathers Day and was hoping that maybe this year would be my year for reciprocation. 

I feel like an asshole for expecting my husband to do special things for me on a day he has already planned with his mom. I feel like an asshole for feeling like I deserve any extra anything for doing what a mom and wife should do by working hard to provide for my family. I just feel like an asshole.

1612,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: My mother died of breast cancer earlier this year and I've never been happier, in large part due to her life insurance policy from which i benefitted. One brother says that I'm being an ass hole for treating this situation like a positive.

I'm 22, and I have two brothers at 20(D) and 27(E), the three of us are very close. My mother died earlier this year after a years long struggle with breast cancer. Another detail is that I've had BPD since high school, which makes it difficult for my family to understand the way I feel and the things I do sometimes.

I failed my first year of university and moved back home. My mom and I became like best friends during this time, my state of mind improved, we spent lots of time together, and she comforted me when my boyfriend cheated and broke up with me.

In 2017, mom got stage 4 breast cancer, which moved into her brain and made her life and mine complete hell.

During all of this time, I'm usually the only one at home caring for her. D is attending the university I failed out of, E is in another state having his own successful life, and dad is working or escaping all the time. I was selfishly miserable.

I loved my mother more than anyone, but when they took her to hospice, I was a little happier. I  helplessly watched her go through a lot of pain at home and I was ready to stop seeing and being around that. I visited frequently at first, but as time wore on, and two months passed with her in hospice, I visited maybe once every week or so. My dad started taking off work and ceasing his weekend escapes to spend time with mom and keep her company. Brothers are too far away to be there regularly.

On January 10th, my mind completely fried from the constant downpour of emotions, my maternal grandmother called me and told me that mom had died. I cried for a couple of hours, but I felt okay. I knew I would miss her and be sad about her death, but my prevailing feeling the rest of that day was complete relief. I'm not good at pinning down my emotions, and when I told my brother how I felt, he said it was just me being happy that her pain is over, but I'm not sure. It felt entirely selfish to me.

The funeral passed, and I learned that my mother named my brothers and I as beneficiaries for her life insurance policy. I'd never had much money, so I was happy when I learned about this. I'd be financially independent for the first time in my life.

This month, I was talking to my brothers in a conference call as we frequently do, and I told them that ever since mom died, I've been happy. My emotions aren't as erratic as usual, and financial freedom feels really great.

D seemed mortified, and told me that I was a real bitch for treating my mother's death as a positive. E, ever the understanding big brother, told D that everyone deals with things differently and that RubyStrings is just different. I agreed with E, but I feel like D is right on some level.

So my family is Hindu but I’m a leaning atheist because I just feel the concept of religion is stupid asf. I still am forced to do religious shit for my family because I am afraid of telling them because once I made jokes about being an atheist and I got cussed out by my dad. Although my religion isn’t very strict, one constraint gets me so mad. I can’t eat beef or pork. I know it seems weird to be mad but just understand me please. I love food and I’m very explorative with my tastebuds and am always willing to try new food. Of those new foods involves beef or pork. Because of my religion(Hinduism), I was barred from eating beef or pork. Initially I didn’t care but when I started becoming more of a foodie it became enraging. I tried beef once when I went to a fair with some people for a trip. My whole group wanted burgers so I didn’t want to contest because I was shy to tell them. I got really turned off from veggie burgers because the last few I had were so bad. So I got a regular cheeseburger. I bit into it and the first bite felt like a whole new world of taste. Like I’ve never felt this before. But I was sad since this was one of the few opportunities I got to try it. I had bacon once in Mac and Cheese at a hotel for a band trip and that was amazing too. 

Sometimes however I get cravings for cheeseburgers or steak or bacon and my mood becomes so angry because I can’t satisfy my cravings. It just feels like nothing replaces beef or pork. I try all the general stuff I use to beat cravings like mints and gum but it didn’t work. Whenever I get the opportunity I go grab something beef or pork related and chow down like no tomorrow. I always do it behind their back. Recently even my brother has started doing it because he tried it and loved it.

I just think about how when I was born I was forced to follow a religion I didn’t want to. I just hate how I have to comply with rules of a religion just because my family follows them. I have thought of what if I get busted. I sometimes like to think I’m justified because I think it’s dumb they are pushing their made up rules on to me and that it’s just nature when you are not allowed to do something your first instinct would be to do it.

A few weeks ago I was looking at a subreddit of a mutual game we play and saw a post by someone with the same username as his IGN for that video game. I checked it out and sure enough, it was him, and I peered through the history. Everything was more or less okay, I don't judge, except then I found a few strange posts.


I found a few posts of his in /r/theredpill and /r/seduction , nothing overly sexist or creepy, but a lot of stuff that implied that woman were something to be ""obtained,"" and other sorts of objectification. He seemed pretty curious about the red pill and eager to learn about it, as if it will him get with a girl. Asking advice about stuff like how to gain confidence. There was even this weird thing about using essential oils or something for some sort of pavlov conditioning to get women. There was also a post about how all women are assholes and picky and that you should ask them out regardless of your confidence because as a man, you will never be good enough for a woman, so there's no point in trying to gain confidence. I never would have expected this from him, not that it was entirely out of character, but rather that he didn't seem like he'd be like this and certainly never treated any girls this way.

1621,UPDATE,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b4wy7h/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_give_up_on_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Hello reddit. Some people asked for an update on this post, so here it is. I considered writing it closer to our initial reconciliation, but I’m glad I didn’t, because this situation became bigger than I thought it would. 

My daughter unblocked me so she could call me, and she ripped me apart almost as harshly as you guys did. Telling me I never believed in her, that I think she’s an idiot, etc. I apologized profusely, and told her that I didn’t realize the damage I was about to do when I made my comments, and promised that I would support her in her journey in any way possible. I asked her if there was anything I could help her with to make this journey less difficult, and told her I’d her find an internship opportunity with one of my colleagues. The conversation was pretty heavy on both sides; the two of us couldn’t stop crying. But it seemed like after my apology, we were in a better place. Despite still having reservations as her ability as a doctor, I was going to try to support her. 

Well, the semester ended and grades come in any day now. Last night, she sat me down, practically in tears. She told me that she wanted to prepare me, but she was going to get an F in a class. I was literally dumbfounded. She told me she was caught cheating on a test. She basically blamed me; she said after our conversation, there was too much pressure on her, so she caved and sneaked a whole sheet of notes into her test. That F, combined with an academic integrity violation, basically ensured that med school won’t be an option anymore. 

When I found out, I was less angry and more extremely distraught. I apologized for putting so much pressure on her, but told her that being a doctor sincerely isn’t worth losing her integrity. She told me that a part of her realized I had a point during our first conversation; she likely would not get into med school with her current grades. So she tried even harder to achieve her goals: studying longer hours, using supplemental books, doing endless practice problems. But when she kept getting below the mean on her orgo practice tests, she tried it with notes and got above the mean. She thought it would be a fool proof plan.

This is definitely not the update I wanted to give reddit. Thank you for understanding.


Update 2: I have a group chat with my daughters. I sent them a link to this suggestion, because I thought it would be helpful: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bn4hl6/update_aita_for_telling_my_daughter_to_give_up_on/en2xbad/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

My older daughter found the post and read it. She called me and was extremely upset, and told me not to feel bad for my daughter. Apparently, the reason my daughter was getting subpar grades was because she wasn’t putting in the effort. She’d call me and say she spent hours studying and doing problem sets, but really has been partying her ass off and buying study sheets for tests. As I’m writing this, I’m dumbfounded and I can barely believe it. I don’t believe it to be honest. I’m going to approach my daughter and talk to her about this. Not sure if I’m updating again.


Update #3: Daughter and I had a long talk. And it’s a doozy. 

So her freshman year, she actually put in effort. She was trying hard, so those hours of studying weren’t a lie. However, she had a very traumatic life event that she did not tell anyone about, and spiraled after that. She stopped caring about her classes, thinking she could easily get a job as a doctor via cheating. She did illicit drugs basically daily.  

When I called her, she realized her lifestyle wasn’t sustainable (as in she could not become a doctor and would have to put in effort to achieve that goal). But she wanted to continue her lifestyle, so she And then she got caught cheating.  

She told me she doesn’t even have a passion for medicine anymore, or anything. She is just numb. She says it’s easy to be happy around her family, because we only see her for a short period of time. But she had been hiding her whole life and sadness from us. To me, this sounds like severe depression. We will definitely be going to individual and family therapy.",452,3848,0.97

1623,Asshole,"My brother is 34 and I am 26. We share the same mother. My father, 68, married my mother when my brother was 8. 

My brother has never had a good relationship with our father. He never called him “dad”. To be fair dad was hard on him, and he did display favouritism towards me (as I was his biological daughter). 

When he was 13 and I was 5, our mother passed from cancer. His relationship with our dad soured even more after that, and as a teenager they’d get into a lot of fights. 

My brother left home at 18 for university and never looked back. He barely visited us, only for Christmas. He met a girl at school and they got married young. He didn’t tell our dad about his first grandkid and if wasnt for me, he would never have known.

Anyways, he became a doctor. His wife and him soon opened a successful medical spa. Now it has multiple locations and they are easily earning $500k a year. I know this because my friend works as their secretary.

They live in a gigantic mansion, they drive brand name cars, their kids go to private schools. His wife wears all designer clothes. They go on vacation every other month. Point is, they’re loaded as fuck.

My dad got diagnosed with a terminal cancer 1 month ago. He’s declined very quickly and is at home with my husband and I. I told my brother, who came to visit for 2 days. It was a brief and awkward meeting.

Before he left, my brother told me he’d be willing to cover half of the costs of a private caregiver. I said ok, because I didn’t think it would be too expensive.

In fact, its insanely expensive. I called him and told him I can’t afford even half of the caregivers salary, and I asked if he could contribute more. He said he’d cover 60% and no more. We got into an argument and he said “Why should I treat this man as a dad when he’s never even treated me like a son?” I said now is not the time for decades long quarrels.

Is it absurd for me to expect him to pay more than 60%? He literally earns 10x more than me a year! I’d take care of my dad myself, but that would mean taking time off work and I can’t do that.

I’m feeling really stressed right now. The govt supplied home care that visits us is not enough. I do whatever I can after work but its the morning that we need the most care. I’ve tried my best to increase our govt care but to no avail. I feel inadequate, like I can’t provide my father with a good quality of life in his last months on earth. What infuriates me is that my brother could easily cover all the costs of a private caregiver for the rest of my dad’s life, and then some, just by going on 1 less vacation this year.

At least his wife was kind enough to send a brand new hospital style bed for my father to use. I doubt my brother knew that she did this, and would probably get mad at her if he found out.

1626,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of context;me and my partner were living at his moms house because I was made homeless. We were saving for our own place but I got pregnant and it was a rough pregnancy until I was 20 weeks along. 3 months after my son was born my health was going down hill and after a series of gp and hospital appointments I was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  (Now in remission and doing very well)
During treatment  days my partner’s mom would take over the care of my son and my partner would be with me at the hospital for support as I had no one else. 

I would feel an enormous amount of mommy guilt for not being able to take my son on fun days out like his nanny did. Even on non-treatment days I struggled to hold him, bathe him and change him and  my MIL would insist on doing it even if my partner would say he would do it but as it was his mom he’d let her carry on so he could do his assignments.  

On a few occasions I did go out with her people would approach us and make the assumption that she was his mom and I’ll be honest I did resent her for it and was jealous and I told her about it and she seemed like she understood but after that chat I feel that she would go out of her way to take my son out the house or take him out of my arms, insist on pushing his pushchair and constantly try to get his attention.


We are now in our own home but my MIL constantly asks if she can have my son and take him on days out- when I ask if I can tag along too she then seems a  bit hesitant or she will pop round unexpectedly and say she’s taking my son to this event or group and just expects me to be ok with it and if I say no she gets a bit stroppy. 

Recently I found out she went to the bank to open him a bank account and the bank said no because she wasn’t a parent and she would need a birth certificate, she then rang my partner and told him to drop off my son’s birth certificate.

Well my partner told me and I lost my cool and phoned her to tell her she needed to back off he’s our son not hers and we already had opened up a bank account for him when he was born and she knew the details so was more than welcome to deposit the money she had for him there but she seemed uneasy and insisted on having the account attached to her. 

-sidenote the account we opened is the kind where you can deposit money in but the money will not be able to be accessed by my son until he is of age but it is attached to my bank account but his account has its own sort code and account number separate from mine. 

My partner is torn because he can see his mom has the best of intentions at heart but feels like she wanted to do this so she can be like “oh look what nanny did for you” as she didn’t open up bank accounts for her own children. 

I feel upset about the situation but feel as though she has crossed the line AITA?",38,46,0.88

1630,Not the A-hole,"Not actually me, but my SO - we're on the fence of the assholishness of this and I was wondering what reddit had to say.

&#x200B;

My SO (James) has worked for a franchise of a restaurant for several years now. He genuinely loves his job. But the last year, the owner of the franchise (Daniel) has had a lot of financial trouble and it has led to a LOT of bad paychecks for James.

&#x200B;

Daniel didn't want to pay for direct deposits so he switched to paper paychecks. Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. James and I have a bank account that has no physical branch location, so the only way to cash a check is to use the app or go to a cash checking location or the issuing. Then, Daniel decided he didn't want to pay for pre-printed checks anymore. Which meant that the app (which always declines hand written checks for some reason) and all the check cashing places were no longer an option. James had to go to the issuing bank. He even opened an account there so we could stop paying the fee each time. Problem is, the bank would never let him cash it the day he received it. Because they could see that there wasn't enough money in Daniel's account.

&#x200B;

Daniel would either ignore him until he had money or make a million excuses. He was always somehow able to get the money in there in time for other employees' (with accounts at other banks) checks not to bounce, and always eventually paid James in a day or two. Whenever we tried to file complaints with the job board they said they couldn't do anything because he always got paid decently quickly. They suggested to us that we file a police report since he's simply writing bad checks. We never did since the money always eventually got to us - plus, none of James' coworkers really believed we had such a problem with the checks since theirs never had a problem.

&#x200B;

This week was more of the same, but James threatened him with the police report since not getting this paycheck meant our power would have been shut off. Daniel exchanged the bad check for cash, so James was paid. Everybody else... not so much.

&#x200B;

Every single paycheck bounced. People are absolutely livid about it, and finally believe James about all of the shit Daniel's been putting us through. They want to file police reports for the 12 bad checks he's written.

&#x200B;

I know - this seems like cut and dry NTA territory. But Daniel's selling the franchise back to corporate, and he's only going to be here for a couple more weeks. He's a father, already lost his car, and he might lose his house. Bad checks in our area can carry up to a $1000 fine and 6 months in jail - EACH. Multiply that by 12 and it's not great.

&#x200B;

We get that legally, we're totally within our rights. But what about assholishly? Would we be the assholes for reporting all of these bad checks to the police, potentially costing Daniel thousands of dollars and putting him in jail for years, even though he's out the door in 2 weeks anyway?",19,84,0.88
1631,Not the A-hole,"Bit of background, my sister is a single mother of two because some guys are asshats. Her oldest is 2 years old and a non-verbal autistic which puts a good amount of stress on the whole family just because of the issues that come with him being born that way.

As of late my sister has taken to telling me "" Varaskana, he doesn't understand. "" damn near any time I tell him not to do something.

1634,Not the A-hole,"So my great grandfather, my mom's grandfather, had lived with us for the past 5 or 6 years because the only people that were willing to take care of him were us and his son (my grandfather). So for the past 5 years we've taken care of him full time. I'm now in college and my parents both work full time jobs so most of the time I was left to take care of him, which was hard, but I didn't mind. I'd drive 20 minutes to school and in between classes I'd drive back home to make his meals and check on him. It got to the point where he could no longer walk and he was completely unaware of what was happening because... Well he was 96 years old. So we live in KY and the entire rest of the family lives in OH but it's only an hour away. Over the 5 years, no one has come to visit him until last month when the doctors told us he was dying. His three kids came to visit a couple times and his grandkids came to see him as well. Now the thing with his kids, is that all of them somehow turned out to be greedy assholes despite my great grandfather being the sweetest and most generous man in the world. This includes my mom's father, who never had much of a part in her life and instead my great grandfather, we'll call him J, raised her. J has always said that my mom was his favorite grandkid even though he's not supposed to have favorites because she always visited him and he played a huge role in MY life too. Anyways, he passed away a couple weeks ago and his inheritance went to my mother. He left us $10,000 but we don't really want the money and his kids are throwing a big fit about it so we decided to spend all the money on his funeral. He got the most beautiful casket and service I've ever seen. Well now they're all fighting over his belongings and the one thing he said he wanted me to have was his 38. Special Revolver. BUT now his daughter is threatening to sue us because years and years ago he told her she could have it even though on his death bed he said he wanted me to have it.

1635,Everyone Sucks,"The answer is probably yes, but I will preface with the week we had.

Wednesday (17th bday) he admitted he gave away our liquor to his friends that were over visiting. Didn’t make a scene over it when his friends were here.

Thursday (the next day) he’s busted on the porch with his friend smoking pot outside of our home. Yes I made a scene bc wtf—blatant disrespect. Confiscated his pipe.

Friday (the next day) he’s busted smoking IN MY HOUSE although husband and I’s house rules have always been clear it’s not allowed here. AITA for losing my shit? 

This kid has been failing classes for years, doesn’t want to work, and creates a sob story about his mental health deteriorating when the hammer comes down. His father is a sucker for it and gives no consequences for any of these things that happened last week. He’s still coming and going as he pleases, comes home 30 minutes past the expected time given by his father, etc.


EDIT: after busting him smoking in my house on Friday, he played the whole “do you really think I’m that stupid” card, and I said “Yes obviously you must be retarded.” I didn’t actually walk in on him smoking pot inside.

When I start seeing that acne crop up, which it does like clockwork as she has a healthy, regular cycle of 28 days, it is a signal to me to start treating her exceptionally well in the following ways: I indulge whatever food cravings she has, I pick up the slack around the house, she gets to decide our entertainment, I don't complain when she hits our weed stash excessively, and generally create a positive environment for her by modifying my own behavior.

1642,Asshole,"So me (F27) and my boyfriend (M26) were together for about 2 years. We moved in together about 8 months ago and everything was going great. We talked about marriage, got involved with family etc. 

The trouble started a few months ago. For context, my boyfriend’s Mum and both his siblings both suffer from a pretty nasty illness that leaves them needing a fair bit of physical care. They’re totally fine cognitively, but none of them can walk, cook, drive etc. My boyfriend didn’t tell me this until we’d been dating for a few months and it never really occurred to me at the time why he kept it secret.

Well, now I know. Like I said, a few months ago we started talking about kids. We live in a crappy little apartment that barely had room for the two of us, never mind a child. Money isn’t an issue but I started talking about moving and he seemed completely fine with it. We started looking on RightMove, I found us a gorgeous 3 bedroom townhouse less than 30 minutes from his work. It all just seemed to perfect...

Until I actually told him I was ovulating. Basically my boyfriend freaked out and kind of started a fight? But it wasn’t really a fight, just kind of... I don’t know. He cried. He just doesn’t want to have a child with me. He knows it’s likely that whatever child he has is likely to inherit some serious genetic issues from his side. After spending the best part of 20 years looking after his sisters he just doesn’t want to go through that again. 

So we talked. And talked. And talked. Non stop over the last few months. He just won’t budge. Don’t get me wrong, he wants kids as much as I do, but he wants to adopt or get a sperm donor. I just... can’t. I’m not going to explain all my feelings here as to why, but I just can’t. 

So we split. I still love him. I think he still loves me. His family all think I’m a selfish bitch and basically excommunicated me from everything. It’s been a week now but I still haven’t processed it fully, you know? Like it hasn’t actually happened?

Everyone else is fine with that, but...

My mother has taken offense at this and is badgering me that she just wants to come see her ""when she is brand new"" at the hospital and immediately go back home. She is the only one who doesn't accept about our restriction. Also, mom lives over 400 miles away, so no matter what she says, this wouldn't be just a quick pop-in visit.

The title is the essential question, but here's a bit of background info:

The event in question is my grandparents' 60th anniversary. They and the entire rest of my family are catholic-christian with me and my older brother being the exceptions. We are both atheists. Now, the problem is that the upcoming event will have a very strong religious undertone (starts with a church service, prayers all throughout the event) and my parents want me to take part in all of this. That includes some of the prayers containing declarations of belief in god and other things conflicting with my decision to be atheist.

My parents argue that my grandparents can't imagine a person not believing in god, that it would kill the vibe of the event and that I should just ""suck it up and power through"".

I myself am also very conflicted because on one hand I want to make everyone happy, but on the other hand I don't want to lie and fake a belief I can't support.

1646,Not the A-hole,"A little over a year ago I bought myself some Beats headphones (the wireless earbuds) to wear to the gym. It was quite the splurge considering I’m in grad school and have absolutely no money, but I saved up and was able to get a pair. 
Fast forward to Christmas this this year, my mom’s dog had somehow dug through my gym bag and chewed up my headphones. After explaining to my mom how expensive they were, she agreed to pay 75% for a new pair. I bought the same exact pair. 
Now, I’m back home for the week since it is summer break. My bedroom door is broken and won’t close all the way (due to my stepdad breaking it, which i have repeatedly asked him to fix), so last night when I was gone my mom’s dog pushed my door open, somehow managed to get into my barely open gym bag and chewed up my new pair. 
I told my mom and she refuses to buy a new pair because she already did once. I understand it’s annoying to have to keep buying me headphones, I’d obviously never expect her to in any other situation, but i feel that if your dog is chewing up someone’s belongings you’re pretty much obligated out of common courtesy to replace that item.

AITA for assuming she should replace them?

TLDR: Mom’s dog has chewed up my nice headphones twice, but mom doesn’t thing she should have to replace them a second time.

Update/edit: have talked to my mom about it and she agreed to round up some old iphones at her work (she’s an IT manager) and let me sell those at a kiosk to get the money to pay for new headphones. She also is going to make my stepdad fix my door next week. I think this is a relatively fair outcome. Thank you for your all’s opinions!

1650,Not the A-hole,"So I (M, 21) work in a large shopping mall. My store does not have a bathroom in it, and the closest mall bathroom is literally more than a quarter mile away. 

However, we have an American Girl store right next to us, and it has a bathroom in it.  My store and they are chill, they borrow Bluetooth speakers from us, we share stories, I helped one of their employees when she got a cut once, they give us candy, it's a friendly relationship.  The best part of that relationship is the guys from my store using their in store public bathroom, and as you can imagine the male bathroom in American Girl is the cleanest bathroom in the entire mall. Most of the time when I go in the automatic lights are off. 

The problem is, the little storage room that their cleaning ladies (all female, 20s to 40s) use for supplies is in the men's bathroom.  And the cleaners just bust in the door when I'm sitting in the stall dropping some gifts, talk to each other joking around about stuff, go into the storage room, grab stuff, and leave, ignoring me.  They never knock or anything. 

Because of the stupid American wide ass gaps in stalls, I can see them and they can see me.  Once, one of yelled over to me ""it's okay"" when... it's really not. There's no sexual harassment or anything, they just don't care. 

This has happened six or seven times now, either when I'm in the stall or when I'm at the urinals. It has to have happened to a real, paying customer for the store. Possibly not though, it really is an unused bathroom most of the time. 

So I'm stuck in a weird situation.  I don't want to complain to the very nice American Girl manager about the bathroom they are letting me use as a courtesy, but I also don't want to ignore it and do them a disservice by having a customer go off on them for this.  Also, it's mortifying as hell. 

Also, I haven't talked to the cleaners themselves about this because I have only ever seen them when I had my dick out at the urinal or I was in the stall, and that's not really the right situation to have a rational discussion about it all.

I love Dan very much and I have always tried to respect him and his choices. When he came out as gay to the family, I defended him against our bigoted extended family and did everything in my power to support him. 

&#x200B;

Ever since Dan came out, he's been experimenting with his hair and clothes. He's dyed his hair so many colors in the that I've lost track of all that he's done and he's bleached his hair so much that it is fried and desperately needs a trim. He's trying to grow it out, but it's so damaged that the ends are breaking off. 

&#x200B;

I was talking to my bridesmaids about planning the colors and coordinating what everyone was going to wear and one of my bridesmaids suggested that Dan get his hair trimmed and re-dyed for the wedding and I had to agree with her. She's a hairstylist and offered to do it for free and make sure his hair looked great for the wedding day. She said he could pick any color he wanted (within the realm of dye possibilities). I want to stress here that the color and cut of his hair is NOT the issue, it's simply the quality of his dye job and making sure his hair is trimmed and styled. He can have pink hair, blue hair, whatever he wants, as long as it looks like it was professionally done and not patchy and breaking off. My hair is dyed black, my mom's hair is bright purple right now, and bridesmaid has pink hair, so once again, the color is not the issue here.

&#x200B;

When I offered this to my brother a few days ago, he originally was enthusiastic about it and agreed to let bridesmaid fix his hair. He said he had never had his hair professionally done before so he was excited. That was until his boyfriend talked to him. His boyfriend told him that we were just being prejudiced against him and that we were singling him out for being gay, since no one else has to get their hair dyed like this for the wedding. Now Dan is turning down the offer and is saying that he might not even attend the wedding if we aren't going to be accepting of him. He also accused me of being a bridezilla.

&#x200B;

I didn't think my request was a bridezilla one, but I'm starting to regret ever asking. Everyone in the family with long hair is getting their hair styled on the wedding day and I just wanted to make sure that Dan looked the best he could. He's still going to be in the wedding no matter what and I won't ever force him to do anything that makes him uncomfortable, but I feel so guilty for asking him to do this, like I really was judging him like his boyfriend said.

She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.

The problem I have with this is:

1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.

2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her.""

I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?

As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it.

I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

I’ve explained to her that all she had to do was ask me and I would have gladly helped her. My mother, as well as some of my sisters, have said that I’m being extremely disrespectful and they don’t know what has happened to me. My mom also keeps saying that if my now wife would just apologize, then everything will go back to normal but I know that’s not the case because she would just bring up something different.
I guess my main point is that my mom and most of my sisters believe that my wife and I are in the wrong.

1656,No A-holes here,"Hello AITA. My (22f) partner(22m) has recently got a job at a fairly fancy hotel. I'm very proud of him, he is quite talented and it makes enough money for us both to live comfortably. (I stay at home, cook, clean, get the groceries etc.) I am Polish (he's English and we live in the UK) and have been raised to believe that you need to be dressed for your work. If you're a mechanic, you dress comfortably, and flexibly, when working with people, one should look professional and tidy.

Today, he gets ready for work. Comes downstairs, in a white button up shirt, and jeans. He was about to put on some light brown leather boots. 

I was... A little taken aback. I mentioned the jeans, and he said he was going to pop to a shop to grab some suit pants before work. To me... It's very irresponsible to leave something like that to literally half an hour before your first shift. I tell him he shouldn't wear light brown boots as they clash heavily and look unprofessional. He didn't know where his suit shoes were. I told him, so he wore those. All good. Then I notice his shirt has very dark sweat marks on the collar, and the buttons are stretches heavily because the shirt is too small. And it smells. Pretty bad. I haven't seen it in the wash for weeks. You can see his very heavy dark chest hair (which I love but I doubt random people at the hotel would share this enthusiasm) beneath it. At this point I was a little stressed, and I pointed out maybe he should leave early and grab a more fitting, shirt, and a vest to go underneath. He seemed visibly upset, and now more anxious for work than he was before. We talked about it, and I told him that I don't know whether he either doesn't know he's being sloppy or doesn't care, and if I was his boss I'd be -very- disappointed. I told him it was very worrying to me, and that it feels like something I really shouldn't have to point out to him. That he's a really talented and hard working man and it would suck for it to be downplayed by sloppyness. 

I kissed him goodbye and told him I can't wait to see him. He apologised and left, again, seemingly very stressed. So I'm sat here wondering... Am I the asshole for pointing all this out before his first day at work?",31,36,0.87
1657,Not the A-hole,"My ex-wife and I got married really young because she got pregnant with our daughter at that time. I don't want to give many details, but she ended up cheating on me with a colleague and we got divorced. 

She decided to give up custody rights and she never met our daughter even once. I've done everything to raise my daughter and I struggled really hard with depression after my wife cheated on me. But I'm doing really well now. I own a successful business with a friend, beat depression, and moved on with my life.

A couple of months ago, my ex made an appearance and asked me if she could attend our daughter's birthday. I was kind of happy, because my daughter always asked questions about her mother and wanted to meet her. But after their reunion, my ex wife proposed that we should share custody now. She tells me that she regrets her every decision and would love to spend time with our kid. Even my daughter was keen on moving in with her mother. But I don't think she deserves a place in our lives after everything she did to us. Visiting once in a while is fine but I don't want to give her any custody or rights. She herself decided that she didn't want to parent our daughter and ghosted us the entire time. WIBTA here?",322,1899,0.97
1658,Asshole,"Okay, so I'll try to be quick about this. Early on in my relationship my boyfriend asked me how many men I had been with before him. I don't really like talking about past exploits, but I knew it was important to him because he felt insecure thinking he was a lot less experienced than me. So I told him, he seemed glad that our partner counts were not that different. He knew I'm bisexual and didn't ask about my female partners so I didn't bother bringing it up. 

Fast forward to now and he thinks I tricked him by not telling him about my other partner count. Apparently one of our mutual friends was joking around about how I used to 'get around' or something. So later my boyfriend asks me about it, confused since I had told him I hadn't been with that many different guys. I said no I hadn't been with that many different guys, but I used to sleep around with women quite a bit. He got mad about this and said that I had kept it a secret, and I said that he never asked and I don't normally share that stuff anyway. He claims that he was led to believe that I had experimented with a couple girls which is why he never asked, but I don't know where he got that idea from. 

I guess I sort of chose not to tell him, but I would have told him if he asked. I'll admit that I didn't especially want him to know because I know how threatened/insecure he can get about stuff like that. I didn't actively hide anything though. Now he is pissed at me for keeping that from him, and he is mad that I never told him that I have a preference for women (I don't even know if I do myself). I feel like all of these things are private matters I shouldn't have to spell out to someone, and I told him as much. He says that it changes the nature of our relationship and I just don't get that, nothing has changed. So, am I an asshole for not laying all my cards on the table when we were in the early stages of our relationship?",155,58,0.8

My friend in high school was killed by a drunk driver and it had a deep impact on me afterwards. I have stopped being friends with people if I knew they had driven home from a party or bar drunk in the past. 

When I talked to him about it he became very defensive and angry, rightfully so, telling me that I shouldn’t date anyone who drinks then and that people change and shouldn’t be judged by their pasts.

1661,Not the A-hole,"So our parents are away for the weekend and my sister decided to invite some coworkers of her to come over.  

Now she asked me if I could go to a friends place for the night so i wouldn’t be home. 

now this is on a Saturday and every Saturday i work at a retail shop and am very tired when I get home. I just wanna stay home a play some games all night long. 

I didn’t want to leave the house so she got mad, she asked me if i could stay inside my room all night and I said I wanted to go downstair for drinks or food now and then.

Then she almost freaked out sayin her co workers are like weird and say stuff they wanna say. Honestly it was very vague.

Then it hit me, I think my sister is embarrassed of me. She never likes it when I’m around her when she’s with friends. Shes always toxic and asking me if i didn’t wanted to leave. 

She really doesn’t want me around while friends are over. Or when I ask for her phone to show her something, she freaks out like she want to hide something from me. 

I don’t get it, I’m just myself. I don’t want to embarrass my sister (even tho I don’t think I’m doing anything weird). 

So AITA here? Should I give her the house or stay inside my room all night?

1662,Not the A-hole,"I live in a house share with a few other people for university. We get on really well and have for the last couple of years bar the expected argument about washing up and taking out the garbages. 

One of my flatmates, we’ll call her Jill, recently got a boyfriend. We’re all supportive as friends even though we’ve truly never hit it off with her partner (he’s very standoffish with us and always appears to look down on us, her flatmates). 

The big problem started very slowly and sneakily. We’d all be in the house for the evening and they’d come back from a date or night out and he’d stay over at our house. No problem! That happens. 

Then it started to become a repeating theme, he’d be in our house. The other flatmates were aware it but it didn’t really cause much harm. 

Until it did. He started to be here constantly, even though he has his own house. Every single night. Sometimes, I’d enter into my own house from work thinking it was empty and he’d be there already alone. He orders parcels to our house instead of his own (which isn’t annoying, just really odd). Uses our gas, electricity, toilet paper, tooth paste. He also has a habit of being so unbelievably loud early in the morning and waking us all up. 

They’re completely menial problems but I think the thing that annoys me the most is he never says sorry, never asks and she never asks if he can be there. In my house. Ever. She’s aware we’ve never had a good relationship with him as well, so it’s all very bizarre to me. 

We’ve tried to bring it up to her as a collective that we don’t agree with it but she would start asking us for a few days and then forget to do it. 
She gets very defensive about it and claims he isn’t here all the time, when we know he is.

1663,Not the A-hole,"Bit of a back story. My partner and I (both female) just moved in together and already have a pretty similar sense of style (skinny pants and hoodies/t shirt), she has about triple the amount of clothes that I do, plenty of options. 

So when we first moved in together we were getting ready to leave for sports, I put on a shirt and leggings, leave the room and about 2 mins later she walks out wearing the same thing, same colours for both top and bottoms. We laugh it off, take a funny snap and go on our way. 

It then happens 2 or 3 more times, it starts to bug me. I’m okay having a similar style, but I don’t want to look the exact same every time we leave the house. I speak with her about it, she doesn’t seem to have an issue but I let her know it bugs me (and usually end up changing). 

This morning, I had just bought a new top. A colour new to me, which she has 2 tops in. Out of her 40 other options. I get dressed and jokingly say “this is what I’m wearing, hope you don’t accidentally put on the same thing!” Laugh, and leave the room. I’m getting things done in the kitchen, we’re running late and need to leave ASAP to get to work. I turn around, she has on the EXACT same thing. Jeans and the coloured top. 

AITA for getting upset and having a silent ride to work?

Edit: I’ve spoken to her in the past and she is well aware of how much it bugs me. I had explained to her that I wanted to have my own style and don’t like looking too similar to someone else I’m hanging/going to be seen with, even with my friends.

So anyways, it’s kind of rainy and they’re on my porch, which I already find irritating as many of their parents wait in their cars until the bus is there anyways so they should already be told to stay away from my property but I digress...

The real problem is that I have a nest of house finches on my porch that I have been very careful not to disturb. The parents have already lost one baby and I don’t want these little birdies to get hurt or abandoned as they’re very sensitive and about to leave nest

1671,Everyone Sucks,"Okay, so I just coined ""Bagel Bandit"" 5 minutes ago and this may not be on anyone else's radar in my office, but here's some background - 

&#x200B;

Every Thursday is ""Bagel Thursday"" where the company I work for buys everyone bagels and cream cheese. I am guessing they get around 4 dozen bagels for 40 people. Not everyone eats one, some people eat two, whatever - there are usually at least a dozen left over. Early afternoon these bagels get wrapped up and get kept in the kitchen, where any communal food is kept. In the last couple of months I have realized that come Friday morning, there are only like one or two bagels left (usually cinnamon raisin or blueberry). There are only a few people who leave a bit later than most, and given the backstory on this one guy, I KNOW it's him. Here's my evidence: 

&#x200B;

1.) During a company BBQ last summer, management brought in left over BBQ fixings. They sent an email saying that people could take some of these fixings home with them if they'd like. I kid you the fuck not this man takes every condiment, numerous packages of hot dogs, and all the hot dog buns (he could have fed maybe 15 people, and only has a wife and no kids). He took everything. 

2.) Not so incriminating but a few weeks ago someone brought in maybe 20 chocolate chip cookies - the good custom bakery kind with the perfect chocolate chip ratio. I go in the kitchen to get some water, and I see this guy walking out with at least FIVE (0% chance he took them to share). 

3.) He worked remotely for 2 weeks, and in those two weeks I took inventory of the bagels Thursday night and Friday morning. There was not a single bagel missing. He comes back this week, I look in the kitchen this morning (I'm the first one in the office) and there is a single blueberry bagel left. Got you. 

&#x200B;

This isn't ruining my life - I just think it's kind of rude and I really want to say something. I would never call him out maliciously, and I would try to do so in a kidding manner where maybe it plants a seed like ""wow I'm a fucking glutton"". Also, there is no power issue here. We hold different positions, but are on a relatively similar playing field status wise.

1672,Asshole,"My gf(24) is a bit naive/shallow, she started to follow a 'guru' on Instagram and she seemed to act according to what he suggested (even giving answers to her questions). The majority of her questions were about our relationship, and he always answered to her, and however only to somewhat attractive girls. My gf and I are of different backgrounds (she's from an immigrant family), so this guy always said to her ""better to stay with someone similar to you"" ""think of your family"" etc. For a time he seemed to make post specifically about her and she always commented asking for more suggestions. I think this guy was trying to hit on her. I made another account, posing as a girl, easily managed to get 150 followers, started to follow her and posted quotes in my favor. Like ""don't trust people suggesting you to break with your man"" and so. She unfollowed him, now I make a post a day that happen to support what I do. Like ""better to stay with him for an hour than make things boring"" if she was upset I've been too much time with my friends, or ""true love is when he doesn't want to let you alone, even for a second"" when I think another man wants to know her and I take her with me even to buy an ice-cream at the park.

1673,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

(U1+2 = Uncles)

When my parents divorced I (5) moved in with grandparents. I would visit parents until I came home from seeing my dad with a mark across my face; my grandad told both my parents that he would be raising me from that point onwards. When is was 19 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I became his carer whilst U1/2 rarely visited.

In November he was admitted to hospital.  I spent from 6 to 11 with him every day. During his hospital stay U1 would show up once a week, and spend the time FaceTiming his girlfriend. U2 would visit fortnightly for 10 minutes.

On Christmas Eve he took a turn for the worse and I rang all members of the family to let them know. Christmas morning was full of family member he hadn’t seen regularly or at all in years. I skipped the offers of Christmas dinner and stayed with him until he passed.

U1 and U2 were keen to be involved with legal aspects. It was decided that I would pay everything and U1 and U2 would refund me when it was totalled up (they had the most disposable income/savings and it would be returned from the estate). So I paid funeral costs, outstanding balances for bills/credit cards etc which wiped all my savings and some essential money. In total this was close to £28K. U1 and U2 had been going to the house daily and thrown away all his belongings unless they deemed them valuable in which case they sold/kept them. U1 and U2 have also removed the kitchen, carpets and most of the bathroom saying they would pay for the place to be redecorated.

At this point we went to his solicitors to make sure we hadn’t missed anything. Surprise to everyone my grandad had made a new will a year prior to being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s with myself as the sole beneficiary, and a note with his reasoning being that all of his children are middle aged, own their own homes and have adult children.

Once finding out that they don’t benefit from the will they have left the house in a complete state of disrepair, refused to refund me any money unless I agree to completely disclaim the will and any inheritance, and use the older will with his five children being the beneficiaries. 

This has left me in the position of not being able to pay my rent and living off rice. The house is unsellable and I have no funds to repair it, and further solicitors bills to pay. I don’t care abut the money I’ll get at the end of it. I’m more upset with how they’ve handled it and that they stripped myself and others of retaining any sentimental objects.

AITA for continuing with my grandads wishes despite  causing a large rift in my family? 

TL;DR Raised by my grandfather who passed away and in a surprise turn of events he changed his will and left everything to me.

I then decided, with upcoming coursework and exams, I would not be attending as one of her bridesmaids.

I had a very civil conversation with my dad, and he understood my reasonings, and assured me it was a very mature decision for me to make.

She started ignoring me, basically dismissing my attendance in a room. I started paying rent for food, and she'd cook me dinner, but that was it.

About a year into this,I had got home from university, she slammed the bathroom door closed, and shouted something like ""ugh what disgusting humans"". A few minutes later, she posted on Facebook ""I have to live with some of the most disgusting people ever.. I wish it was just me and my husband"" I LOST THE PLOT. I packed a bag, called my aunt and asked if I could come stay for a couple days. I text my dad, told him what she had said on Facebook, and I concluded it must have been about me because I was the only one home with her at this point.

He asked me to come home, I said I was going to stay here until Sunday night,, but he best be assured I was livid at this point and didn't want to see her smug face. He spoke to her this weekend, and said it wasn't about me, it was about a colleague at work, and she is sorry. I didn't for a second believe this at all, because why would she apologize to me for something that supposedly wasn't about me in the first place. He then asked if we'd agree to a sit down and chat to sort things out, I said no and went about my life again.

My boss asked why we didn't talk (she was a friend too)and convinced me to extend an olive branch, a truce essentially, and so I did. Her birthday was coming up, so I decided to buy her a present. I got her a card, a present I KNEW she would like, and set about my plan. I walked up to her while she was on her desk, I said the words ""Happy Birthday, I have a present for you"" and the ignorant being she is, did NOT even turn around to take the present from me, she simply said ""Just leave it there"" and kept working. I was MAD. I dropped the present on that table and to this day I refuse to make an effort with her anymore. She out right ignored my attempt at a truce and I concluded she must be the person with a stick up her arse. I was 20 at this point, I was an adult, but this woman was 35, being so ignorant to her step-daughter. I was mature enough to make an effort and she threw it in my face.

I worked hard and made smart financial decisions so I’m now a wealthy guy. Due to this, I’ve had plenty of so called “friends or family” approach my family with ulterior motives. 

The most recent case of this is my son’s current girlfriend. They are both 17. Now, this girl is clearly with him for our family’s resources but unfortunately my son, viewing her in rose colored glasses just doesn’t see it. I’ve met her family, they are an absolute disgrace and all of them are lazy deadbeats. Their parents already tried to siphon money off me several times claiming we are “family”.

This girl is an embarrassment to our family and my son deserves better. She’s already a bad influence on him, he used to be a stellar student but recently his performance has been slipping. She has repeatedly manipulated him into buying expensive things for her and her family. 

If he’s really interested in dating, I’m more than willing to set him up with one of the daughters of my acquaintances. These are ambitious, talented and well mannered girls that are much more suitable for him. I’ve suggested this to him and he got angry at me. 

I’ve honestly had enough, he’s being manipulated and I’m sick of it. So I proposed that I’ll cut him off when he’s 18. I told him to go ahead and tell his girlfriend that he’ll be penniless when he’s 18, let’s see how much she truly “loves” him then.

1678,Not the A-hole,"For a friend's birthday I got him a budget record player from Amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. He is pretty into music so I thought it would be a cool gift. Plus I'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.

After I gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. Here enters Pretentious Music Snob (PMS), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.

PMS: (asking me) How much did you get it for?

Me: 60 dollars.

PMS: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. It's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.

I thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.

My friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. 

PMS: The speakers sound pretty crap.

Friend: I think it sounds fine.

PMS: You know what you can do? You should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. Here's the setup I have at home. (Pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) The one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.

At this point I was pretty annoyed. He might be right, but I think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when I was right next to him. So I decided to call him out.

Me: Hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (Yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)

The room became silent and it got pretty awkward. I know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling PMS out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but I reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.

So AITA?

Edit: I posted this before going to bed (I live in Australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but Holy Crap this blew up. Here's some additional info:

When birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. So when PMS was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. 

To be honest I'm not a confrontational person and I wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. I said what I said to A) shut him up, I wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes B) Yes I said it in a way that embarrassed him. I'm not a saint, I didn't take the high road, but I sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. 

When I said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. I've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since PMS was also annoying him.

So, I’ve have 2 family members die in the past couple of years, the first time I didn’t want to attend the funeral because to me, death is a natural thing and it happens, I don’t see any point in wanting to “see them off” or anything like that, when the person died I didn’t really feel sad, I just kind of accepted it because that’s what I do, accept and move on, I told my parents I didn’t want to attend the funeral but they made me anyway, small argument and a few weeks later I’m dressed in black and surrounded by strangers (other family I don’t know) no massive scene was made but I certainly wasn’t happy to be there. 

fast forward a few years and another family member has died (they were both major family members in my life, not just some randoms like distant cousins) but I again expressed no interest in wanting to go to the funeral or the likes, again fast forward a few weeks later back in Black and surrounded by a few familiar faces but mostly strangers, again I still feel nothing.

I don’t want it to sound like I don’t care about people or don’t respect the dead, I don’t dance on people’s graves or that shit, I just don’t see a point in a funeral **personally** am I really an asshole or does no one respect my opinion or “beliefs”",123,156,0.86
1680,No A-holes here,"My husband (35) put on a bit of weight over the last few years, he's not unhealthy or anything, just normal middle age I guess. He's quite self concious about it though, and says he wants to join the gym a lot. I (31F) usually try and be supportive, tell him it's not a big deal but recently he's been complaining about it a lot which is getting annoying.

His brother is getting married so he's been trying on new suits and he just complains the whole time how they don't look good. I got a bit fed up with him last week during one of these exchanges and said, ""weren't you going to join the gym?"" which really upset him. He got angry and said I was being shallow and that I want a younger man, but I felt that was harsh when he says it himself all the time. I told him he should loose weight if he doesn't like his body, but he said I shouldn't have said that, and that I wasn't being supportive.

I don't know what to do. There's only so many times I can say, ""it's fine, don't worry about it"". I've just got the place where I want him to deal with it or stop complaining. I wont lie, I would like it if he was more in shape, but I've never said that to him and I won't say it. I'm happy the way he is, but his insecurity is stressing me out.

He has many “mothers” in his family, including 2 sisters, and his own mom, and his brothers wives, totaling 7 people. Every year I put my heart and soul into these gifts thinking one by one of each of their likes and interests. 

I get passive comments each year from at least two of them. I have had them tell me things like “I don’t like these color roses” or “that’s pretty but I’m not your mom”, and those comments hurt. Most of them acknowledge and say thank you and that’s that. 

This year my boyfriend brought it up again, and said “Babe we have a lot of ‘mothers’ this year” and I told him I wasn’t really willing to go out and spend money if they weren’t appreciative of it, and that I only got a gift for HIS mom. He was understanding and ok with my reply. I feel kinda bad because usually I do something but this year I’m not. AITA if I don’t show up with anything for them and just for his mom?

1682,Not the A-hole,"I work in a small firm with not too many people so everyone pretty much knows everyone. On Monday, we had a new co worker come in we'll call her ""Em"". She was mostly alright but when it comes to talking whether to someone or on the phone, she has a habit of talking extremely loudly to the point most of us could hear her conversations (guess it's pretty much shouting). Yesterday a group of us invited her for lunch, kind of like to break the ice. As soon as we left the office to get into the lift she starts talking very loudly on how ""awkward"" I looked and continues to go on about how skinny I was ""like a lizard"" in her exact wording (I have a problem where it isn't easy for me to gain weight or build muscle no matter how much I eat or exercise) I brushed it off as I'm not one who really likes to get into conflict especially with someone that was new around the workplace and just chuckled but it did offend me quite a bit and I SPECIFICALLY told her that it was an uncomfortable subject for me and please to not bring it up again. During lunch, she started making comments such as how weak I looked and how she could probably take me on, disregarding whatever I just told her previously, I just continued to hold a smile without really saying anything. When we arrived back at the office building, the elevator area was pretty much crowded with people. So we opted to take the stairs instead since our office floor was only on the second floor. Em says that she was just going to wait for the lift. To which I responded without thinking and out of sheer impulse ""what's the matter, too unfit?"". (She was a pretty hefty person) and this sent her in tears as she just stormed out of the building. The co workers I was with were absolutely furious on what I've said to her and now none of them want to have anything to do with me. I tried to explain that she was to one who insulted me but they believed she just did it for ""fun"".

I understand what I did was extremely rude and was way over the line but a part of me felt like I was justified. So, AITA?",37,84,0.95

1684,Not the A-hole,"growing up, my cousins were always much more involved with my grandparents, while my family was kind of shafted. it was always noticeable and bothered me, but i never mentioned it because I didn't think it was worth the trouble. i was the odd one out for both grandparents,and it showed in how I was treated.

The favouritism was most obvious as we got older. for late high school/going into college, my cousins received thousands of dollars for prom+grad and expensive new laptops. I got $300 total for grad/prom to their $1500-2000for each event. My fam kept hyping up was the laptop I would get, like my cousins had.

I didn't get one, and not wanting to come off as ungrateful, I never pressed it, and it wasn't brought up again until recently. my siblings got similar amounts for grad/prom, no laptops.
now, years later, my aunt learned that we never got laptops, to which she kicked up a fuss. She started to make my grandpa feel guilty for it, despite the fact that NONE of us asked her to do this. my aunt wanted him to buy us all laptops despite the fact that we all have laptops from elsewhere now, and hassled him about it,which he sorta agreed to.

my siblings and I are like 'we're good actually?', but our aunt pressed it until gpa phoned my siblings and apologized to them for 'withholding' their gift, but knowing that they already have laptops, offered them each $1000+. My siblings took the money then ask me, ""yo, did you get a call from gpa?"" I go, ""no, did you?"" I then learned they were getting $1000+, said I hadn't gotten a call, and went on w/ life.

now my siblings can't let it go. They say I should call him about it + won't take no for an answer. They proceed to guilt trip my gpa again, this time making it sound like I'm begging for the money when I'm not. They say that my grandpa is reluctant, it's like, yeah, you keep prodding the fact that he purposely ignored and excluded a grandchild out of a gift he gave to all his other grandchildren.

So days pass, and my gpa phoned me, saying that he'll give me $200 so that I can buy a used desktop, and that I don't need $1000+ because I'm already through most schooling. This the first time that my grandpa and I have spoken directly in a while, I say 'uh, let me call you back'.

This brings us to now: I told my siblings I don't want the money. They think I'm being a dumbass for passing money up + an asshole because my grandpa 'went through a lot' to call me, and that I should accept it. I don't want to accept because I just don't want the pity/guilt aspect of it. My gpa only did this, offering me this money after putting it off for years, with the intent of never doing so at all, because he has been hassled into it. And even then, he left me out from my siblings,and then upon even more unwanted intervention, finally begrudgingly contacted me about it. I don't want it knowing my gpa just doesn't care.

I feel like I will stand my ground and not take it. So AITA for rejecting my grandpa's gift?",15,41,0.98

When the incident occurred I did not really know what to do so I went on to [r/askgaybros](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros) for advice. Here's my original post and how I had felt at the time.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/agvrdh/gay\_friend\_made\_a\_move\_on\_me\_and\_i\_really\_dont/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/agvrdh/gay_friend_made_a_move_on_me_and_i_really_dont/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

&#x200B;

The TL;DR of that is we were hanging out in his car. He grabbed my junk firmly, I told him ""no,"" he apologized, and I accepted it because he was going through a long term break up and stuff. Less than 5 minutes later he tried again and then apologized once more saying it won't happen again. Right there and then I didn't realize how much it affected me until later, which is when I reached out to Reddit. My original plan was to met with him in public to discuss what had happened, but that never occurred. We don't talk anymore and avoid each other at work. 

&#x200B;

Currently I am up for a small promotion at work as my hours are increasing. My coworker is already in this position and it was known that we were friends. My regional director suggested that I shadow my coworker so I may better understand what responsibilities the promotion entails. For the first time ever at work I said ""no."" I paused and then said ""I respectfully decline working with him. We don't speak anymore due to a personal issue."" My director acknowledged my stance and then didn't bring it up again.

&#x200B;

Thing is, if my director were to ask or inquire how big of an issue, I think I would outright say it. I believe in transparency and I am not going to lie either. I know if I say it then HR would be involved and my coworker may end up being fired. And honestly, I kinda don't care. The main reason why I haven't said anything is that I don't want to muddy up my own career or deal with any legal gymnastics. I was fine with leaving things as they were as our responsibilities don't overlap any longer. I am fine with many things, but I will not work with him again.

1687,Not the A-hole,"Quick preface: I am in the military stationed overseas in S. Korea. I am a single service member in the USAF. Basically that means I have no family here. Today my mom textes me asking how many people I worked with and how many people werw in my respective unit. She said another person was asking about it. 

I knew right off the bat that this was leading to another care package. I told her that we really didn't need anything seeing as how the Base Exchange provides everything we need. It's not that bad over here really. Pretty normal work days and on weekends, we basically consume copious amounts of silly juice. 

She argued back that people just want to show that they are thinking of us and wanted to write anon letters to people at my work thanking them for their service and whatnot. These care packages are great for deployments, when supplies are restricted, but we are stationed here. So we really just do our work and don't really do anything except train and be ready in case Kimmy J. decides to get frosty. 

I went on to tell her that these packages normally don't get used or they just kinda get tossed. Idk. Maybe ITA for not caring if people think of me back at home. What do you guys think?

TL;DR: I told my mom to not send me a care package because we don't really pay attention to that shit.",78,255,0.97
1688,Not the A-hole,"Tl;dr my sister is 17, has a 19 yr old BF, is still in HS & acts like shes grown. Dad works out of town so she lives with me so I can keep an eye on her. She hates stepmom so she won't live with her.

Heres the more detailed parts: my parents divorced after I was 18, but my younger siblings were still minors. My sister had the hardest time accepting it, & still has a hard time dealing.

She got into some trouble with friends around May of 2018 (broke into the high school of our hometown) & my Dad gave her 2 options: stay with my mom, but lose her car, or come live with me, keep the car, & help me with my kiddos. (single parent) She, of course, chose to live with me (she couldn't lose her precious car)

She gets here in August, & everything is going swimmingly. After about 6 months, she stops going to school on time, she stops helping me around the house, & is doing the bare minimum on helping me with my kids. Mind you, this is all stuff she agreed to when she came. She would go to school, help me out, & be responsible. She's not anymore.

So, my Dad calls me today & asks where she is. I can't lie to him. He's my Dad. He asks me if BF is her guardian or if I am. I tell him I am, & he says then why isn't she home. It's a school night. She needs to be home at 9. (I truly thought it was 11) I say, ok, I'll call her. He informed me he already did, & he was giving her 20 minutes to be home, & if she wasn't, call him to tell him.

I guess feel like the asshole because I told my Dad she wasn't home when I could have easily lied, but I couldn't. I've never been able to lie to him.

1691,Asshole,"So I have substance abuse problems. Over 20 years ago it was bad but I quit. Now its turned into an escapism issue. Books, video games, work, whatever. If I can lose myself in it I will. I've learned to channel it, mostly towards work, but my weakness has been marijuana. I try to stay away but living in a recreational state it can be hard. Especially since my wife smokes all day every day. She has chronic pain and other issues it helps with. She has had a medical card since they were available and her use has been greatly supported by all of her doctors. She has never taken pain meds, hates them, and her pain is for the most part managed.

I have a strong family history of schizophrenia. Uncle, dad, and sister all had full blown psychosis. Each one of them were initially triggered by drug abuse. I'm positive I have some of it. I'm not quite on the hallucinating level but I do have to keep strict control over my thoughts. If you're not aware marijuana is the one of the worst drugs you can take with schizophrenia. It takes a deluded mind to whole new levels.

Last year I went through some shit, it was bad. Afterwards I lost myself in marijuana and depression for the first time in a while. We barely left the room for about 6 months. We were smoking over 1/8th a day. About a month ago I started feeling myself cracking. I was coming up with things I know weren't me and they were sticking. I tried talking to my wife about it but we just kept on toking. When things started getting really bad I broke and started taking steps to get control of myself again. I reached out to my therapist and scheduled a meeting. I opened up to the family, told them what I was going through. I know marijuana is very bad for me and I asked them to help me quit and stay quit. Everyone was on board. We cleaned out everything, I went through my withdraws (weed isnt too bad but it still sucks), and have just been trying really hard to get back on track. This was all about a week ago.

Yesterday we got into a fight and she took off and said she was going to get some weed. I left to get some food and didnt come back for a while. When I got back she was asleep and the whole house reeked of weed. I looked on her side of the bed and found a pack of prerolls. I immediately grabbed one and lit it up. Within a few hits I was gone. That whole other level I mentioned? I was past that. It was a new level for me. I psycho'd out for a few hours then finally went to sleep.

Today i told her it was messed up she'd bring flower into the house after our talk and me opening up. She replies with that whole thing is my issue and she shouldn't have to go without. The whole time we were having this conversation she was smoking the last preroll right in front of me. I called her out on that and she basically said to get over it and finished it completely. I told her she has a problem and she replied shes fine, I'm the one with the problem. 

So I know everything is messed up pretty good but AITA?",93,79,0.88
1692,Not the A-hole,"So I’m going to try to keep it somewhat light here. Basically I work in a preschool and there is one teacher in particular I have issues with. She’s a very difficult person to work with (lazy, manipulative, mean to some of the women) and really try to avoid her at all costs because she makes me uncomfortable. 

Well this morning it was just the two of us in the classroom with some of her kids and she pulls out a dab pen (THC). She asks “Do you know where I can get more of these” and proceeds to talk to me about it while still holding her dab pen, with all these kids in the classroom.  I ended the conversation and went back to the children, thinking about what I was going to do about this. I live in a legal state and am a smoker myself on my personal time but the fact she had it in the classroom didn’t settle right with me.

Later today during nap time she comes into my classroom and says she has something for me. She hands me a plastic cup and inside were three marijuana gummies. I was in such disbelief she gave these to me out of the blue that I wasn’t even listening to what she was saying and she left soon after. The two kids I was sitting with asks “What’s in your cup Mr.______?”

This was the breaking point for me and went and reported it to my director. Now DSS and Corporate are getting involved and she’s  most likely going to be fired and possibly legal action taken against her. 

I’m sitting here after the fact feeling horrible about the whole thing. This woman has a house and kids and I just ruined her life after she was (what I believe anyways) just trying to be friendly. I was so uncomfortable about the whole thing so I just went along with her but I wish I said something so this could have been avoided. 

I told a few of my close friends about the situation and they basically said I was being a rat and a snitch. I just wouldn’t be able to look at myself if a child somehow got a hold of it and ate it.

So guys,  do you think I’m the asshole here or was it the right call?

Edit: I understand what she did was wrong but should I have approached the issue in a different way?

Update: I want to thank everybody for their input. It really made me feel a lot better. Corporate came today and questioned me and get my side of the story. I might possibly get written up for not reporting the situation immediately but I’d honestly rather that than a kid seizing because they find a gummy.

He mostly keeps to himself. Rarely even gets up from his desk. I have caught him staring at me. Other women have said similar things.

As I was going by his desk I saw reddit open, I leaned in and saw that he was on some incel subreddit. Looking at him, I wasn't surprised. I reported him to HR immediately and told all my female coworkers about this.

HR informed my boss about this and she was distraught too. During lunch break I confronted him about this and he was very defensive and said he knew nothing about this but the way he was stuttering and very nervous while talking.

1698,Not the A-hole,"A little background info; My birthmother was 17 and unmarried when she got pregnant with me, so I was adopted at birth. Met my bio family when I was 6. Ever since then, I've visited them every few months and they like to know how life is going for me. They have been trying to control me as the years have gone by, and a few years ago I was ready to cut ties because of their overbearing nature and criticising my adoptive parents. I didnt want the drama though, so I kept going on keeping contact with them. Birthmom and grandparents are SUPER religious, and while I consider myself a Christian, I disagree with a lot of their values and behaviors. To them, being ""unequally yoked"" is the worst thing I could do. 

I'd been back in my hometown receiving intensive treatment for my depression, and birthmom and grandma really wanted to pay me a visit in person since it had been a while. I had been dating my first (and current~) love for a few months now and felt ready to share the news with them.

Cue visit. I begin to tell them about my man. He's a total gentleman, he's smart, patient, and has helped me mentally and physically more than I could ever describe. They don't look impressed.

Grandma slides me the question I knew was coming.

""So... where is he at spiritually?""

While none of their business, I was honest with them. ""He's agnostic. We talk about it sometimes, he listens to my views and opinions and I listen to his. He's said he's open to learning more about my faith but he just has his doubts.""

As I'm talking, I can see my birthmom tearing up. She said ""Thats just a lie. You know he just wants to get.. physical with you, right? I've run into so many men saying they would change for me and they all just lied."" 

The next two hours were spent with me insisting he is an amazing person and that his lack of faith didn't affect his character and them saying that he's just temporary, a test of faith from God, and that Satan is trying to pull me off track.

I've finally had enough. I know they went through so much heartache to let me go and how blessed she feels to be in my life, but it's affecting my happiness. I've decided that if they aren't going to respect me or the person I love, they won't be in my life until they do. I haven't spoken to them since that visit in late February. 

I don't know if I'm being unreasonable... they're family and cutting them out feels like a huge move, but like the only move I can make to feel free. My adoptive parents support my decision, and are livid that my birthfamily is treating me this way... but I just don't know.

TL;DR - My biological mother was lucky to be a part of my life but her extreme religious views stifle me. She broke down in tears when I said with an agnostic man, and mixed with her past behavior, I don't want anything to do with birthfamily, but I don't know if I'm being unreasonable.

1702,Not the A-hole,"I’m not even sure how to make this make sense but here goes. My husband and I have 3 daughters, the youngest of which is 14.  We are/ have always been a pretty close, laid back family.  We aren’t religious but have always encouraged the girls to form their own beliefs.   My youngest daughter, Rose, has always been a little different than the rest of us personality wise. She’s extroverted, we’re introverted. She’s in the popular group, not as academic, but very talented musically. I’ve always encouraged her pursuits and supported her and she is very loved but I can tell sometimes that she feels different.  

So these past few months she’s been spending more and more time at her friend Autumn’s house. Basically nowadays she wants to go over there on Friday afternoons and stay until Sunday. She’s been going with them to church. I don’t LOVE that but have been cool about it because I want her to feel free to explore her own beliefs.  And I also don’t love that she’s been spending so much time away from home. I’ve allowed it out of a sense of guilt because her father and I both have to work most weekends. And I work overnights so we can’t really do many fun family activities on the weekend.   My problem is that lately I’ve been getting a bad vibe from the whole situation. I’ve seen texts on her phone with Autumn’s mom. She is constantly telling her how much she loves her and is now a total part of their family. She seems to feel some sort of ownership over Rose’s weekends and even tried to get her to spend all of Easter weekend with them. I put my foot down about that because we had plans already and I just feel like holidays are a time for family. Now Rose is invited to their house for Mother’s Day weekend which is also going to be a no because I’m off work and it’s MOTHERS day. They want her to go on vacation with them this summer for a month. That’s gonna be another no. I just feel like it’s inappropriate. But Rose loves it over there and doesn’t ever want to be home anymore.   Basically I just have this crazy feeling that this mother is trying to adopt my daughter out from under me. They’re evangelical Christians and I feel like maybe they’re trying to “save” her from us? I don’t know if I’m crazy or paranoid. I want to put a stop to this. I want to stop letting her go over there at all. I’ve let it go on this long because I feel so guilty that I can’t give her whatever it is that they can. I have to work long hours, I don’t have a choice, and she’s a stay at home mom. They’re pretty well off and we’re middle class through and through.  But Rose hasn’t done anything wrong and she’s going to see this as a punishment. I already feel like I’m losing her and I’m worried that if I make her cut off contact I will push her even further away. I guess I’m a shit mother through and through either way but AITA if I go with my gut and stop her relationship with this other family?

EDIT: A little bit more info, some commenters have told me this should have been in the original post.  Recently (very recently) she’s begun parroting  more conservative Christian ideas that I know come from them. She’s thrilled about this new abortion ban that’s been passed in our state. She  said a  mildly derogatory thing about  Muslims. She doesn’t seem obsessed with any of these ideas, but occasionally mentions them offhandedly. When I try to engage her in discussion, she shuts me down.  She seems very concerned that her father and I are going to Hell. And that honestly breaks my heart because I know that has to be a terrifying concept for her.  A lot of these ideas are very common for our area but NOT in our family.  This is the main reason I feel like they’re trying to “save” her. It may not be them, but the people at the church they’re taking her to. I feel like I’m fighting her on multiple fronts here and no matter what, I’m just losing her.

EDIT 2: Guys this post is getting way more attention than I thought it would and it’s getting harder to respond to comments so I’ll do my best here. First, I really appreciate all the perspective I’m getting. It’s awesome to read all the nice comments from the people who agree with me but I also appreciate the ones who are calling me out. After spending all night on reddit and taking some really hard looks at the situation, I think I’m the asshole in a lot of ways. Bottom line is that this entire situation developed out of my own inadequacies as a mother. I’ve let my daughter down in so many ways and she has sought elsewhere for what she needs from me and found it in strangers. I think what was bothering me more than anything is that this other girls mom is clearly under the impression that she needs to pick up my slack as a parent. That fucking hurts and it’s my fault. And I do think she has way overstepped bounds but I’m the one who has allowed it to happen. And I don’t share her religious beliefs and I DO think she’s trying to indoctrinate my kid (not necessarily with evil intent but still) - but again I’m the one who has allowed it to happen. 

The game plan going forward is #1 I’m going try to take every other weekend off from work and establish more family time #2 not cutting her off completely from her friend but establishing more incentive to be invested with her own family (ie activities, one on one time, etc) #3 really just taking the time to listen to her and what she’s trying to tell me and #4 an honest conversation with the other mom and we’ll just have to see how that goes before I can judge how much time she should be spending over there.

1703,Not the A-hole,"This just happened, I still don’t really know what to do. 

So for context, I requested off today at work about a week ago and me and my gf we’re going to spend the whole day with each other and she was going to spend the night. I was very pumped, she even got her shift covered at work for it. 

When I woke up she told me she was at her friends house and asked if we could meet up a little later, sure why not, I had errands to run and a morning class anyway. Then later in the morning she says “we’re going in a double date with (her friend) but we aren’t sure what we’re doing yet. That kind of put me on edge considering 1.) I wasn’t really feeling it and told her that but she basically forced me to anyways because she never really asked if I wanted to, and 2.) this was supposed to be our day together, we had fun exciting things planned.  

I don’t even know her friends boyfriend and I felt awful and was in a really bad mood already so I really did not want to go. But they later decided we would just go to the movies so I thought it can’t be that bad and I’m sure she really wanted me to go, so I did. 

On my way there she texted me saying “do you want to go into the abandoned hospital by the park with us?”
And I of course said no, I was already in a terrible mood and I do NOT mess around with spooky shit. 

So when we get there, we decide to walk around the park for a while because we still had an hour for the movie to start. She was acting really strange like she had some to drink and it was really embarrassing and immature, it was NOT helping the mood I was in. They start walking closer and closer to the abandoned hospital and it’s clear that they were going to go in. 

“I’m not going in there if that’s what the plan was” 

My gf to her friend: “aw he figured it out”

So I turned the fuck around and got in my car and left. She tried stopping me multiple times but I said sorry I don’t feel good and left. I’m not very good at handling my emotions and I was so full of anger and distrust I didn’t know what to do. So I decided it’d just be my best bet to leave. We called each-other later and I explained why I left and she didn’t have anything to say about it except a mediocre apology and texted me saying I made her feel like shit.

1705,Not the A-hole,"Long time reader, never posted here before. Sorry if its all over the place! 

Backstory: I'm a manager in a restaurant & bar. I'm one of the youngest members of staff, and the only female manager on the premises. All the other managers are men aging 26-39. I became a manager after working in the restaurant for roughly a year, and have been a manager since September.

We have a fairly new chef who we'll call Pete. He's been working with us for over approximately two months now and is usually on our starters section. Mid week when I work, he always demands that I expedite his pass because according to him, we don't send the food quick enough. On the weekend when the other managers are on, he seems to be able to run his own pass fine.

After work, our staff are entitled to stay for a drink if they get the all clear from a manager. They always have to pay for their own drinks, except for a Saturday/Sunday when we've been extraordinarily busy and we usually allow them one beer on the house.

None of our chefs stay for a drink after work. Pete however picked up the habit of always staying for drinks midweek when I'm the only manager on duty. He doesn't pay for these drinks. He doesn't ask for permission.

I told my bar staff last week that next time he asks for a drink, make sure he has gotten the all clear from a manager. Yesterday, we had a tough day and when the kitchen closed he came out and tried to order a drink. My bartender asked if he had permission and just to run it by me first as she had 'gotten in trouble' in the past. (She had never gotten in trouble over it).

Pete seemed to flip the lid. He walked into the kitchen to find the other manager on duty (who would be his friend) and when he couldn't find him, he stormed out of the bar. I have absolutely nothing against the guy, and had he have asked me I definitely would have said yes.

Tonight, I got an email from the general manager to say that Pete text the head chef to say he wouldn't be back and he isn't serving his notice out.


AITA for requesting he ask me permission to have a drink after work? Which, I presume, then snowballed to him leaving?",25,54,0.92
1706,Not the A-hole,"So, a bit of back story, to understand how we’ve arrived at this point. 
4 years ago, I was planning my wedding and my mother and I found a dress that, at the time, suited my style and body. It’s beautiful, simple and off-white with polka dots. Totally my style at 27. 
A month later, my fiancé panicked and called off the wedding (for now-resolved issues/feelings). 

Months later, we’d resolved our issues, started our relationship again and we’re pleasantly (and terrifyingly) surprised to find out later that year that we were going to be having twins! Now, if you know someone who had multiples, you know it does a total job on your body. My body is not the same as it was (not that I hate my body — it was able to produce two healthy babies!). Also, I am not in the same mindset that I was then. 

Fast forward 4 years, and we’re replanning our wedding and making it all about us as a family unit. With that being said, I’ve fallen in love with blushy/pink/frothy dresses. Tulle and lace, and all around delicate feeling. The wedding is in 18 months, to allow planning around our daily lives and such with our 3 year olds. 

I told my mom that I was thinking of getting another dress that suits me better in body and mentality. Simply put, I don’t love that dress at all and hate the idea of wearing it. It’s tied, in my mind, with a failed marriage attempt (even if I’m still getting married to the same man). 
She’s upset about this idea and I’m not sure if it’s because she’s attached to that dress or has some emotion connection, or if it’s because (as she’s stated every time I mention it) she paid $1000 for that first dress. I truly don’t know which bothers her more and so I’m torn. If it’s the money aspect, as she keeps bringing up the cost, I’ll pay her back if I have to and buy my new one (as I’d already planned). 

My fiancé says I should buy one I want to wear, and then I’ll have two dresses in case my two daughters each decide they want to wear mine. He thinks it’s a great idea to get a fresh new wedding and dump what we were thinking of doing last time, and I agree. We’re different people than we were 4 years ago, and our lives are exponentially different. 

Would I be the asshole if I decided to purchase a new dress this time around?

Edit: 
I really do appreciate all of your comments and suggestions, and I do plan to approach this carefully. I’m going to find some time to have a true sit down with my mom, and in the most non-confrontational way possible, explain my feelings about the first dress and my reasoning as to why it doesn’t suit me or my taste now for the wedding itself.
That said, I’d never planned to get a new one without her there this time around as well. Other than this, my mother and I are extremely close and rarely disagree on anything. I don’t want that to change, because her feelings are extremely important to me. 

What I failed to mention in my original post was that my mother has been fighting cancer for the last three years. Granted, other than the reoccurrence that keeps appearing, she’s actually healthy. She just has regular Opdivo treatments and radiation ever 3-6 months when a new spot is found. 
This is important, because there’s a wild card that could flare up in the next month, year, or 20 years from now. It’s unpredictable and I don’t want any tension between us when the unthinkable could potentially happen at any time. 

I do plan to pay her back, and I will give her a payment timeline so that it’s finite and clear. I want her to be involved in picking the new one and I will be paying for that one alone. 
I do believe I’ll keep the first one, as the halter style would lend itself to a cute, shorter, honeymoon dress. I don’t hate it to the point that it’s trash in my eyes, but it’s just not what I want to be married in — as superficial as that may seem. Idk.",112,404,0.96
1707,Not the A-hole,"I buy a banana from a fruit cart every morning on my way to work. I’ve been going to the same cart daily for almost three years. Bananas are 25 cents. 

I didn’t have exact change today so I gave the man (not the usual guy who works there) 30 cents. He turned around and moved onto another customer afterward without giving me my change. When he turned around, I asked him if he could give me my change. He gave me a confused look, so I said, “I gave you .30, it was only .25.” He turned around, grabbed one of the dimes I’d given him, and threw it at me while yelling, “take your money and leave, lady.” He had a large cup of change on the stand- he was definitely able to give change. 

I understand that it’s only 5 cents, but it’s more the principal. I used to be a cashier and would never not give someone their change, even if it was a penny, unless they said they didn’t want it. I’m a pretty frugal person and wanted that 5 cents for my banana tomorrow- otherwise I’d have to break a $20, which is kind of a rude thing to do at a fruit stand since most thing are bought with singles or change. Maybe my reasons for wanting the change don’t matter, but was it outrageous for me to ask? He got so angry about it and literally threw it at me. I’ve just never had that happen. Do most people not ask for their change?

Edit: the same guy was there again today and yelled at a woman for putting a bruised mango back and trying to find a better one. I think he’s just a miserable guy.",165,666,0.95
1708,Asshole,"My best friend had a crush on this guy Wally for the last month and a half. She *couldn’t* stop talk about how hot and sweet he was for the longest. I (and other friends) encouraged her to ask her out for weeks, but she’s traditional and wanted him to ask her out. They’ve been talking pretty often, though.

Well there was an end-of-the-semester party last night and I ended up getting pretty fucked up. I saw Wally, and in my drunken stupor, I thought he was the sexiest man in the room. We were flirting pretty hardcore and he invited me to his apartment, and we ended up having sex.

I didn’t think too much of it; she had a whole month to ask the dude out, and ultimately, she doesn’t own people. This isn’t middle school. In any case, I decided she should probably know coming from me besides anyone else. I told her I was drunk, and slept with Wally last night, and felt like she should know.

She **BLEW UP**. She called me *horrible* names; cunt, bitch, whore. She asked how I could violate “girl-code” like that, and that I’m a piece of shit and I *knew* she liked him. I told her she had a full month and a half, and that it’s not my fault she couldn’t put on her big-girl panties on and ask him out herself. I told her she didn’t OWN people, and that it’s pretty fucked-up to try to claim “dibs” on an actual, living human-being.

Well our entire friend-group is in shambles. Half agree with me and are saying she could’ve just asked him out awhile ago. Half said it was a douche-move and that if anything, I should’ve asked for permission (as if I need permission from a grown-adult to sleep with another adult).

I’m three states away for work, and my wife texts me saying her and her mother got into an argument and ML told her that “she doesn’t do anything right, and doesn’t know how my kids survive with her”. Now this is not the first time she has said something horrible to my wife, however, my kids were there (m-10,f-8) and saw this.

Apparently, all hell broke loose, my wife calls me screaming asking what did I do, and I say, “defend you and my kids. I won’t put up with that around them”.

1715,Asshole,"I have been friends with this dude ""Ricky"" since we were in middle school. We have done every sport imaginable and went through puberty together so I've seen his penis almost as many times as I've seen my own. The dude has a gift. I'm not going to get graphic because then the S-post accusations will come out of the woodwork but it's big. But Ricky is such a nerd and so shy that I think he's been with maybe 3 girls in his life (we are 19 now) and it's possible he's never had sex. 

We were at a graduation party last night and Ricky told me that he thought a particular girl was really, really cute (she was) and I was basically like imploring him to go talk to her. He asked if I would go over with him and at first I was like dude, she's by herself it will be so freaking creepy if two dudes descend on her to hit on her so I really wanted him to go by himself. But he didn't, well maybe an hour later we noticed she was surrounded by 4 other girls so I told him now was a good time. So we went over and Ricky was his normal shy self and I was tired of carrying the conversation. One of the girls asked Ricky if he was in school so I said ""Ricky is in school but he also has literally the biggest dick you'll ever see on a white guy."" Ricky looked like he wanted to crawl into a hole but all the girls took it as a joke but they absolutely wanted to know more about him and them talking with him pulled him out of his shell. It wasn't the girl he first noticed but another one grabbed his hand and with a sharpie wrote her number and IG on his arm with like hearts and ""you better call!"" They said they were leaving for another party. 

Ricky was furious with me. He said I embarrassed him so bad. I told him to look at his arm, this chick was wicked into him. Then he was like ""but she likes me for all the wrong reasons!!"" I was like dude she likes you because you talked to her, she didn't even see your glorious gift! He said ""well because of your bullshit, I'll never know!"" I was like dude you don't have to know, go on a date and if it works it works. He was so pissed at me that he slammed my door shut and won't answer his phone or texts.

1720,Not the A-hole,"Okay, basic background info; I work retail and have an irregular schedule. I don't mind a good prank, but will try to turn one around on you if I catch you in the act.

&#x200B;

Recently I had an early morning shift starting at 5:30 am, I am not a morning person and was dead tired by the time of my first break, exhausted by lunch time. On my lunch break I very quickly stuffed my face full of food, set an alarm on my phone and tried to take a nap in the break room as it was the only spot I could do so.

&#x200B;

Sometime during my nap a coworker got the idea to play a small prank on me. I had my eyes closed and listened as she whispered (loudly) to another coworker that she was gonna get me with the air horn app on her phone.

&#x200B;

I thought that this would be a great time to get some preemptive revenge. So, when she got closer to me and started lifting her phone to my ear I jumped up out of my chair and shouted real loud.

&#x200B;

That made her lose her balance and fall over, she tried to catch herself and ended up pulling a table down on her hip among other small injuries. Nothing broken, no cuts, just some bruises as far as anyone has told me.

&#x200B;

The rest of the shift and the few days since she's been complaining to our managers that I'm abusive and rude. HR has stepped in and tried to resolve the issue. I have apologized for causing her injury, but feel that she was kind of asking for it by trying to scare me out of my nap. My coworkers are split on the issue; some think she deserved it, others think I'm a massive d-bag for it.

I lost my cool and started to yell at my husband that he didn’t even ask if my son was ok, if he had tripped, etc. My husband said well obviously he’s fine he’s standing upright, he was just being careless. and he snapped at me not to yell at him. He then left to go in the back yard as he had gone very red which meant I had to clear up the bits of plastic on the floor. 

I confronted him about it after I cleared up the plastic and I told him it was not cool that he had yelled at my son. I don’t even yell at my son. My husband said that he wasn’t yelling AT my son, he was just very upset that his xbox was broken. He said it was limited edition (which I kinda believe is a lie because an x box is an x box) and that my son shouldn’t have been so careless. I told my husband to get over it.

I was finally officially diagnosed with bipolar and CPTSD. I started intensive therapy, completely quit drinking, basically did a 180 and have stayed on the straight and narrow ever since. I have no desire to go back to where I was, ie pick up a drink. The meds work great, and I am stable and better than I ever have been.

Turns out though, my very compétant psych team is pretty convinced that my mom is a narcissist and that her constant emotional abuse definitely caused my CPTSD and maybe in fact lead to my bipolar. Although I made bad decisions during my years of being sick, I want to be clear that I never DID anything TO anyone in my family, (Stealing, violence, etc) though I definitely said some things I regret, that I have apologized for. 

I can completely understand how from my fam’s  perspective it was difficult to see me in that state, however as they are stuck in this narcissistic family unit, they can’t seem to grasp that my mom actually played a big part in it.

In any event, I have only ever wanted a good relationship with them, and I though that getting sober and on the right track would have helped with that, but it actually has made relations worse, namely with my little sister who thinks I’m “playing the victim” blaming bipolar  for my years of bad behavior, also for blaming my mom for her abuse. 

For me, I have apologized for my past actions and words. In my view the best way to show my remorse is to take my recovery seriously. I can’t change the past but I can work towards a happy and healthy future. My sister sees this rational as me not owning my past actions, and I resent her, what I see as ignorance about my bipolar (she refuses to look into it to try to understand better).

AITA for not focusing on the past and how to make up for it? I don’t even know what I could possibly do. AITA for thinking that the hard work I’m doing now should be enough, at least for the time being?",55,52,0.9

1732,Asshole,"We bought our 10 acre property 1.5 years ago. It was a dream for my daughter and myself. We have 2 horses and 3 dogs and 2 cats. A great wonderful acreage with conservation land behind us, our 6 acres to the west of us, and 25 acres to the east of us.

These people bought the 25 acres of land to the east. It has one spot way around the eastern most corner and up on a hill that they could build on, we can't even see the building site from our home. Otherwise it has a creek running through the middle of it, and that area is considered a flood area. However, there is a small area right next to our yard that isn't a flood area. They've planted fruit trees there and want to place their beehives there and a garden. Right next to my yard, when they have 25 more acres to do it on. Literally on my fence line.

This though, is why it is a sensitive issue for me. My daughter lost her battle with the darkness inside her 11 weeks ago. She was 14 years old. She LOVED honey, any way you could get it. Literally drank it when she could. So last year she and I decided to get bees, we went to bee classes, researched online together, the day she died she made a collage of all the bee supply pictures that she took at Tractor Supply and put it in her mom folder. I saw it when the police returned her phone.

I don't mind that they've migrated to be as close to our house as possible even when their building site is the opposite side of their property but, that I'm still raw with emotion and don't know that I'm ready to see that yet.

Eventually I might want to honor her memory with keeping bees, but just seeing anything that reminds me of what could have been wrecks me.
He did tell the neighbors why. I don't know what their decision is yet.

Edit: 

When we bought the property it was exciting not to have neighbors. The people who bought the 25 acres do not have neighbors on 3 sides, only conservation land. We are on the side that is a flood area from their creek. Our property is barely out of the flood zone. Our property is basically a square 10 acres, except for this odd divet that is triangular at the base of our driveway, the front of our property. That is where they are putting this area of things. Not even in their buildable areas. I don't see why THEY would even want to be that close to US. So that chafes me anyways.

They don't live there yet, there is no home or any other buildings. 

They only know this happened when my husband told them a few weeks ago. These people are nice, they seem like great people. 

I see where I should take the good out of this, but it is hard when you lose a child. The what if's and what could've beens are debilitating. 

I'm not jealous because I'm not doing it, I want to just not yet. I'm still quite broken. 

My relationship with my daughter I thought was amazing. We were best friends, she did everything with me. She was a straight A student, pretty, funny, popular, well mannered, well loved child. She was a high achiever and really pushed herself hard. She was also dealing with her sexual orientation, which we supported. This came as a shock to us, no prior diagnosis, no alcohol/drugs, was not sexually active. So, needless to say this truly devastating to our family.

Second Edit:

They have the north and the east and south east sides of the property that are not in the flood zone. Their creek floods the west side of their property almost right up to the edge of our property, BUT there is a 1/4 acre triangular divet that is on their property but is basically right beside our property.  If that makes sense? Imagine a square with a tiny triangle cut out in the bottom right hand side. That is where they are putting all this.",80,35,0.79
1733,Not the A-hole,"So little background. My GF let's call her Sally, is one of the nicest people and caring people I know. Her roommate, let's call her Jackie, and Sally both attend the same classes, so Sally has been giving Jackie rides to class every. single. day. Jackie just turned 21 and doesn't even have her driver's license (we live in a smallish uni-town where it's highly recommended you get a car to get to anywhere). I spent the night at her place couple days ago, and when we were both ready to leave, Jackie was still sleeping, and Sally had to wake her up. The girl is 21 for christ's sake and she needs someone to wake her up because she couldn't wake up to her alarm (I don't even think she set one because she's so used to my GF waking her up) I could tell on the car ride to my place that Sally was frustrated and not happy. 

So later that night, I talked to Sally about this situation, and she told me it's been going on for awhile and she's just used to it now. I asked if Jackie ever thanks her or even steps up to pay for her gas because of how much she drives her around, and she said no. When she said that, I was a little frustrated. I think my GF doesn't have to go through all of this as it's not her responsibility to do all of these things, and she tells me it's just because she's so used to it now and she knows bringing this up about how Jackie needs to grow up will only make her cry and she wasn't about that. I know there is a bus that stops by her place that gets her to class, and when I brought that up, she says she's worried that Jackie wouldn't wake up and miss class. 

I was baffled. My GF literally is this girl's mom and she's scared to confront her because Jackie is very sensitive. I told her that she's not responsible for Jackie and that you should tell Jackie to grow the fuck up. Sally agreed, but she still can't seem to confront her about that.

So, am I an asshole? Couple friends are siding with my views on this, but they seem to keep shielding Jackie and using this excuse that she's so innocent and sensitive that she can't go confront her like that.

1736,Asshole,"I (19F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for about 6 months. I come from a rather poor background, and had to work for things that I needed. My boyfriend grew up middle class, but has a considerably large amount of savings and wealth he gains from his own business, investments etc. I still work at my job (but do much less hours) because my bf pays for my bills and lets me live in his house with his parents. Since we started dating he would always pick up the tab on anything we went out to do, dates, restaurants, because he feels it would be wrong to expect me to pay for those things (considering the difference in our access to money). 

&#x200B;

But heres the thing, he gets me ridiculously expensive gifts on christmas and my birthday. Don't get me wrong, I think its very sweet and thoughtful, but in some of these cases I could have just gotten the money and I would have been perfectly okay with that. He buys me diamond jewelry (which I love), and nice phones, computers etc. These are all worth literally thousands of dollars, more than I have made ever working at my job. I brought it up to him that I'd be cool with him just giving me money instead of gifts, and he got really upset. He said ""That is not the point of a gift, you don't choose what it is, it is a gift not a payment"". And now he feels insulted that I would suggest something like that. I just wanted to suggest that if he likes ""spoiling"" he could just give me money, but apparently I'm crossing a line here?

1738,Asshole,"I went on a beach house vacation with several friends from university. Yesterday, after spending the entire day drinking at the beach, we decide to go the club and drink even more.

After the club, we went skinny dipping. I told my boyfriend before I left for this vacay that the girls we're talking about skinny dipping and that I wanted to join them. As a kid, I thought that's what all the college kids did and I've never felt like it was overtly sexual. Just something that was fun. I knew he didn't like the situation, but after telling him that I wanted to be young and have fun, we dropped the convo.

*EDIT 4: We dropped the convo because he said that he'd be okay with it, even if both men and women were there, under the impression that  we were doing it in the ocean. I thought we were doing it in the ocean as well at the time, but I didn't realize he considered the pool or hot-tub a very different situation.*

Fast forward to the beach house, 8 of us college girls and 2 guys go skinny dipping in the pool and then head to the hot tub afterwards. One of the guy friends is gay, and the other one is getting married (his fiancee was also in the hottub).

When I get back home, my boyfriend is very upset about what happened. He kept going on and on about how all those guys 'didn't deserve to see me naked' and how it wouldn't be an issue if I 'weren't so attractive to him.' He said he thought we would be skinny dipping at night at the beach, not in the light, in close proximity to each other in a hot tub. Before the trip, I thought we were skinny dipping at the beach too.

We calmly spoke about it, and I decided that I didn't like seeing him so upset over something like this so I told him he was right and that I was sorry. He was particularly upset at the guy getting married for getting to see me naked. He kept calling it 'the best bachelor party this kid could get'. I didn't fully understand his beef with the married guy but I guess that's why I'm here asking Reddit.

Although we've talked it through I'd like 3rd party perspective. AITA here? I just wanted to be young. Is skinny dipping sexual? Would you consider it cheating on an SO?

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1:** Because I'm receiving a lot of personal attacks. **I'd like to emphasize that my boyfriend and I have resolved this issue. Long before I even posted here.** Because he and I had such different views, I was curious to see what other 3rd parties would think. My post states that. **Clearly, the comment section is divided over the situation too.**

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** For everyone calling my boyfriend misogynist, he is certainly not. u/veastt 's comment perfectly captured how my boyfriend felt towards this situation.

&#x200B;

**EDIT 3:** Everyone keeps asking this question so I figure I should put it in the post description:

**Q:** *Just wondering, if you found out he went skinny dipping with naked ladies when you weren't around would you be upset?*

**A:** I would not be upset if he went skinny dipping with 8 dudes, a lesbian, and a woman getting married with her fiancée present (the reverse situation). Not at all. I judged the situation as being non-sexual. If the group of people consisted of several single, straight men, I would not have gone skinny dipping because that would make me very uncomfortable. The same goes for my partner--if he went skinny dipping with several single straight women, I would be upset.",718,439,0.84
1739,Not the A-hole,"To be really honest, I don't want to. Not out of laziness but more out of my mom being an angry drunk who cheats on her bf and her never being satisfied with anything we do for mother's day. As a little kid, my siblings and I made as elaborate of cards little kids can make and presented it to our mom. She screams at us because she actually wanted us to clean the entire house and yelled at us all day as we cleaned. Next mother's day rolls around and my siblings and I get up extra early, clean the house and make her breakfast. She gets all uppity because we didn't have a time to make a card and keeps bringing it up. Last year, my mom told us all she wanted for mother's day was a clean house on Friday. We do so. On Monday, she's screaming and crying at us in the car how we are bad kids to her and how she broke down crying in front of her students because we didn't get her what she wanted for mother's day.

I'm just so fucking done. I don't want to deal with her inevitable screaming and crying and thinking she deserves the world like she does everyday. Why she would even celebrate mother's day when she doesn't let us celebrate father's day for our dad? Maybe I'm just a sensitive brat and should just do it idk.",15,32,0.92

Edit: wow guys, thanks so much for all the super useful info and advice! This post has had a few more replies than I was expecting, so I'll try and reply to all your questions and such. But thanks for making sure I didn't feel like a POS for wanting these services. After thinking about it, my husband came to his senses and we applied last night and will see if we get approved!


So. My husband and I just brought a beautiful baby boy into the world a month ago. During my pregnancy, I was VERY ill and constantly tired so I was unable to find work after the place I worked closed down.

Now that I am done with the baby making, and have  healed from the c-section, I told my husband I was going to start looking for a job. He told me not to do that. We have a 3 year old daughter and he says that whatever money I *DO* make will only go towards daycare and gas and I will not make any profit. 

I see exactly where he is coming from, although I really wish I could go back into the work force...but I think I need to wait a little longer so we aren't spending a fortune on daycare lol

HOWEVER, I suggested that while I stay at home, it may be a great idea to apply for food stamps to help just a little. I have to eat good food to keep up my milk supply and my 3 year old is (thankfully) not picky, so I thought this would help us maybe be in the positive at the end of the month instead of at $0. He freaked out at this idea, calling me an asshole for even bringing up the idea. My mom agreed, saying our money situation can't be ""that bad"" but...it kind of is.

So, AITA?",197,328,0.95
1741,Asshole,"My (27F) fiancé (32M) asked me if I would agree to a prenup before our upcoming wedding this year at the suggestion of one of his coworkers, that would make it so that in the event of a divorce we would split assets 50/50 and both leave the marriage with what we entered with. I feel that this is a huge slap in the face. 

Before anyone jumps down my throat or calls me a gold digger, I’d like to explain a little about the relationship. When we met about 6 years ago he was in a really rough spot, addicted to hard drugs and alcohol and severely depressed. I invested a lot of time and energy into helping him recover, and he did! He did an incredible job kicking all of his vices (he’s been completely sober for 4 years), getting his shit together, going back to school and graduating with honors, and getting into a really solid career. He put in a lot of hard work into his recovery and success, but I feel like he’s forgetting the work I did to help him get there. I’m not trying to take any credit away from him, I know recovery is one of the hardest things a person can do, but it was a lot of effort and labor on my part as well. 

There was one time I had to explain to him that he couldn’t continue smoking crack, no not even every once in a while, and he argued with me about it. When he went back to school (largely due to my insistence), I spent countless hours studying with him on top of my own studies and full time job. I even ended up paying for him to take a few of his exams when he couldn’t afford them. I didn’t mind doing any of this because I love him and knew he was worth that investment. 

Now we’re fortunate enough to both have good careers and rent a nice house, and enjoy all the financial stability we worked for. My refusal to agree to the prenup is not because of the money, i make roughly the same as he does and am currently in grad school, and neither of us are really materialistic people. I just feel it is an insult to ask me to sign something basically stating that I had no part in his success before the marriage. I would never ask him to do the same. Am I the asshole here?

Edit: I do not feel like he owes any kind of debt to me. He has done more than his fair share of supporting me through school and my career, and was my biggest motivator when applying to and attending grad school. I don’t believe in a prenup in this instance because I don’t believe either of us would be where we are today without the others support.

Another edit: The circumstances are not “sign or the marriage is off” it’s been discussed and we are both planning on going through with the marriage either way. The prenup (which hasn’t even been drafted yet, it’s just a discussion) would be to eliminate the possibility of alimony, which I wouldn’t want anyway.",464,1292,0.9

1743,Not the A-hole,"I’m 16 and my mums boyfriends daughter is 13. She stole money from my room (£150) that my boyfriends mum gave me as a treat to buy some hair straighteners because I babysat her cat when she went on holiday. This happened at Christmas time. When I found out and confronted her she admitted it to me, my mum, AND her dad. All of them did nothing about it, and my mum really upset me because she laughed it off and said ‘oh she’s only 13, plus you didn’t need the money anyway’. I was fuming but I’m used to my mum treating me like shit so I didn’t bother to kick up a fuss as she’s already threatened to kick me out her house more than once because I don’t get on with her BF or stepsister.

1744,No A-holes here,"My partner (let’s call him Tim) and I work at the same company, but in different divisions - think designer vs. analyst. Tim’s scope of responsibility is excessive for one person, and he often works 55-60 hours a week, has been asked to come in on weekends, etc. I also have a lot of responsibility, but am proactive about talking to my boss and delegating workload if I’m on track to work above ~45 hours, or miss a deadline. Tim has not communicated the extent of his work directly to his boss. When Tim comes back from work exhausted and frustrated, or cancels on plans for the night because he’s too low-energy, or can’t hang out with friends because he’s working Saturday morning, I feel stressed on his behalf and hurt that our relationship doesn’t feel like a priority. This has been going on for about 3-4 months at this point. 


We’ve talked this out a bunch of times. I’ve tried to be patient and supportive, and often do things to offset his workload, like meal prepping his lunches, offering to draft an email to his boss, and reminding him of other coworkers that he can share work with. I’ve told him that I feel hurt and upset to see this pattern continuing, and asked him what steps he has planned to adjust his workload. He always says “it’s not that bad” and that soon he’ll tell his boss/leave after 40 hours/take himself off a project, and none of those things have happened. I feel more and more stuck and like I’m running out of options that don’t overstep my professional boundaries. 


A week ago, I sat down with him and told him how I felt. I said that since he seemed ok with his workload and hadn’t taken steps to change it, I was going to match his hours. If he works 11 hours one day and I come in at 9, then ok I’m staying til 8. He reluctantly agreed to this and said that his workload probably wasn’t much more than mine anyway. Surprise surprise, after a week he is begging me to stop my “experiment” and let him work more hours than I do. He says “I hate knowing you’re at work for so long” and “it hurts me to see you worn out at the end of the day”. He’s super upset that I’m being so stubborn in “proving a point”.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I are in our early to mid twenties and have been together for 6 years. He graduated high school, went to college for a year and knows some people so he got a pretty nice gig in a large company. He has his own desk, takes phone calls, does some paper work. I, on the other hand, dropped out of school due to my anxiety and since I didn't have school or a job at the time I took care of my grandma. 

&#x200B;

My grandma passed away this last month so I started immediately looking for a job. Almost no one wants a high school drop out but I did find this super kind local couple that own a business and they were willing to take me on part time. It's a very physical job. I clean the outside and inside of old vehicles(cars, buses, trucks, etc)- a lot of them are just completely trashed inside. It's all done outside in the heat(I live in South Carolina). 

&#x200B;

Anyway, the past two weeks have been hard adjusting. I'm not out of shape by any means. I'm just not used to the level of activity required for this job and because of that, by the time I get home I'm just...extremely tired. My boyfriend got annoyed that I turned him down for sex- I have every day since I started this job. I've apologized and told him that it'll be better once I get adjusted. Last night though he made a comment that just irked me. He said that I shouldn't even be that tired since I'm just working part time. I shot back that it's still physical work that I'm not used to and he just pointed out again that he works full time- 8 hours every day and he's not as tired as I supposedly am. That made me really annoyed and I just told him that I actually work and he just sits on his ass all day at a desk so of course he's not tired. He got upset that I insulted him and his job and he went out into the living room to watch tv by himself.

1746,No A-holes here,"I have this friend that I'll call ""Josh."" I have literally known Josh my entire life as our moms were friends in college. We were best friends when we were younger but sort of grew different interests in high school but stayed friends. I guess to put this as nicely as possible, Josh is like the epitome of a ""niceguy asshole"" but he's my niceguy asshole if that makes sense. I don't think Josh has ever been on a date in his life much less kissed a girl. He's a little weird around girls if that makes sense. We go to the same school out of state and hangout maybe once a week or so.

  I knew Josh was crushing really hard on this girl from one of his classes named ""Bailey."" I knew for the first time in college, he had a girl who was being really nice to him and he was massively in love. We talked so often about how he should just ask her out but he was always too nervous and never did. I never met her but I knew they hung out all the time, ostensibly to study but I know he really enjoyed her company. He showed me her Instagram and she was really, really cute so I was happy for him. 

So last weekend was commencement which usually means just massive partying. I went out to a grad party and met a girl and instantly hit it off with a girl named ""Bailey."" We had a blast dancing, doing shots and flirting. It honest to god never even crossed my mind it might ""his"" Bailey. At like midnight she basically told me she's getting an uber home and she really wanted me to come with her. Honestly who wouldn't?  So got back to her place and r/ihavesex. In the morning she woke up and asked me if she could take a picture of me eating cereal for her snapchat. I said yes of course. 

Within like two seconds of her posting the snap both of our phones started blowing up. It was Josh. I honest to god didn't clue in as to what was happening and he asked me ""did you have sex last night?"" since I didn't know he was talking about the snap I said ""fuck yeah dude, you should see this chick, smoking hot."" He texted back ""yeah you fucking piece of shit asshole fuck stupid pig asshole fuck loser chad fuck backstabber fuck asshole !!!!!!! !! ! !! That's fucking Bailey!"" (that's a cut and paste). 

Baily was engaged in her own text flame war with him and the gist of her conversation was that she liked him as friends but they weren't dating. 

The thing is I REALLY like her. She's amazing looking but she's also fun and funny and smart. We are loosely talking about driving across the country together to get home for the summer (her hometown is literally a stop on my drive home). Josh has come over crying asking me how I could do something like that to him and for the most part I've said I was sorry but had no idea who she was.

The other day I was grabbing a burger at Shake Shack when some random kid walks up to me and asks ""Do you know Karate?""

His dad runs up to grab his kid, looking MORTIFIED.

At this point, I can't hold it in anymore, and am laughing at them, and ask the kid what else he's been taught about ""Chinese"" people, and before he can drop any more gems, the dad hustles him away, and calls me an asshole.

I, a guy who *wasn't* offended, am dragging this out because I find his discomfort hilarious.  Otoh though, it kind of rubs me the wrong way that he was all ready to go into full apology mode if I **was** offended, but because I didn't go after him over it, all of a sudden now I'm the asshole.

1748,No A-holes here,"So my friend has been going through a depressive episode and I’ve done my best to be there for her because, well, I know what it’s like. She has mentioned several times little asides like “I haven’t done laundry in a month” or “I haven’t washed dishes in weeks” and the like. That sort of seemed like a cry for help to me and I was debating like...inviting myself over for a cleaning party. Wine, music, and the vacuum cleaner. The usual. 

But before I could make a decision on that, she had a family tragedy and had to fly back home to Texas. She asked me to check in on her cat and birds. So obviously I’m doing that and giving the little ones lots of love and attention. 

But while I’m here I also just kind of went to town cleaning, thinking that she doesn’t need to come back from a funeral to a sink full of dishes and old fast food wrappers on her bed. I went through a rather prolonged depressive episode in my own life and I remember how hard it was to do even the most basic cleaning things. 

So I cleaned her toilets, washed her dishes, washed her sheets and blankets, swept, and vacuumed. Now, though, I’m second-guessing myself and am worried I overstepped. Like, we are friends but we aren’t super duper close. I don’t want her to come back and feel...shame. That’s not my intention at all! I just wanted things to be a little easier for her when she gets back especially because she doesn’t have too good of a support system here. 

I’m trying to make it look like I didn’t clean, like I’m not going to make the bed and I’m putting the clothes pile right back on top and I’m scuffing over all the vacuum lines. But she’s definitely going to notice all the clean dishes. 

So, I guess, my question is did I overstep and make myself the asshole here?",48,85,0.92
1749,No A-holes here,"Next month, one of my good friends is getting married. He and I have known each other for about 15 years now, we have drifted the past few (as you do in adulthood) but remained friendly. 

This past week, I received my RSVP request for his wedding. It was addressed to me alone, so I texted the groom to ask whether I had a plus one. He said that the seating arrangements were done a couple months ago, and that he didn't know I would want one. 

Some backstory: my SO and I have been together since 2014. We split up for about a year to work on some things individually, and reconciled last summer. We now live together, we are not engaged but plan to be soon. SO has a middle school aged child who I am involved with and have a great relationship with. Long story short, serious long term partner. 

Here is the kicker: I am IN the wedding party. All the etiquette I can Google says a plus one should always be provided for wedding party members, and that the ""no ring, no bring"" rule is outdated. 

Would I be the asshole if I asked to bring my SO? I totally get that there are budgets and plans, but I really feel like a plus one should have been factored into those plans a long time ago. And how do you have a final seating plan if the RSVPs just went out? My response was a neutral ""okay, glad I asked"", but as I think about this more, I get more frustrated. Is it a dick move to talk to the groom about this, or should I just suck it up and go alone?

Edit to clarify: by ""suck it up and go alone"" I just mean that it would be kind of a bummer to go to a big romantic event without my partner. I will still go to the wedding either way, have a great time, and would absolutely not do/say anything to ruin my friend's day. This is also not something I would end a friendship over.",70,35,0.88

1751,Not the A-hole,"My wife (let's call her Liz) decided to surprise me for my birthday. As we headed out for a night on the town in Paris (where we live), I could only guess at what fun event it could be. Maybe a concert, a nice meal, or an interesting play? I could only imagine, and maybe I let my hopes run a bit wild.

&#x200B;

The surprise was a self-styled ""fashion freak show,"" a song-and-dance cabaret (almost entirely in French, which I don't really speak, but Liz does) review of the life, times, and inspirations of famous French designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. If you have no idea who he is (as was the case for me), with a little light googling you can find that he designed the Madonna cone bra and was/is best-known for scandalizing the Paris fashion establishment. Right.

&#x200B;

I self-identify as a bit of a nerd. My interests include music, sci-fi/fantasy, politics, video gaming, history, food, karaoke. A live podcast of My Brother My Brother and Me or Five Thirty Eight? Perfect. A They Might be Giants or Belle and Sebastian concert? Bulls eye. Escape rooms? Baller.

&#x200B;

A cabaret-style fashion show and musical retrospective of the life and style of monsieur Gaultier? Erk. 

&#x200B;

While opinions have differed over whether I behaved appropriately, friends and family all agree that Liz missed the mark pretty badly. I stuck through to the end of the performance, but I'm afraid I didn't hide my dismay particularly well. Liz became offended that I didn't enjoy and appreciate a night that was intended as a present. She tartly offered that for her birthday we could do something I would enjoy. I responded that this was not a quid pro quo. I would never gift her something I did no reasonably believe she would enjoy. Reader, things got tense.

&#x200B;

My disappointment stems from the fact that this was to be a birthday surprise. Had Liz approached me and asked if I would go with her to the ""Fashion Freak Show"" because it was something SHE wanted to do, of course I'd say yes. I would even appreciate getting out of my comfort zone a bit and doing something that made her happy. Instead, I was left scratching my head and wondering how, after 13 years together, she could miss on my interests so badly. AITA for feeling hurt that my wife would give a gift that I so obviously would not enjoy?

&#x200B;

TL;DR version: Wife took me to a surprise cabaret ""fashion freak show"" celebrating Jean-Paul Gaultier for my birthday. I am not interested in fashion, cabarets, or Jean-Paul Gaultier. I hated the performance, stayed for the entirety, but didn't hide my disappointment. I suspect my wife chose this present because it was really something she wanted.",190,1025,0.98
1752,Not the A-hole,"So background is basic r/justnoMIL stuff that isn’t super relevant here. What is relevant is that my husband and I have gone to counseling to learn to set proper boundaries with his mother and a couple months ago we had a “come to Jesus” with her implementing those boundaries. Since then things have been pretty good. She stills makes inappropriate comments or oversteps from time to time, but my husband nips it in the bud immediately and the issues seem less frequent. That being said, having put up with her antics for over 7 years, I am still super sensitive to her and tend to see the worst.

So to the issue- MIL is going out of town for Mother’s Day. She asks if we can all get together to celebrate early and she wants everyone to come so we can get pictures and share this day. Sure, no problem. We show up with cards and flowers ready to celebrate. 

When we arrive and throughout the meal, she makes it clear this is “her Mother’s Day” and she was sorry she’d be out of town on “my Mother’s Day”. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t want anything from her. In fact, if she does something nice it will be held over your head forever. It just seemed weird that we all had to get together and make sure I understood we would ONLY be celebrating her motherhood on that day. I’m the mother of her only grandchildren - the most recent was born 8 months ago. It just couldn’t have been “happy Mother’s Day to all the moms here?” 

In my family, we celebrate all the mothers and the same goes for Father’s Day. I understand that every family is different and I want to respect that. This just felt purposely exclusionary if that makes sense?

My husband thinks his mom was being an asshole too, but he is sensitive to her as well. We haven’t said anything to his mom at this point so my question is- AITA for thinking MIL was being asshole?",18,69,0.96
1753,Not the A-hole,"A little bit of background. I am the sous chef of a small farm to table restaurant about 30 miles from where I grew up. The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.

Last week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.

Fast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. 

As i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better. 

Am I wrong to judge someone for their actions so long ago? I definitely feel like a bit of an asshole, but honestly if I had to work with him again it would bring up a lot of memories I try not to think about anymore.",1439,7822,0.95
1754,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway and some small details changed as my wife is on Reddit, but the story tells the same so judge away. 

So, we’ve been married for 5 years, my wife is friends with a couple that we see about once a month. Wife had a relationship with the male about a year before we got married. 

The issue is the couple continually bring up the “love triangle” between them, the male brings up at least one sexual situation with my wife every time we see them, and I feel like it’s gotten to the point of being disrespectful. I’ve mentioned to him in the past that I have no problem that they used to date, but I have no desire to know the details of their sexual exploits. 

We all have history, I don’t fault my wife for hers and she doesn’t me for mine. I just don’t want to hear the details of it from someone else that was there. 

We don’t see them often, which is why I’ve sat on this for so long, and I honestly thought it would get old to them. But here we are, another visit last night and I got to hear about how my wife hogs the shower head during sex. I’m just tired of it, i don’t want my wife to lose her friends, but I am at the point that they don’t have enough redeeming qualities for me to look past how uncomfortable they seemingly intentionally make me. 

I just don’t care to be in their company anymore and I’m not sure if this is an asshole thing or not. We have other friends that we see regularly, some hers, some mine, some ours. Our relationship is great and we discussed this issue a few years ago and she understood that it made me uncomfortable, I’m not sure if she forgot about it or is just hoping that it’ll stop, or if she thinks I’m just overreacting. I was hoping for some outside perspective before I spoke to her about it again or at all.",39,38,0.92
1755,Not the A-hole," 

Let me start with I never thought I would be in this position.

Five years ago, I had breast cancer and, as a result, got a double mastectomy with reconstruction. My husband of three years never had sex with me again after that. Believe me, I tried, but he just wasn't interested. He also wouldn't help me, so I have been, essentially, involuntarily celibate for 5 years.

3 years ago, my husband got cancer, it was a stage IV and he was given a few months to live. His selfishness and ""belittling"" got worse, because he had absolutely nothing else to do all day.  He was prescribed anti-depressants, he refused to take them, so that's the end of that. All of the cancer treatments worked, and he lived to see more years, but he did not ""see the light"" about trying to be at all helpful to me. I had to file bankruptcy about a year and a half ago, because his medical bills garnished my wages. My frustration kept building until I had an emotional affair with a guy at work. That's over now.

His cancer came back two months ago. He decided to go full gusto to fight it, although I don't know why. It's not like he has a great quality of life or anything. He is currently, as far as I know, lying naked on a bare mattress calling people names on facebook. His bedroom is strewn with empty containers from uber eats and water bottles. I gave up trying to deal with it.

The final straw happened. I was in my own bedroom masturbating and he came in (knowing this, it was 6:30 am) and demanded I get him more water. I LOST MY SHIT ON HIM.

Then, I started on a path I probably shouldn't go down, but I contacted the guy I used to work with. I am doing a 5K next weekend near him, and we are meeting for lunch. I also have been not coming home immediately from work. I'm not doing anything exciting, just going to Starbucks and watching a video or walking in the park or driving aimlessly. I also went out drinking with friends last weekend. Honestly? I get off work and don't want to go home at all.

I realize some of this might be escapist on my part. Recently, my husband spent days not speaking to me at all (which is fine) but texts me when he wants something. If I don't respond, he calls. So I got a second cell phone. My friends and family have the #, but are under strict orders not to give the # to him. That way, I can turn off my primary phone and get some peace.

A few months ago, we DID couples counseling because I desperately wanted to ""get closer"" before he died, maybe find that spark, but it's not going to happen.

This morning, as I was getting ready for work, husband volunteered that he wanted to resume therapy. He said he wanted to work on our marriage again. I told him I am already disconnected and don't want to put any more effort into it.",42,37,0.8
1756,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because he knows my reddit. I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting errors.

My ex and I broke up around the end of February. There are a number of reasons why it happened, and while he initiated the breakup, it felt mutual. We dated for a little over a year but things began to go downhill (in my eyes) when he became friends with this girl we’ll call Emma. Emma is very sweet and I liked her as a person, but they spent a lot of time together alone and I felt uncomfortable and honestly threatened by it, and I already know ITA about that. He and Emma became best friends and it felt like he’d rather spend time with her than me for a few months. Every time I brought it up, he’d get mad saying that I am just jealous, but I genuinely feel he didn’t understand boundaries between friendships and relationships (we’d had this talk about other girls in the past as well).

When the breakup came around, I was expecting it. It was a clean break at first and we decided to remain friends because we have a very close-knit social circle (we play DND together usually once a week). I was assured that he still enjoys me as a friend and that he just didn’t feel dating was constructive for him right now, so other than no longer sleeping together, not much was going to change. I did however tell him that while he can do whatever he wants, if he and Emma start dating, I will like cut all contact with him because it’s a very sore spot for me.

As I’m sure you can guess, everything’s changed. Long story short, I haven’t gotten over this as quickly as I thought I would and it’s been very hard for me to spend time around him anyway. I noticed he’s spending more time with Emma but I hoped it was my anxiety and insecurities getting the better of me, so I never mentioned anything to our friends in fear of looking like a jealous ex.

Yesterday I broke down and told two of my friends that I’m convinced ex and Emma are dating and hiding it from me. Within a few hours of that, ex texts me to tell me that is what’s happening, and that I have a right to be mad at him, but that they’re happy and it wasn’t planned for them to start dating. Apparently they’ve been hiding it from me for a few weeks and all of our friends knew. He then goes on to say that he doesn’t want me to quit our DND group because he thinks it’ll be good for me to have something to do and he wants to keep me around.

AITA if I want nothing to do with them, at least for a little while? I love my friends, but I don’t think I can be around my ex and this girl while maintaining any bit of dignity. I understand that I can’t control who he dates, but I feel very disrespected by the fact that it’s Emma and especially because my entire friend group has been lying to me. If I quit this DND group, it’s really the only social contact/friends that I have, but I really don’t know if I can handle this gracefully.",44,116,0.92
1757,Not the A-hole,"I had been in the military for about 2 years, I had bought my own car with my own money.

One evening, in the middle of nowhere (driving back to base) I misjudged a corner in the wet, skidded off the road and damaged the front end of my car. (no damage to any 3rd party property).

Because it was my first car, I could only afford 3rd party insurance... which meant I was not covered for accidental damage to my own car.

Although damaged, it was still driveable and I managed to get back to base safely.

The front bumper had sprung back into shape, but the front edge of the bonnet/hood was dented beyond repair.

I was aware that there may be underlying structural damage but the car drove fine and I wasn't really going that fast during the impact.

A few weeks go by and I start to notice small puddles of oil where I park the car... about the size of a 10p/dime... clearly there's a leak most likely caused by damage during the crash.

I took it to a garage and they told me I needed a lot of work doing to the engine, but structurally the car is safe.

However, I couldn't afford the work so took the car away and parked it up on base.

I did very little travelling home from base for a few months, and when I did I used public transport.

My parents were fully aware of the situation, and knew my car was parked on base, needing repairs. They offered to pay for the repairs if they could then loan the car to friends for a few weeks whilst they were visiting from abroad.

I accepted the offer and gave the car to my parents. They paid for the repairs and loaned the car to their friends.

The car was then handed around different families in my parent's church, sort of like a missionary ""pool car"" over the next year.

At this point I'm now in a position to pay my parents back for the repairs, and I wanted my car back. But they told me that they had sold the car to ""the church"" for £3000.

I thought it was just on loan, so you can imagine my surprise.

OK, I said... take the cost of the repairs away from the £3000 and give me my money so I can use it as a deposit on a new car.

That's where things went sour... they were acting like I was trying to steal from the church, but I said no... you were paid £3000 by the church for MY car... it's my money, but sure take away the repair costs.

We argued for a while, they said I was being unreasonable asking for the money, they argued that because I gave the car to them for their missionary friends it was technically a ""donation"" to the church and it's bad form to ask for a donation back. Also, they had already spent the money the church gave them for the car so didn't have it to give to me.

Am I the asshole for trying to get my money back?

Edit: For those asking for more information regarding title/registration documents.  

I'm in the UK.

Here things are a little strange.

There is a difference between the owner and the registered keeper...

Now obviously, an individual can be both owner and registered keeper.

Proof of ownership comes from the dealer, in the form of an invoice or receipt for payment.

The registration document of the vehicle does not prove ownership, just who the registered keeper is.

If you sell a car privately, you can change the registration document to show the new ""keeper"" details, but there is not usually a receipt handed over to prove ownership... normally just cash and a handshake.

I signed the car's registration document over to my step-father as the registered keeper, as it was going to be at their address for the majority of the time.

Also, I did not want to receive any speeding tickets/fines that the missionaries might incur.

I still legally owned the car because I had not given them a receipt for payment, because I didn't receive any payment.

I only agreed to the initial loan of the car for the church people to use, as a way of saying thank you for my parents repairing my car.

They knew I wanted the car back, but we agreed I would only get it back when I could pay them back for the repairs.

From conversations I had overheard, I think they ""donated"" the car money back to the church (paid for something the church needed), so effectively the church bought the car off my parents as a tax write off, then got the money back straight away, so got the car for free... all a bit dodgy if you ask me, stinks of a scam to avoid tax or something.",164,903,0.96

I hope you guys get the point. 

But I've learned everything, because I'm the only person our daughter has. I love her and she is the only person who keeps me running. My wife has a best friend. Let's call her Sarah. Now Sarah was with my wife so nce childhood. They were really close and her death shook Sarah. Before passing, my wife casually told Sarah that I didn't know much about raising a girl and she was worried about me and our daughter. 

Now Sarah thinks it's her responsibility to raise my daughter. She gives me unsolicited advice, which seems condescending, buys my daughter gifts and she recently asked me if I could let her watch my daughter when I'm at work. I make more than enough and I can totally afford daycare and a sitter if necessary. And I think interacting with other kids is important. She keeps telling me that my daughter needs someone around to assess her trauma. I think that's our therapist's job and not her's. Also, she gives me the feeling that I'm somehow being neglectful. 

My daughter and I are really close. Now, she asks me if we can have Sarah over and make her mommy. I think this woman is crossing every boundary and it's time to tell her off. IMO it's causing serious issues for me. WIBTA here?

We had a beautiful daughter and despite the relationship being new, we were both confident enough in each other that we got married and haven't looked back. We have a very strong marriage and relationship. If it matters, we're both 25 and 26.

I became pregnant again eight months after our first was born. We weren't ready for another child so we had a termination at 15 weeks. We told no one because my family is fairly anti-abortion. The only person I told, and this was a mistake in retrospect, was my sister. Who was understanding at the time but I guess she flat out told my mother. Our relationship with my mother was strained for a long time but I *thought* we reconciled and they accepted our decision then to terminate the pregnancy.

This next part will probably sound stupid to you all but I felt immense guilt for disappointing my mother by having an abortion. The unreasonable part of me wanted to make it up to her, and the unreasonable course of action was to have another child. I became pregnant again much to the delight of my mother and my unreasonable thought process was I was making it up to her. I expressed to my family we weren't fully ready to have another child but we figured it'd follow the old adage ""it takes a village"" and we'd get ample help from my parents. My mother flat out told me it's the right thing to do and she'd babysit whenever we wanted because she's retired.

To make things short, we had our second child, a son, and my family completely left our lives. Straight up moved away, closed their Facebooks, never spoke to us again. Before this, she said it's punishment for having the abortion previously and that we're not part of the family anymore and we're on our own. My support system went to zero in a matter of weeks. Even my sister was on board and ghosted us 100%.

We now have a 2 and a half year old daughter and a 9 month old son. My marriage is beginning to get strained. We weren't ready for a second child and honestly, I'm not sure we ever really wanted more than one. My husband works full time and I had to relent to becoming a SAHM because we have no support system anymore. I wouldn't call our lives miserable but it's close.

I broached the topic to my husband of maybe putting our son up for adoption, so he can be raised in a better household. Not only that, but maybe our marriage would repair itself, our daughter can have a better undivided life, and we can continue on our original path of just having one child. My husband is conflicted and said to give him a few months to work on us and if we can make it work, he'd like to keep both children as he loves them both.

A few months ago I received a letter from a young woman - introducing herself and explaining she wanted some medical information. I called the number that was on the letter and my wife and I set up a face-to-face meeting for dinner at our home which went fine and we exchanged relevant medical information through the clinic I went through.

After she had left - my wife said that when I went out for a smoke, my ""daughter"" expressed to her that she wanted to be part of our lives. I declined, which ended in an argument.

Fast forward a few weeks later - my wife gets a call from her asking to stay the night, apparently she was facing some financial difficulties, I decline again, which unfortunately started another argument and I let it slip ""that I only donated for the extra cash not to be a parent"" - My wife called me a callous a**hole.

I do not feel I should have any sort of parental responsibility towards her, neither do I feel any sort of connection. While the humanist in me understands the plight of someone in need - I find it suspicious that she's wanting to be a part of my family when she's having financial issues.

Edit: Thank you very much. There were a few questions asked:

1) We decided to bring her to our home because ultimately I did not know what form of relationship I wanted as I had not met this person at all. Its unfortunate that I didn't feel anything towards her (yes I'm aware this was only one meeting)

2) The decision to put my details down was made over 20 years ago - at the time I had no idea as to where my life was heading.

3) No, we do not have any children of our own and yes my wife was aware that I had donated. I will be discussing this with my wife today to recognize how she feels

Before work at around 6:15ish I blend my smoothies. I have always been consious of the fact it can be loud so I try and make it as short as possible (even if that means having a few chunks left). The other day in passing my neighbor asked me if I could not make so much noise in the morning. I explained to her it's a blender and I'm making my breakfast. I told her sorry but it's a way for me to maintain a healthy diet in the morning. She didn't say much but I could tell she was irritated. As far as I'm concerned using a blender in the morning is a normal routine for most people and nothing out of the ordinary. I feel like even though my normal morning routine is annoying to her that is just a downside of living in a duplex. I could be wrong and maybe I'm a total asshole. But anyways... AITA?

Edit: Thanks for all the feed back. I basically posted to get a general consensus of what everyone thought. I'll be honest I felt like I was being annoying but I was consistently told by friends and family not to worry about it. But to be clear I am very consious of how loud I am... Some examples are: TV doesn't go above volume 12, music stays quiet, don't vacuum until I hear her walking around, no laundry after hours, make sure guests lower voices, I put a sponge between the strings of my guitar so it dampens the sound, and I roll my motorcycle to the bottom of my driveway before starting it. I feel like I am typically ultra cautious of the noise I am making, maybe even to an extreme.

I plan to try making my smoothies at night and putting them in a yeti cup in the fridge to hopefully keep the right consistency. Thanks for the input!",114,114,0.97
1766,Not the A-hole,"Me and my gf have been together for 2 and a half years, and have been living together for six months in a four room flat.

Her parents, who live nearby, have two dogs who live in their yard, who we shall call Fido and Annabelle. My gf loves Fido to death. He is a 9 year old Staffie and she has known and cared for him his entire life.

When we were house sitting for her parents while they were on holiday last year, I came out into the garden to the most horrific fight between Fido and Annabelle (Fido seems to have become jealous of my gf momentarily giving the other dog more attention).

In our attempts to break up the fight, both me and my gf were bitten. Neither of us suffered lasting damage but I do have a noticeable scar on my left hand. My gf has scarring on her left finger over the incident.

While sympathetic to what had happened to us gf's parents still kept the two dogs together in the yard, until Fido had another go at Annabelle when they were there a few weeks ago. Now my girlfriend's mom wants Fido gone as he started both fights.

Gf has begged me to have him in the flat, and that she can't bear the idea of him living with a stranger. 

Even outside of him being a dog that has bitten me in the past, I don't see how it is feasible to have a dog left in a flat on his own while we both go out to work. She's offered to pay 50% more in rent (I own the flat), walk him with a muzzle (as shown he can't be trusted around other dogs), hire a dogwalker and even put him in a kennel for nights when dogphobic people might be coming round. I've still refused and told her I don't care about the money, I just can't see this massive commitment being the best thing for the dog or us living there. The last thing she said to me on the phone just now talking about this was 'you're a selfish cunt'. This could cost me the relationship but I can't see how I'm in the wrong here. AITA?",75,166,0.93
1767,Not the A-hole,"2 years ago at Christmas my aunt and I got into a small argument about my senior dog who was 12 at the time. She is known to get very drunk at family gatherings and this one was not exempt. Towards the end of the night I heard my dog barking and growling, which was odd because he rarely if ever made noises like that. I go into the room where he had been napping and my aunt has my dog pinned on his dog bed, gripping his paw visibly hard and she has her face right up to his as he's barking and growling. I tell her to get off of him and she doesn't make any moves. I then have to pull my aunt off of him pretty harshly and scoop my dog up so he doesn't bite her face. After I get him away she tells me I'm babying my dog too much and it's ruined him. I told her it wasn't any of her business how we raise our dogs and left the room. 

As you can imagine I was extremely upset, but the rest of my family wasn't so convinced. She and I were the only ones in the room so it wasn't like this moment was witnessed by a lot of people. It's been 2 years since I've spoken to or seen this aunt.

Yesterday we went to go visit my grandmother (aunt is her daughter) and aunt called to say she would be dropping by to visit. I ended up taking my leave, basically just saying I would walk home but I didn't mention it was to avoid the aunt but at this point it's no secret that I don't like her so I think everyone could figure out why I was leaving so suddenly. 

My dog passed away a few months after that christmas so he hasn't been with us for a long time. My parents think its about time I end my grudge against my aunt so we can all be together at family gatherings again.

AITA for cutting off my aunt for this long? I just really loved my dog and even though I don't think she meant to hurt him it really made me upset that she even did that in the first place.",90,602,0.97

1769,Everyone Sucks,"It’s now been two years since my grandmother passed away from a stroke. I was extremely close with her, as she taught me what it meant to be compassionate and kind despite the world telling me to only look out for myself. She was an amazing woman that I miss every day and it killed me to lose her, just like it killed my entire family. After she died my family started to break apart; cracks started to show and we began arguing more and avoiding each other. This is all in service to say that her loss had a huge negative impact on my family and, I’m not ashamed to admit I spent a few nights in the following year crying

That, in part, is also why I was stunned and shocked when my grandfather started dating again less than a year after my grandmother passed.

My grandfather’s new girlfriend, let’s call her Janet, has had a rough time integrating into the family because many of us see her as trying to replace my grandmother in our eyes. While I’m sure this is just an overreaction on our parts (perhaps my part especially) I’ll admit I’m a grown man who acts like a 14 year old kid. I don’t like this woman, mainly because I don’t like what she represents: my grandfather moving on and finding someone else other than my grandmother.

This came to a head quite recently as we have never had a true sit-down conversation, Janet and I, until recently at the family (or the remainder of the family who chooses to show up) Easter get-together. I don’t follow the same religious beliefs as the rest of my family (Quaker, family is Presbyterian) and Janet decides to talk to me, asking why I didn’t go to church with everyone else. As I give my response, she then tries to explain that I should have gone to church with my family if only to be with them on Easter (I also live about 3 hours away so don’t get to see everyone much anymore) and while explaining that she referred to me by a nickname that my grandmother gave me when I was a baby and that she called me my entire life. I asked her firmly, maybe too firmly, to address me by my name, not by my nickname, as my nickname was something special that I only let family and VERY VERY VERY close friends call me. She then had the nerve to say “well we’re basically family now” and I lost my cool and stormed off after telling her that if she called me by my nickname again she’d be the one explaining to my parents why I don’t go to family functions anymore.

My mother, the one who basically told Janet she could use my nickname, said that I should let Janet call me by my nickname because it would make her feel more welcome in the family. I know this is a really stupid reason to get bent out of shape but I don’t want a nickname my grandmother gave me to be used by someone to whom I don’t even have a desire to get closer. AITA?

Edit: Forgot to mention: this is my dad’s side of the family, not my mom’s

Edit 2: I want to be clear, I haven’t been overtly disrespectful to her up to this point. I haven’t had much in the way of interactions with her but every time up to this point I’ve been civil, if not cordial. I don’t want my grandfather to be lonely and miserable, I just don’t want Janet using the nickname my grandmother gave me.

Edit 3: you guys have given me a lot of perspective and I appreciate all of it. Moving forward I’m going to try and make more of an effort to try and move toward accepting Janet’s place in relation to the family. I acted like a child because I’m still dealing with the loss of my grandmother and I’m ashamed that I acted how I did and I’m sure my grandmother would be disappointed, which is even more shameful for me. I’m going to apologize for how I reacted but I’m going to insist that for the time being she address me by my given name rather than my nickname. Maybe this won’t be the case forever. Thank you all for your words both consolatory and advisory, I will take them all to heart and use them to make myself a person of whom my grandmother would be proud.",86,367,0.97
1770,Not enough info,"Lots and lots of drama here. I'm from a small town, moved to our states main university. I'd been with my HS ex since I was 13 and even tried to let him live with me while I went to school but that didn't work and I kicked him out. He moved back home and got a job with literally the only catering company in a 100 mile radius of our home town of 2000 people. 

I have since met the most amazing guy in the history of the world. He's doing his pediatrics residency at our schools hospital, he's stunning looking, he's a devout Christian and he's built like a Greek statue. We are enaged and I'm so thrilled because our relationship feels like ""home"" wherever we are. 

My sisters graduation party is Saturday. Of course I want to bring my fiancé. My parents adore him and have met him many times so there's no issue there. But like I said, my HS ex will be there working for the caterer (the only caterer...small town life). I'm freaked out because he's already telling our friends he's going to do ""something stupid"" if I show up with a new guy.

Here's the thing, ex's life is somewhat on track and I want the best for him. Derek has a black belt in BJJ and would literally strangle my ex since he's so fat and out of shape, but I don't want to put him in that position either. I don't want any drama to impede my sister's party. There's a whole lot of reasons for Derek not to come.

But I also can't live my life for my ex so my default is in a perfect world, your future husband comes to your sisters graduation party and I want him to be there.

Would I bee the asshole if I bring him knowing in advance my ex is likely to do something stupid?",45,33,0.88
1771,Asshole,"**Edit: Okay, I am the asshole. I accept that.**

**However, I have seen no convincing arguments about why Josh doesn't deserve to know before getting married, and everyone here has just disregarded his feelings out of hatred for my actions (fair enough).**

**Given that, I don't regret my actions, and will do it again if she doesn't tell her future partners before getting married. I am an asshole, but a necessary asshole.**

-----------------------------

My sister (30) is engaged to a guy (33), let's call him Josh. Josh is a very well established guy, very nice to my sister and our family, does a lot for us.

Josh and my sister announced their engagement a couple of months ago at a family dinner. Obviously everyone celebrates at the news and has a great night.... Except for me.

I took my sister aside  later in the night and asked her if she had told him about her ""past"". My sister went through an extremely ""sex positive"" phase in college and slept with easily over 100 guys (we're twins btw, so always been close). She said it didn't matter, it was the past, etc. Fair enough, it shouldn't matter, but I think Josh deserves to know this before he marries my sister. Not every man is comfortable with marrying someone with such an extensive list of past sexual partners.

So anyway I tell her if she doesn't tell him, I will. I give her a month. She doesn't tell him. Meanwhile they're going full steam ahead planning the wedding. I give her one last chance, a few more weeks to come clean, she doesn't.

So I told Josh all I knew about her sexual past. He thanks me, but doesn't take the news well. Apparantly my sister has been presenting herself as a sexually-shy kind of girl. (**edit: she lied and said he was her third sexual partner**). Completely blindsided him.

He's put the wedding on hold and hasn't spoken to my sister for several days. Says he needs time alone to think.

As you can imagine, everyone in my family is blaming me for ruining my sister's wedding (I guess I kind of did). Josh's family is kind of neutral, though they're obviously offering Josh emotional support and thanking me for my honesty.

1774,Everyone Sucks,"I have two young children. For years I’ve been on track for a VP position at my job. Last summer, my boss told me that my attendance was a concern since coming back from maternity leave & I was in jeopardy of not being chosen for the position.

&#x200B;

After this convo, I told my husband that I need us to start splitting the time being taking off for our children. He agreed that we should and took the day off the next time there was an issue. But since then any time a child gets sick or daycare is closed he rattles off the many things people are counting on him for and marches out the door.

&#x200B;

In Nov. my boss told me that they are hiring someone else for the position because they need someone who can be fully focused on the job. I’m devastated but I understand.

&#x200B;

Last week the person they hired to fill the position gave her notice. I was approached by my boss again, who said that my name came up for filling the position but they want to know if I have things better situated. Our son is at a preschool now (located between both jobs) so I say yes although our daughter is at the same place.

&#x200B;

I don’t want to lose this opportunity. I’m thinking of telling our childcare providers that from now on they need to call dad first and only call me if they can’t get in touch with him. Both places ONLY call me. Also, from now on I want to just leave the house and go to work if there’s an issue (ex. If daycare messages to say their closed, just leaving for work without the kids and telling my husband via text/call that he has to figure it out).

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I did this? I’ll drop them off as I normally would, but from now on any mid-day pickups or cancellations, I’d force my husband to take by not making myself available.

&#x200B;

NOTE- I only take time off for the kids. Part of why so much time is missed is because if a child is sick they have to be out until they are symptom-free for 24 hours (strictly enforced). Also If the daycare owner (only adult) is sick or has to close due to an emergency then we don't have childcare. We don't have family or friends to take them, and our area has extremely long wait lists for other centers (our daughter is on a list and our son got into preschool after a five-month wait). Also, I take my children to all of their ""well visit"" appointments and there are several with an infant.

&#x200B;

OTHER NOTE- My job is more mobile than my husbands.  I'm a graphic designer. When I’m home with the kids I can still usually get work done. My husband can't work from home and works an hour away from the kids. I'm 15 minutes away. Also, we both work FT, but his salary is almost double mine. This promotion would raise my income significantly but he would still make more than me.",87,125,0.92

1778,Everyone Sucks,"Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

On Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

But then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

When we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

The logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: ""Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!

My sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

By the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.

I'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.

&#x200B;

**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",8006,29673,0.86

1781,Not the A-hole,"  I have a friend, Sarah, who has always wanted kids. She loves her niblings and always spoils them but recently she's had a 'baby craze' and wants her own. Except, she's not in a relationship. So it seems obvious right? If you want a kid but you're not married go get a sperm donor or adopt. She doesn't want to adopt because she wants the kids to be hers biologically. She also doesn't want a sperm donor because, in her words, she wants her kids to be attractive. 

&#x200B;

  Here's for some reason where I come in. Yesterday she proposes to me that \*I\* should be the donor. She says it's better because she knows me and because I'm attractive (no, not a humble brag, we both have blue eyes and she wants the kid to have blue eyes too). I feel... uneasy about this for multiple reasons. First I don't think I can live w/ myself knowing the kid is biologically mine but I can't raise him. Also there is something about the whole ""I want my kid to be attractive/have blue eyes"" that strikes me wrong, it feels like eugenics honestly. 

&#x200B;

  I tell her I'm not comfortable with donating my sperm and she completely FLIPPED, as in started hysterically crying and throwing anything she can reach at me. I think she expected me to agree. I went home and my brother said it would make her happy if she had my kid and I should've just sucked it up and donated since it won't affect me in any way. I just told him if he's so sympathetic he's practically a clone of me and can go donate his sperm. My friend is making me type this post right now because he doesn't know what to think. Am i the asshole for not donating sperm to my friend and denying her the right to have attractive kids? It's not like there's no other guys with blue eyes, jesus.",667,2942,0.93
1782,Not the A-hole,"I was born in the UK but was raised by fundamentalist Muslim parents. Everything was ‘dirty’ or ‘vulgar’... I wasn’t even allowed to watch films like The Mummy because of the vague sex references and kissing scenes. I was forced to wear a hijab at 8 years old. I only took It off when I went to uni. Denim was haram. drinking coke was haram according to them. Things like eastenders growing up was totally out of the question even as a teenager. I do want to totally defend my religion though and say that my parents were CRAZY. They imposed rules that were *not* Islamic and unfortunately I just got stuck with crazy. 

As soon as I was old enough to go to uni, I begged and begged them to let me leave home and they relented on the condition I room with my cousin. I did as they asked, but unbeknown to them my cousin was no longer a Muslim and I slowly began to come out of my shell and finally discovered real life for the first time. I felt like Kimmy Schmidt! I met my future husband at uni and lost my virginity to him (without being married) and fell in love with him, HARD. I basically ran away, (helped by my male cousins) who really really went over and beyond for me and who have still kept my location secret from my parents. 

We’ve been together for over 15 years now and are raising two ridiculously happy kids, I get to have a dog (haram in Islam), and my life is as close to perfect as I’ll ever get. The other day I was talking to my husband about our circumstances in getting together and I said to him - ‘I wish I had more sexual experience before I met you so I could be better in bed for you’ ... because our sex life is FANTASTIC now but in the early days boy oh boy did I feel like a hell bound whore. I used to lay there like a fish because I genuinely didn’t know what to do. my husband took the comment really well and understood I wasn’t expressing dissatisfaction, but I made the comment again later to my friend when we met up for drinks and the topic drifted to my childhood (it’s Ramadan and she was asking questions about it) and how I still feel awkward and ‘dirty’ about sex related stuff. I suppose I am just lamenting the young adulthood I was deprived of but I really wouldn’t change anything. She couldn’t believe I had told my husband, and she laughed and told me I was a brave dickhead who shouldn’t have said anything to him. She didn’t mean to,  but now I feel awful.

1783,Not the A-hole,"My Aunt and her kids were at my parent's house when me and my cat were there too (i generally dont take him with me but he is friends with their yorkshire terrier and it was their ""playdate""). 

At first everything was fine. The kid (9yo) played with my cat and the dog, then there was dinner and the cat and dog both went to take a nap.

I told her she couldn't play with them right now because both are tired from excitement and would be cranky. The kid ignored me and went for my cat anyway so I physically caught her and told her a firm ""no"". 

The Aunt got mad that I ""tell her kid what to do"", that it is not my place to correct *her* kid etc and that it would be fine. I warned that my cat could lose his patience and scratch or bite her if disturbed. She said it would be fine because the kid played rough with it before so why would it happen now? And to just stop being mean and let her play with the cat.

Soon enough the kid took the cat into her arms and started to ""dance"" with it. My kitty didnt seem to be in any pain but he DID seem very annoyed and I saw his ears go flat and he started to wiggle.

I told her to let him go. She only looked at me and ran away with him as fast as she could. I basically said ""fuck it"", Im not chasing after her, I warned her and my cat was not in pain so I decided to let it go and wait for her to come back crying with a scratch or a bite mark.

Would you know it, exactly that happened. Minutes passed and she is back, without the cat (I saw it casually stroll into the hallway after her and start to bath himself, smugly) and crying horribly with a long scratches on her hand where she was holding him.

Aunt was mad of course, started saying something about rabies (which, come on, really?? Rabies? In an indoor housecat?) And stormed out soon after.

My parents arent exactly on her side but more on the kids side (she's just a kid, he could scratch her eye or bite her throat! She was a brat but you shouldve prevented that as an adult) but I believe in learning from experience. You ignore advice, annoy the cat and get scratched? You learn to never do it again.

1785,Not the A-hole,"So my partner let’s call him Blake went on a boat trip a few months back and came back telling me all these stories about his trip. I noticed with all these stories this one girl was always mentioned. I thought nothing of it until she was being mentioned and talked about all the time. I started getting a suspicion that he could have liked this girl but I kept that to myself 

I couple months past and I didn’t hear any more about her. Until for some reason she came up in conversation. I said in a joking way “oh yea when you first got back you wouldn’t shut up about her” he then admitted to me that he had some feeling for her. It made me upset but he went on the trip towards the beginning of the relationship and this girl lived in another country. So I just let it go. 

Now Blake has gotten a new job and he’s been working there for the past month. He really enjoys it and I'm super happy for him. But Recently I have been hearing about this girl who he works with quite a bit. She sounds like a cool person but for some reason just didn’t like her. Then I began to hear about her all the time. I’ve heard about her almost every day for the past couple weeks and it’s starting to make me upset.  We had to discuss cheat and we agreed that we would never cheat and just end things. This was a genuine conversation. I trust him and I know he would never do such a thing. Blake is aware that I don’t like her and he knows that when he talks about her I get annoyed but just last night he was meant to come over to my house at around 5 and he didn’t show he texted me an hour later telling me that he’s just with his mate getting food. So I thought he’d be here in 30 minutes or so. 2 hours go by and he finally shows up. He knew I was annoyed I asked him who he was with. He was with his mate and the girl. I feel wrong to being that jealous girlfriend who doesn’t allow him to hang out with another girl. It’s just the sad thought in the back of my mind. So please tell me if I’m an asshole and that I should just let it go 
My apologies if my grammar is shit



Update: 
I realised I didn’t explain this but he has many girl-friends and I’m totally cool with him chilling with them. it was  just how this particular girl was being mentions all the time which got to me. I have I talk with him last night about how I feel about the whole situation and I think I was looking at it in the wrong way. On the boat trip with the girl he explained that he was small area with only about 50 people and limit areas to go in. It just happened. I understand how it was the beginning of the relationship and he still could of been confused with how he actually felt about me. Which is totally fine. And I think that the girl at his work is just a really cool person.

Last year was kind of a roller coaster ride for me as I've experienced two relationship break ups. Ever since my last break up, I've been active on a few dating apps. Being on casual dates has been my weekend agenda for almost every single week.

&#x200B;

Two months ago, I was matched with a 22-year-old girl, M. We began talking, went on for dates, and she even stayed over at my place for several times now. She is a part time student, currently in her final year in business law and she's also running an F&B business. I knew something was odd whenever she refused to show or let me follow her on Instagram claiming that she's ""not longer on the app"". One day I found out that she was indeed still on Instagram - and she has a boyfriend of 4 years! I was devastated and confronted her immediately however she claimed that it has been on/off relationship. She claimed that she was ""secretly hoping that I'll find out the truth cause she doesn't know to tell me without ticking me off"". They were doing a long-distance relationship.

&#x200B;

Since then I knew I couldn't really trust her entirely but I continued seeing her despite all that. Fast forward to a month ago, her boyfriend finally flew over to come see her. She didn't tell me that he was back though. I managed to find out the details from friends only after he's been back for two days. Just last week, she told me that she loves me but couldn't leave her boyfriend cause apparently he plays a big role in her business, she even admitted to be a ""very practical person"". I then suggested the idea of one last date - it was a childish attempt to make her choose me. We went for a fancy dinner, had drinks and we slept together as well. At the end of the day I asked her if I made her change her mind. She teared up, thanked me for planning and doing so much for her but she couldn't say yes to me. That supposed last date turned out to be one of the many dates cause we subsequently went out a few more times, and still seeing/sleeping with one another.

Question is, AITA for hanging on? Should I move on or continue seeing her?",93,79,0.67
1788,Not the A-hole,"Just over a year ago, one of the most important people in my life, my Grandma, passed away very unexpectedly and very quickly. She was the youngest of 8 siblings and the only one nobody had any issues with so a LOT of family was travelling from out of town, most of which I’d never met. 

I was the only grandchild to speak at her funeral, and it was a spontaneous decision. I improvised, told some funny stories and how much of a hole Grandma would leave. And I ended it with ‘best April’s fools joke you ever pulled’. She passed away on April 1. My immediate family, Grandpa included, understood the humour, and know Grandma would’ve too, but my extended family did not. 

These people hardly knew my Grandma, never came to visit, hardly ever reached out. I saw her at least once a week, she raised me as much as my parents did, and while she never outwardly showed favouritism I was the favourite grandchild (and there are six of us, with six great grandchildren too). None of them stood up and said anything honouring the amazing woman we lost. I wanted to give everyone a break and make people smile because Grandma HATED crying. 

Those who found it offensive practically turned on me, people I don’t even know, saying how disrespectful and inappropriate I was. My family (as in my Mum, Dad, brother and Grandpa) all backed me, as well as my godparents and their family who had just as much of a place in my Grandma’s life as we did. But no, according to the multitude of cousins and aunts and uncles that thought I was disrespectful, I’m demon spawn who jokes about death.

AITA?",24,76,0.95
1789,Not the A-hole,"My parents adopted a border collie 2 years ago after doing plenty of research on the breed, exercise requirements etc (the dog doesn't suit them but that's a whole other topic). 

They're going abroad for 3 weeks at the end of May and have asked me to help with walking the dog while they're away. No big deal, I've done it plenty of times before, and they have a dog walker out twice a week to take him out when dad is working (mum doesn't work, but also can't be arsed to take the dog out). However, the dog is used to 4 walks a day, each of which roughly 90 minutes and it will be my gran who is house-sitting and being in her 80s cannot walk the dog due to him being too strong. 

I've said to my parents i'm happy to help out so love spending time with him, but I'm a shift worker switching between 13 hour day shifts and 13 hour night shifts so can only walk him on my days off, which is reasonable. I followed this up by saying the dog walker could come more often to alleviate the pressure from me having to do it everyday (I have my own home, family and 5 horses to look after, plus a full time job) which was met with a positive reaction. 

I've been told today that they won't be getting a dog walker in on any extra days as it would be too much money, leaving the dog to only be walked by myself and possibly my uncle, although he also works full time and has a family, so it will likely be left to me. 

I'm obviously not happy about this as I don't feel it's fair for the dog to go from 4 walks a day to one, or even none when I'm working if my uncle cannot take him out. To make matters even worse they've spent a lot of money on this holiday, bragging about going to see Cher in Vegas and going to casinos etc. They can afford a dog walker, they just don't see it as a necessary when they expect me to do it all.

Sorry it's so long, but I feel detail would be helpful when judging if ITA.",18,33,0.88
1790,Not the A-hole,"We were together for 2 years prior. We had talked about if we wanted to break up before and specifically decided not to. The night I left for bootcamp she had dinner with me and my family and we all talked about the future. She talked about moving where ever I was stationed after I was finished with my schooling, all smiles. It would basically be one full year of LDR and then together again (She has this journaling job for a website, which means she could work from anywhere, digital nomad if you will). Anyways, tears come down we kiss goodbye and say that mystical L word and I'm off to MEPS.

Fast forward about two weeks into bootcamp I was FINALLY able to send out letters, well I guess 2 weeks was 2 long, because I heard back from everyone except my... lovely sea monster... Every week I sent her a letter as if nothing was wrong (I didn't want to offend her in case something was wrong and she couldn't send a letter), fast forward to the end of bootcamp, mom and stepdad are at my graduation, she's not. They said they hadn't heard from her since I left. Go to school, get my phone back and have notifications from everyone except her. Nothing. I post to Instagram she doesn't like it. (But didn't block me?)

Anyways, school ends and I get my first shipment and location and I couldn't exactly post it on SM yet (Military shit), so I just put on SM that I am leaving for a shipment so I won't be able to contact anyone, that's when I get my first text and call.. I ignored it, I wanted to focus on my mission. It was a VERY short mission literally like 12 weeks. Got back and that's when I started getting many calls..... I just turned off my phone at the point.

fast forward to now about 2 months her friends are calling me out on SM and texting me calling me a dick for not responding to her. I don't care at this point. No one has said anything about an emergency or if she lost her phone or something. she knew the address. She had her phone or Internet access the whole time (posted on SM). Am I being an asshole for not giving her the time of day?

EDIT: I have news. Some good, some bad. Good news she's getting the help she needs, we aren't together anymore, but I will remain in her life as much as possible, we have smiles. Bad news, the ghosting was real and intentional and she had every intention to do so from the beginning of when I told her I was joining the military. She said she thought that I needed the support and didn't want my last few months as a civilian being sad or heart broken or upsetting. So. I don't really know what to think. I told her I didn't like being ghosted, but most of the conversation was about her though so not a whole lot on the topic, I didn't want to make her feel like she was being interrogated... 

Anyways, LSS she didn't want to hurt me in person I guess rather in distance, which I don't agree with, but I understand. She said she's seeing someone about it and isn't dating anyone else, never was about someone else. I hope her journey well, and I hope all that's left are smiles between us as friends. I also hope her next boyfriend doesn't join the military.",133,466,0.95
1791,Not the A-hole,"This is a weird one and it's causing more conflict than it's worth. 

Basically I work in admin for a construction company. I worked hard for the company for 3 years and then I got the ok to work from home whilst maintaining the same salary. (£45,000) a year. 
They hired another admin to work in the office and paid her the same wage. She took care of the rotas, accounts and finances. My only specific job was to cross reference the ""clocking in"" reports and staff meant to be on duty and log any sickness or unauthorised absence. 

This literally takes a minute. Like I honestly only have to cross reference the clocking in sheets with who was meant to be on shift which is an automatic function on the computer and then click the names of those who haven't clocked in and it sends them an automated email as to why they haven't clocked in. 

I can't remember a time I spent more than 5 minutes doing work on any given day. 

My gf knew I worked from home and what my company was. She works 70+ hours a week in mental health and only comes out with like £18,000 a year. 

We moved in together and after a few weeks she asked why I wasn't working. I told her I was, and said what I had to do each day. She said ""over 40k a year for 5 minutes work?!"" And then asked how I don't get sick of sitting around all day playing Xbox. I told her that if you can get away with getting paid a lot for doing nothing, why wouldn't you and she said wasn't I a bit afraid of what to do after as I was getting no experience. She felt I'd lied to her when I said I worked from home and the fact that I'm perfectly happy to do nothing all day worries her as she thought I was like minded in my motivation like she is. 

I can understand she works very hard so it's a bitter pill to swallow. She says I led her on when I said what I did for work, which is true because my true role is not exactly impressive. She also said I'm dishonest because my work have no idea - the company I worked for sold into a bigger chain and they kept me on the payroll but I've never communicated with them, I'm not even sure they know they employ me and the only job I get told to do (via automated message) is to check the clocking in. 
Gf says it's a red flag that I live this lie and am taking advantage of a fluke mistake and that she is disappointed in me. 

AITA here? 

**Tl;Dr** GF mad that I told her I worked full time from home when in fact I've gotten away with doing virtually nothing due to a flaw in the payroll and I earn over £40k a year for playing Xbox and sleeping.


Edit - she isn't really mad that I don't work much, just that I would relate to her hard work and in reality, I had no clue. Also, she thinks that they will end up firing me eventually and then I'd have no reference, skills or experience.",37,30,0.98

1793,Everyone Sucks,"Trying to keep this under the word limit. Let me know if you need info. 

I got married & one bridesmaid was pregnant at my wedding. Due the same day. 

A few months later my other bridesmaid, B gets engaged & asks me to be a bridesmaid the same day. A few weeks later I find out I’m pregnant. I tell B and tell her when I’m due, she assures me there’s no way she’s getting married in such a short time and nothing will change, she still wants me to be a bridesmaid. 

A week later B calls me and tells me they’ve booked a venue, it’s 3 weeks after I’m due. I tell her if it’s too much stress I’ll back out of being a bridesmaid, she assures me it’s not as I would have already had the baby & that we’ve both been through this with my wedding so we know how to make it work. 

2 days later I get a text, she tells me having me pregnant & then with a baby is to much stress for her and she can’t make it work. I’m devastated, but tell her I understand, it’s her day. She tells me she still wants me to say a speech and be involved with dress shopping, planning etc and I of course say I’m happy to be involved. 

B sends me a text and asks me if she can ask my sister to be a bridesmaid in my place, she wants someone who looks like me standing up there with her and she’s the next best thing. 

Before I respond I spend about 20 mins crying my eyes out. I’m being replaced with my sister and I don’t know if it’s the pregnancy hormones but I can’t stop crying. 
By the time I calm down, I check my phone and B says she has already asked my sister, who has accepted. I call my sister crying and she says she’s only accepted because it was awkward but she understands why I’m upset. She says she’ll leave it between me and B to figure out. 

I call B and tell her I’m upset about all of this, I don’t want her having my sister as a bridesmaid. I feel like I’m being replaced by my sister when I could be a bridesmaid but she didn’t want me to. Her and my sister aren’t close and I’m hurt that she would kick me out to replace me with someone who shouldn’t mean as much to her as I do.

She goes off her head at me, starts screaming that I don’t understand how stressful it is planning a wedding or having a pregnant bridesmaid (exfuckingscuseme). She tells me I’m selfish and should be honored that she wanted someone who looks like me standing in my place. 
I tell her she’s an insensitive bitch and can go fuck herself. We haven’t spoken since. 

My sister isn’t going to be a bridesmaid as she’s on my side. I have two other friends who have called me selfish for the stress I’ve put B under. They’ve told me I’m only behaving like this because of pregnancy hormones & I wouldn’t be so upset if I weren’t pregnant. I disagreed and now they’ve both stopped talking to me. 
Im no longer invited to the wedding. Friendship over.

1795,Not the A-hole,"Anyways, I made my boyfriend fishsticks for dinner. He wanted it. i love fish but hate the smell of fish sticks. And the texture of the breading. (No shame if you like that stuff, hell i love coleslaw and tons of people don't. Different strokes.)  Also, he likes them extra crispy on all sides so i have to flip them a lot. I cant find my tongs (i think he lost them somehow?) so its a pain in the ass (and fingertips). So it was like 40 minutes of flipping fishsticks. He fell asleep. I woke him up when it was done. He said he was going to eat in a few minutes. I woke him up again, cause i didnt want it to go to waste or for him to sleep without dinner, and he got cranky and said he was getting up and i was a broken record bitching at him. I gently reminded him about dinner and he said he wasnt hungry anymore.

I packed his lunch for tomorrow. Nothing special, sandwiches and whatnot. Ive been thinking about taking the sandwiches out of his lunch box (and eating them. They're good sandwiches) and just putting these fishsticks in there. I feel bad cause these were very specific sandwiches that he wanted and he wouldnt really notice til he went to eat that it was cold fishsticks. But i also kinda feel like it's fair. I made him food that I dont like (so i cooked myself a seperate dinner) and i dont wanna just throw it away.

The other idea i had was switching the lunchmeat in his sandwiches out with the fishsticks so he wouldnt know until he started eating but that seemed to evil.

For background, in the past few weeks i can name 5 times he didnt eat the dinner i prepared even though they were things he liked. Im kinda getting annoyed. We have different tastes in food and since he works more, i cook more.. But i also have stopped making some of my favorite foods cause he doesnt like them.",67,158,0.96
1796,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys. 23/M here. Back in 2010, when I was in high school, I became interested in bitcoin and bought about $75 worth. Fast forward to today and... well it's worth quite a bit more. I've cashed out back in 2017 on most of it- about $12M worth after taxes. (I have about $2M still in bitcoin and plan on cashing out if the price spikes again).

I was in college when I decided to liquidate most of it. I felt on top of the world, but still wanted to graduate (I graduate this quarter), and on top of that, lead a fairly normal life. I've heard about how peoples' lives change because of the lottery, for example. Because of this, I have not told anyone about my investment gain. Not my mom, girlfriend, or any friends. I even keep a facade of being poor. I've grown up like that, and figured any big change in spending, etc. would raise some eyebrows. 

I met my girlfriend at the beginning of 2018, right after cashing out. We've been going out for over a year now. I plan on telling her whenever we move in together, but for now, she does not know.

1797,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory throwaway. 29M here, ex-wife is 28F and we have a 5 year old daughter. So buckle up, here's the deal:

My ex-wife (let's call her Anna) and I finalized our divorce about a year ago, which happened due to infidelity on her part. She was very apologetic, and I do believe that she sincerely regrets her actions deep down, but it was always a complete deal-breaker for me and one that I couldn't really get over. We had been together  for 9 years at this point, and married for 7, and it hurt me like hell.

Anyhow, since I have a pretty high-stress job, my daughter now lives with Anna most of the time, but she comes over for meals twice a week. I have her at my place every other weekend, and we try to have a family dinner together on Sundays if possible to try to establish a sense of normalcy for her. Here's the problem: Anna has been acting pretty inappropriate around me for the past couple of weeks. I'm talking drunk texts at 2 AM, kissing me on the forehead and cheek when we meet, insisting on hugging me, and repeatedly saying that she misses me in conversation. I don't know what spurred this on, but it's just strange.

The final straw was that, last Sunday, my daughter asked me why Anna and I were no longer married, and then said that she ""wishes you and mommy still loved each other so we could be a family together all the time."" Now, this could certainly be an innocent thought on her part, or (what I think is more likely) it could have been planted into her mind by Anna in some way. I talked to Anna about it later, and it quickly devolved into a weird fight. Something really set me off, I got really pissed, and yelled at Anna for what I thought was her inappropriate behavior. She ended up sobbing because she said that it was really hard for her to be a single mother, that she feels super depressed all the time, and that she wishes she could do anything to ""take back her what she did"", and that it's worth it for us to try again to be together because she loves me deep down and believes that I love her despite what's happened. She said that it was horrible of me to get angry with her when she was the one primarily raising our daughter and that she just wishes that things could be ""like they used to"".

That made me feel pretty guilty about yelling at her, because I definitely can't say that I've gotten over her fully. But at the same time, her actions definitely crossed a line given that we're no longer in any kind of relationship. So, reddit, am I the asshole here?",21,31,0.97

I have been wanting to dye my hair for ages, but I've been too scared to do it since I have naturally dark brown hair.

I finally took the first step and bought a beautiful mermaid green dye that happens to match my animal crossing character (I have been living out my dyed hair dreams vicariously through animal crossing), and my roommate and their girlfriend dyed it. It turned out great! It was plenty visible and shone green in the sun.

She has been completely rude to me and my family since we've met her, but that's a story for another time. I posted a picture of me with my new hair on my Instagram story, and I guess she saw it because I immediately got a text saying ""I need you to have regular hair color for my wedding"". There was no ""you look great"" or anything, she just immediately took the opportunity to say my hair doesn't fit in with her ""ideal wedding and family"" and the picture that ""she will cherish forever"".

1802,Not the A-hole," 

This one will be short, so here's some background:

I was abused in a sexual matter by my father my entire childhood until I was \~11 when my parents first had the idea of divorce and separated. (This began when I was a toddler). I kept quiet about this abuse due to me growing up with this, thinking it was normal activity. When I was \~12, I began to learn about puberty and my mother gave me a book on sex and periods, ect. and I began to understand what was going on. About a few months after my understanding, I initially told my grandmother while we were alone watching Dr.Phil, about a girl who was sexually harmed and assaulted (I had wanted to speak up, couldn't find the right approach). She wasn't shocked at all by this, she immediately comforted me. After about 4 minutes of our embrace, she tells me that she has no choice but to tell my mother. Fine, tell her when she comes home. She did.

(This happened about a year ago) I was 21. My mother and I were having a serious conversation. I asked her questions that I probably have asked before. She decided it was time to tell me about some family secrets since I was an adult now. The subject of my father of course came up. She told me about his past (before they were together I presume) I found out that he did cocaine..... and that he has herpes. I immediately lash out on her, infuriated that she never decided to tell me this. Yes, she could have told me when my grandmother told her about the incident, maybe she could have waited until I was sexually active? Maybe could have just taken me to get tested? Nope. I was either 20 or 21 at this point. I have been sexually active since I was 15. 15! I yell at her (paraphrased): ""Do you know what this means?"" ""Do you realize what you've done?"" ""This means that every single one of my previous sexual partners has this, not to mention myself!"" ""How could you do this to me?"" I then began to bring up her awful past and how she went back to him AFTER I had told her about this. I yelled ""I fucking hate you!"" I then stormed off to my room, moved my dresser in front of the door, and bawled my eyes out the rest of the night.

I still regret doing this, I am bothered by it because I just recently remembered it. I did get checked and did not have herpes, I'm not sure which kind he has. A lot of the details are blurry, and I'm not certain on exactly what was said.",28,49,0.93

1805,Everyone Sucks,"So the story starts out in one of my classes, we are working on an essay about describing the process of doing something. You can choose any topic you want eg how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

This is where the interesting part happens, one of my friends in class was asking for good ideas for his paper. a few suggestions are made but then a female student says he should do his essay on how to grow teeth. you might be wondering why this is a big deal, this friend of mine had an accident a few years back and lost some teeth that he has yet to get fixed.

This is where i may have fucked up, I get quite heated in this moment knowing that he can’t just grow his teeth back. I know that this probably was not my place to jump in but it was an in the moment decision and i said “maybe you should do yours on how to lose weight”. 

Nobody in the class said a word after she insulted him for something he can not change but when I insult her back over something she can, everyone flips their shit at me. Every female in class was attacking me for saying what I said and demanded I apologize. I just kept my head down and focused on my work.

What do you guys think? My thought on the matter is that he could have defended himself but I could see in his eyes he was really crushed by what she said, he was just in shock and couldn’t respond. So it most likely was not my place to jump into the conversation but I think the fact that people are more defensive of a person because they are female is a little unfair. Also for anyone saying this isn’t a gender thing, it clearly was, the defense that most of people used to defend her was that “You don’t talk about a woman’s weight”. She can change her weight, he can’t change his teeth.

TLDR: Female said good friend of mine had bad teeth, i retaliated for him by saying she was overweight.",63,89,0.86

1807,Everyone Sucks,"My wife and I have been married for 7 years and we’ve always talked about wanting kids. We’re  both 29 years old and started trying to conceive about a year ago but have been unsuccessful. We recently decided to get checked out by a fertility specialist and opted to have extensive genetic testing done. The genetic counselor said there isn’t a reason they can point to as for why we haven’t conceived yet, but the bad news is that we are both carriers of a genetic disease that could cause our children to go blind. The risk of having a blind child is about 25% with each pregnancy. 

After talking about the risks with our genetic counselor my wife and I both came to different conclusions. She still wants to experience pregnancy and childbirth and is okay with taking the 25% chance. I’m not.

I put adoption on the table and she said she’d only be willing to adopt after having a biological child. She says donor sperm isn’t an option because she wants to have *my* kids and that I’m taking that option away from her over a “small” risk. 

Two night ago we had really bad fight over it. Hurtful things were said by both of us. During the fight I said that pregnancy is hard and most people suffer through it so It’s not like she’s experiencing a great loss. She can keep her flat stomach and not have to suffer through 9 months of sickness. I told her that her mindset is negative. She disagreed with that and said she see’s nothing to be positive about. She called me a coward for wanting to let my kids be fathered by a donor. I responded that of course she’s never going to see the positive in the situation because she’s 100% negative, just like all of her pregnancy tests were the last year and how they always will be. 

That’s the line that caused her to start sobbing and leave the house. She packed a bag and told me she was going to stay with her sister and that she’d call me when she was ready to talk. She’s been gone for two nights now. It will be three if she doesn’t come back tonight.  I don’t want to extend the olive branch and call her first because I’m still pissed. 

I don’t know if this post is even a question or a cry for help at this point. 
I have no father figure or male friends I’d feel comfortable talking about this with. Instead I’m asking strangers on reddit  because I’m drunk and at rock bottom. Tonight will be the third night alone in my house drinking by myself and going to bed alone and that terrifies me. Things were completely different a week ago. This sucks.

I had all the points i have earned divided by the possible points i could have earned to receive an A Which is great so I didnt have to take the final.   

I received an email from him telling me ""As per the syllabus, you have earned an A grade in the course. Your superlative performance relieves you from taking the final in the course as scheduled.""

A  friend of mine has a relative who was the victim of a horrible crime about 30 years  ago.  The man plead guilty to his charges to avoid the death penalty  and was sentenced 30 years to life.  He's up for parole soon.  My friend  has been (electronically) passing around a petition to deny his parole.   I didn't sign it.  I was hoping to avoid talking about it with my  friend but today she asked me point blank if I had signed.  I told her  no.  She asked if I was going to and I told her I didn't think I would.

I  tried to explain that I believe incarceration should be rehabilitative  and not punitive, that hating someone can't be enough to keep them in  jail forever, after the man had served his time, but I know I sounded  like a huge asshole so I just stopped talking.  The fact is, while his crime was horrific, I don't know that I  believe he should be denied parole and I can't sign something I don't  believe.  I also couldn't lie to my friend about it (and I *really* wanted to).

She  started to cry and asked me to leave, so I did.  She may never speak to  me again.  I feel really really scummy for upsetting her like that.

1815,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I've posed this question to a few of my friends and it can be fairly recognizable. So, I've been donating whole blood for a few years now (not religiously, but still often enough), but recently moved to one of only 2 cities in my country that allows for paid plasma donation. It doesn't pay much but they allow you to donate weekly. Since I'm a student in a very competitive and demanding program I haven't been able to hold a part time job and this has been a really helpful way to cover my groceries and some of my utilities each month. 

The reason I feel like an asshole is that I have a very rare blood type (not quite O- but very close) and because I am donating plasma on a regular basis I can't donate whole blood unless I wait 2 months between donating plasma and whole blood, and then another 2 months before I can give plasma again. The whole blood I was donating before could be used for blood transfusion in case of emergency, while plasma collected by this specific agency is not purchased or used by hospitals within my country. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding plasma donation since the plasma collected isn't being used locally but instead shipped overseas to be sold, and because most people are choosing to be paid rather than to donate the amount of plasma and blood available locally is falling. They are now considering banning the exchange of money for plasma altogether. 

I know I'm not an asshole for choosing to donate at all and I know I ultimately have the right to decide what to do with my body fluids, but I've been feeling incredibly selfish and overall opinion of plasma selling is quite mixed to almost negative locally. Some of my friends who also donate blood in my original hometown expressed that it is pretty gross to pay locals for blood products but to ship them elsewhere, and that I shouldn't be supporting the practice. I do have a student loan so I wouldn't starve or be homeless if I didn't get this money but it HAS made a difference in my budget. 

TLDR: I'm a healthy donor with a rare blood type who frequently donated his blood, but have now taken the opportunity to be paid instead while knowing that my donation isn't being used to benefit anyone but is instead being sold abroad for profit. Opinions have been very divided and I feel like an ass.


So AITA because I'm choosing to profit from blood I have been otherwise regularly donating?",29,41,0.9
1816,Not the A-hole,"Hi there,

So it took me a while to find somewhere to live in the city I’m in, but eventually I found a great place with a yard for my dog. The place is rented to me by a coworker which has been great, I have awesome access to him if anything ever comes up.

So I can’t afford this 2br house on my own, so I found a roommate. The first guy lived there for a year and eventually moved to month to month rent because I knew he was trying to buy a house soon. I took responsibility of the lease.

When he moved out I found another roommate. She was supposed to pay first month, last month, and deposit (nearly $3k). I told her she could spread that out over the first three months. Well she paid two of the three but never the third, but I could tell she wasn’t well off and didn’t make an impact on the house much so I didn’t mind having the whole deposit in my name. I didn’t really bring it up again.

So cut forward to now, I just renewed the lease (she did not sign anything, I’m basically sub-letting) and I got a job opportunity out of state. I told my landlord and he said he’s fine with ending the lease, or my roommate can take it over.

Well now she’s FREAKING OUT because she can’t afford first+last+deposit, and she “can’t move.” But I figure I had cut her a break by not making her pay that or sign the lease up front (she never asked) and I gave her a full month heads up to move out.

So, did I do something wrong? AITA?",56,36,0.93

Yesterday morning, a few of my coworkers we're discussing this individual and asking management how they should speak to her. Even management was a little confused, so, overhearing this I decided I would simply approach this individual and ask them as kindly as I could.

I simply asked ""Hey, (Name) is it cool if I ask you a personal question?""

When they confirmed, I asked ""What are your preferred pronouns?""

This sparked them to rage quite a bit, so I explained the situation that had happened that morning. This caused them to grow even angrier and they left the building.

This morning my boss chewed me out saying what I did was stupid, disrespectful, and appalling.

My boss calmed down when I explained my reasoning and my exact phrasing, but she was still very angry. She explained that this individual is in fact biologically female and not transgender at all. She simply has a hormone issue that causes her to appear male.

1820,Not the A-hole,"So in my(24f) free time I do freelance work. About 3 months ago my client hired me due to a mentor referral. I’m in charge of storyboarding and the animatic. Last month he hired two animators. I recognize one of them due to her blocking me on Twitter awhile ago. She didn’t know it was me since I don’t use my real name on that account. She blocked me cause I said “it’s stupid to think male artists can’t be trusted” on her anti-Attack on Titan thread. Completely unrelated to our project.  

We’ve been working together for a few weeks. She’s very chill and kinda funny. We talked about movies and cartoons during our off hours. I found out she’s a college student. Over the weekend she asked for everyone’s socials so she could follow us. I gave her my Instagram. I completely forgot that my insta links to my twitter. She stopped answering my emails/calls and has the other animator ask me questions for her. 

At first this wasn’t a problem, tho it delayed work a bit. But then I would get retweets saying I’m a Nazi and racist on my art posts, and then blocked. I wanted to see if these situations were related so I asked my friend to check her account. She’s been calling me all sorts of names and -ists to her followers. Saying I tricked her and tried to convert her to the alt right. 

My thing is it’s easy to be blacklisted in the industry, especially through Twitter, even when the allegations are wrong. Since she’s not even acknowledging my messages, I told my client about her recent attitude. He paid her for the work she already did and fired her. She has deleted her original tweets about me. So now she tweets about how much of a bitch I am for telling her business and that she needed this job for rent and tuition next semester. There’s a video of her crying. Her followers have stopped calling me a Nazi also, just random comments saying I’m a misogynist or creepy. 

Maybe I acted rash? The tweets don’t hurt my feelings or anything. She’s 19, but I don’t want to risk my future over this.

1823,Asshole,"My partner has decided on a new hair colour that she will go ahead with at the salon tomorrow. She showed me a picture around a month ago and asked if I liked it, I said no. She told me the following day she was booking an appointment to get the exact same colour as the picture. I told her I didn't like it and stated why. My reason was it was extreme and it reminded me of a rebellious teenage youth going through a phase and it would not suit her at all. Myself and my partner are almost 30 years old and have been together for 5 years. We have a son and we both work professional jobs and the hair colour is fairly extreme. She's going from a beautiful brunette to red and orange.

 I would never tell my partner what she could or could not do but I've told her numerous times I may not be happy with certain decisions she makes. Of the two of us I am the more level headed. I plan and think things through whereas she jumps head first into almost everything and she would agree.

My partner has stated before that she feels stuck in a rut at work. She doesn't like her job but I think it's mainly because a lot of her friends (ex colleagues) without children and at home responsibilities have moved into other roles across the country and she feels she has been left behind.  I asked her if that is why she is doing something so extreme to sort of stand out among the crowd and she said no. 

Fast forward to today and the conversation came up again after she reminded me of her appointment. I said to my partner I do not like the hair. Do not be upset with me when you have it and I do not like it. She accused me of being nasty and we argued a little. I told my partner I don't believe she will suit that hair colour and that I think she's quite selfish for telling me she doesn't care what I think about it she's doing it.

She had our son (I am a step parent but I consider him my own) when she was 19 years old so missed out on a lot of her youth and I believe she's trying to recapture some of it certain ways. We've argued before about me being boring because I don't like to go out to nightclubs and drink excessively like I did 8 - 10 years ago when I was a teenager. I have explained to her I'm over all of that and clubs are full of kids that I just don't want to be around. My mother was a serious alcoholic so I avoid alcohol now after going through depression and drinking heavily myself. This is getting kind of off topic so I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

1824,Asshole,"I am a high school senior at the moment, and my uncle has offered to plan me a graduation party and hold it at his house. I was super grateful for this, and that weekend, he and his family went out to lunch with my family after church and planned the party. The date of the party came up, and we realized that the day of graduation wouldn't work due to graduation scheduling, so we discussed doing it the day after, which was my sisters birthday. She was asked if it was okay to do on her birthday for two or three hours, and she said okay. We continued to plan the rest of the details of the party, which would include a celebration of my sisters birthday, and finished up lunch. He sent out invitations 2 days later.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My sister, two days after discussing the plans and after invitations had gone out, brought up that she did not want the party on her birthday. My dad talked with her about it, and the essence of the conversation was that she wanted her one day out of the year for herself to be selfish, and didn't want anything to be about me on that day, and that she had changed her mind about it. She said that she was never given the chance to say her piece on it, which both my uncle and I refute, as there were not only multiple pauses in the conversation to speak up, we asked her if it was alright. Anyways, let's run under the assumption that we didn't ask her if it was alright. My dad said that she could have said something within the next two days and now that invitations were out it was too little too late. Then my dad said he needed a moment to collect his thoughts and that we needed to talk it out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My sister asked me to ask my uncle to move the party, but I told her that she would have to do it if she wanted it done. We talked for a while with her pestering me to do it, and I eventually just left. We were talking in circles and she didn't want to seem to get out of them. Anyways, she ended up texting my uncle after further conversation with my dad, with my dad reaching out as well. My uncle told her it wasn't ideal and that her birthday would be just as celebrated, and that day was really the best day to do the graduation party on. My sister asked me to text him and push him more, but honestly, I just don't want to. First off, he was nice enough to open his home to my graduation party. Secondly, she literally could have said something for 48 hours, but chose not to until the worst possible time.

&#x200B;

She also never communicated to me the significance of her birthday. However, she signified to me in front of our mother (who my sister doesn't like) that she didn't want to do anything much for her birthday this year, but it turns out that was only so that my mom didn't get involved with the planning.

1825,Not the A-hole,"Title is confusing and English isn't my first language so here's the context and explanation:

I (17F) live in Germany and as a part of a project for young immigrants I'm part of this group of other girls and a mentor. We learn about German culture, visit museums etc etc. I'm from an European country and the other girls from an Asian country (this is kind of relevant I think). Our mentor is obviously German. She's in her twenties, super liberal, left leaning, etc etc. She's nice and all that. 

Well, some time ago we visited this place with other groups and their mentors. In one group there was this 18yo guy from Afghanistan. Right at the beginning he didn't give me a good vibe (he yelled out ""we're in Afghanistan"" when the tour guide said ""welcome to Germany"") but I decided to just ignore it, no big deal.

However, during the rest of the tour he kept making many comments about how girls are supposed to stay at home to clean the house, about how our ideas were stupid, and once straight up insulted this other girl. The guy's mentor told him ""we're in Germany"" every time he made some comments like that and he just laughed crudely and shook his head.  (This sounds super random but we were at a AI thing and had to make up robots and some of them were gendered etc etc. Don't want to ramble too much.)

Obviously the atmosphere was really heavy, uncomfortable and awkward. At the end, when my group got together and we talked about it, our mentor said the only thing she didn't like was the fact that the other mentor kept calling the other kid to attention. She said that the guy was new in Germany and comes from a different culture with different values so we should respect that. Now, all the girls in my group looked super uncomfortable and I was kind of mad, but no one said anything because we didn't want to be controversial or whatever (the mentor told me using the expression ""migrant crisis"" for a project was problematic so yeah.)

When my group went alone to the station we started discussing it (after the mentor left) and we three agreed that the guy was an asshole and was making us uncomfortable.

I just think that, if the guy is here long enough to know how to say stuff like that about women in German, he's been here long enough to understand how things work here. Let's be honest, any other guy would've said that, he'd get immediately shut down. I don't think this behaviour should be forgiven, accepted and pretty much ignored just because the guy comes from a different culture. Especially when he's a legal adult.

But, I dunno. I'm not a raging feminist or anything, but this kind of mentality shouldn't exist in a country like Germany. If we get mad at men for spreading their legs while sitting on the bus then I think we can also get mad about *this.*

So, am I the asshole for not being understanding of this guy's situation or do I have the right to be grumpy and mad about this?",62,54,0.89

Me and my husband have a one year old daughter. We've been together for 6 years and married for 2 years. 

He moved out of his parents home when he was 16 because his dad was away with work 5 days a week and his mom is neglectful and from what I was told it was yelling from the time he got home to when he went to sleep for his whole childhood. Not good circumstances and he was almost taken into family care when the mom up and left for a year when he was 14. 

Now that's all in the past and neither have reached out to each other in years. Jump to 2018 and his father passed away suddenly in a work related accident. Him and his brother had a really hard time dealing with all that comes with sudden loss in addition to trying not to argue too much with the mom. (She starts fights with anyone she can every time I've ever seen her which has been about twice a year from 2012-2018). 

I am civil with her even though I'm furious that she doesn't acknowledge that her only job as a SAHM was to raise them to be happy, successful people and instead made both their childhoods miserable and left their actual raising to family members, pastors, and my family (for my husband at least). I've never confronted her about the past issues but it all happened before we got together so it's really not my place. My husband has given up trying to make amends.

Now come back to early 2019. Our daughter turned one this year and so far has had two (uninvited) visits with her paternal grandma. My family really took my husband in once we started dating and all we heard from his family is that his mom was an awful mom and the other family members wouldn't take him in for fear that the mom would start harassing them. 

My husband doesn't want any contact with his mother. Before our daughter was born she would message and ask how we were once or twice a year. But now that our daughters turned one shes trying to come to our house every week for uninvited and unwanted visits. This has been bothering my husband a lot and yesterday she came to our house and I just didn't answer the door. 

My husband says that she can't decide to not be a mom and then when it's time for fun parties and pictures decide to be a grandma but I'm torn.

For instance, we were with a friend playing cards and she saw a video of a child getting hit by a car in his front yard that went into excruciating detail about his injuries (paraplegic, brain damage etc.). It was extremely depressing and kind of put a damper on the night. I told her that I was sorry but that I didn't want to see things like this anymore, because it effects my mood. I know I'm staying willfully ignorant to the harsh realities of the world, but I've accepted that I am not a saint. 

It came up again last night when she saw a headline about young girl getting kidnapped in Mexico, that also went into detail. As soon as she read the headline I said no thanks and that I don't think she should read it either. She started reading out loud anyway and I said that I was really sorry but I didn't want to hear about it. She kept reading anyway and so I left the room. Argument ensued.

I notice a guy and a girl to my right with the guy towering up close and personal to the girl while she was essentially with her back to a wall. I first thought they were a couple because the guy kept leaning down and whispering to her and they were far too close for strangers, even when packed together in a rush-hour subway train.

Then the girl suddenly shouts out, ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" and people turn to see what's happening. The guy doesn't back off so I think maybe they're having a lover's quarrel. Then she struggles against the guy, who's now holding her by her wrists. She finally screams, ""I DON'T KNOW YOU, LET ME GO!"" and the guy loudly tells her to, ""SHUT THE HELL UP!""

Since I'm standing directly behind the guy, watching the situation like everyone else, she immediately makes eye contact with me and her eyes are staring straight at me for help. I look away and do nothing. To be honest, whatever this was, I didn't want to get into the middle of it.

I see the yellow-tape/string thing that passengers can press for emergency assistance and I press that. At the next station, the doors open, the speaker system says the train will be stopping temporarily while they investigate a situation, and by that time I had already stepped out of the car. The girl runs out of the train in tears, and the guy says, ""Come on, I was just playing,"" but he stays on the car and doesn't follow her.

I'm already fast-walking away but the girl angrily yells out at me. She says, ""WHY DIDN'T YOU HELP ME?"" I just look at her for a second, then I turn around and walk away.

My goal is to take care of myself and the people around me. I'm not rich, and neither is my family. If I die, they're going to be in really rough shape. The risk of helping a stranger isn't worth the risk to me, or my family.

1832,Asshole,"I'm 34F, husband is 35M. Husband is the bread winner in our family, he's an engineer. We have two kids (3 + 6 year old boys) He has been at the same company for 7 years and he's decided to move on. We both want to move from California and he's getting sick of his job anyway.

So last month he took a couple weeks off and flew out to the east coast to interview at a bunch of different engineering firms. He has a very unique skillset and is very much so in demand in his industry. Now I knew he would be interviewing at a couple companies in the south but I didn't think that much of it, I figured he would go there and nope out once he saw how backwards it is down there.

Well you can see where this is going. He got an offer at a firm in Atlanta and he would be making almost twice as much. He told me he wants to take it and my heart just sunk. We're obviously both very liberal, and the idea of moving out to Trump country and raising our kids in a racist, ultra religious and super conservative place makes me shudder. I told him my concerns but he insisted that I would really like Atlanta, and he offered to take me there (just us) to visit to try and convince me. I told him no, this is out of the question, we will not be moving to the deep south, period, end of story. My friends and parents also think he's insane for wanting to move our family there. 

My husband is extremely pissed at me and thinks I'm being unreasonable. I told him surely he can find another company elsewhere and get a similar offer. I don't like that he's using the fact that he's the bread winner to try and uproot us somewhere I don't want to live. I can't imagine our kids growing up in a place with such prejudice, and the lack of diversity (something I like about where we live in California) is also a huge problem too. Never mind how unhealthy and poorly educated Georgia is too.

I’ve been here with her every step of the way, and I haven’t left the hospital in days. Recently, she has started asking me to call her nurse every 10-15 minutes because she wants pain medication. At first I called the nurse because I knew she was in pain; however, the nurses started telling me the times of all of her doses so that I would not have to call them away from other patients. Because of this, I have started telling my mom that I won’t call the nurse if it isn’t time for her medicine. Now she is telling my grandmother (her mother) that I am not taking care of her and that I do not care about her because I won’t call the nurse in. She has even gone as far as to lie about other things to get me to call the nurse. So far she has lied about: her bed being wet, her staples coming out, her IVs coming out, and a couple of other things. Am I the asshole for telling her I won’t call the nurse?

1837,Asshole,"Context: I'm talking about when two people--or one person and a pair of airpods--get into a confined or quiet space (elevators, airplane, etc.) with other people and start or continue a LOUD dialogue between themselves. It doesn't matter what it's about. And I'm not talking about normal conversation volume, these people are desperate to be heard from the fucking moon. I just have a pet peeve about rude, selfish narcissists who think they're so fucking interesting that everyone around is *dying* to hear how ""omg, did y'all hear what A said bout B behind C's back?!"" or whatever the conversation is about. 

So lately I've just been innocently chiming into these conversation as if I think they're talking to me directly. It's actually pretty amusing when I inject my two cents into the middle of a conversation. Usually I just get like ""WTF is this creep doing"" looks and then they shut up, but I have been called an asshole for butting into a private conversation, to which I usually just smile and say something like ""oh, you weren't shouting so we all could hear?""

1838,Not the A-hole,"I've been married for 25 years to a man with a hyper-religious family. I'm an atheist, but never discussed this and gamely went along to their church, bowed my head in prayer at each meal, went to religious lectures, listened to anti-abortion talk, etc. (my husband is an agnostic and studiously avoids religious discussions while visiting them). I have always known that I didn't meet the standards of my MIL. When I first met her, the very first thing she asked me when we were alone was: ""So, do you know why Mike stopped dating Cindy?"" (Cindy = husband's previous long-term girlfriend who was more to MIL's liking). We aborted a non-viable fetus, but were forced to lie about it (""It was a miscarriage."") and I endured cross-examinations because MIL became suspicious. She gave me a sermon about how a co-worker accepted her handicapped child as a precious gift from God, and what a saint that mother was, and that women who don't want to have such a child are monsters. After we had two more children, I was a bit more accepted, but because our children don't attend church, the religious talks became more urgent and our children are being pressured to believe  (to the point of having the bible read to them for hours).

During the previous election cycle, I curiously asked parents-in-law why they saw Donald Trump as a better candidate than Hillary Clinton. MIL replied that they would rather vote for Satan himself than for HC. There was no argument and no further discussion. That answer simply broke the camel's back: By equating a political candidate with their religion's worst character, they had instrumentalized their faith to a non-acceptable degree in my eyes (I didn't realize then that this is the modus operandi for many evangelical Trump followers). After 24 years of swallowing my distaste for the sake of fake peace and reluctantly traveling to see them, I dug in my heels and quit visiting the in-laws (they live a plane ride away). Husband and kids go twice or three times a year, including Christmas. I stay home, at peace without Fox News and attacks against my country (I'm not a native-born American). They pretend to believe that I'm too busy to come.

My kids (both teenagers) don't want to visit their grandparents anymore (due to the ultra-conservative opinions and the fact that there is no attempt to connect with them beyond some small talk), but are being forced by my husband who believes that his parents (79 and 81) can die at any time. I now want to honor my children's wishes to stay home with me, but am colliding with my husband who wants his parents to die with the impression that all is well in their family. I think that's b.s. -- how can they not know that it's all a farce? At what point is a son's obligation to ""make the parents happy"" overridden by his children's needs to spend their vacations free of religious pressures?

**EDIT: Lots of thoughtful responses here -- thank you so much for them. I should have mentioned that my in-laws are not mean people who argue or attack; they're generous and verbally loving, but simply too shallow for intellectual debates and thus prefer to uncritically get their talking points from Fox. Because of their fervent faith, they're deathly afraid that their son and grandchildren will go to hell. I don't see them as a-holes, but as hypocrites. But I wonder whether I'm a hypocrite myself by cold-shouldering them.**

**What's really opened my eyes, however, was the criticism aimed at my husband. In trying to be a good son to his aging parents, he appeared to many responders as a less-than-acceptable father and husband. Both the kids and I have commented to him how he turns into a different person the moment he is with his family. When I used to go with him on his visits, he would quit touching me and criticize me for little things, like twiddling my thumbs in church. He wants to appear as the perfect father to his parents and thus angrily hisses at our children to be quiet (when there are even louder cousins present) or to sit in the living room next to his parents as they watch TV. So it's amazing to read how many people here put their fingers right onto this problem.**",105,594,0.93

However, before the girl working the counter could scoop I noticed the guac was slightly brown and looked like it was probably from the night before.

When I asked if I could get fresh guac she responded by stirring the brown guac and almost scooping it right on my burrito. I told her no I don’t want the brown guac. For some reason this really irritated me and I couldn’t bring myself to ask when freshly made guac would be available.

I paid and ate my burrito in the store and typed an email to corporate right then and there. I said how slighted I felt by this girl who obviously didn’t care about her job at all and how she might as well have spat in my face, which I realize now was probably a little harsh.

1842,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR My neighbor cut my overgrown grass for an agreed price, and then cut it again without asking and is charging me. 

Also I apologize about formatting I’m on mobile. 


Hi! I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don’t have a huge yard but it’s definitely pretty big, I’d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn’t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn’t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn’t need to worry about it because it hasn’t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn’t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he’s only going to charge me $50 for it. I let him know that was a bit expensive, and I’ll pay him this time but in the future I’ll cut it myself. I make okay money and I’m a single father, I can afford it but I don’t really have the expendable income to spend on yard work I can do myself. AITA for not wanting to pay him?",14,100,0.92
1843,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (I'll call Anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

After months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. 

A few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""I love you). 

At the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again ""I love you.""

After the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said ""I love you, Anna."" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

1848,Not the A-hole,"So basically I go to a private catholic school in the midwestern United States, so you could guess it to be a pretty conservative environment. I’m a senior and I walked up to one of my freshman friends to hear her talking to her sophomore friend about how she’s sexually active. Sophomore friend had a look of confusion on her face, so I became curious and approached the conversation. This is when the freshman said something about a condom and the sophomore said “Wait, what’s a condom?” This is when I sighed, because even for a catholic conservative school, most people know this much. So I explained what a condom was. Soon after she said,”Well I mean, I don’t even know how babies are made.”  This is when I asked her if she wanted to know and asked that I explain because her mother took her out of middle school to avoid sex education, and homeschooled her for 6th-8th grade. This is when I gave the scientific, biological explanation of “how babies are made”. 

Most of my friends don’t think I did anything wrong, but one friend and one of my siblings thinks I should have honored the family’s wishes. Knowing that the lack of sex education is proven to be a cause for teen pregnancy and STDs, and she was at the age when most people begin to have sex, I believed it be necessary to tell her everything I could. The explanation was educational and scientific, and not vulgar or suggestive in any way. So what do y’all think, AITA?

1852,Not the A-hole,"I have a new work neighbor, let’s call her Polly. She sits in the cube right next to mine.

Polly immediately struck me as having poor social skills. She asked to be my friend on facebook, and when I told her I don’t friend co workers as a general rule she sent me a friend request anyway. I didn’t accept but I looked at her profile and she speaks often about having autism. 

This made sense based on her behavior. A few examples of her odd social approach include:

-telling me unprompted that I should work on my posture 

-putting her bare feet up on her desk (I can smell them)

-taking personal calls often at her desk 

-making insensitive comments about co workers weight and giving them weight loss tips unprompted. 

-constantly comparing our work place to her old job and listing the ways her old job did things better. Her old job had 4X the staff my org does.

-proudly proclaiming she knows she is “odd” after being reprimanded for saying something insensitive to a co worker about her age. 

-Sometimes I leave 15 min early. My boss knows this and does not care. When I do this Polly will point out loudly that I am leaving early and once said “you know union contract says we can’t take our breaks at the end of the day.” I still leave early when I want and can because honestly fuck her. 

Polly interrupts me constantly. She will often interrupt me multiple times in 10 minutes which breaks my concentration while I’m working. I will put in headphones, set my status to do not disturb, this does not deter her. 

So finally one day I said “Polly I really need to focus on my work right now, if you have questions can you email them to me and I’ll get to them when I can?” I thought we were good but the next day she approached me and said “I can tell I was annoying you yesterday.” I said we were fine but sometimes I need to get in the zone.

The final straw was yesterday. I led a project that was recently completed and Polly was complimenting it. She said she admires how graceful I am under stress. I said “thanks I’m not perfect but I appreciate the kind words.” Her response was “yea you do get snippy sometimes but you’re worth it.” 

This offended me more than anything else she’s said or done. I am not snippy because I dared to draw a professional boundary and ask for some space to do my work. I’m a pretty direct and no nonsense professional, I prefer to address things head on rather than being passive aggressive, but I’m not catty or “snippy.”  

I’m considering asking my boss to let me move to a different cubicle. I’m almost positive Polly will take this personally and will ask me why I moved. It almost might make things MORE tense to move but part of me feels like I need to send a message and actions speak louder than words.

I asked what it was about, and it turns out there was this kid at church (whom I did not know of) who needed help with his/her school assignment.
They needed to interview students who went to international school.

 I said no, and they seemed very surprised. They kept going on and on about how we are supposed to help others, how it was a simple request, etc. I told them i personally dont feel comfortable being interviewed, and that there were many other people at church who could take my place. I was arguing (respectfully) with them about how it was my choice whether I wanted to help (isn't it?), and that its not that i was inherently opposed to helping someone. hell, if they asked me to help teach them something like math or whatever I would be down, I just dont like being interviewed and recorded. Now my Dad has went into an utter fit of rage, and I am sitting in my room, completely dumbfounded how it has come to this.

1855,Asshole,"Our daughter (19) is a great kid! She graduated a year early from high school. She is kind-hearted and funny. She is beautiful. She is a talented singer and guitar player. Just a wonderful young lady.

Ever since she was 15 she has been making money playing and singing around town. She is talented.

Her boyfriend of about a year is a farm hand. He cleans stalls and gets in hay. He wanted to be a fireman but failed the aptitude test for the academy. He works and drinks. He is joining the Navy, but the reserves so he doesn’t get deployed. His family is also fundie Christian. He drinks too much and is a bigot and homophobe.

She and the current boyfriend broke up because he was getting nudes from another girl.

She has had one gig in the past year. Singing has not beer a priority. If you want to be a performer, it has to be a passion and she hasn’t shown it.

She was hurt by the breakup. We were happy that it happened and hoped she would find her focus and expand her world. My wife saw that The Voice has auditions in LA and my brother and his wife live in LA very close to where the auditions are. We encouraged my daughter to sign up to audition. She would have something positive and fun to look forward to. I also wanted to (yet again) expose her to something better than the low-class crowd she is spending her time with.

She reconciled with the boyfriend a month ago. We just can’t abide homophobia and don’t want to spend time around him.

Buying a plane ticket to LA is a burden for us. I would have to work OT. Now that she is back with the BF I am not inclined to pay for it. She has not worked on her music for a year. I would support her in her music if it was something she was passionate about and putting her energy into. If she works on her music, gets gigs, and starts performing again, I would fly her out next season to audition.

She works and could buy the ticket herself if it was that important to her, which she has never suggested. She says I am taking this away to punish her for a boyfriend I don’t like. I can’t say she is wrong. 

WIBTA to no longer pay for this trip?

EDIT: OK I hear you and I kind of knew you were right all along. It’s sad that some people are so eager to say you’re a bad parent over things like this. Parenting is hard and when you are in the midst of a scenario you don’t have great perspective.

Few points of clarity.  She has been passionate about singing in the past. Not lately though. And over the past year we have watched her orbit get smaller and her interested focused more on her BF and less on singing. We suggested the LA trip to cheer her up after the break up. We don’t push her to sing. If she doesn’t pursue music that’s fine with us.

1857,No A-holes here,"I'm adamantly childfree. I've never wanted children and I've known this for as long as I can remember.

I guess you can count this as a selfish decision, though I'm not hurting anyone but it's my decision.

My boyfriend and I are planning a big life decision. We've had conversations about children and I thought I made it quite clear that they're not in my future. He's always said that it's way too early for him (he's 27) but refused to give me a clear-cut answer. In the light of this decision, I've asked to have a serious conversation: if he, in any version of the future, sees himself as a family man, we need to break up. 

He's a bit on the spectrum and one particular thing he struggles with is imagining the future. He's not rash or immature by any means, he's good with money and he's very serious about his career but he needs to be faced with an impending decision to make it. So, naturally, he's struggling to make up his mind. He's asking for time, and he's said he loves our childfree life now but can't imagine how life with children would be, so he can't for sure say he doesn't want it.

I don't want to push him but I need him to make a choice ASAP. Also, I'm afraid he may say he's also childfree because our relationship is perfect in any other way - not saying he's going to lie to me, but maybe he may lie to himself out of fear.

So, I got to thinking: what if I could make him 'live out' the parenthood life without obviously having a child? Sadly, he's got no nieces/nephews/friend's children that we may babysit for a day or two to get a taste of the parenting life. I'm still considering this idea but it would be something along the lines of: having to get up early on his days off, refrain from his hobbies, do a larger portion of the chores (\*I know this will probably spark a discussion on here, I don't mean it as a way to 'trick' him into doing my chores too but rather, see what taking additional responsibilities will feel like).

I discussed it with a friend and she said it's very manipulative of me.

1858,No A-holes here,"My wife and I (37) due to a rare genetic condition need to go through IVF if we want to have a second biological child. I don't care if we have a boy or a girl. Doesn't matter either way to me. We could do it naturally, but there would be a great risk to not only the unborn baby, but Mom as well.  Because of the testing that needs to be done on the embryos for the genetic markers (dunno if that the right term) we will not only know if the embryos have the protein that caused the condition in our first child, but also we would know the genders. At least thats what we were told from the Docs. There will be multiple embryos that they have to test, so feasibly it could be all girls, or all boys, or a combo of the two. My concern was that because we will be working with the IVF clinic so much, they might get familiar enough with us where they subconsciously, use an embryo for a gender based on their prior knowledge of us as a couple. To prevent this I suggested flipping a coin to decide the gender if it comes to that. I was told by a few different people that I am being callous and not taking the process seriously enough. My wife doesn't know what to do, but doesn't want someone else, or even herself to ""pick"" the gender. How would I explain to our child that they were the result of a coin flip, but in reality I just the gender of our baby to be as random as possible and not to be decided by a lab tec/doctor/or off the cuff story overheard by the staff.

Background: I completed 3 semesters of college before dropping out due to mental health issues. I moved back in with my parents this January. Right now I’m working 2 part-time jobs and saving money while deciding what to do next.

After I was hired my parents told me that they would buy me a car because sharing my mom’s car wasn’t really an option. She has her own places to go to, you know?

They also told me that I’m responsible for the $200 monthly payment, gas, and any maintenance it might need.

1863,Everyone Sucks,"Am I the asshole?

Hi I haven’t really post in here before but here we go.

My girlfriend (24F) and I (24M) have been together for about five years of which we have lived a lot of our time in share houses or separate places however we have recently moved into an apartment together. I feel like things have been going really well apart from a particular issues we keep coming back to which is that we don’t spend enough quality time together. 

I work full time shift work and study part time on the side, she is a full time student and works a few days ever week. Despite this we do get some opportunities to spend time together however I often feel tired or simply don’t want to go out sometimes. We now have an agreement to make a date every month to go out and do something together which I think is a good thing.

Tonight we had a similar argument which started off about my gaming. I play video games 2-3 times a week for maybe 2-3 hours and I wouldn’t consider myself a heavy gamer. It initially felt like she was trying to control the time I spent gaming which made me feel angry and like I was being spoken to as a child. The argument soon came to the crux of the issue which was her feeling like we don’t spend enough quality time together. To me it seems that We spend a lot of time together however this time isn’t spent doing something like going to dinner or going out but its often just spent talking to one another. I feel like her view on quality time is very different to mine and even somewhat misshapen by movie culture which dictates that a man should take his women out on dates all the time (which I think is a very archaic ideal). 

Although she hasn’t said it, I feel like she wants me to give up gaming when I think the real problem is that she isn’t happy with the time we are spending together. Gaming for me is a strong connection to my friendship group. I also don’t know how to make the time we are spending together more of what she needs. To me, quality time together is irrespective of what you are actually doing at the time but more about the talking, care, consideration, love that you share and show for someone else. I am standing strong in my opinion that my gaming habbits don’t need to change.

1864,Not the A-hole,"I’m really upset with my wife after what she’s done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. So I’m posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

I’ve been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my “high school sweetheart” for well over a decade.

My late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn’t start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

I’ve always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

When I met my current wife she wasn’t comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it’s an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.

Over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she’d bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can’t she accept it’s very important to me?

Long story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.

 I don’t know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?

1867,Not the A-hole,"My dad has always pressured me to get married & have kids, so when I told him I was pregnant, I thought he’d be happy. Instead, he flipped out and kept talking about how my husband and I can’t afford a kid as if we were irresponsible teens. We’re both 30, we’ve been together for 5 years and waited more than 2 years into the marriage before we tried for kids to make sure we were ready. 

My husband may not make as much as my dad, but he’s also 2 decades younger and compared to his age group, he’s actually ahead career wise and earning really good money. 

Since then, my dad’s attitude to my husband has become extremely hostile & disrespectful (they used to be on great terms), and he keeps asking me if I have “enough money to survive”. I keep telling him we have enough and we’re financially responsible, but she just shuts me down & tells me I don’t know how expensive babies are. He’ll send me money unsolicited, with passive aggressive messages implying that he’s saving us from poverty. 

I finally found out the reason why he’s acting that way. I have a cousin with a 1 year old baby who keeps insisting he can’t afford the baby, even on a dual income, and needed financial help. Their baby even sleeps on a mat on the floor of their living room instead of a cot. He has various family members sending him money and buying stuff for his baby. 

I had to quit working due to health reasons, so my husband does make less than what my cousin & his wife makes combined, and my dad knows it. 

The thing is, I’m friends with my cousin’s wife on Facebook and I know they actually have a lot of money for the baby. His wife actually went on a dive trip in a private yacht in the Maldives when the baby was 4 months old. That costs at least $10,000, so there’s no way you can’t afford a cot if you can afford that. 

I thought I should just let me dad see how well my husband is taking care of the family and he’d realize that yes, my husband is financially responsible. 

I gave birth in one of the top private hospitals in our country, and our baby is definitely spoiled since I’ve been splurging on all the best baby products for her. And yes, we can afford a damn cot for her. 

Unfortunately, my dad still hasn’t changed his mind. When he visited me in the hospital after I delivered, he was on his phone the entire time, and the only thing he said to me as soon as my husband left the room was, “Do you need money?”

I’m getting so tired of how he’s treating my husband & I really want to just tell him my cousin is just bullshitting to the entire family to get easy money. Would it be a dick move to expose how full of shit my cousin is by showing my dad his wife’s Facebook posts?

1871,Not the A-hole,"Long story cut really short.  I was a bad kid, born in '87 to a single mother.  I was your prototypical ADHD early 90s kid.  It wasn't an easy childhood.  I found my grandmother dead at 3, was abused by a baby sitter at 4.  Fights at school, (this is all pre Columbine, it was a different time then), I never made it easy on her.  But she returned the favor.  So to say it was rough on both of us, is an understatement.  Speed quickly through the years, she agrees with my step dad to kick me out at 16.  So I was homeless till about 19 years old.  I grew up real quick, and saw most of the US as a homeless teenager.  

Speed things up some more, about 7 years ago my step dad died.  She tried to solo everything but ended up having a breakdown.  She lost about 100 pounds and laid in bed so long she caused nerves damage to her legs.  Our relationship was never the strongest, but after the death of my step dad I tried to reach out and be there.  She was always snarky and short, she never made me feel wanted, even at this time.  I was trying to start my own family, married and talking about our first son.  My wife and I talked and we decided she would move in with us.  Shes been with us for 2 years.

She is an absolute dismissive jerk to my son.  Shes been that way to my wife.  My son is NOTHING like I was.  Hes sweet and only wants to put a smile on everyone's face.  So last night, my mom was washing dishes, horribly I might add (I always have to rewash), and left a huge pool of water on the ground in front of the sink.  It's simple here, clean up your won mess.  But she won't, she has an insane amount of excuses to get out of work.  And I get it, neuropathy in the legs has to suck.  So I let most of that shit go.  But my son runs around and slips and falls in the water, I hadn't known it was there yet.  My son comes into the living room and asks ""who spilt water on the floor.""

My mom replies with, ""yea, that why you shouldn't run around.""  Small things like this piss me off.  

I interject and ask ""why do you have to be so short with him"", to which she replies all big eyed, ""that wasn't short"".

Listen, I'm not a normal person.  I'm high anxiety and hold a certain amount of resentment for my mother, but I try not to begrudge her to much, as I was a horrible child.  But I feel like I need to defend my child against her, protect her from the stuff she did to me.  Am I the asshole here?

1872,Asshole,"I’m 27 and my boyfriend is 28. We started seriously dating after Christmas, and we really like each other. We are both similar people, have similar interests... it’s awesome! We seriously committed to each other after Christmas (we had met on tinder in October and had a few loose dates where we REALLY liked one another) and basically it’s been amazing since. Like. Really amazing. 

We both decided to introduce one another as significant others to our parents at the start of April. However my boyfriend had the idea to just throw a family bbq at his place (he has a beautiful new place that he’s just bought and is proud of so I kind of totally get why he wanted to do that) and invite both sets of parents over. 

My mom and dad, who are just your average American older couple I guess and his mom and dad, totally hit it off. I mean. They were like best freaking friends who were on a long lost reunion. It turned out my dad and his dad had gone to a BUNCH of the same obscure band shows when they were younger, and my mom and my bf’s mom both are crazy about a weird specific hobby so it kind of turned into this love fest. 

First I thought it was really cute but then yesterday on the phone my mom casually told me that they had met up for drinks, her and my bf’s mom have been on a  shopping excursion together... the thing is my mom and dad are really popular so I don’t get why they need a new set of friends that are my BOYFRIENDS parents.

1874,Not the A-hole,"I (30M) have a twin brother who is getting married in July. I also have a fiancé  (31M) who I am getting married to in October.

The family of my brother's future wife is of a different culture and religion and they come from a country where homosexuality is illegal. She is alright, but her parents are extremely bigoted. *Editing to add we all live in a Western country (not the US) where gay marriage is legal. They are not visiting, they moved here 25 years ago.* 

So in order to avoid any uncomfortable incidents, my brother has asked me if I could act straight on their wedding day. I'm not super flamboyant or anything, but I like showing affection to my boyfriend whenever I feel like it, including in public, and since I'm the best man, I'd be in the spotlight a lot, so they would probably notice it.

Since it came out of nowhere and he caught me unprepared, I said I would do it, but the more I think about it and talk to my boyfriend about it, the less I want to. I saw my family over the weekend and talked to my brother and said I didn't feel comfortable pretending. There will be friends and family at the reception who know I'm gay and who have met my boyfriend, and I think it would feel humiliating ""acting straight"" in front of them. Besides, what if I slip up and call my boyfriend ""my boyfriend"" within earshot, or if I do something automatic, like put my arm around him?

My brother seemed a bit hurt, but my parents and sisters made a huge deal out of it. They think I'm being difficult and that I should at least try to make my brother's wedding day go without any incidents. They're saying that it's just that one day and that I would survive not showing affection to my boyfriend for a few hours. They said I have it easy because I only really have to see them that one day but my brother is marrying into that family. In the end I said that if I have to do this, I'd rather not come at all.

Since then, I've gotten dozens of messages from all of them, asking me to change my mind and trying to convince me it's not such a big deal, but also calling me selfish and a bad brother. My parents have been reserved with insults, but my sisters have both called me an asshole.

I have no idea what the right thing to do is anymore. I feel extremely bad and guilty about all of it. He is my twin brother, my best friend, the one person I've always been closest to. He has always been there when I needed him and I feel horrible about not doing this for him. But I can't help but think what happens in October when I get married. Does he plan on hiding that from his in-laws too? And what if they have children? Will I have to pretend my future husband is my totally straight bro friend every time we see our nephew or niece and the in-laws are there?

1875,Not the A-hole,"So I'm graduating high school in a week and my class, as per usual, is raising money to get the class teacher a gift. There's no way explaining this without some backstory - our teacher has been with us since the start of high school, which was 5 years ago and has been our class teacher (the teacher the class has been entrusted to) for the last 4 of them. I can't even say that she did a somewhat decent job as a teacher (she teaches Literature). Had I not read the books on my own I would never learn anything whatsoever. Also, which is more important, the class' dicipline was shattered - she wrote no absences, no complaints and would even excuses absences without doctor's notes. And all of this, as you all may have guessed by now, backfired really hard, especially the last 2 years. Additionally, all the material from these last 2 years is included in the final exam, which is in 3 weeks. So if most people, including myself, weren't seeing tutors to catch up, the results would be horrible. 

I have never been absent for more than 2 days a year and have always presented a doctor's note in such cases. I have nothing to thank her for - she hasn't done me any favours, nor has she taught me anything or made my life easier for that matter. In fact (I do quite ok in Literature and often find myself arguing with her), she has sometimes given me lower grades on purpose, so there were times when I had to do extra work only to get the note I actually deserve.

Here comes the gift part - every year we raise about 3$ each and get her a coupon for a nice clothes outlet or something similar, but this year it's special - someone decided that we should be raising 18$ each! (I don't actually live in the US, I'm just using USD to give you a better perspective, but where I live 18$ is not that small a sum, especially if you take into account that the minimal wage is 300$.

1886,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few days ago, but I'm still catching flack for it.

Saturday of last week, a group of friends and I got together for a D&D session; we're all making small talk about life, kids, plans, etc. I mention that I haven't gone to see A.E. yet and I want to because spoilers are plentiful and (jokingly) I want to sit and cry in a dark room full of people I don't know.

The guy next to me, a friend of a friend, starts talking to me about how he wants to go, his boys have already been to see it, they loved it, etc. He's a huge comic book nerd and I'm more into my favorite characters over entire universes. We don't dwell on it because the other players start up a conversation about Cosmic Ghost Rider and I was lost.

The game continues, we break for dinner, the guy I'd been talking comes over to me and asks if I have plans for Friday.

I say no, and ask if he needs a babysitter. Which was apparently the really, *really* wrong thing to say.

He goes from cordial to huffy and storms away from me. A few minutes later, I hear him bitching to my friends that I'm a massively stuck-up bitch because I think I'm too good to go see a movie with him. That I'm fat and ugly and pathetic, that he can't believe I'd say something like that to him, like who the fuck tries to find babysitters at D&D night, etc.

My friend A and her husband start explaining that I'm the group's babysitter; I'm an aunt to all their kids and it's normal for them to ask when I'm free so I can hang out with the kids and give the parents a break. A couple other people chime in that I don't look like his type, so why would I assume he was asking me out?

On this note, I'm gonna be honest; he's built. This man is tall and lean and gorgeous. And I am not. I am none of these things. He's a ten, I might be a four.

Nothing seems to appease his hurt feelings that I wasn't picking up on whatever subliminal vibes he was putting out, despite the best efforts of the group to convince him I was being myself and not some conniving bitch out to crush his feelings.

And at this point, it's obvious the mood is dead. We pack up and clean up; the guy takes off and the girl that invited him (who I later found out has a huge crush on him) says I handled it like shit, so it's really my fault he got upset. She rags on me until everything is put away and we're heading out the door.

Sunday morning I checked my phone and found a bunch of missed texts, FB tags, and status updates, and notes in my inbox that I'm a self-centered bitch that ruined D&D night for everyone and made a really good guy feel like shit for putting himself out there. How dare I treat him like that when he's fresh from a divorce? How dare I think I'm too good for him, I deserve to be alone and miserable, etc.

Because I assumed he was doing like all my other friends and asking if I could babysit.

AITA for not assuming he was hitting on me?",86,184,0.94
1887,Not the A-hole,"Whenever my GF's car has any sort of maintenance issue she tries to hold me accountable for finding the issue, fixing it, or taking it to get fixed. When she had an issue with one of her tires a while ago I was the first to notice how low it was and gave her a heads up as she was leaving for work. A day later it was completely flat because she didn't pump air in it (or get it inspected). So I ended up doing it for her. At that time I also decided to buy her PSI gauge and showed her how to use it. This was about the extent of my capabilities and when I started to notice a pattern of other car-related demands I made it very clear that I don't know shit about fixing cars besides the very basics (changing a tire, pumping air, pouring oil, jumps starts). She still insisted that I call her Dad and ask questions or watch youtube videos to learn how. My response was that I'd prefer that a mechanic take care of it and that she could learn to do these things if she wanted.

&#x200B;

Now another tire has a slow leak and needs to be refilled about once a week or two (not entirely sure bc I've never seen it completely flat). She insists that I check the pressure every morning before work and drive it to the gas station to fill the tire as needed (until she gets it fixed/replaced). She says she never noticed the leak before and had to rely on the help of strangers to check the pressure and pump the tire for her.

&#x200B;

I asked why she needed strangers (they're always men btw) to do something that I've taught her how to do already. She claimed that she didn't know how, didn't want to get dirty, and ultimately its a man's responsibility. I told her that as a car owner (man or woman) you should know how do something as basic as pump a tire and change a flat (especially since I showed her how). I told her that it seemed like she was playing the ""Damsel in distress"" role and acting completely helpless on purpose. I also reminded her that she could be stranded one day and may need to know how to do these things instead of relying on the generosity of complete strangers. She replied saying that all of her male friends/family agreed with her and that they were ""real men"" b/c they knew how to take care of a woman.

&#x200B;

I don't really care for the silly, outdated gender role bs and I've made it very clear. On top of that I do plenty of handy work around the house, cook and clean regularly ( I cook more often than she does in fact), and I pay majority of our expenses (including all of the rent). The way I see it, this shouldn't make me any less of a man in her eyes. I also never hold her to lofty standards, or stereotypical expectations just bc she's a woman, but she always seems comfortable doing it to me.

&#x200B;

To settle the issue, I offered again to show her how to use the pump while we were at the gas station this past weekend. She flatly refused..... So now I'm determined not to lift a finger. AITA here?",26,66,0.94
1888,Not the A-hole,"“Are we the assholes” really because my husband made the decision with me.

My father passed away a few months ago and left a pretty sizeable estate behind. The majority went to my sister and me, with an equal amount of money to each grandchild (or so I thought.) 

My kids are grown so I never really thought to reach out about the money because the executor was handling it. My daughter never mentioned it, but she’s always been frugal so I figured she didn’t want to discuss it and had some plan for it.

Recently we had a family meal and my son brought up the inheritance, and my daughter revealed that she had received nothing and didn’t know that any of her cousins or her brother had. It is very clear to us that she was cut from the will because my father always disapproved of my son in law.

My husband and I talked it over and decided to give a portion of our inheritance to our daughter and her husband to match the amount given to the other grandkids. We are still working with a lawyer to figure out the best way to give her the money so the transfer hasn’t actually happened yet, but we will definitely be doing this. Our son is very upset because he feels that this is a gift coming from us, and it is unfair that we are not also giving him money. He feels that since my father chose not to give money to my daughter, that’s the end of it and that any money we give our daughter is now an unfair gift. Are we the assholes for doing this and not giving our son anything?",455,1691,0.96
1889,No A-holes here,"For reference, my daughter is 14. She has always wanted to go to Disney World ever since she was a young kid. Unfortunately, as a single mother, I just haven’t had the time nor the expenses to pay for it. That is until my boss gave me an AMAZING raise last year (+20% salary increase). Since then, I’ve been able to live much more comfortably.

I promised my daughter if her behavior is good and she maintained her good grades (As and Bs) for this semester, I’d take her to Orlando this summer. She’s doing very, very well this semester and is on track for all As.

That is until today, I got a call from her teacher. Apparently, somebody got ahold of the multiple-choice section in her AP World History class and it was spread around some group chat. 20% of the class ended up getting a 100 (the average was in the 70s, even accounting for the huge amount of 100s), so the teacher made everyone who got a 100 take the exam again on the spot. My daughter flunked the second time, which was evidence enough for the teacher to confirm cheating and she got a 0 for the test.

My daughter’s obviously very, very upset about this. Her justification was that she didn’t want to get destroyed by the curve. I asked why didn’t she tell an authority figure about the leaked test and she just bawled and said she didn’t want to be a tattle tale and that she didn’t think this could happen. I told her I’m sorry that it’s happened, but cheating is unacceptable and we will have to cancel the trip to Orlando this summer. I also grounded her for a week.

She was hysterical at this point and just ran to her room crying. I feel really bad about it, but ultimately, she cheated. I don’t know where she got the idea that cheating was okay, but I do feel like I have to send a strong message that it’s not. 14 is plenty mature enough to know cheating is wrong.

AITA for punishing her this way?

Edit: Since I see some arguments in the comments, the class is curved to a B - B+

**EDIT: I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS WASN'T EMPHASIZED ENOUGH SO I'M HOPING BOLDED, CAPITAL LETTERS IS ENOUGH! READ BEFORE COMMENTING.**

 So I had to know whether or not this was a one-time thing or a repeated pattern. I asked my daughter if she ever cheated before and she answered ""not often"". I asked what does ""not often"" means and she said she doesn't generally cheat at all, but if presented with the opportunity, she's not going to turn it down. So this wasn't a one-time lapse of judgment; she's likely done this plenty of other times (I have a feeling I'm getting a trickle-truth answer, too). So sadly, the trip is definitely off the table completely until at least winter break or the following summer. Thank you all for your opinions.",845,1484,0.95
1890,Asshole,"Yesterday, I kicked my brother out of my house and it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. 

My youngest brother has been battling depression for 3 years, it started due to a messy divorce when my brother caught his then wife cheating, they split and they got equal visitation rights over their only son.  The cheating and divorce completely crumbled my brother mentally.  Since the house was in her name, he moved out and needed a place to stay. 

Me, being the oldest of 5 siblings (3 boys and 2 girls) felt like I needed give my brother a place to stay. The first two years were incredibly smooth, he helped around the house with chores, went to therapy, paid some utilities,(didn't need to but he insisted) helped watched my kids, (wife and I managed to do things we thought we couldn't do often because of this) and my 3 kids adored their uncle. (they loved when he brought their cousin over.)

 This changed over the past year, when he lost his rights to equal visitation with his son. His ex-wife managed to made up some BS, that the judge fell for(the system is totally fair). This sent him into even deeper depression, because he absolutely loved his son.  He took an leave of absence from work, and I was completely supportive of him. He started to fall victim to the bottle and I caught him passed out drunk a few times. (thankfully, never when my kids were around)  I offered to pay for him to go to rehab center. He said he would take up the offer and never did.  He didn't go back to work either, and I found out later he quit his job. He started to become lazy around the house.   At first, I tolerated it, but he refused to change his habits nor seek help.  This reached a breaking point, this Saturday, when I caught him passed out drunk while my kids were home.  They were sleeping, but it was completely unacceptable.  

I didn't say anything to him at all about it.   After consulting my parents, wife, and other siblings, I decided to kick him out.  

I confronted him yesterday, and had all of his stuff packed up. I told him he couldn't live here anymore and that he had to leave.  He burst into tears and got angry at me. He told me I was stabbing him in the back too.  

I stayed calm and told him he would be welcome back in open arms if he truly wanted to change and that the moment you put my children in any type of trouble was the limit. He left angry and has since stayed with a friend.  

I was on the verge of tears, the entire time, but I felt like I needed to do this.  I have never had to cut any of my family out of my life like this before. 

When my wife came home with my children from school and they asked where their uncle was, I broke down and cried.    I feel like a huge asshole honestly.",25,40,0.88
1891,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my boyfriend has been best friends with this girl for 2 years, he’s really close to her and even had feelings for her at one point. But he obviously got over her. However recently she told him that she has always had feelings for him and she has always wanted him to fuck her. My boyfriend told her that he had me (we just recently started dating so he hadn’t told her yet) so basically he’s off the market. As a response, she told him that she didn’t care and he should just wait until he gets back to Florida so they could be together (me and him currently live in NYC). He constantly told her no and that he didn’t want her. She then went on to say that she knew him longer, that she’s the better one for him, even if they aren’t dating, that she’s his number 1 girlfriend, when he goes back to Florida, she’s gonna try to take him away from me so he can see how much happier he’ll be with her. She also started coming at my boyfriend every time he tells her no or declines her sexual advances, calling him a fake hoe and that he’s just trying to replace her. I genuinely didn’t care at first but it became an everyday thing and tried to get him to leave me multiple times while being very disrespectful towards me. My boyfriend has tried taking different approaches about it and has even told her that it makes him uncomfortable and angry. Eventually I just told him to drop her and block her if she didn’t stop. He got really upset when I said that and said it would hurt a lot tho to just drop her after everything. Am I the asshole?

Small update: thanks to everyone who reassured me that I wasn’t being overdramatic about this. I sat down with him and told him how I felt and that it had gotten to a point where it was either her or me. He had told me that apparently he had already told her off and blocked her and apparently texted her parents cause she was making threats to rape him so yea.",27,32,0.88
1892,Asshole,"Summary- my bday was months ago and wasn't really celebrated (within my family). Didn't even get a cake, just a 99¢ balloon and a few ""happy birthdays"". Outside of my family, my bf and friends absolutely spoil me. This pisses off my mother royally because I refuse to share my gifts with my wretched siblings. She says and I quote ""without me you wouldn't be alive right now."" Then says I'm being childish for pouting over my lack of celebration. I know I'm a bit too old to get a party but damn, kinda bummed me out that there wasn't a cake. 
So mother stays angry over my ""greediness"" toward my siblings and I explained that it was my friends who spent damn near 300$ treating me, not her. 
-side note she's raised these two siblings into thinking that on someone else's bday they get gifts too. 

So now it's almost their birthdays. Low and behold guess what?? Big party, expensive gifts, friends, cake, the whole shebang!
Brat #1 gets 600$ worth of stuff (that's just one kid) and my mom's showing it all to me.
Brat #2 roughly gets the same 

Brat 1 and 2 aren't even full blooded. Not do I care for them that much. Mother expects me to get them gifts with my minimal wage and even showed me expensive gifts she thought I should get. I plan not to celebrate their birthdays or even tell them happy birthday. They tend to be spoiled brats anyway, so it's not like I'm taking this out on innocent kids.

I just shrug, tell her whatever she wants to hear and go to my room because I'm upset over my lack of celebration. WIBTA if I pointed this out??

Additional info-
Friends and BF found out that my bday wasn't being celebrated, so they celebrated for me. So the excuse about already having people to celebrate with couldn't be used. Plus, birthdays in my family are a big deal. Especially since my last bday was a milestone.




EDIT:
Alright, for me disinterest of my siblings is simple. They've always gotten more attention than me and my full blooded siblings, to the point to where it was ridiculous (their dad would give them incredibly expensive gifts in front of me or my other full blooded siblings) . My mother often left me to take care of them when I was a kid myself because being a mother was tiring.

As they get older they find out I don't have a dad, but they do. Oh boy this is where the bratty part really comes in.  They point out my lack of having a father every chance they get, even laugh about it. At first I figured to just ignore it but this persists and nothing's being done about it. However I let it go bc idrc. 

Half blooded and full blooded siblings are MAJORLY divided in my family. Or they were. My mom would always scream at my Uncle or my Aunt's that she was an only kid and they weren't even real siblings.

When my MIL was here for my post partum period she was horrified that SIL would be getting the kids and agitated to have the will changed. I had a very bad manic episode after my son was born and so I agreed.

Since then I have seen how she behaves with her much younger son (he's 20, my husband is 41) She picks at him constantly, treats him like he's incompetent, and does pretty much everything she can to make him feel useless. He's an amazing kid: kind, diligent, and very smart.

When he's done, he picks me up and we go home. Since we are using just my car (his car is currently broken) we split the gas; one time I'll buy it and the next time he buys it. I was the last one to fill the tank last Thursday morning. 

He had to go out of town and was taking my car on Sunday (3.5hr drive) to see some friends. I was not going to go because it's a long-ass drive and it kills the entire day, I just wanted to stay home. Last minute he begged me to go with him so I ended up giving in and going. The gas I purchased on Thursday was used by the time we got to our friends' place so he filled up for the trip back. When we got back home, the car only had 1/4 tank of gas. 

Fast forward and its Tuesday morning. When we got in the car I remarked that there is only 1/4 tank left so we should get gas before we get on the road. We get to the gas station and get into an argument on who's turn it is to pay. I remind him I filled up on Thursday morning so it's his turn to pay.

It's still his turn to pay for gas. After some brief arguing, he paid for the gas but was very angry with me.

1896,No A-holes here,"My brother, who I have a very strong bond and good relationship with, has been trying for years to get his wife pregnant, all to no avail. It’s believed that he’s sterile, and this saddens him (and me) very greatly. A while ago, they accepted that he is unlikely to ever have biological children, and began looking for a sperm donor. But just recently, they posed a new, unconventional idea to me - that **I** be the donor.

Asking your brother to donate sperm for you might be an odd or even inappropriate request in most circumstances, but ours is a unique one - we are identical twins. We share 100% identical DNA, and thus any child born of my sperm would be related to my brother **every bit as much** as his own child from his own sperm would. This would not be the case with regular brothers, where the baby would be related as a nephew/niece to him. And because of this, the child wouldn’t find out about the “donation” from one of those home DNA tests so many people are taking now - my brother and I both would show up as the father on any DNA test because of our identical DNA.

My brother views having an identical twin as a great stroke of luck in this situation, and an opportunity to be able to have his own children after all. Despite his enthusiasm, I’m not so sure about the whole thing. I haven’t officially declined; I just told him that “I’ll think about it.” I’m married, and just think the whole thing seems a bit weird and “off”.

I don’t even know where to begin since it feels like my life is over as I knew it. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 2 years and in March she thought she saw a message from another girl on my lock screen. I tried to explain that the girl was just a classmate who was joking, not a serious offer. My girlfriend said my explanation sucked and me not taking her concerns seriously had obliterated her trust in me. 

We basically fought non stop in April and she broke up with me last Friday. I’m beside myself. My mom has always been my sounding board so as I was talking with her she asked if she’d like me to call Bailey and try explain things from a neutral perspective. I thought it would be a good idea. 

Well, Bailey basically told my mom it was none of her business and hung up. My mom tried to call her back several times over the weekend but never got any response. After the last call Bailey text me and said “you were pathetic before, having your mom call me makes you an asshole and any chance of us being friends is gone.” 

I texted back “no please understand, she offered and I accepted, I didn’t ask her to do it.” Her response was “well if you couldn’t get any lower BLAMING your mom for your stupidity took you there.” I think she then blocked my number. 

I’m devastated and have so little hope now I don’t what to do. I’m so low I’m lost. Was it an asshole thing to do to allow my mom to call her? I honest to god thought maybe having my perspective presented by a different person might help Bailey see it another way. I meant no disrespect at all.

1902,Not the A-hole,"Gonna try an keep this is short as possible. My husbands ex-wife is extremely difficult to deal with. It’s either her way or no way, zero compromising from her part, has never said sorry in her life, narcissistic etc. I could go on for  days about why co-parenting with her is an extreme challenge, but you get the picture. 

My husband wanted actual set times put in the custody agreement during mediation because she would pull things like “well it says it’s your day, but technically this is morning, so I’ll bring them over when the parade is done” things of that nature. Which ended up backfiring because now, we only get them when he’s not at work on our days. His schedule sucks (paper mill) and his shifts are inconsistent and his schedule changes sometimes on short notice. She hasn’t ever brought this up as an issue as she has multiple babysitters. I am not asked to take them before the babysitters. 

On occasion when her mom would be out of town, or have plans, and her babysitters were busy, she would ask him, to ask me if I could take them. If I wasn’t working I always said yes as I’d like to spend more time with them. (We once had to basically beg her to let me have them on our scheduled weekend when he had to work to participate in a walk for breast cancer in honor of his mom who is a survivor) 

So she asks me to take them on a specific day a couple weeks ahead of time whether my husband works or not, I say yes, and I take off work,The week of this day she needs me (Saturday of our scheduled weekend) my husband finds out he has to work. Which normally means I wouldn’t get them, but she and I had made plans for me to take them regardless because she had plans. 

Then last minute she decides I’m not taking them because she doesn’t “need” me. (She ended up still going out so she must have had her mom or a sitter to watch them) 

I was fucking irate. I had taken off work during a busy time, and made plans to take them to the beach, which they knew about and we were all looking forward to it. When he complained to her about her going back on what we discussed her only response was “you’re working, so that’s what the papers say”. Meanwhile I’ve taken them for her at 10pm while he’s at work so she can go to the bar multiple times, and at 6am when he’s at work because she had to work and her mom was out of town, so clearly I’m only good enough when she’s desperate. 

After that incident I told my husband never again. Until she wants to change the custody agreement to take out actually times, and just let us have our weekend/2 weekdays regardless if he has to work or not, I will no longer help her out as a last resort. I would like more time with them, but I also don’t want to be used as a 4th person on the list babysitter, because she wants to go out drinking.

I said to my husband ‘why is this in the wash I haven’t worn it?’ and he said ‘oh Kayla borrowed it the other night, you don’t mind do you’, I was like, ‘yeah, actually I do mind’. This isn’t a cheap dress, and also I just really don’t want my stepdaughter wearing my clothes? He was like ‘oh sorry I didn’t think you’d mind’ and he was annoyed at me that I was bothered by it. She walked in the room and asked what was going on and I was like to her ‘Can you ask me next time you want to borrow something because a lot of my clothes are quite expensive and I don’t want them getting ruined’ and she was like okay...

Then she walked off and my husband was like, ‘chill out it’s just a dress, if she ruined it I would have bought you a new one.’ I was like ‘that’s not really the point but ok whatever’ 

AITA for not wanting her to wear my clothes?",590,2214,0.94
1904,Not the A-hole,"My friend asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, and for the past few months I've been helping out with the wedding planning and been very excited. Until my friend told me she had bad news. One of the groomsmen had to drop out of the wedding, and since there was no one else available unfortunately I couldn't be in the bridal party either. I didn't understand why, and the bride said because the number of bridesmaids and groomsmen would be uneven and would cause problems with ceremony logistics and photos. 

I told her that plenty of weddings have uneven numbers and it's easy to plan for that. She cried and told me that she had this whole plan for having the bridal party walk down the aisle in pairs and pose for photos in pairs so we wouldn't be able to do that with an extra bridesmaid. She said she didn't mean to hurt me but that someone had to be dropped and since I was her most recent friend in the bridal party, she had picked me. She assured me she still wanted me to to come to the bachelorette party and wedding and said this didn't mean she didn't want to be friends anymore. I told her what she did really hurt me and that I'd have to think about it.

AITA for not wanting to go to the wedding anymore? Being kicked out of the bridal party really hurt me, and the bride is acting like this was completely unavoidable and that she had no choice. I think insisting on pairing off the bridal party like that is ridiculous. None of us are actual couples and it makes me feel like she cares more about some how the wedding looks than our friendship.

I don't want to come off as a brat, but I really don't feel comfortable going to the wedding, especially since a lot of people know by now that I was supposed to be a bridesmaid.",298,765,0.96
1905,No A-holes here,"Hi. Made a new throwaway account to post this because I am... wildly conflicted right now.

**Backstory:** My sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \~2yr, together for 5. BIL and I dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. BIL and I have not gotten along since he and sister got together. My sister essentially believes I'm jealous of her for marrying my ""one who got away"" (he is not that), so our relationship has ALSO suffered as a result. This whole situation is already fucked up and yes, I'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.

Recently BIL has begun reaching out to me more frequently. I've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. Last week BIL asked if I would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that I would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. Out of politeness and curiosity, I said sure, thinking I would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.

The book... is about us. I don't know how else to put it. It's a ""domestic thriller"" (so think *Gone Girl, You,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married ""the wrong sister"" and becomes obsessed with his SIL. It's one of the weirdest things I have ever seen. It doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and I don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... Jesus, it's too weird to say. Open a door with me?

Here's how I'm conflicted. People have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. If a stranger handed me this book, I would just say ""not my taste"" and move on. That said, this is my sister's husband, and I found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that I almost didn't finish it. That ALSO said, this is my sister's husband, and I am afraid, based on the past, that if I tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? And on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, I don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (There are no skin suits but you get it.) And if it IS just a fictional fantasy thriller, I'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after Columbine.

**TLDR: My BIL and I dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and I don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**

**EDIT: Whew. Went to dinner and came back to a lot more replies than when I left. I'm figuring out a way to move forward right now. Thanks to everyone who has commented, I've read them all.**",813,11643,0.95

Yesterday I got pulled over because my dad had failed to put the registration sticker on the license plate. The registration WAS up to date, however the cop that pulled me over told me that my dad would be getting a fixit ticket in the mail. My parents are expecting me to pay whatever administration fees that are owed to the city, because the car would never have left the driveway if I hadn't been using it. I'm leaving for a job soon, and Im planning on just not paying the ticket and letting them deal with it. Am I the asshole for never intending on paying the ticket?

He will chastise other family members for their food habits. He only eats sourdough bread and gives others shit for eating anything but. He doesn't like xyz brand of abc and only likes def brand of abc, therefore we all should use def. It's not founded in reason.

I want to bar him from our family gatherings because of it. But am I the asshole? By the fact of gatherings, we're gonna have food, and it's going to be a shitshow if he's involved. We don't mind his company, just any mention of food awakens this assholery we don't care for.",204,734,0.97
1908,Not the A-hole,"So I live with my brother and with one other roommate. Long story short, my brother lied to both our roommate and I about him going into our roommate's room to rewire Ethernet cables etc without asking. It would have been fine to go in his room if he asked. But to do it without asking and lying about it to our faces, made us very uncomfortable.. 

Fast forward a couple months, I needed to get into the router's settings. I find the password that I had given to everyone had been changed. I reset the password back to its original and I log in to find my brothers computer was listed under priority bandwidth. When we moved in we all agreed to not mess with prioritization and to make all bandwidth equal. So after the lying to our faces and finding out he went and did all this behind our backs we both were fed up. (On a side note I also caught him trying to route my DNS to his raspberry pi - which he technically could monitor all my traffic with) 

The Internet bill is in my name however the modem and router are my brothers.

And me and my roommate are going to let him know that he is welcome to still pay and split the internet 3 ways as we've been doing and he will have no special access to the router and my roommate and I will manage everything. He will not. Since we clearly can't trust my brother.  His other option would be to add his own additional service line to the house.

1910,No A-holes here,"I am a professional...let's just say basketweaver, since I don't want to reaveal identifying information. I make artisan baskets and sell them online and at craft shows. This is how I earn my living and I've been extremely successful at it, earning 6 figure annual net profit. I have a successful youtube channel where I make videos about basket weaving. 

&#x200B;

I have a friend, Barb, who is also a basketweaver. She started basketweaving last year and opened an online shop, but it's really just a side gig, earning $300-500 a month. She has a day job that she'd like to quit in order to weave baskets full time, but her revenue has not grown to the point where that is possible. Barb also has a youtube channel, which has found moderate success thus far. Barb makes very polished videos with lots of whereas mine are much more candid and vloggy. I mention this because it's easy to get the impression that that Barb's is a full-time basketweaver based on her high quality videos. Sometimes we appear in each others videos and our subscribers know we're friends.

&#x200B;

Well recently, very popular youtube basketweaver, Nancy, invited Barb to be in one of her videos. Nancy makes great tutorials on basketweaving, and Barb actually started learning to weave baskets based on these tutorials. Nancy is promoting a weekend retreat workshop she's hosting (with very expensive tickets). In the video Barb talks about how she first started watching Nancy's videos and got to where she is now. And in the video she is very misleading. She implies that she is a full-time basketweaver and makes her living solely from selling the baskets she makes. The video was basically ""look at Barb, she learned from Nancy, and she's a massive succcess now. Buy a ticket to Nancy's event and you can be like her."" This is patently FALSE. 

&#x200B;

I do not know if this was something Barb intentionally lied about, or if Nancy edited the video to be misleading, such as removing any mention of Barb needing a day job. WIBTA if I asked Barb about this, and if she says she willingly presented herself this way, telling her I am disappointed in her for deceiving people and I won't be doing any more videos with her?

1911,Asshole,"Like all AITA posts there is a ton of background in this. I'm separated from my wife and we basically fight to fight over just about everything. I admit up front that I'm so screwed up over the pending divorce I don't know if I do things because they are right or because she wants to do the opposite. As such please be honest with me. 

However it happened, my kids love Sia and her videos on youtube. I was a little shocked to see her video for the song ""Cheap Thrills"" which to my mind features a young girl acting and dancing in an overly sexual manner with two grown men. I did some research and the girl is in fact underage former reality TV star. In fact nearly every Sia video I found features this same girl, some are fairly tame, some (in my opinion) are unquestionably inappropriate. 

I have banned my kids from watching her videos. My soon to be ex told them no problem they could watch all the videos they wanted, including Sia's videos. My counter to this was since i'm paying for their phones and bought their computers, they couldn't take them to their mom's apartment. So now the fight has escalated to level 11 and I was just trying to shield my kids from overly sexualized material. My ex says I am robbing the kids of experience and learning to love music and art and that art is sometimes controversial.

1912,Not the A-hole,"Okay so the background. My US State has an extensive network of State Parks. Some of these are massive, sprawling networks of amazing natureness. Some of these are as simple as super pretty overlooks or fishing spots. If it is a State site, they all have fees - you may either buy an annual pass for \~$70 or pay per day at the site which is generally $6-10 depending on the site.

&#x200B;

I am a photographer, so I frequent alot of these sites very regularly and as such I get great use out of the annual pass.

&#x200B;

Now this story concerns one of the smaller overlook/camp sites. For context it is marked on all of the signs on the highway before you turn in that it is a ""Fee Site"" and again when you turn and finally at the massive gate that tells you to use the self serve pay station (similar to unmanned parking) if you don't have a pass. 

&#x200B;

I stop here alot because in addition to being a good spot to take pictures, it is also a great place to have a snack and have a bathroom break. During these frequent stops, I notice alot of people with out of state plates coming in and blowing by the fee station and using the overlook without paying (the pass is a brightly colored window sticker so it would be obvious if they had the pass). This always irked me but I had never done anything about it until yesterday.

&#x200B;

I had brought my girlfriend with me to shoot pictures around the state, and we had bought some tasty pastries to enjoy at the overlook site before continuing on our journey. Lo and behold  while we are here this massive fifth wheel with out-of-state plates comes in - they clearly stop and read the sign and then continue on. I am not sure why this time was different than all of the other times but I decide I want to say something. My girlfriend says leave it alone, but I would not be before the reddit jury if I had followed this advice.

&#x200B;

Now I decide I do not want to get into a direct confrontation with these people so as I am leaving I roll down my window so I can talk with them as the middle aged couple are setting up to camp here for the night. 

&#x200B;

Me: Hey guys, just a head's up: The ranger here normally makes his rounds at noon (it is 11:45) to check that everyone has paid for the site. (I have absolutely no idea if this is true, I have seen the rangers come before but dont know the schedule)

Woman: Really?!

Guy: Wait, so they really expect me to pay $8 just to stay here, that is insane.

Me: Just letting you know, have a good one.

&#x200B;

I drive away with a shit eating grin because they are obviously going over to pay. My girlfriend says that this was not my concern and I am an asshole for getting involved.

1913,Not the A-hole,"So, to give a little bit of context, my roomate is one of two others living with me in a college-dorm style apartment complex. He has muscular dystrophy, but he has a fair amount of ability to manipulate his hands and move around, though he is confined to an electric wheelchair thing. He has a caregiver that comes and puts him to bed and gets him out in the morning.

So, when we first all moved in things went well. We all helped each other out figuring how to live on our “own.” However, as things started to progress, his caregiver started to become more expecting of us to help him with things, such as throwing away garbage, helping him cook, etc. This was fine at first, but cooking became a chore when we knew he was supposed to be having all his meals meal prepped, and we soon discovered he was not eating the food he was prepared when we started occasionally cooking for him. This ended up getting even worse over time, as he would expect us to help with the smallest things, essentially expecting us to be on-call helpers. This meant he would call and text us, or just sit by our doors and call our name for something as small as getting something out of his backpack for him. After a while, I began to ignore him, as it became a hassle to stop what I was doing multiple times a day to help. Caregiver recently spoke to me saying I’m an asshole for not taking a few minutes out of my day to help. Am I really the asshole for not wanting to take care of my roomate during my “college experience”?

1914,Not the A-hole,"I left for college back in January. My father agreed to sell my gaming rig on Craigslist and give me the money for it when I came home to visit next time. The reason I left it with my dad was because I couldn’t fit it in my car when I left for Florida. Now, this computer had a lot of sentimental value to me (it’s dumb I know), and I expressed this to my dad. So we clean it up, reformat it, and list it. 

A few weeks go by, and my mom gives me a call saying someone was interested in it. So I said alright, go ahead and tell dad as he’s the one selling it on my behalf. She doesn’t tell my dad, and the computer goes unsold apparently. 

It’s summer break now, and I got home. I asked my dad about the money for the computer. He told me he didn’t sell it and instead gave it to my mom. I wasn’t consulted about this. Nobody told me it was just being kept. That’s $700+ I’m missing now. 

So I want my money. I can use it to pay my bills and help me through the summer which was the whole purpose of selling it to begin with. But there’s a problem. 

The family dog just got sick the day before I drove home and now he needs medicine regularly. So now I feel like an ass hole for being upset with my parents for basically scamming me out of $700 because the dog is sick and needs medicine. Don’t get me wrong, I’d much rather them be able to afford medicine for our dog than give me what they owe me. But at the same time, they just spent $600 on a puppy (this was before my dog got sick btw. Puppy WAS NOT a replacement dog) a few weeks ago and a trip to Hawaii prior to that. 

I’ve been seething about it for days and basically grinding my teeth to nubs trying to figure out what to say or what to do about it. I haven’t brought it up since I asked my dad about it, but I don’t know if I even should at this point.

1916,Not the A-hole,"So I hope I'm asking this in the right sub. Don't know for sure if this is a true 'moral dilemma', but here I go.

I'm 25, just graduated and am trying my hand at dating again. Thing is though, I'm balding like a mo-fo and it really wears down my confidence. So a while ago I was looking into some good non-surgical hair replacements and found a hairdresser that offers 'hair systems' near me. I ended up going and now I once again have a glorious mane. Even though I didn't grow it out of my own head, it gave me the needed confidence boost to put myself out there.

Sure enough, I soon hit it off with a nice woman. I clicked with her from day 1. We have some similar interests, we are likeminded, she is my type, I seem(ed) to be hers and we're both out and looking.

So around the third date she commented on my hair. Told me I looked great, had a nice hairstyle, and so on. Because I remain pretty insecure about my hair loss, I missed the opportunity to 'playfully' reveal my secret and tell her about my - what essentially is a - hair piece. I felt like we still hadn't completely connected personality-wise and this would be a tipping point for her breaking things off or keeping things going. Idk, I just didn't have the heart to say it then and postponed it.

A few dates later we ended up sleeping together and she surprisingly liked it kinda rough. What happened next you just can't make up... So in the rush of the moment, with her on top, she freaking pulled the hair piece from my head... The glue that is used for hair systems is usually very strong, and doesn't admit defeat to even the most extreme conditions (sweating your ass off on a hot day, while exercising, in heavy rain, you name it), but I guess she just pulled hard enough for it to come loose (at least partially).

What ensued was about the most awkward chain of events I have ever experienced. She sorta sat there looking at a piece of my hair hanging loosely from my skull. Seeing my embarassment she fled into the bathroom to get dressed, left me there with my boner like a candle in the wind. She didn't really comment on the hair, just said ""well, this is kinda awkward"" and made up some excuse to gome home early. 

She then spent about a week ghosting me. When I finally got ahold of her over the phone to offer my apologies and to explain what had happened, she told me swiftly that I had betrayed her trust, by not telling her about my balding head. Even though she had explicitly complimented me on my hairdo. She told me she didn't really care about the baldness but the dishonesty could not be overlooked. And that if I saw it fit not to tell her about something 'as simple as this', she wondered what else I would omit. She took it pretty bad obviously and thus we broke up (if we ever were a thing in the first place).

Do I suck for not telling her? Should I come clean to all my future dates about my lack of a hairy scalp?",200,267,0.94

He agreed.

This morning he texted me while at work and said “we’re getting a puppy” and I totally lost my shit (I haven’t said anything to him yet, I try not to fly off the handle when I’m mad or upset so thought we’d talk about it when he gets home). He says he’s going to house train any puppy we get but he works 10-12 hours a day so I know it’s going to fall in my lap and I just don’t have time to handle that.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years now. We started dating in college and now we share an apartment and both have great paying jobs in the new city we moved to. She is smart, beautiful, funny, and an overall a great person to be around. I can definitely see myself spending the rest of my life with her and we have talks about marriage and other future plans. Something to note is that this is the first relationship that both of us has been in. We were each other's first in everything (first kiss, first relationship, lost our virginities to each other, etc.).

Last week, I picked her up from a doctor's appointment and we made small talk about it, with me asking her how it went and her describing common check ups procedures; nothing out of the ordinary. But what surprised me was that she casually said she got an STI screening. I asked her why she needed to do that as we've only been with each other and she said that she just wants to make sure. I guess I was a little miffed about this as I thought this implied that I could've cheated on her and gave her something, but the more I thought about it I guess it makes sense. If she did have something harmful, I would want her to know as soon as possible as a lot of illnesses are easier to treat during the early stages rather than when symptoms arise. 

Fast forward a few days later and we're just relaxing at home and somehow the topic shifted to future things like children and marriage. I forgot how it came up, but I said that I would want a paternity test on my future children regardless of who I was with just to make sure that this really was my child and I don't have a nasty surprise down the road. My girlfriend became visibly annoyed, saying that I that was unreasonable of me and that by wanting that, I was showing I didn't trust her if she was to bear my child. I was pretty taken aback by this and I pointed out her STI tests to her, but she said that that was different. But when I asked her how it was different, she wasn't able to really come up with anything that really sounded reasonable to me. I remember her being pretty annoyed at me for the rest of that night.

We get over annoyances with each other pretty fast, so it's not like either of us are holding grudges over the other, but I've been thinking about this for a while and I just can't see the reasoning in her argument.

1925,Not the A-hole,"I moved into my current house on a 3 month sublease with my roommates. 4 total, including me. We split rent by the square footage of each bedroom.

Roommate A paid $850, I paid $900 and roommates B (a couple) paid $2000.

After the sublease ended, one of roommates B had to move back home (for reasons I don't want to get into) so remaining roommate B asked that roommate A and I pay higher rent to help offset costs for him. Roommate A and I agreed, although their portion of the rent technically wasn't out responsibility. At this point we are all on a month to month agreement with our landlord.

Everything was fine on our month to month agreement until roommate A got a new job, put in their 30 days and moved out. We were able to find another roommate and roommate B said that we could charge the new person more rent, in order for my rent to go back down to the normal price of $900 that I moved in for. Well, after looking at our roommate cost sheet, I see that roommate B tried to keep an extra portion of what the new roommate paid. He said ""WiFi went up for a few months but (he) decided to not charge us the increase"", and he wanted to keep the extra money to cover that. I told him that he can't make decisions for money that wasn't his, and that he should have just charged us the increase in WiFi. He gave me an ultimatum that I could either let him keep the extra money for the month, and start my $900 rate next month, or take the money now but he would be upset. So I took the money now, bringing my back to $900.

I told the roommate that I was going to move out at the end of June, but because he is upset at me he is making it unbearable to live with him and being super cold and rude to me. WIBTA if I changed my move out date and gave him 30 days notice, even though I don't think he'll be able to afford it?

**tldr: My roommate tried to keep extra rent money from me, that we agreed would go to me, citing ""I didn't charge you for the increase in wifi"". And now I want to give 30 days on our month to month lease, even though I don't think he can afford it.**

I dropped out of  college to work full time ever since I found out he was coming. My kids mom, I'm gonna call her Bertha cuz why not, quit her job right once she found out she was pregnant then didnt work for a year and a half (8 months of which she lived in my house and paid for nothing whatsoever. 

In the past two months she has seen her son about 48 hours even tho she is allowed visitation twice a week.

1927,No A-holes here,"For background I'm a 25 year old woman living in Southern California. A guy at my gym who I've talked to briefly a couple times asked me to coffee and walk around an art festival.  At first it was going really well, he was cute, funny and we were really hitting it off.  I even let him put his arm around my waist.  After a couple hours of eating, drinking and walking around we both needed to use the bathroom, and got in an annoying long line for the public bathroom in the park.  I think he needed to go for a while, but for some reason didn't want to say anything.  Well, as we were almost to the front of the bathroom line, he mutters ""oh shit"" and a see a wet patch growing on his light grey shorts.  He wasn't holding anything, but still says ""I think I spilled something on myself"" I just pretend to go along with it and try not to embarrass him further.  He goes into the bathroom, and I wait outside for about 5 minutes for him, and he comes out with a wet patch all the way to the end of the leg of his shorts.  I try to be sympathetic and ask him if he's okay, but he just tells me he spilled water, and we should get going.  He then goes to put his arm around my waist, to pull my body in front of his wet pants to no one notices.  I really didn't want to press body up against his pee stained pants, so I kind of just push his arm away and say ""I don't think so.""  I try to make light of it, joke about it lightly, tell him it's okay, but he's just silent and keeps telling me it's just water.... dude I watched you piss your pants, we both know it's not water.  In the car when he's driving me home I even tell him a story about how I wet the bed until I was 15, and he gives me a look which to me said ""that's gross why would you tell me that.""  Well, after an awkward drive home I leave with a cold goodbye.  He texts me a couple days later, not mentioning anything about what happened, but asks me out again. I didn't reply.  My friend told me I was being an asshole for not heplping him cover his pee stain, joking about it, and ghosting him just because of the incident, when I liked him before.

1931,Asshole,"I went to six flags with some of my friends. Gf wanted to see a movie but didn’t want to go alone so she was gonna ask one of my better  guy friends to go do she didn’t have to go by herself. According to her there purely friends (and she told me about the date, didn’t try and hide anything from me). I flipped out on her and told her I was uncomfortable with that , asked why she couldn’t see it with one of her female friends instead, why it had to be a guy. We got into a pretty explosive argument. She ended up seeing it by herself and kept calling me insane/crazy. However this “friend” she only sees whenever I’m not there to see her and it’s making me think she’s just another guy down her list or something. She told me “it wasn’t a date” and she just didn’t want to go to the movies by herself. AITA? Reason I’m suspicious is because as soon as me and my gf started dating this friend started ghosting me and only started hanging out and talking to her. She also sent this friend nudes a few years ago, so they had some sort of chemistry at one point in time. However the weird thing is he’s been trying for this other girl who he seems to be super into (they really want to date however he’s in a private military school and that new it very hard for him to do anything outside of school) so for all I know they really could be purely plutonic friends but idk. The nudes thing happened 2-3 years ago. 


Edit: I should clarify I never said she couldn’t go with him. I just stated that I was uncomfortable with it and it kind of just lead from there.

Edit: was told to include this in the post, but I’ve been cheated on multiple times in the past as well as ghosted with no word as to why I was broken up with, and that’s why I have a hard time understanding platonic relationships between my girlfriend and other guys and trusting her.

Edit 3: I should also mention my gf has been extremely caring and affectionate. However out of nowhere her entire attitude will change sometimes and she becomes a completely different person. She’s cheated on people in the past however as far as I know, she’s never cheated on me. Our relationship has its ups and downs but we have great chemistry other than the trust issues. Half of y’all are saying I’m the asshole and the other half are telling me to leave her and I have no idea which to listen to. I really need a middle ground compromise here because that girl, still after some thin ice and close calls in our relationship, brings happiness to my heart everytime I see her. However sometimes she’s very oblivious to my feelings (we went out to eat one time and she left a 50% tip ((15 on 30))  when I told her I needed some money left in my bank acc for my gym membership, and not to tip to much I only had 60 in my bank acc) and acted like it was ok when I got upset about it.  Things like this aren’t a super common occurrence but they happen. But on the other side of the spectrum she’s extremely caring. Always asks me if I’m ok, offers to drive me if the weather is bad, tells me not to text her when I drive, let her know when I make it home, all out of simple empathy.",735,622,0.88
1932,No A-holes here,"My wife developed some kind of body insecurity after giving birth in November to our first kid. Or it started a few months before this but it really went to 100 afterwards. Before this, she was very body positive, no real shame in the bedroom and I kind of dug it. I'm very attracted to her, even through her pregnancy.

Once she started to lactate, however, she never took her bra off. Plus she'd wear a top on top. Once she gave birth, she always wears underwear and pants now, too. I haven't seen her nude body since November. She said she's embarrassed about her body now and thinks she's unattractive despite my efforts to convince her otherwise.

It's May now. This is still going on. We still are intimate with each other but it's always acts on me and I can never reciprocate. The moment I try to do anything she pushes me away and gets upset. I suggested maybe seeing a therapist or someone to help out and she said something along the lines of her body is disgusting and something to be ashamed of, nothing will change it.

I told her a few nights ago I don't want to be sexually intimate with her unless she's not wearing clothes. I know it's an asshole thing but I think it's justified: she's not going to get over her body insecurity unless we can work on it together and I can show her I still really do find her attractive. She didn't take it well and refused to budge.

Like imagine being in a relationship for four years when all of a sudden your partner asks you to leave the room when they get changed. They'll smack your butt or whatever whenever they want but you can't reciprocate without being yelled at. They call themselves disgusting and are embarrassed about their own skin.

He recently said he had arranged a hen do and it was a surprise. He said he would pick up me, my mum and my DD 12yrs  and take us there. 
Today my mum asks how to get on the message site to find out arrangements. Curiosity got the better of me and I looked at the group chat.
I was horrified to see he had arranged for us to go to a pub at 7pm on the Friday night. Now heres the kicker. 
I am a recovering alcoholic. I haven't drank in two years and do not want to be in that environment, especially with my 12 year old DD.  
I texted my AA sponsor who thought I knew it was a pub venue and was fine with it.  She had told him she wasn't going to come because she did not feel happy in that environment. 
I rang him and told him I would not be going to a pub. He tried to say we had been to pubs to eat before, but I pointed out that they were pub restaurants. 
This is literally a local pub where ppl just drink. There would also be a chance I might  see people from my drinking days.  The thought of which makes me cringe. 
My partner is angry with me and says I'm being ungrateful to his friend, but with all the stress over the last few months, I really don't feel safe around alcohol in that atmosphere.

So AITA?

However the group is Full of middle aged teachers who literally complain every. Single. Day about everything. We teach children in China so our cultures are going to be different and these people just don't seem to understand... So the post was this conversation between the teacher and the child. They were learning the words fat and skinny and the child called the teacher fat... Because he is and the teacher went Off on Facebook. He was saying he wants to report the kid for being so offensive and stuff....He was so offended that the child dared to call him fat... But what I don't understand is, if you're teaching this word and the child tries to use the word and you are a representation of said word...why be so offendedel? I mean there is nothing wrong with being and I don't understand why this man was so upset.
I asked on the thread "" why are you so offended that you were called fat when that's what you are? These kids often needs pictures or some type of visual to recognise words and he associated you because well..you are.""

The child is 6 and barely has a grasp of the language.

1936,Not the A-hole,"Hello, Reddit it's 9:00 am and I'm writing this fresh from the incident. 

&#x200B;

I want to start by saying I myself am an atheist. I grew up in a family that is half Jewish, and half Catholic. I have been to temple for family bar/bat mitzvahs, etc. but have never been in a proper church service. I wanted to give that context before going into this story. I live in a small city, with a lot of people in it. I was driving to school this morning which requires me to pass through 3 stoplights within the first 3 min of my drive. I pass the first light no issue. The next two lights are very close together one is a high traffic area (the first) and the second has a little less. 

I make the first of these two lights at the beginning of a yellow, no biggie. (These lights are a 4 way stop so you sit and wait for about 2 min) Upon pulling up to the second light within 10 seconds my window is getting knocked on. This person is flailing their arms around yelling about me speeding. I have had my window knocked on before because this area has a large population of homeless people. That being said, I get high anxiety when ANYONE comes knocking on my window at a red light. The man is wearing an all-black outfit with a white piece in the middle of his collar. I begin to wave him off and repeatedly say ""Please leave me alone"". After about 15 seconds of this man trying to have me roll my window down, and berating me for speeding I lose it. I began honking my horn until he finally begins walking away, I then find my courage and say ""Don't come up to people's cars like that you fucking lunatic!"" He was SHOCKED and then decided to take a picture of me in my car and I'm assuming my license plate. (I threw up a middle finger as well because at this point I'm furious)

1938,No A-holes here,"This fight with my mom happened last year but it’s recently been on my mind so I thought I would post here and hear som other opinions


Last year I dropped out of school because of my mental health being real bad and also because I wasn’t sure if what I was studying was right for me. I started working as a dog sitter/dog walker on the weekdays and I also kept working Saturdays in the store I was working in while I was studying.


But my mom was not happy, we had a lot of fights about my future and how disappointed she was with me for quitting school, even tho I told her I would start school again when my mental health got better and when I actually knew what I wanted to study. I also want to add that university is free here so I didn’t waste a bunch of her or my own money by quitting. 


In one of our bigger fights she told me that as of right now she thinks I’m never going to achieve anything real in life and just work low paying jobs or maybe live of benefits the rest of my life. She told me I have no ambitions and no real interests in anything and because of that she doesn’t think I’m going to be able to amount to anything important in life or have a good job or life. 


This really really hurt to hear, especially from my own mom. I told her how upsetting it was to hear her say that to me but she only told me that those are her fears and worries and she’s allowed to be worried about stuff like this. I also said that I know I’m not going to end up like that because I do have ambitions and interests, I’m just in a really bad place mentally at the moment and I need to fix that first. She told me that she’s still going to worry about it and talk to me about it.


That’s when I told her I didn’t want to hear her fears and worries about this then. She got really angry and said “oh so I’m not allowed to talk about my worries with you now??” “I’m not allowed to talk about anything??”. I then further explained that because I won’t be able to make her stop worrying about my future and future career until I get better and get back on track again it’s not helpful to hear how she have a hard time believing I’m going to achieve anything in life. It also doesn’t help her to talk about it with me because I’d just get agitated and then she would too and then a fight would start. I told her it’s probably better to talk about these things with her boyfriend or friends because then no ones feelings will get hurt and she’s probably have a way more constructive discussion while also being able to vent her feelings and thoughts.


She didn’t really listen and then we started arguing about something else instead. But I’m wondering am I the asshole for telling my mom not to tell me about her worries? I know she does and feels all this because she cares about me but it just really hurt to have her say that.

1940,Asshole,"I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.

So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I’m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend’s husband. Divorced obviously followed.

The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I’d have no problem paying what’s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it’s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.

Now she has no legal recourse (I’ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

The reason I’m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",1524,18855,0.88

1942,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because people know about my Reddit. 

My friend took a trip abroad for nine days and asked if I could look after her dog in the meantime. I have never taken care of this dog before but my friend said he isn't a problem since he is easy to take care of. She said she'd pay me because of all the help. I told her I would do it, I love dogs and since he is easy there will be no problem. And I do not mind getting some extra cash to spare either. 

Except, this is not true. 

The dog can't last a minute by himself, he starts crying if I leave, even to the bathroom. I live in the fourth floor of an apartment building and I can't go to the store or gym because I hear him howling and crying, all the way to the front door downstairs.

 I had to take him to work with me yesterday because he just couldn't stop crying when I was leaving. 
He starts whining and howling if he can't come and sit on the coach with me, he does that when I go to sleep if he can't sleep in the bed with me.
 Every single sound he hears from outside of my apartment (people walking outside, the elevator) he starts barking loud and doesn't stop even if I tell him to. 

I know it takes a while for the dogs to calm and settle down when they are in a new environment, especially when the owner is nowhere to be found but it has been nearly four days now.  I've had two dogs before so I do have some experience with them, and I've tried everything but none of it seems to be working.  

I  try to keep him busy with bones or chewy toys but right when he is noticing I am about to leave he starts jumping and crying. I try to put on some music or leave the TV on, same thing happens. 
And I know I should leave and just let him bark and wear himself out but I also don't want to risk anything and get any noise complaints since the landlord in my apartment is super strict. 

I confronted my friend and told her that I am not sure if I can look after the dog full time since he is not easy at all like she first said. I have work and other things to do besides this.

 I told her kindly that I am happy to come up with a solution and work something out with her, and she doesn't even have to pay me the money she promised. Her mom lives quite close but she has a condition which means she cannot walk the dog, but I told my friend I would be happy to take him out for walks if he could stay at my friend's mom's place. 

Now though, my friend is mad at me because ""I am insulting the way she has taught her dog"", I can't keep my promise and because I am ruining her vacation. She told me to use the spare key to her house and bring the dog back there and her neighbour would feed the dog and take him to walks every morning and evening but that would mean the dog should spend his nights alone. I tried to come up with more solutions but she is telling me that I ruined her vacation and the dog is not my problem anymore.

AITA?

UPDATE: My friend called me and told me to take the dog to her house. She told me her neighbor will look after him. This means he has to be alone during the nights. I am not sure though if she has made arrangements with her mom but I am now left out of this. She is very mad at me for ruining her holidays and I feel like TA.",72,222,0.98

So next year me and my Fiancé (we got engaged last week btw. I'm very happy) have got plans in action pretty efficiently for the big day which we're thinking will be June next year. We're going to be having the ceremony at her parents home (which is fucking huge by the way) which has an amazing garden so a summertime wedding in the sun outdoors sounds perfect. It also saves us a lot of money on venue hire which is a complete blessing. Seriously much love to my fiancés parents for letting us do this. 

There is however one catch 

It is going to be quite a small ceremony with only close family present.

So with respect to her family for hosting us we're keeping the headcount low and inviting close family. (though I do get my best friend to be present as best man) but with the low headcount it leaves no place for other friends to be present. 

The after-party is open to all friends so they can be invited to that but the big day itself is unfortunately off the cards. 

So my question is would I be an asshole for not inviting some of my close friends to the big day? Or would they have to suck it up and accept being invited to the after-party?

I assured her that I trust her, but that doing so would make me upset and it would be better if she tried other websites (BumbleBFF or Meetup). She currently resents me for taking away her freedom. I recently talked with one of her close friends and she said that saying that her doing that ""would upset me"" is a very controlling move and I should have said something along the lines of ""I don't think you should make an OKC account because I am insecure.""

1951,Not the A-hole,"Tl:dr - I recorded a man taking up two and a half seats for multiple stops and showed ticket officers the footage, getting him a fine. AITA?

So I get on my train after work at 6 in the city to the outer suburbs, everybody dashes for what seat are available and I snag one next to this biggish guy. This guy was pretty overweight, but if he sat properly he would be fine.

On Metro trains, seats are grouped in four like


oo

With another set of four across. I got the lower left seat, but this selfish yobbo was on the upper right and had one leg across on the other, and his other leg taking up half of the seat on his right (across from me) an asian man took the seat, but could only sit on half of it.

At first I thought this guy was sleeping. I shook his leg several times and asked if he could move his legs to no response, when my voice started to raise a person said ""just drop it mate, hes not moving"". So whatever, I left him to his coma. We hit Richmond, he wakes up, looks at me, looks out the window. AND DOESNT MOVE. 

So I see the asian man take a photo of his face, and I get an idea. Lets shame the asshole. So I take out my phone and start recording in selfie mode each time we arrive at the next stop, so the mic picks up the announcer saying ""now arriving at x"". I also shake his leg again, to which he tell me to bugger off. So now I can prove hes awake. Originally I was going to stitch it all together and post it in r/melbourne. But something better happened. When we got to one of the outer suburb stops, officers got on the carriage for inspection. He hears them asking for tickets and moves his legs.

1952,No A-holes here,"We are both 30 years old. I’ve had my license since I was 16, never got hers. She says she has anxiety about driving but she has driven before when she was with other people who got too drunk to drive and they were her ride. This has only happened a handful of times, never with me.

We’ve been best friends for the last four years and it wasn’t a big deal at first but lately it’s been bothering me that I always have to pick her up and take her home when we hang out. Almost every time we go shopping or run errands, she asks me to stop somewhere she needs to go (her bank, the vape store, etc. - I don’t smoke or bank where she does) and it makes me feel like a cab service kind of.  

I’m the DD when we go out to bars by default. She never offers me any gas money but I also have never asked because I don’t want to sound rude. The few times I’ve suggested we split an Uber she says she won’t be able to go because she doesn’t have enough money for the ride and drinks at the bar so I just end up driving us.  

I enjoy her friendship and hanging out with her but have been spending less time with her than usual because I’m starting to feel resentful and annoyed that I always have to drive. So, AITA?",78,273,0.96

1954,No A-holes here,"My wife [42] and I [45] recently have been grieving the death of our only son [18]. He died due to a drug overdose, specifically Xanax. We had no idea that he was a constant user since he was very good at hiding it from us. We’re heartbroken and miss him so dearly, we pray every night that he is at peace with himself.

Now we notified both of our jobs and they graciously allowed us to take some time off to grieve and be with one another. 2 weeks have passed and I’m working again, I still have to excuse myself at times to cry in the bathroom but I understand that we still need to continue to support ourselves.

My wife on the other hand is still in pretty bad shape, she’s been sleeping in our sons room every night since his passing. She barely eats, I have to urge her greatly to even eat a meal a day. 

One thing she really wants is a grand funeral for our boy. Her reasoning being that since he was unable to live a lot of life we should use money we would have had to spend on his college and additionally work the rest.

The only problem is my wife is basically stubborn about going back to work. She said she’s mentally and physically unable and needs me to continue working in order to support us. I think that’s ridiculous since I’m grieving as well and it seems like she’s making it seem that I wasn’t affected as much as she was. 

I plan on telling her if she wants to have this funeral she needs to go back to work as well, because I don’t plan on working overtime for a while.

1956,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys. I’m in a weird spot. 

Saturday I turned 23, and we had a party to celebrate. I had 15 friends show up, some planning on staying over. Eventually, the party dwindled down to just us that were staying the night. This left me, my boyfriend, 4 other friends, my little brother (20) and Laura (25), who I had considered one of my best friends up until this. 

To preface this, here’s an event that happened a week ago. I went out with Laura, my boyfriend Michael, and Michael’s friend Kyle. We had a good time at the bars, and came back to our house to keep the party going. 

Midway through the night, Kyle and Laura started having loud, gross sex when Michael and I were in the other room for just a minute. Michael and I had an awkward laugh and waited it out in our office. That is, until they came running through our office naked to use the bathroom and throw out the condom. Michael yelled at Kyle and kicked them back out to the living room, where they had loud sex again. They left behind our torn apart living room, smashed food in the carpet, Laura’s dirty underwear, and two unopened condoms on our couch. Laura gives me a half assed apology, and Kyle gives both Michael and I an incredibly sincere apology. 

I let Laura’s stupidity slide, and invite her to my party as a peace offering. I wasn’t mad necessarily about the sex, just how rude and loud they were. She’s also had similar inconsiderate sex in our house with another friend. 

At my party, Jordan and Laura start to flirt. He’s coming off a really rough breakup not even a week prior, and his flirting seemed harmless. He’s really, really young. He acts much younger than 20, and has minimal experience with girlfriends/sex. Laura frequently has sex with different men, which is fine, except she has confided in me that she rarely uses protection. Definitely not someone I want my baby brother romping in the sack with. 

I catch them going to Laura’s bedroom at the end of the night, and I call out to my brother asking what the fuck he was doing (sorry. I was drunk, tact was not used.) She pushed him away and shut the door in Jordan’s face. I walk past, and hear the door open again and them giggling. I lay in bed with my boyfriend on my birthday night listening to Laura make the weirdest, most exaggerated sex noises that were unfortunately very familiar to us by now. The headboard knocked into the walls for my other friends to hear, as well. Literally echoed through the large house.

AITA for cutting Laura out of my life? Michael thinks I’m exaggerating. I’m just getting sick of her being so gross and inappropriate. I’m the last person to shame someone for promiscuity, but good lord. I don’t enjoy being an unwilling audience member each time, especially when my own flesh and blood involved.

1957,Asshole,"My girlfriend is 5'2"", and when we started dating, she weighed about 130 pounds, so on the thinner side of average.  To be completely honest, I like chubby girls, but I liked her personality enough that I was willing to overlook her not being my usual type physically.

Since then, she's started actively losing weight, and at one point she dropped below 100 pounds (I think she hovers between 100 and 105 now).  She doesn't eat much.  If I bring home burgers or whatever, oftentimes she'll only eat half of it and throw away the rest.  Usually she just asks for a salad or even says that she's not hungry at all and doesn't want anything.  The other night her dinner was literally pickles.  She talks about how she loves how her thighs don't touch anymore, but honestly, I'm not really attracted to her body now.  She's just too thin.

Anyway, I've been less into sex recently, and I guess she could tell because she asked me about it, and I figured I'd be honest, so I said, ""I think you've taken this weight loss thing a bit too far.  You looked fine when we started dating.""  She said, ""So you don't think I'm sexy?""  I said, ""I just think you've gotten too thin.  I honestly would've preferred if you had gained 30 pounds instead of lost it.""  She got upset, said I should just go date a ""fatass"" if that's what I want, and stormed off.

1960,Not enough info,"I grew up in a rural town but I always knew I wanted a different life. I worked my ass off and earned a full-ride scholarship. I graduate in a few weeks and I've been accepted to a top-tier law school on the other side of the country. Life was good. Then I got a phone call...

I have to back up. Last December I decided to go home for the entire Christmas break. My mom died when I was 14, so my dad and I are really close and I wanted to spend extra time with him before law school.

My second night home I was playing pool with friends when a girl walked in. I'll call her Lucy. She's the younger sister of a kid from my football days. They live about a mile from my dad (which counts as ""neighbors"" in my town), so I used to drive them to school. She's four years younger than me, so I thought of her like a kid sister.

Well, she's not a kid now! She was hot and funny and we spent the night flirting. My girlfriend broke up with me a few months before, so when Lucy told me she'd had a crush on me since she was 10, I admit, it fed my ego. We were both drinking and one thing led to another. We slept together.

I saw her like four more times before I went back to school, and we had (protected!) sex each time. I thought it was just a fling. I went back to school and resumed life.

I hadn't really thought about her, so I was shocked when she called a few weeks ago and said she's pregnant. She was a virgin, and with the timeline I'm sure it's mine. Lucy is religious, so abortion is out (too late anyway) and she plans to raise the baby. I told her I'll be there for my child, 100%.

I called my dad and he encouraged me to marry Lucy since, statistically speaking, a child does better with two parents at home. Plus there's a stigma towards single mothers in our community. He told me he and mom had to get married (I never knew) and though he wasn't sure at first, he's glad they did and he'd give anything to have more time with her.

I like Lucy a lot. I always have. She is smart, funny, hot, she'll be a hell of a mom and a great wife. And she loves me. Plus, if we marry, I can still go to law school. I checked and there is married student housing available. We'd have three tough years but I should make excellent money afterward. If we don't marry, I can't see how I can go; I'll need to get a job to support this baby. I'll have a degree, but it's in history. What do I do with that? Law school was always the plan.

My dilemma? I don't love Lucy, or at least, I'm not IN LOVE with her. Maybe I'd learn to, but I can't be sure. We'd be a good team and we'd be great parents together but I always pictured marrying a woman I loved with all my heart. I may never feel that way about her. If I'm completely honest with myself, I'd never marry her if not for the baby.

I've almost decided to propose. It seems right. WIBTA for marrying her because I'm stepping up, and not because I'm in love with her?",71,55,0.86

So a few days ago I placed two orders for mother’s day flowers with our local florist. They were doing a big promotion for special Mother’s Day flowers at about $60 each. It comes in a huge basket with a big selection of local flowers and a nice note. I got two, one for my wife who’s celebrating her first mother’s day and my mom who I won’t see.

My wife recently saw the receipt in my email but didn’t see the quantity so she thought I spent $120 on flowers for her. She asked excitedly how many flowers $120 gets someone and I sheepishly told her there’s two bouquets, one for her and one for my mom. She got immediately annoyed and asked me why I thought it’s ok to buy her and my mom the same flowers. I told her I wanted to buy from the local florist because the owners a nice guy and they only had that one promotion going on, not to mention it’s like 50% more expensive than their normal bouquets.

She’s still mad and called me clueless. I don’t think I did anything that wrong though. I’m taking her out for a full day, with brunch and massages and a special dinner in the park.

1963,Not the A-hole,"I am the youngest of four from a blended  family. My sister ( eight years older) and my brother (three years  older) (hereby known as stepbrother for this story)  are my step  siblings and my other brother (three years older) is my blood brother.  We've been a blended family since i was two.

I  was never very close to my sister as a child, there was too much of an  age gap between us, she moved out of the house at sixteen and married at  eighteen.

my brother moved out at  eighteen and into the CBD for his job as a chef. I moved out at eighteen  and into the CBD for my job as a bartender. My stepbrother did not move  out at all and my parents ended up moving out and leaving him and his  girlfriend (now wife) the house.

My  Sister had two children (child 2 & 3) at this point and had just  separated from her husband so my parents and sister moved into a house  together. She got together with another man (sister's partner / sp) who  already had a child (child 1) and he also moved into the house with my  sister and parents, and sister quickly got pregnant with child 4.  my  parents told me they hated living with sister and sp as they argued all  the time and they quickly moved back in with stepbrother and girlfriend.

shortly  after this i got hit by a car and had to take time off of work to  recover. i had a hard time affording rent during this period and  stepbrother offered my old room back which i happily accepted.

stepbrother  and gf got married and bought a house of their own, moving out and  leaving me and my parents, i got another job and started paying board.  my brother lost his job and fell into depression so my parents pretty  much forced him to move back into the house until he got back on his  feet. he immediately put the utilities into his name and i took the  internet into mine. mum was in the process of building a combi, the plan  was that she and dad were going to retire and drive around the country  and live in the combi, leaving the house to my brother and me.

but  then my sister had a huge fight with her partner and took her 4 kids  and ran interstate. she was court ordered to return but it turns out  that by this point she had been blacklisted from renting any where in  the state. so she had nowhere to go but back into the house with  parents, brother and me.

as far as i  was aware everything was fine from that point on, we now had five adults  and four kids living in the house but wee all got along pretty well so  everything was good and the parents were well on the way to moving out  soon anyway. but sp moved into the house as well a few months later, and  the arguing started. sister and sp are really not good for each other  but for some reason they are still together (it blows my mind)

brother  got a new job, this time as a head chef and moved back into the CBD.  the utilities were transferred into my name and i discovered exactly why  he had moved out. Sister did not pay her share of the very expensive  utility bills.

she also got pregnant again, child 5 was on her way.

i  had a deal with mum so that everytime a utility bill came in i would  cut my board in half and that half would go towards mum and dads share  of the utilities. but i had no way of making any similar deals with my  sister as she paid for nothing in the house. neither she nor her partner  have a job and the divorced husband wasn't in the picture and didn't  pay child support. Both sister and sp are living off of welfare. to make  it worse sister joined a bird rescue organisation and constantly took  in injured and/or abandoned baby birds, she bought multiple heat lights  and ran them for pretty much 24/7 she also bought an old chest freezer  and filled that up as well as running the air con all the time during  summer and the heater during winter. this hiked up the utility bills by  almost 100%, and never paid for even a cent.

this  combined with the almost constant arguing with sp and child 1. every  other week she kicks sp and child 1 out of the house only for them to  spend a night away and be back the next morning for the arguing to start  up again. parents have finally set a date for their combi travels to  begin and will be on their way by the end of july.

I  refuse to put to up with it anymore. sister is an inconsiderate  housemate and i just cant deal with it anymore. I have told her i'll be  moving out and into a single person apartment soonand she has spent the  past few weeks telling me she wont be able to afford to live in the  house without me so she and her children will be homeless. As sister has  been blacklisted fro renting in this state (and now i know why) i'm  fairly certain she's right.

I know  moving out will potentially leave her homeless but at this point i dont  really care, ive been putting with her shit for three years now and just  cant do it anymore. AITA?

1964,Not the A-hole,"So, here I am again- school's a rollercoaster and after another incident (that might be my own fault), I am here again seeking the judgement of strangers.

&#x200B;

I've been through some nasty trauma, and while it was years ago, it sorta haunts me. (I'm not diagnosed with PTSD, I do suffer from a panic disorder). I'm extremely skittish around men that are taller than me (I'm 6' tall), with dark hair and darker skin. I can manage my own anxieties in large groups, in class, etc. But private settings and one on one conversation are beyond me.

A week ago, a boy that's been part of my friend group for a while (black kid around 6'3"", linebacker for the school's football team) held a promposal for me. A sign, roses, loud music playing- all in the middle of the common area at lunch. He looked so excited, I felt crushed saying no. Really, I still feel awful, the way his face fell. I just said I didn't think I'd be into it, and I was sorry.

(To add some context: He knows about what I went through, and he knows about my trauma, and understands how it affects me.)

The next day he'd taped flashcards to my locker, each basically listing off something he liked about me. The last one said that he would treat me like a princess, and promised to take me out to dinner beforehand. I was flattered, but still upset that he'd continue after I'd turned him down. I felt like crying, but I just took them down. At lunch, he asked me if it was a yes. Again, I turned him down. Instead of backing down, he asked me why I wouldn't go to prom with him, when I'd had a crush on him since first grade.

That's when our shared friends, and some of his team mates came over. He was loud, and making a scene.

I think it's important that I type this out verbatim, because i do feel my wording could've been a bit better: ""Please stop asking me, \[redacted\]. I said no! I've already told you no. Don't ask me again. You know why. You need to f\*\*\*\*\*\* stop!""

I was losing my grip, I really shouldn't have cursed at him. It made me seem aggressive. but the way he responded was uncalled for. He said, ""Yeah, I know why. It's because I'm black. You don't like the way I look, because I'm black. I can't help how I look.""

I was taken aback. I'm mixed, white/black, and I have a half sibling with the same complexion as him. He knows all of this, but he knew how to make a scene. While the incident hasn't spread around too much, I have our shared friends and his calling me bigoted, with one girl I hardly know talking about my, ""light skin bias"". The most extreme calling me a racist. I really don't know, I thought I was right, and I thought he was just oversimplifying the issue to make me feel bad. But now I don't know. He messaged me and told me he'd give me time to think. Now I just don't know. I think I might just go with him and apologize, but I don't want to if I really am justified.

She said “be right in.” 

She came in and asked what she could do for me. I asked if they maybe had ear plugs or something. I didn’t want to directly blame them for talking too loud. They didn’t have ear plugs but she brought in a fan to help cancel out the noise.

So I match with a black guy in his late early 20's and we hit it off. He asks if I'm up for a coffee and I agree.

  Once we meet up the first thing he says to me is ""Sorry I didn't recognize you from all the other white women"" which I found a bit odd but didn't think about it that much. So the conversation goes really well, I thought he was charming and funny and\` we really clicked. He confesses that I'm the first white woman he's seen and that he wants to ""see what we're like"" which I found patronizing but I never went on a date with a black guy before so who am I to talk?

The last three times I have tried to take the car out, the battery has been dead (the first time, I replaced the battery - that was in September, and it was legitimately very old).  And, when I use the term dead, I mean it very expressly.  I do mean really really dead.  Throwing a battery charger on it reads an output that would let you know it's dead - this last time, 0% charge and 5.0 volts.  The time before that, 0% charge and 8 volts.

I asked my wife when the last time she drove the car was, and she swears it was last Tuesday (today being Monday).  I charge it up, and do what I need to do.

The last couple of times this happened, after I charged it up she made not complaints about the car not starting the entire time - the next time I went to drive it, a couple of months later, it's dead.  This happened again, and again, the next time I drove it - a few months later -, it was dead.  That was today.

1971,Not the A-hole,"So this is a hard one. Throwaway in case anyone recognizes us. 

This is purely a case of “morally wrong but somewhat harmless” so I’m not sure what I should really do. 

Anyways 3 years ago my wife went through a difficult miscarriage. It was a tough time for both of us but especially her. During the time she got engrossed in this online forum/blogging community with moms who’ve either lost children, miscarried, or had tough pregnancies/PPD. The therapist thought it was a good outlet and she made lots of real world friends there. 

Well in the last year it’s kind of taken on a new life of its own. My wife no longer posts about her miscarriage and therapy, but she posts under a fake profile where she pretends to be a mom who had recently lost her 2 year old to a terminal illness. It’s INCREDIBLY detailed because she’s researched everything, down to the developing symptoms of this “illness” and what we had to “endure” at various stages. She references me as well. 

It’s disturbing because I check up on her activity now and then, and she’s now one of the most popular commenters/posters in this community. She does routine updates on how she’s doing and there are a lot of moms who ask her for questions. I think it’s wrong because she’s giving lots of advice to mothers who are ACTUALLY either losing a child or has lost a baby/toddler. It seems really, really wrong to me. 

She refuses to talk to our therapist about this and when it’s brought up she stonewalls. I don’t know how to get through to her. She says it’s harmless but I’m not so sure. Her persona is so well fleshed out that she gets PMs from actual grieving mothers of young children and she interacts with them frequently. I think there’s something really immoral about it all and an tempted to message the community moderators about my wife’s account and posts, since she refuses to listen to anyone’s concerns. WIBTA?

**Edit**: when I say “outing” I mean telling the site admins/mods about her account. I’m not going to publicly out her as a fake.

With therapy, we’re dangling by a string already. She’s increasingly resistant to seeing the one we have and forget about finding new therapists. She refuses to talk about her online persona even when we go just for that issue. It becomes “I’m not harming anyone/this is a creative outlet for my grief/I’m not going to stop anything because you say so.” This is why I want to go straight to the source and have the site ban her or something. She REFUSES to stop and therapy isn’t helping anything at this stage.

On another note I want her to stop because I’m also worried about how quickly it’s getting out of hand. It seems like her popularity on this site is growing exponentially. I’m worried the more popular she gets the more people will look into her stories and potentially find out who we are. There’s enough overlap between her online persona and her actual person that it wouldn’t be impossible to connect the dots. I’m worried someone would be upset enough about the lies to harass us or even harm us. I don’t want it to get to that point.",202,1167,0.98
1972,Not the A-hole,"Edit to add: the kids didn't belong to anyone there
 The person that brought them I assume was babysitting but I didn't ask. 

So, I'm not particularly religious but I go to a church activity about once a week. Not always but most of the time. The activities are usually fun, **they're 18+** and I have a few friends there. Most of which have busy schedules so we can't hang out much outside of that setting.

And today I decided to go. We were doing nerf gun wars. Hunger games themed. So the first part of the activity was ""training"" with foam noodles into hoops, foam arrows, and plastic axes. All of it is completely safe. 

And before the activity starts I see a 5 year old. I ignore it at first but then notice there's 2 kids. Again this is an *adult event* kids aren't supposed to be there. Period.

And I let it go but once we get into the gym area I kinda go ""kids shouldn't be here but ok"" and a friend of mine Kayla* says ""they're fine"" but at first they weren't doing anything other than what the adults were doing so they're fine even of their mere presence is making me want to leave. So i deal with it and throw plastic axes. And the kids pretty much hog the archery station that I really wanted to try and never got to. 
And then once they get bored of that they grab the foam noodles and start smacking each other with them. At that point I decide it's not worth staying and leave. 

I see one of my friends(Zach)  and went ""hey, Zach, I'm gonna bounce."" 

He says bye and asks why i'm leaving. 
Me: ""i don't like kids, kids should not be here so i'm just gonna like go. So yeah bye.""

So am i the asshole for making it clear the kid's shouldn't be there and leaving bc they were?",131,221,0.92

1974,Asshole,"I just attended my best friend's (of 14 years) wedding and was a bridesmaid along side a woman I hate. I made a wooden hope chest with my dad as a wedding gift. But after this weekend, I think im going to keep it, and here's why:

In middle school, there was a mutual friend we had that I grew to hate. She is toxic, everything evolves around her and she is outright mean. To both of us. For example, when it came time to the Bachelorette party, she got the bride extremely drunk, to the point of concern, and was pissed at the bride for jeopardizing her plans to go bar hopping. And she made a point to tell the bride if she didnt sober up she was going out regardless if she was going or not.

I hate this person so much, that once I knew she was a bridesmaid I continually tried to back out of being one. But, the bride was my closest friend of the few i have and I was ultimately guilted into staying a bridesmaid. I was even told she was only asked because the bride had no one else, and the wedding party would have been uneaven.

When it came to the wedding shower, Bachelorette and wedding, I was very cordial and even friendly to the one person in life I hate..

The bride knew, how much I was holding in wanting to finally deck this girl in the face or tell her off one and for all. She knew how much anxiety it gave me to go to all of these extravagant wedding parties/ events. She knew she was my closest and dearest friend and she knew that what she did would crush me.

The bride relied on her. She put her before me. And she finally chose who meant more.

If there was ever a task, the brides asked to her help. If there was ever something forgotten, she was asked to retreive. If there was a problem, the bride went to her for a solution. 

After asking many times for the bridesmaid line up, it was at the rehearsal I found out why I wasnt told. She was before me. If it had been any of the other sweet girls I wouldnt have cared. If I was second to last, as long as she was after me, I wouldnt have cared. But she was there, standing proudly before me. It wasnt even a thought in the brides mind that I would have liked at least a warning. Or maybe it was, and she didnt want her day ruined by me not showing up and her bridal party be uneven. Because that was why the bride asked her to join right? To fill a spot for symetery and aesthetics.

If i'm not special enough to her to consider my feelings, she isn't special enough for a gift made with precious moments spent with my dad. 

Ps. This fucking chest was a bitch to make. She and I spent days picking out the perfect style and stain color and it took months of weekends to make.

1975,Not the A-hole,"When I was 10-11 don’t recall the exact age I embarrassed my dad in front of his whole family over an outburst I had. I told him things like “ You don’t love me” and “You don’t help mom enough” etc. Well I did this because I was genuinely upset over the obvious favoritism he showed to my sister.
Well when I got home he stopped calling less frequently and eventually cut off communication completely. 

Flash forward to today. He doesn’t call on birthdays or anything no contact at all. My mother recently told me that I should call dad and chat. I refused and said that he should do it since he is the “father”. I would not mind calling him at all it’s just sad how he cut me off after one outburst and recalling the favoritism still kinda hurts.

SIL yells at me "" it was an accident don't speak to him that way"" to which I responded that her dog was very excited, hurt me, and I was afraid he would try to jump on my son.  Her dog is approximately 60/70 lbs and very tall and he listens to no one.  She started calling me a b!+ch saying I should never scold a dog.

1981,Asshole,"I am pretty sure that I'm the asshole here, but wanted verification.   Honestly, I'm not sure I'm going to change it though because there aren't too many things he will eat. 

So when S (son) was 8, his favorite food was steak, and filets being his favorite cut.  He literally asked me daily for steak.   One day, he came home saying he didn't want to eat meat any more because he didn't want to hurt animals.   I immediately asked him, what about steak?  He said, ""I'll probably just eat it once a month.""  Thinking it's just a phase, and I want to honor his fledgling belief systems, I go with it. 

So the month went by... he isn't less picky about vegetables, and is essentially a carb/cheese iterian.  I'm supplementing with vitamins and veggie/ fruit smoothies.  I ask him if he's ready for his monthly steak.   He says no. 

So, fast forward to middle school and high school years and he discovers that he loves Mexican food.  Initially cheese enchiladas and progressing to 
rice/ refried bean/ cheese burritos.   

Awesome. There's protein in them beans. 

He is totally clueless that traditional refried beans are made with lard (I just buy the 16 pack at Costco/ Sam's.)  He eats probably 16 burritos a week.  (He's a teenager, it's ridiculous.)

AITA that I've never told him that refried beans, practically anywhere, aren't strictly vegetarian?   And I actively don't buy the vegetarian refried beans because well more expensive, and jeezus, I'm already catering to him anyway. 

I've been cooking two meals for almost ten years, and finally he's able to make his own food.   

I'm pretty sure IATA, but wanted verification.   Most of my friends/ family think I was an idiot for even entertaining the vegetarianism in the first place, especially because he won't eat vegetables.

EDIT: Kid is 17 and I only realized that there was a vegetarian refried bean option like two years ago.

EDIT 2: I just told the kid.   He literally said that he knew already but he'd decided that it wasn't ""enough.""  As in, it wasn't enough like eating meat to make him stop eating refried beans at restaurants, etc.  He said, he just can't chew meat, that grosses him out. Then he said,  it's my favorite source of protein, so yeah, I'm good. 

EDIT 3: I just asked him how long he has known, and he said at least a few years.   He told me that he'd googled vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants when he was 14 and realized that refried beans weren't vegetarian.  But figured that it wasn't a big enough deal to stop eating his favorite Mexican food.   

EDIT 4:  Here's where IA(truly)TA. He's been checking out his protein/fat/carb ratios for a few years, changing his diet to increase muscle mass and gain weight.   He's known this whole time about eating non veggie refried beans.   IATA, totally, for not believing my kid would be on top of it.

1982,Not the A-hole,"So, I've (18F) got three sisters (21, 20, and 16). We have our ups and downs and dont always get along, but I love them a lot. 

A bit of background-- I've been struggling with anorexia since I was in in sixth grade (~1 meal a day, every day). It wasn't until my junior year in high school that I actually started eating three whole meals a day. Needless today, i was very happy when i started gaining weight again (I made it to 130!), but did not like the dysmorphia that came with it. I still find it very hard to look in the mirror and appreciate how far I've come, as well as speak to myself positively. 

Lately, my sisters have started making comments about my weight. It's never anything bad (20 did call me fat once though. Explicitly), they're supposed to be compliments, but they make me feel bad. 

One time at dinner, 16 looked down at my thighs and just went ""DAMN! You've got some thick thighs!"" In front of like. My entire family. I tried to play it off as what she meant it as, but it really bothered me. Same sibling also complained she doesn't have a thigh gap anymore, and that set me down an emotional rollercoaster (unintentionally).

Today, i was standing in my 21's room because she had asked for my opinion on a purse she wanted. 20 comes in and is like ""get outta my way, dummy thick""

I know these things are meant to be jokes, or compliments. I know they don't mean any harm by this, but it took me a very long time to tell them about my disorder, and I don't think comments like this are really helping me recover? I just feel like it adds onto my weight, and it makes me feel bigger than I actually am.

1990,Not the A-hole,"My cousin (52yo m) is currently awaiting trial for a serious crime that involved a child. I accidentally stumbled across his arrest 2 years ago while I was searching for his son’s mugshot to show a friend how stupid he looked. His son is a jr, so when I searched for his name, my cousin’s mug shot popped up and I saw what his charges were. Months went by and I kept following his case. He was lying to our entire family. At first he told everyone (most of his family and my extended family is in another country) he was dating a 17 year old and her parents were upset, then when people found out the child in question was actually his step-grandchild so he switched his story and told people his wife set him up because she found out he was cheating on her. I’ve known his wife my entire life. As far as I can remember she knew he was cheating on her and just lived with it. She’s also not the type of person to do something like that, plus I really doubt the little girls mom would put her daughter through that. There’s also medical evidence of what he did. 
     A few months ago he requested permission to leave the country because his mother died. The judge granted his travel request. The problem with that is that his mom is NOT dead and he actually traveled for a birthday party. Someone that attended the party posted pictures of him with his mother at the party. So I contacted the prosecutor handling his case and gave her that info along with the screen shots. As a parent, woman, and human I could never forgive myself if that man walks free. His family has defended him blindly this entire time but none of them actually know what’s going on with his case. 
So the prosecutor filed a motion to hold his bond insufficient, they issued a warrant for his arrest again to hold him in jail until his trial. I was named in all the court documents because I didn’t provide the information anonymously, otherwise the judge would have thrown it out. Now my entire family found out I provided the pictures of him at a party with his mother to the prosecutor and my mom got really mad at me. She said it was none of my business and I should have stayed out of it. 

Am I the asshole for wanting justice served here even though that is my cousin?

EDIT: the child in question is NOT a 17 year old. He told everyone that because as one commenter pointed out while still a minor, a 17 year old can make mature decisions.

Friday morning I learned I might be testifying in court as a character witness unless he takes a plea deal.

For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults.

The government didn't give her any aid either since our income is apparently too high. My daughter got into her dream school after being waitlisted. She was really happy to start college there this fall, but she has no money. I don't really feel like I have to pay for her college; she's an adult she should start paying for things on her own. She has no money saved up, because her mom has discouraged from getting a job until this spring. She has been working at a local bakery, but only has very little saved up for college. 

The university my daughter wants to go to is $17,000 after the small amount of aid they gave her. She's planning on studying biology, then going to PA school. My daughter's uncle and grandparents have promised to pay $5,000 of her tuition. My daughter plans on having $4,000 saved up by September. But it still isn't enough.  My daughter thinks I am unfair for refusing to pay the rest or at least cosigning a loan. She says she has no other way to pay for college, and that I am taking away her chance of going to a university. I don't need any extra debts by signing a loan, but my daughter thinks I am being stingy. 

My daughter is very mad at me and has been for weeks. My birthday was two weeks ago and my daughter refused to get me anything even though my wife offered to pay (didn't really matter to me, but I thought she was being a little bit overdramatic.).  She has also told me she will never spend a penny on me, or give me anything, unless I help her get a loan for college. She says I'm the only person she knows who could co-sign a loan for her, but I just don't want to.

 I don't understand why she is being so dramatic. I have encouraged her to start at a community college since she'll have enough saved for that. That makes her even more mad, because she wants to go to her ""dream school"". Also she says she can't stand me anymore, wants to move out asap, and rent in our city will end up costing her more than the price of going to her dream school (that part is probably true).

I’m like, “That’s nice, you still have to leave your gun in the car when you visit.” Well one day she asks me to put something in her purse and when I do I see the gun sitting in the pocket, which is unzipped. Mind you the gun is loaded and my two year old who loves getting into anything and everything is running around. So I flipped out on her. Basically about how we’ve discussed this multiple times, she doesn’t take gun safety seriously, and from now on we’re searching her purse before she enters the house and the gun either needs to immediately go in our locked gun safe or in her car when she arrives. She acted like a scolded teenager who doesn’t understand why what they did was wrong, like I’m totally overreacting. Honestly, I want to tell her she cannot come visit unless she leaves the gun at home, but I know that will really upset her. We support responsible gun ownership in our family but I just feel like my mom isn’t being safe and is putting my kids at risk.

UPDATES

1. For those accusing this of being a validation post, I’m not asking if I am the asshole for wanting my mom to follow gun safety, because that’s obvious. I’m asking if my reaction (flipping out, banning her from visiting unless she leaves the gun at home) are me being the asshole. 

2. There is reciprocity between our state and her state. 

SHE LITERALLY VISITED AGAIN TODAY AND FORGOT THE GUN WAS IN HER PURSE AGAIN.  The gun was in the purse, which was on a dresser. I’m done. Asshole or not my mom is not visiting anymore with her gun.",267,849,0.93
