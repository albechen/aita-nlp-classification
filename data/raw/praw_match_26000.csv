0,Not the A-hole,"I am currently studying in 12th grade. My school gives  large scholarships to the best student of the year in terms of grades and academic output every year. 
I grew up in poverty, and have a single mom as caretaker....getting the scholarship genuinely helps a lot. I would not have been able to go to school otherwise.


This year, there was a tie between me and another girl.
Call her F for all I care honestly.

 Both of us got the same final grades. I told them we would split the money in half and share them, but F wants the prize to go to any one of us.
I beg her in private to split the prize and talk about my condition.

 Both of her parents are rich and she lives in a posh area where apartments cost over a million, she comes with a driver to school. She doesn't need the money as badly as I do.

But F still wants to take the prize. Teachers go for the second criteria ,which was who had the higher competitive exam score, and of freaking course she does.
I could only afford one attempt with no private tutors but had a lower score by 20 points from one attempt as compared to her best of score, section wise, from 5 attempts.
Scholarship goes to her, I get transferred to a far worse school. Life goes on.

But then she personally messages me pictures of her necklace and how she bought it and snidely asked if the bathrooms at poor schools were as bad as she heard.

I screenshot the conversation and posted it on social media along with what she did. 
Half of the people are siding with me for the most part but I have honestly never done something like this and she might be losing popularity fast.
I avoid confrontations at all costs and I felt scared doing this stuff for people to judge. Plus plenty of people are giving me tasteful messages too.
So your opinion genuinely matters

Edit:Thanks a lot for each and every response, each one makes me think about what happened and I thank you guys for spending your valuable time helping me.",224,1023,0.91
1,Asshole,"So my uncle was almost like my father. He pretty much raised me when my dad couldn't, (he got arrested and imprisoned in Columbia for some bullshit drug charges for a few years before the incompetent legal system realized he was innocent). My uncle rarely took things seriously which is what i loved about him. He took me to strip clubs when i was 15, took me on a road trip to sketchy places across eastern europe when i was 17. Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.

SO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me. At the end i said, ""in honor of my uncle, I'm proposing to my girlfriend, I had the courage to ask her out because of him and now I'm proposing to her in his honor as he requested."" My girlfriend accepted my proposal and i gave her the ring my uncle gave to my aunt (she died previously). Most of the guests were like wtf are you doing and were pretty pissed off. Nobody was happy and people were screaming at us for being disrespectful and saying that we need to learn to be more respectful. The family kicked us out and barred us from entering the dinner and other activities we had planned. Im really bummed out i missed out on it and most of my family isn't on speaking terms with me.",33,43,0.79
2,Not the A-hole,"Some context: I don't know my SIL well. She lives across the country, and I have met her 3 times including her most recent visit.

I also had a miscarriage recently, so recently that I still look somewhat pregnant. This will be important later. The loss was not a secret. We had already announced the pregnancy and so we had to make announcements again when we lost the baby.

The story: SIL came to town and my family of 4 and my husband's family of 3 met up with her at a children's museum. My family arrived first and we eventually spotted the other group and walked up to them happy and excited for our fun day.

Me: There you are! You ready?

SIL: Oh my god. Your boobs are HUGE. They are seriously so big. I don't remember them being that big. Is that a baby thing?

I was so shocked and offended. My mouth actually hung open and though I was trying to think of an appropriate response, I was really surprised by what I actually said which was,
 
Me: Yes, SIL. I was recently pregnant. (in an admittedly really condescending tone)

I grabbed my daughter's hand and walked off announcing ""Let's go do something fun!""

I later apologized for my tone and said her question caught me off guard but everyone except my husband seemed like I had done something shameful and shocking for the rest of the visit. So, reddit, AITA?",46,136,0.93
3,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I woke up Saturday morning eager to get our errands done, so we could head to a fun, free event going on in our city. I heard my roommate and her boyfriend cooking up a storm the night before, so I expected the kitchen to be a bit rough. We run our errands, go to the grocery store, and head home. Our plan is to quickly cook up some meat we had marinating overnight and then head to the event. However, the kitchen is horrendous.Both sides of the sink stacked full of dishes, zero plates in the cabinet, zero forks in the drawer, all the counter space covered with dirty pans, grease, and crumbs, etc. And the straw that broke the camel's back was seeing my poor cast iron, covered with food and water, strewn in the sink. I take pride in caring for my cast iron, and it's my favorite cooking utensil that I make just about every meal in.


We realize that we will not be able to quickly cook our food and head out. At the bare minimum we need to clean the cast iron, season it, clean plates and utensils to use, and clear a workspace on the counter. My boyfriend and I thought we had the house to ourselves since the roommate in question is usually at her boyfriend's place on Saturdays, and my other roommate had just left. So we crank up some tunes and get to work on the kitchen. As we clean we're venting about the mess, how it inconveniences us, no respect for our dishes, so ready to be done with roommates (my boyfriend is currently buying his first house), and stuff like that. It takes us a while to get it usable and get our lunch cooked, but by the time we're about ready to eat we've put a load through the dishwasher, wiped down the counters, hand washed a couple dishes, and shoved everything else to one side of the sink.




Then, my roommate opens her door and walks to the bathroom…Oh shit. She was here the whole time. I wonder if she heard us complaining about her? She definitely did, her room is right next to the kitchen and our walls are super thin. I feel bad that my roommate heard me venting about her, but was I being an asshole? My complaints were coming from a place of exasperation, and I kind of hope this event was an eye opener to her. Maybe in the future she'll be more considerate of common places, and try to think about how others will need to use the space after her.",26,49,0.95
4,Asshole,"I live with three roommates, so there are four of us total. This morning I got up and my entire shelf in the fridge was moved so it was only a few inches away from the top of the fridge and all of my food had been rearranged. I sent a group text to my roommates because I wasn't sure who'd done it, and all I said was that I didn't appreciate my things being moved without asking, especially since it put my bags of lettuce right under the coldest part of the fridge, which makes it spoil faster.

My roommate who had moved everything came home after that text and confronted me, saying that it's ridiculous for me to be angry about her moving my stuff and she'd only moved it because she and her bf/our other roommate had gone grocery shopping and needed more space for their things, and that my text was passive aggressive. I don't think it was passive aggressive when I clearly stated what the problem was instead of like sulking or re-rearranging the fridge.

I tried to explain that I wasn't angry, it just feels jarring to wake up and have a bunch of your stuff rearranged. Her stance is that she shouldn't have to fucking ask me to move things in the fridge, especially because she and bf are two people and I'm only one person. And she made the point to say it was ""more organized"" once she was done with it.

She also said that as she was reorganizing things she knew it would probably bother me, and she shouldn't have to feel anxious about moving things in her own apartment. I really don't get why she didn't just ask me if she knew it would bother me, and I still feel like it's a reasonable thing to be annoyed about because I would never just rearrange her things without asking.

So, am I being an over-sensitive asshole?

**Editing to say:** thanks for all of the feedback so far. It definitely has made me reconsider my stance on things and I set up a time this afternoon to talk with my roommate so I can apologize and just generally clear the air between us once we've both had some time to cool off.",32,68,0.9
5,Not the A-hole,"I'm using an alt to save me some trouble. This summer i'm taking my family to Disneyland. We have been planning for almost a year to go and all 3 of my kids are ecstatic. Everything has honestly been great so far and it looked to be a great vacation, until recently. This is where my 13 year old son James comes in. James has been a problem child as of recent. He's been acting up in school, getting in trouble around the house, and been an overall headache for me. I've always had the mindset that ""kids will be kids"". Hating school is fine, I get it. And he's getting to that age where he's going to push back a little but he has tested my every nerve.

&#x200B;

I've tried to handle it with care and be ""the good cop"". Try and handle it with love and care, you know? Well, that changed this last week. James was caught shoplifting. The store called us and my wife had to go and deal with it. The owner was nice enough not to get the police involved and we made James pay for what he was going to steal.

&#x200B;

That was not enough for me. The minute I got home I sat him down and lectured him. He seemed to not really care and eventually started to argue with me. Eventually I had enough and told him that he's lost his right to go to Disney with us. He immediately started to apologize and begged to go but I told him no. I told him he will instead be going to my parents and working on my dads farm for that time while his sisters have fun at Disney.

&#x200B;

James has been a wreak since then. He's been crying to his mom for me to reconsider and claiming he'll stop being bad but I don't buy it. My wife says i'm being to harsh and to let him go but I feel like this is where we need to put our foot down. My dad says I'm doing the right thing and is all for working him while we go to Disney but could I be wrong. I feel like maybe a second opinion would be good here. So, what do you guys think?

&#x200B;

Edit:  
I want to thank you all. Getting a second opinion has helped me see the situation from other perspectives and I feel a lot better about this now. I talked with my wife for over an hour during my lunch break and we've decided we'll give James a second chance. We are going to talk more tonight but I'm going to frank here, it's going to be very tough for him to regain my trust and go on the trip. Me and my wife talked about the possibility of him moving in with my parents the moment he's out of school and working on the farm until we leave. If he act's up there then the trips off and he's on the farm for till we get back. 

&#x200B;

As some of you have mentioned though I may want to get to the root of this too. I'm going to sit James down tonight as well and talk with him and see if I can figure out what's going on with him.

Thank you all for the help",611,3514,0.97
6,,"This isn't as big of a deal as a lot of posts I see on here, but I've gotten really mixed input in real life and I'm curious. I'm training for a half marathon, and now they the weather is getting nicer I'd really love to run outside more. I live in an area without many sidewalks--just tons of road with narrow grassy areas on the sides. However, there's a beautiful, spacious cemetary near my house with amazing, sloping sidewalks throughout. I've never seen any mourners in there when I drive by, but never seen any other people walking around in there either. Would I be an asshole if I jogged around in there? I don't want to be disrespectful, but honestly don't know if this is something anyone even really cares about. 

If it matters either way: I wouldn't wear headphones and would wear modest exercise attire.

Edit: I emailed the cemetEry yesterday (thank you community for the email idea and spelling help haha) and was told that they welcome recreational walking but not jogging.  Thank you to everyone for weighing in!!!  I kind of can't believe it didn't occur to me to just *ask* the proprietors, but I'm really glad for all your help and glad that I didn't try it before asking.",123,247,0.97
7,Asshole,"I’m not sure where to begin with this. I’m exhausted because I spend all night with “Jeremy” (Ex) in my living room trying to explain to him why I did what I did but maybe not making sense so I’m here for judgment. Trying my best to make this coherent. 

I have had this friend named “Alex” since I was in elementary school (we are all 23 and 25 now). I literally have swooned for him since I was a little kid. I love him so much I can’t even put it into words. We dated in high school but I stupidly broke it off with him when I went to college because I wanted “experience.” We’d always, always hook up when we saw each other but he we always parted ways but amicably. My friends always joked that I never poured myself fully into other guys because Alex was “in reserve.” There’s probably some real truth to this. 

So enter Jeremy. He’s a very good guy I met on tinder who I liked a lot who had potential. I saw him maybe 3 times a week since January and I guess we were exclusive but we never discussed it. 


Last week I saw Alex’s mom and she told me that Alex was moving home because he’d been assigned (he’s air Force) to fly the planes that do training in the city closest to us. I about died of excitement. I texted him right away and he won’t be moving until August but he asked if I’d be willing to drive to San Diego and spend the weekend with him. Before i even set my phone down I was packing a bag and on rhe higway. I just had the most amazing weekend of my life and as I was leaving Alex told me that if I’m not careful he’s going to marry me and give me babies with his dimples. I was literally on cloud 9 the entire drive back because it’s all I ever wanted. We made plans for me to come visit him and maybe drive cross country with him when he moves. 

Well i completely forgot about Jeremy and I feel terrible about it. When I got home he was sitting in my parking spot both scared because I’d disappeared and mad that I’d stood him up on Saturday. I invited him in to give him the news in person and he freaked the fuck out. He went through every emotion possible from crying and begging me to reconsider to literally calling me an asshole for breaking his heart. He kept saying things like I’m shallow for chosing  “top gun over the guy who pours concrete” I tried to explain the history but he said he just wasn’t buying it. 

**edit: just to be clear this is how I came to see ""Alex"" this past weekend:**

**I live outside Tucson, AZ. Alex is finishing up pilot training in Texas. I saw his mom at a grocery store here in Tucson last week. She's always loved me so she said that Alex had just (like that day) gotten news that he would be assigned back in Tucson for his jet training and he was going to call me. I couldn't wait so I texted him. He asked what I was doing this weekend. I said nothing (wrongly as I already had plans). He said that there was a training mission to San Diego and he could hop on it and wanted to know if I could drive there (it's about 6 hours). I said yes...that's how we came to see each other.**

I feel really bad for what I’ve done but am I an asshole?


Edit: everyone wins, I'm a terrible, terrible person and I should be cast away from polite society and Jeremy should get a medal for trying so hard to be nice to me and Alex deserves to stick his dick In non-crazy pussy.",569,240,0.78
8,Not the A-hole,"We were at a kids bday party a few weeks back where there were about 20 kids. There was one boy in particular around 7 or 8, who seemed to be acting out- running around yelling in the adults faces, grabbing them, poking or slapping them, he just would not leave us alone! He would run into the garage; where the adults were, throw toys at us, run around and run back out. At first it was funny, but then everyone began to get visibly irritated. 

On top of that we were not sure if he had a speech impediment or something bc no one could understand him, and he would get emotionally upset if we didn't know what he was screaming at us. Most of us moved indoors to get away from him since he was grabbing at our chests, slapping our necks, etc. It was bad. 

We later found out the dad had been sitting near us when his son was screaming and hitting other adults, but did nothing about it. I was completely shocked. 

AITA for not ""sensing"" this kid had issues and being more understanding? 

We also later found out that this boy had very severe learning and speech disabilities and was likely triggered by all the people and kids around.  

If the parents issued an apology or at least an explanation to the adults he was harassing, it might have helped us deal with this kid's behavior a bit easier. But they said nothing and did nothing in response to these behaviors, giving everyone else the impression this kid was just a dick.",19,87,0.95
9,Asshole,"So I'm kinda leaning toward feeling like I'm an asshole in this situation. So recently me and a guy I met on tinder have been trying to set up a date. I really do wanna go out with this guy but it just seems nothing ever works out. He works weekends and every weeknight last week he had available I either had to get up early in the morning or had some other prior commitment.

So Friday he tells me he pulled some strings with coworkers and got Saturday night off so we could go see US. I bought the tickets and he was going to buy dinner after the movie. Everything was great. Then a few hours before the movie I get a call from my son. 

For reference I gave my son up for adoption at birth to a family I know but mostly stayed out of his life till recently. Hes actually a really fun and smart person and I like to take any chance I get to make up for lost time. So when he told me he had finished his university assignments and wanted to drive down to my place and hang out Saturday I just said sure without thinking.

I did kinda regret that, just because the guy has been so nice so far but I knew I'd have to cancel on him since I honestly would rather spend this weekend with my kid before he is loaded with exams and has to go to a study abroad over the summet.

When I called my date he understandably was pissed and I offered to take him out on me Monday, he called me out saying I was stringing him along and that my son is in college and can find something else to do. Things didnt get better and I'm pretty sure theres no coming back from it. Not to torn up though.

So I had two movie tickets and wanted something to do me and him went and I guess had our own ""date"" night. At work today I told some friends and the response is pretty mixed right now. AITA?",77,228,0.93

she came out as demigender aceflux? I believe. I asked what that was and after some explanation I knew that it was fake and a fad. 
I told her I would not accept her and would not use her new pronouns (xe xm) I have no clue how you even use them. 

she then locked herself in her room for 5 hours crying. 
this was last week and she is now not talking to me unless I use her xe xm pronouns.

12,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want someone I know finding this on my real account.




My husband and I have been married for 7 years. My sister-in-law and husband share a father who's going to be abroad for 13 more months, SIL's mom is a drunk who never took care of her child so we took legal guardianship of SIL 2 years ago when she was 15. SIL is a troubled kid but not a bad person at all, I try to go easy on her because I struggled a lot when I was her age and I was hoping I could help her move past her shitty upbringing. It's been a challenging couple of years especially since Husband and I have been dealing with infertility for a while now and lost three babies over the course of 18 months, the last one at 15 weeks. I've been trying to come to terms with my infertility while helping Husband through his depression as he's been recently laid off work.




A week ago, SIL came to me and said her period was late. She begged me not to tell my husband and I told her of course we would keep it a secret until we knew for sure that she was pregnant. I took her to the clinic and we found out she was 8 weeks along. I was surprised and she admitted that she had stopped taking her birth control because it was giving her acne. On our way home, she told me that she wasn't willing to abort.




I told my husband and to my shock, he was actually happy. He told her we would help her raise the child. I waited until she went to bed before I broke down in tears and told him that I wouldn't be able to handle it. I want her to move out. He exploded at me calling me a selfish bitch. He apologized later but made it clear that his sister would stay with us.




She has relatives living in another state who offered to take her in until her dad gets home but Husband doesn't want her to have to change schools. I know SIL would not be able to take care of a baby and that would leave my husband and I to do the work for her. She has no income, she doesn't even know who her father is and isn't willing to adopt the baby out.

14,No A-holes here,"I've been friends with this girl (I'll call her F) for over 5 years and we have a mutual friend (M) who we both have a lot of history with. It was a known fact that M had always liked me and I had given it a chance in the past. I did have vague feelings for him but due to circumstances, I decided to give up on him because I didn't think it would work out between us. We were still friends however.

&#x200B;

A couple of months ago, F confessed to me that she liked M. I didn't feel too great about it, but I encouraged her to go for it and ask him out. That might not have been a great idea but I was pretty sure that M and I would never hit it off (foreshadowing) and they were my friends and I wanted them to be happy. 

&#x200B;

F asked M on a date and he said yes. The day they went I was dying for F to text me the updates. When she got home, she told me that the date was fun but that M had told her he didn't think it would be a good idea for them to be in a relationship and that she had agreed that it wouldn't work out.

&#x200B;

Cue to one month ago. As you probably could have guessed, my feelings for M started to get more serious and one day we went to the movies, telling ourselves that we were just going as friends (I was in serious denial about liking him). Long story short, that night we ended up confessing our feelings for each other and from that point there was no turning back. M told me I should tell F asap, so I told her the same night. 

&#x200B;

To my surprise, she said she already knew I liked him because my feelings were always written on my face for everyone to see. She also told me that she had been feeling terrible about it, because she still liked M and she actually thought that she still had a chance with him, which I had now ripped away from her. I was confused by that because she had agreed with M that they weren't going to date. I apologised to her anyway, because I did feel bad about it and also because I hadn't told her I liked M even though I hadn't even admitted that to myself before that night. She accepted my apology and told me she forgave me.

&#x200B;

M and I are in a happy relationship now, but the thing with F is still bothering me. Even though she said she forgave me, she still passive agressively guilt trips me about my relationship. She also sometimes talks about how 'M used to drool over both of us' which implies that it was entirely possible that she could have been in my position. I asked M and he said that he has never been interested in F. However, in her eyes I stole her potential boyfriend and I should feel bad for it.

&#x200B;

My friendship with F is quickly becoming suffocating and there are more issues than only this story, so I'm seriously considering ending our friendship but I'm very aware how much of a villain I already am in her eyes. Is she right? Am I the asshole?",64,98,0.91
15,Not the A-hole,"My 3 friends and I went to a semi fancy Italian restaurant for dinner. Keep in mind we are college students. A couple of us ordered appetizers as meals, because they were cheaper and we weren’t super hungry. He made a big deal saying “are you SURE that’s all you want to eat? Really?” We just chuckled and he said “are you poor? Do you need more food?” In a serious tone. We sat there awkwardly and didn’t say anything. Cut to the end of our meal, and he asked if my friend needed a box for her leftovers. She said she didn’t need one, to which he said “are you sure? You could sell it on Craigslist or something?” At this point we thought he was just being rude. After contemplating a lot we told the manager about it. She was very nice and said she was very sorry. I now am regretting telling the manager, because I don’t want him to lose his job or something. He was rude but maybe he just doesn’t understand what’s socially acceptable to say? Should I feel bad for talking to the manager? 

TLDR : waiter joked about us being poor, we told the manager about it, AITA?

EDIT: A LOT of people are wondering what we tipped, and a couple suggested we probably couldn’t afford to tip. Though his service was bad, we did tip. My bill was $14, and I tipped $2. My friends did around the same. If he had been a good waiter, I would have tipped more.

17,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago me and my SO adopted a stray dog. She's still quite fearful, but getting better every day. Because she used to be a stray, her teeth, digestive system and coat were in a poor shape. We managed to make it better through hard work and a light diet. Our vet told us that as a stray she probably ate a lot of trash and scraps of salty human meals, so we should be even more careful with feeding her processed human foods than usual. If we want to treat her, we boil some (safe) vegetables, give her a few slices of an apple or a spoonful of sugar-free yoghurt, but spicy and salty processed sausages or ham are off limits. So are heavy cheeses, sugary puddings and other sweets, fast food and so on.

As a part of her socialization process, we visit my parents quite often. It's great and I've always been grateful for them inviting us. However, last time we visited, my mother was in quite a mood for the entire time and actively tried to annoy me multiple times. Most of them I'd endure without batting an eye, but one thing that led to an actual fight was the fact, that she fed my dog human food, mostly pizza crust with spices and sprinkles of cheese on it **while looking me dead in the eye** **right after actually** **asking me if she can feed the dog and me saying no**.

Since at this point I already told her multiple times that this is not acceptable, I asked her why is she even asking me if she can feed the dog if she's gonna do it anyway. She answered ""because I don't agree with you"". It was a very stupid answer, so I asked does that mean she doesn't want us coming the her house, because it kind of looks like she wants to scare us out. She then said that she ""won't be blackmailed"" by me and she will ""do whatever she wants and if we don't want to visit, we don't have to"", so I answered that since I am not looking forward to watching the dog's every move and I think she poses a threat to her health, we won't be visiting for Easter or any time soon for that matter, to which she just barked ""fine"" like a moody teenager and me and my SO left.

I do not intend to set foot in that house until I hear a clear apology and she swears that she won't feed the dog shit again. Now I'm finding out that she's deeply offended, because I supposedly set restrictions on her *and her alone* out of spite and ""if I think I will win this peeing contest I am dead wrong"". On top of it I know this whole situation ruined Easter for my SO, because we refused to visit his mother to make plans with my parents. My dad is also sad, because we're not coming.

Basically everyone's miserable, because me and my mother won't budge. Except I think I don't want to budge for a good reason and she is the one in the wrong. Do you think I'm right or am I actually the asshole?",218,870,0.97

21,No A-holes here,"i thought about posting this in r/relationship_advice but i did that once and got 1 reply so i figured a smaller audience might reply in larger quantities.

i (29m) have been with my boyfriend (26m) for 3 years. before him, i had a ""slutty"" phase and i had this friend with benefits (FWB). we slept together for over a year, fairly regularly, and we also chatted ALL THE TIME, watched shows together while cuddling on the couch, made dinners together and so on, like it was pretty hardcore. like barely a step away from being a real relationship.

both of our lives changed at some point, we had much less free time and so we stopped sleeping together but we still talked over messenger. after a few months, i started dating again and just over 3 years ago, i met my boyfriend. i fell for him hard and instantaneously, and he for me. i told my ex FWB i'm not comfortable chatting to him anymore and although he was a bit mad, he respected my wishes.

the thing is, coincidentally, my boyfriend and ex FWB went to college together and now they work together (editing to add they've only been working together for about 8-9 months). my boyfriend knows i also know him because, at the beginning of our relationship, i mentioned a very specific hobby i have which is where i met my ex FWB, and my boyfriend said he knows someone who also does that, and we realized we both know the same person. (i'm sorry if this isn't making much sense!)

however, what i came to find out is that my ex FWB is a massive dickhead. he was apparently a complete piece of shit to everyone at college, he is a complete piece of shit to people at work, he's sneaky and jealous, and he sets people up for failure, generally treats everyone like crap, and much worse things than that! we never went deeper into our worldviews so i had no idea about any of this, we just sent each other lots of dick pics and sexted most of the time. he, to my enormous dismay, also likes to brag about his sexual conquests.

as far as i know, he's never said anything to my boyfriend about us having sex, but both of them are currently in the running for a really nice promotion. i think my boyfriend will get it because he is a bit more qualified and i'm worried my ex FWB might tell him we had sex as revenge.

the thing is, after hearing about what kind of a person he really is, i am APPALLED and disgusted and ashamed of ever having anything to do with him. i wish i could rip out those memories out of my head. i don't want to go into detail about what makes me feel this way, but trust me, he is a horrible person! and i don't want my boyfriend knowing i ever had anything to do with someone like him.

so my question is **AITA for never telling my boyfriend about us** and **WIBTA if i didn't tell him at all and just hoped for the best and risked him finding out from a person he hates**??",66,43,0.86
22,No A-holes here,"I’m a woodworker on the side, I made my best friend a wooden American flag because he said he would love one. Only charged him cost of materials and shipping cost around $20. He then asked me to make another flag for a gift for his mom. I still gave it to him for cheap because growing up I was close with his family, but now he asked me to make the same flags for 5 other people in his family and one coworker. Keep in mind I sell these size flags for $150 and he assumed this time it would still be $20 each flag. I promptly told him I can’t do that cost anymore, it was only really a deal for him because he is my best friend and I agreed to it the second time bc it was for his mom but now these are for people I don’t even no. Told him I’m sorry but it’s not gonna happen. He responded “oh, ok...” and it’s been weird ever since, really short. Should I have just done it and not risk ruining our friendship?

Update: followed some advice on here and let him know I’m not upset but broke down what all goes into it. Said there aren’t any hard feelings but just wanted him to know why I said what I said. I’ll update with his response.

Update #2: He did give an apology of sorts. Said he thought that getting my flags out to different people would help more people see my products which could lead to more revenue. I told him I appreciate that but I currently stay busy enough without it and that I wouldn’t mind giving him 50% off only bc we’re boys but this would be the last time. He said he didn’t mean for it to come across the way it did. Idk I still feel like it isn’t resolved, we’re going out for beers this weekend. Going to get him to understand my side of things.

Final update: He sent me a random message last night profusely apologizing. Apparently he was talking to his wife and she tore into him and was upset he would do that haha he just sent a PayPal payment for 5 flags at full price. Glad it all worked out, I’m going to make him something customized as a thank you for the business. Thank you all for the advice. ✌🏻",621,13183,0.93

24,Asshole,"My fiance and I got engaged last year, and booked a date for October 2020 at the beginning of this year. We've obviously been very excited about it and have been very involved with her family, planning and trying to include everyone.

&#x200B;

Switch to her sister, who has been with her now fiance for almost 10 years, but got engaged earlier this week. They have been in a strange ""about to get engaged"" zone for about 7 years now, always saying they'd talked about it and it was going to happen soon, but they never got around to actually organising it. Now, they've just gotten engaged and immediately decided to have their wedding exactly 2 weeks after ours. 

&#x200B;

The family is very tight-knit and even just helping us plan our wedding so far has drawn a lot of emotional energy. Both weddings will also require extended family to travel interstate to attend, and both weddings will probably need logistical and setup help from her parents and family (we are doing it on a bit of a budget). 

&#x200B;

From her perspective, she has been waiting for almost a decade for her special day and loves autumn - I don't think she has chosen this date to copy us or anything sinister. 

&#x200B;

From our perspective, we are worried about burning out our family with travel, planning, and physically helping move things around - and we are worried that this will steal our thunder for our special day which we have been planning for longer. It will also affect our ability to have a honeymoon, and the third sister lives and works overseas so will need to make two trips or take a long time off work.

&#x200B;

We are not sure if we should talk to her or just accept the decision. Please Reddit, let me know if I'd be an asshole to ruin her special day, or if we're within our rights to ask her to move it.",98,344,0.96

26,Asshole,"So I’m at that age where I have to start thinking about college, and as most of you know, one way to help you get into a college you want is to have teachers send the college a recommendation letter to tell them how much I would fit in their curriculum. Now I’m fine with filling out the recommendation letter from that I have to give to the teacher, but the problem is my mom wants me to write a thank you card to every teacher I’m filling out the form for. We got into 2 arguments so far about this, one of them got pretty heated. I just think writing a thank you card is stupid and pointless. If I wanted to say “thank you for writing the recommendation letter for me”, I would just say that in front of them. I’ve NEVER heard of anyone writing a thank you card for a recommendation letter. I guarantee that my mom didn’t even do it and is just forcing ME to do it in her own weird view of politeness.

So am I the asshole in this situation?

EDIT: The comments have spoken. I now understand that writing a thank you card is needed. As much as I don’t want to, I now know I just have to suck it up and do it if it’s really gonna help me.",23,31,0.82
27,Not the A-hole,"This week three friends and I are on vacation in Puerto Rico. A person in our group, we’ll call her “Sally” for ease of reading, has family here, and last night we went out with them. We were all drinking and having a good time until it was time to drive home. Sally’s cousin is from the area and is experienced driving the mountain roads, so we let her drive our rental.

Here’s the problem. Sally’s cousin drives like a maniac. She was constantly speeding 20-40 miles over, tailgating within 10 feet of the people in front of us while going 80 miles per hour, looking at her phone, laying on her horn for no reason, swerving around the road, and wearing no seatbelt. At one point she stopped in the middle of the highway (granted, it was midnight and there weren’t any cars on the road), reversed 50 feet for some reason, and then continued the way we were going. Keep in mind Sally’s cousin doesn’t speak English so I had absolutely no idea why she was doing what she was doing. Riding with Sally’s cousin was the worst driving experience I had ever witnessed by a long shot, so I assumed she was drunk, high, or both. I later found out she only had a couple beers, and thats literally just how she drives normally. Before I did the following, I talked to my buddy next to me in the back and confirmed that Sally's cousin was indeed a maniac.

We stopped at a gas station and I demanded I drive us the rest of the way. I had only had a beer and a half, and that was a couple hours before, so I was practically sober. 3 out of the 4 other people in the car declined, with my friend who agreed with me staying silent. I told them I did not trust Sally’s cousin behind the wheel, but everyone else was defending her. “This is how everyone here drives, you’re worrying too much.” This is the part where I know I was an asshole. I started yelling about how I didn’t care what part of the world we are in, terrible driving is terrible driving, I didn’t want to watch them die tonight, and basically said either I’m driving or they’re leaving me there and I’ll get an uber home. They let me drive us home, but after everyone cooled off and sobered up the next day, they still believe I was being an asshole. I agree that I should not have raised my voice, and apologized for it, but I still believe that making sure I was the one who drove us home was extremely necessary, and that if I did not take the wheel I would be putting my friends lives in danger.

Self improvement is a very important part of my personality, and since I rarely get mad enough to raise my voice the way I did, I am trying to take their side into account. Although I see that I should not have yelled, I have a really hard time seeing how I was in the wrong to kick Sally’s cousin out of the driver’s seat. I should have found a less loud way of doing so, but I still believe me driving home was the only correct decision. AITA?",65,225,0.97

29,Not the A-hole,"Now i’ve been family tech support for years (im 23 and i learned a great deal about pc’s when i was ~12-13 so about 10-11 years or so now)

My father is quite the stubborn man, regardless i love him, but every week it seems as they want me to drive an hour to fix his computer.

Now he plays alot of facebook games and things of the such with obvious virus ads, and clicks them, so i often spend 1-3 hours cleaning, and wiping his computer. Occasionally it gets bad enough to the point in which i sometimes have to factory reboot.
—————————————————————

Now obvious solution: install malware bytes, enable active protection, and ad block.

And within a week he deleted them. So i asked him why. 

To which his response was “I dont want them on my computer, I dont think they are safe things (english isnt his first language)”.

I explain to him that everthing is safe, and reinstall it. He does the same thing, and i get a call a week later. I go back, but this time i hide the application in the chrome store, and i buried malwarebytes in his windows directory, and lastly take away his administrator privileges.

Him still not wanting the applications on his computer, looks up something along the lives of “how to uninstall a program,” or so i assume.
—————————————————————

So after the third week of him calling me with the same problem, i tole him that I would not be coming out to help. This did not sit well with either parent, as “im their son, and i should help them when they ask.” I told them i wouldnt be driving out every weekend to help if he keeps uninstalling the programs I install.

After this and the incident involving my brother/SIL my family seems to think that “I dont care enough about them, to help them”",74,138,0.95
30,Everyone Sucks,"So in November last year I moved into a flat with 3 of my other close friends (Been close mates for 5+ Years). All of us at this stage had a job and where living super easy, the Rent was split 4 ways and so was food. In about December it came to my attention that one of my flat mates (We will call him Jack) Had missed a rent payment. That was fine at the time as he worked in construction on a hourly rate and it was the holiday season so he wasn't working, so we moved some money around and was able to make do. HOWEVER it was just 1 rent payment, soon Jack had racked up a solid $1600ish NZD worth of debt with us in back payments for rent and food.   We bought this to his attention and he seemed to sort his shit out. How ever about 2 months ago to decided to quit his job and has since again been living in our house again living rent free and eating all of our food, while the rest of us are out at work trying to ""Get this bread"" to the feed the little shit. We then recently gave him a month to move out and that time is almost up. Are we an asshole for the following

1. in 4 days we will be putting an eviction notice on his door
2. The day after the date supplied on the door half of his room will be packed up and moved to the street and his family will be contacted about the situation and our locks will be changed
3. If none of the following will work we will be contacting the police to have him forcefully removed from the flat

31,Asshole,"My husband (45M) and I (45F) have been fighting over this for several weeks now and since I don't want to discuss it with any of my friends out of embarrassment, he suggested I ask here where nobody knows who we are.

We have two sons (20) who moved away for school 2 years ago. They've always been very introverted, had very few friends, they never dated anyone and spent most of their time studying. They both got accepted into prestigious schools and my husband and I have always considered ourselves to be very lucky to have such amazing children.

Since they started university, they became much more outgoing. They have a lot more friends, they go out all the time and they're extremely social. They came home for a visit a couple of weeks ago and one of them said he had something to tell us, and it was that he had a boyfriend. Then, his brother said that while the other one's at it, he may as well come out too, and said he is also gay.

When the first one said he had a boyfriend, I honestly felt happy for him and I was glad he trusted us enough to tell us that. But when the other one said he was gay too, I got very upset. I don't know why I had such a visceral reaction but I started crying and left the room. I didn't want to talk to them or my husband for the rest of the day, the rest of their stay at home was very awkward, we didn't talk much, and in the end, their father took them to the railway station without me.

I just can't help thinking that this means I'll never experience the joy of having a daughter-in-law, and helping her with the wedding, that I'll never have grandchildren and do all the lovely things I've dreamt of since my sons grew up. I do accept them as they are, but I just can't help feeling sad. It was so unexpected and such a shock to me, especially since they'd never said or done anything that might make me even think they're gay, so that I'm ready when they come out.

My husband thinks I'm being an asshole and, even worse, a bad mother, and that I should have contained myself when they came out to us. He said we can get a dog, but it's not the same and I feel like he is the asshole for even comparing grandchildren to pets. I think that even though my sons are upset with me now, they should understand what this means to me since I'm too old to have more children.

Which one of us is in the wrong here?

**Edit: Thank you all for your replies, but seeing as how many nasty comments and PMs I'm getting, I'll be logging off and not responding to anyone anymore. I don't need to be told I'm a vile cunt, a bitch, the worst mother ever, and a disgusting, toxic person that should never be around children. I'll take the kind advice to heart and try to fix the damage I've done with my sons, and the rest of you should evaluate what sort of person you are if you can't resist the urge to send strangers messages about how they're a ""homophobic hag"" and you hope their sons will never talk to them again.**",436,2298,0.87
32,Not the A-hole,"I see a lot of posts on here seeking validation for their situation but I honestly don't know if what I did was an asshole move or if my wife is just unreasonably angry at me for this.

One day I saw this valentines day ad for a daddy-daughter dance night and I told my wife that I don't like them. My reasons were this: They are creepy and sexualize the relationship between daughter and father. There are hearts all over the poster. It's on valentines day. The dad and daughter are dressed like they are going to prom together. It's oddly ""date-like"". Not to mention it these dances have their roots purity balls where fathers claim sexual ownership of daughters until marriage. The whole thing just grosses me out and makes my skin crawl. I love my daughter with all my heart, but I don't want to date her. I also don't want to reinforce weird gender and patriarchal stereotypes in my daughters young mind.

My daughter is 2. This shit is all hypothetical for the future. I was just expressing my distaste for them to my wife upon seeing this poster. She lost it. She was shaking and crying. I don't think I've ever seen her look at me with such disdain.  She thinks I would be denying my daughter a special bonding experience. She was worried my daughter would feel so hurt and left out by this. I don't think I'd ever not go if it's something that my daughter really really wanted, but I still think as parents it's our duty to do better than ""it's tradition"". I've never been one to buy into that crap. People do a lot of horrible nonsense because they're told it's what they're supposed to do.

I don't see the big deal in not wanting to participate in a weird archaic past-time that sexualizes my relationship with my daughter. I can kind of see my wife's point, but she was so mad I literally didn't understand it. Help me out, AITA?

EDIT 1:

I should have mentioned that my wife's father isn't really involved in her life and hasn't been since she was 3. She sees him a little every few years, but he didn't show up at our wedding or meet our daughter despite invitations to both. No doubt this has something to do with her sensitivity about this issue.

EDIT 2:

1. A decent amount of people think I'm gross for saying the dances were sexualized and maybe that was a bit too far. I meant that they are treated in a romantic fashion, not necessarily sexual. The way they treat it like a romantic prom date on or near valentines day where you slow dance with your daughter to love songs just makes me feel like a male version Lucille Bluth. \*Shudder\*
2. As a couple people pointed out purity balls actually came about in 1998. Daddy/daughter dances were happening before that. I think these dances REMIND me of purity balls in a lot of ways, but I was wrong to say they were rooted in them. Also, some people are saying mommy/son dances are a thing but I've never seen nor heard of any personally. I see daddy/daughter dances all the time though.
3. There are also people saying ""do something else with your daughter instead"". I do. Here's a little background. As of right now my wife works the better job. She makes more money and has insanely good health benefits and we don't wanna pay for daycare so I work a couple online jobs and stay home to take care of my kiddo. These dances are from a time when a dad went to work and the mom stayed home and raised the kids. Dads were distant and didn't raise their kids. So these dances were a way for a dad to actually spend time with their daughters. I promise you that's not the case here. I spend every single day with my daughter. We do fun stuff all the time. No worries there.
4. I feel like a lot of people here think I believe these things are bad because I think dancing with my daughter is sexual. That's not true. I dance with her now. I'm affectionate. I hug and kiss her. I nap and cuddle with her. It's my favorite thing in the world. However, context is important. Like yeah, it's innocent to breast feed, but if you saw a 10 year old boy doing it, you'd be a little weirded out. These dances are something that weirds me out. I can't help it. It's a visceral reaction to it. I do think people are missing the part where I said I would absolutely go if my daughter really wanted to. I would be uncomfortable about it probably, but I'd never hurt my daughter if it meant that much to her.
5. Just had to laugh at the marriage counseling suggestion. Just needed a ""delete facebook and hit the gym"" and the reddit relationship advice would be complete. We're fine. We've had plenty of talks about her shitty dad. I'm nothing like him, thankfully. I honestly think her reaction could've been stress related and I just hit a nerve at the wrong time, but I don't see the point in bringing it up again. Sometimes in marriage and parenting you won't agree on things and that's okay. You compromise or work around it... or in this case never speak of it again unless you have to.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Apparently (in this situation) I'm not the asshole! But honestly thank you to everyone for your thoughts, ideas and criticisms. It helped to know some people that went to these things had neutral or positive experiences. It also helped me to know other people are just as creeped out about these dances as I am. Now I don't feel so crazy. Whatever your opinion on it, just know I'm gonna keep doing the best I can to be a good dad, dances or not. Thanks for your help reddit!",714,2133,0.94

34,Not the A-hole,"
Note: I dont want to start a discussion around surrogate mothers, I respect every posture and I think it ends up to the specifics, so please, keep that in mind when commenting.

We’ve been married for 10 years (M40-F32) and have two children. About 5 months ago my sister in law (I’ll call her Donna) and her husband(Jake) started “joking” around with us about the chance of my wife being a surrogate mother for Donna (39) who was recently told by 3 different medics that she cannot have kids on her own. I didn’t like the tone of the conversation but did not mention anything as it was a “joke”.  3 months passed and the jokes became a direct ask (to my wife only) from Donna and Jake, her mother, Jake’s Mother  and a “close friend”. When my wife and me started to discuss this we both agreed it was the best to gather everybody together to decline (we scheduled it for spring-break as all we live a couple of flights away from everybody). 

From time to time we talked about our decision,never changed our minds, but discussed the situation. During one of this talks I mentioned I did not agree due to different factors(my wife agreed on two of them):
- Pregnancy is not a game, mother/baby life are literally on risk.
- Although Donna and Jake always mentioned they would cover the cost of everything, what would happen if at some point they just turned around and said “we changed our minds”. (Not to mention we have no idea of the legal implications of the process)
- Some background on Donna: she decided not to have kids until now, when my first child was born there was this small talk around her plans for family and she told us that it was not in her plans(not with Jake yet) because she wanted to travel and meet all kind of different places (which she did), when my second child was born she (and Jake now) told us the same and even said they were not sure they wanted to become parents. I’m not judging her decision, I’m just mentioning the fact that pregnancy becomes more difficult with age and that is something you need to consider if having family is on your plans.

Last week we announced them we would decline their offer and everybody just froze, when we gathered them they thought we would announce we were accepting and this shocked them. Her family started blaming me and my wife about it, saying the common “family first” speech. They made us feel like shit and we decided to leave. I’ve been receiving calls every 2-3 days from Donna, Jake and all her family saying that I don’t have a word on it (even we are married and she is the mother of my kids) that she should be able to decide this on her own. during one of this talks with Donna I mentioned the reasons why I didn’t wanted to do it and she hung up on me and since then all her family completely shut down communication with us (not complaining on my side), but it affected my wife and the kids also started to ask why they dont get calls from her grandmother. AITA for telling her?


[Edited to add info on what I told to Donna.]

While I was explaining that we had two childs and didnt wanted to take any risk on my wife health she just kept interrupting me with “facts” about how small that chance was in the present time, and just kept talking about all her research. I got tired of having my(and my wife) actions questioned and told her (not verbatim): “This is a personal choice, I don’t like to justify my actions as I don’t like to ask for other people justifications. You and Jake decided to wait until now to have a family and we respected that can you do the same and respect our decision?”- that is when she hung up on me.

[Edited to add more info on why we told everybody and not only Donna and Jake]
The first call from a third party was from my wife’s mother. She started the conversation (according to my wife) with “we talked to your sister and she told us they asked you to....”- nobody else knew at that point so we assume this is true, then Jakes mother and then my wife (and sister in law) friend. At that point this became a regular topic during any call, we thought it would be a good idea to let everybody know at the same time as everybody was involved at that moment (not by our choice) and also because we felt it would make them feel better to have this delivered face to face. Huge mistake, but we never thought they would react the way they did.

[Edited, adding clarification]
I think there was a confusion, we always talked to them together. The initial approach was with my wife only but they didnt looked surprised when I mentioned it, so I just assumed they were relying the communication through her. My wife was clear on her position , they just assumed I was behind it. (I think they still do)

**[FINAL UPDATE ON THE POST]
I want to thank you for the support provided on this post, over PMs and for all your different opinions, it really helped us to see things with perspective and provided some comfort to my wife(I shared this post with her). We are sticking to our decision, we’re not surrogating for them. For those worried for my family(specially my wife) she is doing more than ok, as I mentioned we live far from everybody else(for the last 4 years) and although distance can take a toll on the family in this case is a blessing, we dont need that toxicity around us (specially around our children). No updates so far in the situation, we don’t have interest in resuming the relation with my SIL and BIL. As for my MIL well... I think my wife has the final word there but it doesnt matter what she decides I’ll be standing next to her side. [I’ll provide an update if anything changes hoping it helps somebody else in the same/similar situation I also think is the least I could do given the support we received, sincerely thank you all!]**",376,1862,0.97
35,Not the A-hole,"I was getting food at a pretty popular place, so lots of people are queued at the cashier (kind of like a fast food cashier system). It was just about to be my turn after waiting for around 15 minutes in line when an old lady (around early 60s) blurted out her order right beside me, obviously intending to cut (there's only 1 queue). So I got pretty annoyed but told her politely that there's a queue behind and many people are waiting for their turn to order and that she should too. She says that seniors have priority, but I said that there was no priority queue and there were seniors in queue behind us too.

She then says that a roaming security guard told her that she could cut, but the only security guards were at the entrances of the mall. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, but then she said the security guard was wearing black. All the security guards wore white, and none of them should have the authority to let people cut in line. She then says that she's sorry and she doesn't actually want to cut in line and is just doing what the security guard told her to. At this point, I was pretty sure she was lying, so I told her if she was sorry and didn't want to cut, then just go to the back of the line.

She ended up getting her order before me because the cashier took her order anyway (despite my protests). I just let it go in the end, but I was still annoyed. I told my sister about it, and she told me I shouldn't have done that because she was old. I come from an Asian family so they hold elders in high regard no matter their behavior or attitude, but I just couldn't help being annoyed and telling her (the old lady) off.

37,Not the A-hole,"  My parents have been separated since about 2006, but never actually divorced. I was about 12/13 at the time and things were bad. My dad had just started going to AA, my mom was trying to get on her feet since he was no longer in the picture as far as money went and hardly there for actual parenting. 

  She made everything work and looking back, I honestly don’t know how she accomplished it all without much help from dad. She was always present, no matter what. Dad, on the other hand, wasn’t really there because he was dealing with his problems. We saw him regularly, but he wasn’t exactly a parent. 

  Mom filed for and tried to finalize the divorce two times. The first was stopped because my dad threatened to take us away. He threatened to use anything it took to gain custody if she tried to get child support or actually divorce him. Whether it was true or not, Mom backed down. 

  She tried again a few years ago after my youngest sibling turned 18. 

  Dad, in the years between the first try and the second, hasn’t really made much of himself. He’s had failed businesses, but mainly gets income through selling off what he has left of his gold and silver collections. Mom has worked hard to move up in her company and has succeeded. She’s finally getting what she deserves and has an amazing man beside her. The time has come for a new chapter in her life but my dad wants alimony. I’m sure he can get it too. 

  Regardless of what the law is, I can’t keep quiet about how I feel. She’s worked so hard and I want her happily ever after. 

  So, would I be the asshole if I cut ties with my dad if he intends to seek alimony instead of just a cut and dry divorce?

EDIT:

  Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond. My siblings and I are going to help my mom through this and get this divorce finalized. 

  My goal here isn’t to cut my dad out of my life. However fucked up this situation is, I love him. He’s my dad. Ultimately, his actions will determine mine. And from what a few commenters have said, I don’t think he’ll be able to get alimony. Time will tell! 

  Hopefully I’ll have a positive update for everyone. 

  Thank you all, again :)",47,95,0.92
38,Asshole,"I'm an incoming college frosh and am torn between my options. For context, I want to go into \[FIELD A\] and I'm an American student.

Option 1: Both of these colleges are basically some of the absolute best (I'm talking about top 10) for \[FIELD A\] students. Furthermore, it'd be relatively cheap to attend them. I have a full ride into one of them, which means 0 burden on my parents.

Option 2: Both of my option 2 colleges are also very good colleges, though not necessarily quite *as* amazing as my option 1 colleges for \[FIELD A\]. The tuition for attending these colleges is very expensive, though alleviated since I managed to snag scholarships that turned the tuition costs from unrealistically high to low enough that I can consider them options. The tuition cost for attending option 2, including scholarship deductions, would be about four times the amount of attending option 1, if my parents *don't* support me at all financially.

Also, I'm ineligible for financial aid, so not an option,

Why in the world am I even looking at option 2, you ask? Location, location, location. This is where maybe a bit of naivety and shortsightedness on my part comes into play: the locations for option 1 to me are very drab and I can't imagine myself really enjoying the atmosphere / environment while living there. Option 2, on the other hand, is located in basically my dream state (both of the colleges in option 2 are in the same state), and I'm fairly confident that my student life there would be a blast.

My parents said they would financially support me to the point where basically my cost of attending option 2 would be *slightly* more expensive than attending option 1 (around $7k more for me to take out loans on). I have considered denying their financial support entirely, but I know for a fact that without this financial support from them, I will most definitely suffer from crippling ungrad student debt, possibly for the rest of my life.

If I accept option 2 and also accept financial support from my parents, my dad is going to have to wait another half a decade before he can retire. I cannot, in my good conscience, know that I'm the reason he has to wait even longer to retire than he already has, can I?

EDIT: I'm definitely leaning more towards option 1 now. You guys are right, I just need to grind out for several more years and then I can move wherever I want, and it'd be shortsighted to throw away a full ride. Also, I love my parents, and I know they love me to death, please don't think otherwise.",49,39,0.93
39,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account, long time lurker, hopefully this isn't considered a self-validation post since it took me a long time to get up the courage to type it...

My girlfriend and I have been together for the last seven years (eight years this July) and the last few months her libido has completely evaporated due to a combination of the medications she's on (which unfortunately, the side effects of said medications already mean if I don't initiate, we will most likely never have sex) and a new job she recently started.

Since starting the new job two months ago, any time I've wanted to have relations with her, the immediate answer has pretty much been, ""I'm really not in the mood right now.""

Under normal circumstances, this leads to me to continuing my advances, i.e. rubbing her back while we watch TV, massaging around her body, and in general being pretty physical while working my way 'down there' (since being physical with her sometimes helps get her into the mood). 

I ask a second time, and we either get intimate if she's changed her mind, or, if she says 'no' again, I drop it and we go back to whatever it was we were doing together prior to the whole shebang. 

Lately though for me it's been so long since we've done stuff together that I've felt pretty bad directly after being turned down (from both the blueballs and being rejected) that I haven't felt like continuing to be physical afterwards, completely dropping the rubbing / massaging, and not wanting to cuddle with her any more for the rest of the night.

After the first time I did it, she realized I intentionally dropped everything, which resulted in her feeling bad about saying 'no' to me since afterwards I barely talk and completely stop being physical until the next day.

After ~two weeks of me being shot down any time sex came up, and me continuing to be distant directly afterwards for the rest of the night, the following day she suddenly 'wanted to do stuff' with me that afternoon when she got off work.

I know her well enough to know she wasn't actually in the mood; she was pushing herself to have relations with me to try to make me feel better and so that we could start cuddling at night again. 

I turned her down since her initiating sex because of how I've been acting after being turned away turned me off even more. I had essentially guilted her into doing stuff with me, which isn't what I wanted (and made me feel even less desirable than I've already been feeling).

Which brings me to the TL;DR / entire point of my post: 
AITA for outwardly / actively not wanting much to do with my girlfriend directly after being rejected (which as of lately has been happening consistently / constantly)? 

I'm would never try to guilt her into doing anything with me because of me acting upset, I've just legitimately felt more and more upset and self-conscious since this began (advice appreciated).

Edit:
I don't only touch her I want sex. I'm still physical with her the entire rest of the time we're together / the entire day if we're both off work. It's only the hour or two after being rejected before we both go to sleep, where I feel rejected / depressed / like not being around anyone. 

Yes, I've talked to her about how I'm feeling, and it's been something we've communicated about since our first year together when I helped save her life and first got her on antidepressants. Unfortunately a side-effect of the antidepressants was loss of libido, but it wasn't instant, it was gradually over months, which we didn't realize at the time. 

She's mentioned coming off of them to get her libido back but I would never ask her to do that, or want her too. She's also hesitant to go on a different antidepressant, because she's got ADHD and sometimes forgets to take her meds, which if she does, she doesn't want to get sent into a suicidal spiral.

She's told me she's still physically attracted to me and still loves me no matter what, just that she hasn't been in the mood more than usual lately due to work and her medications.

I understand the situation and I'm not saying it's her fault for how she feels or that she can't help it. 

We're very open with our feelings and our relationship and I would never intentionally do something to her emotionally to manipulate her because that's a shit thing to do and because of what we've both been through (together and in our own lives). But it doesn't help how I feel immediately after getting consistently rejected, and I usually freeze her out for the rest of the night because I feel unwanted",88,28,0.82
40,No A-holes here,"I met my wife when our oldest was 1.  His dad is minimally involved, and his grandparents(father's parents) have always treated me, and referred to me as his father.  I have always loved him dearly as he is my son as far as I'm concerned....we recently had another, and I'm not afraid to say I am completely obsessed, smitten, and madly in love with this little boy.  He is 5 months old and the feelings I get when I am around him are like nothing I've ever experienced.    My wife has made multiple comments about me loving the youngest one more, to which I've always responded ""it's a different kind of love"" because it really is...he's a baby, I never knew to oldest as a baby.  This came up again today and she left for work pretty upset after I again said I love them both, but the love I have for the baby is very different.  I'm feel like this is normal, but AITA for actually saying this to her?  

Again I want to re-iterate I love them both and would do anything for either, but when I'm around the baby Ojust turn into the mushiest softest person in the world and I can't help it...

Edit: for more info...oldest is 7.  He loves his baby brother.  We still have many things that are special to us, but a lot of the disagreements between me and my wife center around discipline, as he is a 7 year old who has experienced a lot of life changes in the past couple years.  An example though what set things off today was when we were doing our taxes and she couldn't find oldest's social security card.  I wasn't worried because it must be somewhere right?

I was gonna go alone three days before the funeral as my Mother was gonna come three days after a funeral as she can’t handle attending acquaintances let alone her own Mother’s.

To cut things short I get nervous when going on flights and have a passive feeling of needing to vomit, but ironically looking out the window of the plane calms me and feel to just feel normal. When getting my seats I specifically wanted to have a window seat and as in the title I got it.

On the other seats I got a mom and a child around 7 or 8 years old where the mother politely asked if her child could seat in my seat. I told her no trying to ignore conversation and I’m already afraid to go alone. She would ask me why and I would say something along the lines for personal reasons. She would question me what these reasons were and I’d respond with she shouldn’t know about them. I must include that I did speak to her in a demeaning attitude because I was afraid not at her but the situation in general with the funeral and all. We wouldn’t speak to each other again throughout the flight but the mom continuously gave me a death glare throughout the flight. However, I could see the child to not really care about the seat only to be bored.

I go to a local comic book shop to buy dice and look around a couple times a month. I noticed they had a small fish tank on the counter. It contained one betta and 3 snails, and the fish looked unhealthy. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know what I’d say, and I didn’t want to be insensitive 

Fast forward a week, I go back to show the store to my friend. The betta is still there and the tank looks worse than before. It has a lot of algae, very dirty gravel and no live plants. The tank is about 5/6 full and the top is dusty. Being a smaller tank (2.5 gallons) it needs to be cleaned frequently. The snails look ok, but the betta’s color is dull and looks to have ammonia burns. 

My question is, am I the asshole if I tell the shop owner his betta is clearly unhealthy? My plan would be to submit anonymously through a suggestion box.

She's always relied on me to remind her to take the pills when shes really busy with school, otherwise, she does a good job remembering. It's getting closer to finals time and has a lot of projects and she has been forgetting to take her pills here and there and having to make the pill up by taking it early the next day. AITA for not going out of my way to remind her to take her pills every day in order to have kids? I mean it is her responsibility to take the pills every day to make sure she does not get pregnant.

46,Asshole,"I am the head of my department, and there is an employee in my specific department (who we’ll refer to as Jamie) who, for the past four months, has been caring for her brain cancer-stricken mother full time, in addition to working full-time at our business and raising two children on her own. I greatly admire Jamie commitment to her family, have deep sympathy for her plight, but...I’d be lying if I said she hasn’t been a **huge** burden on the company.

Her call-outs are very excessive, and are usually mere hours before her shifts begin. Her reasons for calling out are almost always related to her mother. I would estimate she’s missed about a quarter of her shifts; rarely a week goes by without her calling out, and many weeks she has had multiple call-outs. As we are not a huge company, it has been an incredible pain for us. The same group of people have repeatedly had to come in on their days off, or work ridiculously long hours. For me, it’s always extremely stressful and chaotic having to scramble around last minute, call multiple people, and try and get things under wraps. Many employees have begun refusing to work any extra days at all, as a result, and have grown frustrated with me for keeping her around. If we knew well in advance what days she was unable to work, we’d be able to accommodate her, but the last-minute and unpredictable nature of things is too much. 

While I’ve been very supportive of Jamie, I have dropped small hints to her that it’s becoming more and more difficult to accommodate her. After four months of this, I made a difficult decision. A few days ago, I discussed the issue with the manager of our business and told him that I think termination would be the best option. He agreed with me very strongly. I pulled Jamie into my office, and began things by telling her what a great employee she’s been, how much I admire her devotion to her mother; but told her that as much as I regret it, we have to let her go. Her eyes swelled up with tears, she grew very angry at me, and stormed out, not returning for the rest of the day.

I feel **awful** about hurting Jamie and making her living situation all the more difficult, and hate now forever having the stigma at my workplace of being, “the guy who fired the employee caring for her cancer-stricken mother.” Nevertheless, I feel I had no choice, and did what I had to to help keep a stable workplace and cater to the needs of my other employees.

In a drunken nonsensical idea I (M30) decided to host an after-party for them to have a private space to sort that out. 

Well turns out he didn't go for it after she was basically throwing herself at him. He left like 2am. 

She couldn't drive so she just stayed drinking shooting the shit.

She ended up moving up closer to me and getting handsy. I didn't do anything really to stop it, booze related. She started kissing me and I guess I went with it. She stopped a bunch of times saying she didn't want to ruin our friendship, we'd talk, get handsy. Repeat. We ended up having sex. 

It didn't feel right, I don't even think I enjoyed it and I changed my mind during it because I remember getting up and telling her that we couldn't keep going.

I grew up bearing the brunt of a lot of “Sam’s” anger issues. He is 4 years older than me and would physically be able to pick me up and throw me around. 

My parents refused to get him any kind of help when he was a kid though and instead would say things like “He’ll grow out of it” and he’s just “acting out”. 

Despite all of the shit I dealt with under his hands, I’ve never had the heart to be able to cut him out or the rest of my family. 

The last relationship that my brother had ended with him being physical and the girl having to leave him. He is also a master gaslighter and have been manipulating my parents for as long as I can remember, resulting in him having a “Golden Child” status with them. He also has been seen in a positive light by everyone his whole life, because he is good looking and athletic and this is partly why he has been able to get away with so much. 

After the last relationship my brother had, the police had to get involved and Sam had to take court ordered anger management classes, and he is once again in another relationship. My parents mentioned it to me this weekend while I was over at their house for supper and they mentioned that she is a “really lovely girl and they hope that she is better for him that the last one.”

I could have screamed it was so much victim blaming and Sam never having to take responsibilities for his actions. 

I didn’t say anything about it to my parents but when I got home I talked to my girlfriend about how frustrated I am with the whole situation. 

She told me that I had a duty to talk to this girl and warn her about what my brother is like and is capable of before he hurts her too. 

I thought about it and I told her that I don’t think I can get involved because I can’t always be there to warn off girls from dating my brother and I doubt anybody would believe me anyways because Sam is viewed as the “perfect” guy.

60,Not the A-hole,"Before I start, I'd just like to say I respect the hell out of military men and women who put their lives on the line for me and people like me.

I was sitting with two buddies of mine, both male, one's girlfriend, and her female friend. Somehow we got on the topic of selective service. Both of my buddies said if they were drafted, they'd definitely go to war. One for the reason that it'd be ""an interesting life experience."" Wasn't really a fan of this but it doesn't matter.

I said that I would flee the draft. On saying this, the girlfriend (call her D) turned to me and said, in what I believe to be all seriousness, ""that's really cowardly of you."" Then her friend really pushed back at me, asking where I'd go to live if not the US. I stayed calm, basically said I didn't know. D's friend stayed quiet for the rest of the night, and I figure I really pushed some buttons.

My reasoning is this: I really don't know the motivation or intent of the person that tells me I need to kill someone for my country. I've read about soldiers being made into killers time and time again (see *Ordinary Men*). I don't want to go there as a human being. Truth is, I just flat out don't trust that whatever thing I'm fighting against is a real enemy in this scenario. Was North Korea's missile launch fabricated by a third party? How would I know? Can I kill a man with that level of uncertainty?

D and her friend were whispering to each other for the rest of the night, and the friend didn't say a word to me, even when I made a point to, at the end of the night, say ""nice meeting you"" and be cordial and all that. She didn't say a word to me as I just got out of the car and went home.

I felt really unwelcome there, but my two buddies didn't really care. They didn't push back against the conversation getting very intense very quickly, nor did they call me a coward or engage in any such name calling.

Maybe I am a coward, but am I the asshole for saying I'd run?

So the general consensus was that I was being a raging asshole, though a few thought I was just ignorant. It's been a while since I made that post, and my own conclusion is that I am probably both.

I've done a LOT of thinking about my behavior that week and I've realized a lot of things. This isn't something that I wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like I was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and I had been in a terrible mood. I wasn't acting like myself at all. Instead of coping in a healthy way, I'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

The date wasn't really for her, it was for ME, and that's what I'd been trying to avoid thinking about. I was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that I was just upset because this problem had happened before. The truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. I was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

That was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

I apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. Because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem I asked her if she had PCOS or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

We went to have her examined and it turns out that she has PCOS, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. So yeah, I felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. Luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. She'll be getting regular treatment from now on so I'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

TLDR; I was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has PCOS. Thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. Thanks for the help, Reddit.",493,17551,0.94
70,Not the A-hole,"So, I went into a bathroom at the airport (in NY) about an hour before my flight... There were about 20 stalls; I went into about 8 of them with piss all over the seat. Like, this was literally the worst bathroom I’ve ever been in. Eventually I found a stall that was pretty clean (or didn’t have piss all over the seat).

After I did my business I went to the sink to wash my hands. Now, one of my friends asked if I was going to rate the bathroom as I was leaving (they had those buttons that said “good,” “ok,” or “bad” on them on the door), so I pushed the “bad” button. 

Now, I didn’t even realize that he cleaning lady was like right behind me... but she yelled at me and said “Really?!” So I turned around to face her and said “Yeah! A ton of the toilets had piss all over the seats.” So then she started saying stuff like “Are you kidding me?” and “Did you even look?” or “Why would you say that?” So I just told her that I could take her to the specific stalls that I saw the piss everywhere. She just ended up shaking her head at me in disbelief so I left the bathroom with my friends. 

I feel bad because the lady was standing RIGHT there as I did it. It was not meant to be an insult but it WAS very gross. And, when she started arguing with me about it I just felt very frustrated.

74,Not the A-hole,"I am the mother of a 4 year old girl, and recently had her pictures taken by a well-reviewed child photographer in our community. She has a very popular Facebook page for her business which she posts her pictures on (with parents’ permission, of course). After doing the shoot, she told me that she’s interested in featuring my daughter on her Facebook page, as her main profile picture, and asked for my permission to do this. I accepted.

A while later, she finished working on the pics and posted her picture on her page. It received a ton of likes and comments, which made me proud to see, but I was made uncomfortable by one comment I saw, made by a middle-aged man with a Russian-sounding name. He posted, in very broken English, about how he wants to “squeeze her cheeks” and what a “doll” she is, which sounded a tad odd for a stranger to post about a child. I looked at his profile, and saw that nearly **all** of his likes are child photography/modeling pages or fan pages for young girl actresses.

Looking over the other likes and comments on this photo and other ones, I found at least ten other men (all of them foreign Russians) who frequent her page, comment on and like her photos, and all have tons of likes on their pages relating to child modeling/young actresses. I sent the photographer a message, telling her about these men and sending her links to their profiles, and she responded with a short message saying she’ll deal with it. A couple days later, she posted some more pictures of my daughter, and I saw these same men’s names in the “like” section, meaning that they were not blocked and were still looking at her page.

I sent a follow-up message, and she responded a little frustratedly that liking child photography pages on Facebook doesn’t make someone a predator; she emphasized how most of **her** likes are fellow child photographer pages, and asked me if that makes her a predator. She said there’s nothing explicitly illegal on these guys’ pages, and she believes in “innocent until proven guilty.” She said that she welcomes views and likes from people “of any culture, race or country” and that it would be very small-minded and ignorant not to. I can tell that she thinks I’m just some busybody making a big deal out of nothing and trying to stir up drama.

I then told her if she’s not going to block these men from her page, I want all my daughter’s pictures taken down from her page as soon as possible. After a bit of squabbling, she did so. I’ve been telling all of my many mom friends about the incident, and encouraging them to go with another photographer or at absolute least not consent to having their kids’ pictures up on her page.

84,,"So, I’m 19 years old. I was dating my ex for almost 2.5 years. It was the best relationship I ever had; the only real point of contention was that throughout the relationship, he always asked me if I wanted to have sex and I always told him I just didn’t feel ready. He never “pressured” me, but I could always tell his disappointment. The most we ever did was making out/heavy groping with clothes.

Well 6 days ago, we broke up. He told me that he loved me, but he just didn’t feel sexually satisfied and that he wished me the best, but he thinks it’s best if we see other people. I was obviously distraught. I felt ugly and unwanted and that nobody would ever love me.

3 days after when I was feeling particularly down, a co-worker started hitting on me. I was feeling really low about myself and he talked about how sexy I was and how my boyfriend was an idiot to break up with me. He suggested that maybe we should go to his car. We did and to make a long story short, we ended up at a park having sex. I just felt like I lost everything because of this dumb virginity thing, and he made me feel so wanted and beautiful.

Well that night, my ex called me begging for me back. That he’s okay with waiting and that he loves me. I was so happy but I felt SOO guilty. I tried to bring it up subtly (I said we should get tested) and he was insistent that he didn’t even kiss another person, but if I really wanted him to, he will. I hinted we should probably get tested together when he said that was a ridiculous idea and he knows I’m clean.

I admitted to him I was feeling really low and actually did end up hooking up with someone. It looked like his heart was being ripped out of his chest. He was solemn for a bit and told me “if you just did some heavy petting, I don’t think you need to get tested” when I admitted we actually had sex.

He turned **extremely** angry. Let me be clear; I’ve known this man for 2 years. He’s never even cursed when he hits his foot on the bed, so this was *completely* out of character. He said if “all I wanted to do was whore around, then I should’ve told him a long time ago so he wouldn’t waste his time with me” and a bunch of other horrible things that makes me sad to repeat :(. He told me we were over and to never speak to him again, and then he blocked me on everything. He also told ALL of our mutual friends that “I wanted to be a hoe and fuck my old, creepy co-worker a day after we broke up and that I’m a raging bitch”. My mutual friends all sided with him and nobody wanted to hear that I was just lonely and needed someone, nor would anyone acknowledge that we were broken up at that point and I didn’t have any obligation to him.

My friends’ reactions’ hurt; I lost many of them and everyone’s bullying me. I feel horrendous about the entire thing, but I still don’t see how I was in the wrong. HE broke up with ME, and in my mind, we were done. AITA for sleeping with another person?

85,Asshole,"So I have 2 kids, a son that is almost 2 and a daughter that is 6 months, because of this we tend to go to a lot of activities to get out of the house and so the kids can burn off some steam before nap time. I like to take pictures while we’re there because my son’s father and I aren’t together so he likes when I can send pictures of our son playing and doing stuff; I also take pics for my boyfriend as he works away so he also likes to have me send him pics of what me and the kids do. 

Anyways I was at playgroup one day and I was taking pictures of my son playing when a mom approached me and told me I wasn’t allowed to post the pictures I had just taken on to social media because one of her kids happened to be in the background.

86,Not the A-hole,"I (30 m) am recently divorced after 8 years of marriage. I figured I would give tinder a try just to see what it had to offer. I matched with a girl, let's call her Trogdor (30 f), and we hit it off. We went on a generic first date of coffee and conversation that ended with a kiss.  We didn't really click in person like we did over text. I don't know why I kissed her, maybe it was just as a kind gesture.  I figured that there wouldn't be a second date.


We didn't talk for about a month after our first date. One night she texts me at around midnight with a, ""You up?""  Now, I might have been put of the dating pool for about 10 years but I know that this is 100% a booty call. Trogdor doesn't have a vehicle so I drive to her house about 45 minutes away. As I'm pulling into her driveway I see her leaving the porch and walking towards my truck. She gets in and tells me her roommate is asleep and doesn't want to wake her up. She tells me she wants to go to the beach. I've never had sex on the beach, but that doesn't seem like the ideal place to fornicate. 

So, we are walking down the beach looking for a somewhat secluded place to sit. I find a spot to sit and she immediately straddles me. We start to kiss and all I can think is, ""what the fuck is that smell?""
Trogdor's mouth smells like hot shit. I am instantly nauseous. She continues to kiss me as I try not to breath. My stomach is turning. I turn my head away from her, "" I don't feel good. My stomach hurts, I think I might be sick."" This was after about 30 seconds of kissing. Trogdor's mood quickly changes from sex crazed dragon to almost a motherly demeanor. I tell her that I think I should go home. As soon as we get back in my truck the the sympathy was gone. ""We could have sexy time in here"", said the sex crazed dragon as she grabbed my genitals.  ""I'd rather not, I think I just want to go home.""  I tell her as I start driving back to her house. After 5 minutes of silence and her staring a hole in the side of my head I give her a quick glance. She immediately follows with rapid fire questions, ""Why don't you want to have sex with me?"" ""What's wrong?"" ""Am I really that boring?"" I just say ""I'm sorry."" She keeps asking what's wrong. I can't take it, but I don't want to tell her the truth. I tell her, ""I don't feel good, and I recently got out of a long relationship and I'm not ready for this."" ""This"" being the interrogation that I was currently going through. I know my statement was vague and could have been taken a number of different ways but that was the last thing I said. As we pulled into her driveway she just stared at me and ask "" seriously? "" before sighing in disgust.

90,Not the A-hole,"So me and my gf got into a huge fight because she wants to cook something for me that I don't want to eat. A little background info, we're from different cultural backgrounds and she isn't used to cooking with as many spices. So anyways, she has cooked for me before and has been unhappy with my response to her asking me how her food was. I've let her know what I like and she still doesn't do it. I'm wholly capable of making my own meals but she thinks it's a nice and loving gesture for her to make food for me and I think it definitely is a nice gesture, but I like what I like and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. 

This particular argument began with her wanting to prepare something I definitely wasn't going to like as I'm not a fan of one of the base ingredients. I told her this and she basically said sometimes we have to suck it up and eat things even if we might not like them. Now I'm 24 and I'm completely capable, as I said before, of cooking for myself so I mentioned that if that were the case she should make that for herself and I'll make something for myself. (I thought this was a perfect compromise, no?). She got very upset and said that that's not how relationships work and reiterated that sometimes we have to suck it up. My response was that we're different people and that's ok, we can do different things, i.e. she and I can make our own food unless it's something that we mutually enjoy. We continue to argue and it got pretty bad. (Also she wouldn't accept my answer to why I didn't like that particular ingredient. My answer was because I don't and I believe that sometimes an explanation isn't necessary)

95,Not the A-hole,"Let me start off by giving some context to the situation. My fiancé and his family are Indian, and I and my family are white American. We got engaged last October, and ultimately both of our groups of parents very generously offered a large amount of money for the wedding. We plan on having an Indian wedding, as well as a civil ceremony, which means it is a multi-day affair, effectively making the total cost skyrocket. Extra days of events means extra food, extra decor, extra space rentals, extra photographers, etc. etc. 

My parents were very no-strings-attached and said they just want us to be happy (that we could take the money and put a down payment on a house or go on vacation for all they care). My parents are divorced, and both provided a huge amount of money within their means and easily covers my family and our friends. 

However, my fiancé’s parents have not been as lax. They said that they would match however much my parents decided to give and would not go higher. Okay, fine. Still a very generous amount of money, and would cover a healthy amount of guests. 

We sat down and discussed who they would like invited, and their number of people is effectively double the number of my family and our (mine and fiancé’s) mutual friends combined. They insist that they do not need to provide any more money, and that as long as we “plan smart, don’t use as many flowers, and don’t use fancy decorations” that we should be able to accommodate everyone. It is simply not true. Without going too much into financials, it would cost an extra $10,000 to accommodate the extra people his parents want to invite for the reception alone. Forget the extra ceremonies. They’ve gone so far as to say we should just cut the other ceremonies, which would take away from the whole point of having an Indian wedding. 

In addition, we are receiving extra pressure from them because they recently attended a large Indian wedding that they EXTREMELY disliked, because the couple was over budget and had to cut corners, resulting in poor planning, not as “fancy” decorations, and not great food (all things they insisted we need to avoid). 

My fiancé and I are at an impasse with his parents. They are demanding that we invite all of their guests, but aren’t willing to pay any extra cash for them. When we explain that we have to cut the guest list to reasonably stay in budget, they say “it’s not the Indian way” or “we’ll be exiled from the Indian community” or “well, the bride’s family is supposed to pay for everything anyway, so we’ve already been plenty generous”. 

We’ve barely spoken with his parents in weeks. We are a year out from our planned wedding date, and we can’t even book a venue because his parents won’t settle on financials and guest list.

She then created a petition/appeal to the school administration, which I signed. This was also signed by several other students and even teachers and other staff. I was also very vocal about the matter on social media. I got into a few arguments (nothing major) where I posted some statistics I had researched. I even spoke with the newspaper about the issue. 

Yesterday, my girlfriend told me that it was embarrassing that I was supporting this, because I'm just ""stirring the pot"" and doing this for attention.

So my sister has been having an affair with a married man for the last 2 years, and is now trying to have her first child (either with him, or if he's not willing, through a sperm donor).

Because it's not possible to get the necessary procedures done in the country where she lives, she has been coming to stay with me and my husband for extended periods of time, while she goes through multiple rounds of egg freezing. In total, she stayed in our house for just over 3 months in the past year. We allowed it because we want to be supportive of her having a child, but honestly it was a strain on our personal life having a houseguest for such a long period of time. We both have stressful jobs with long hours, and it's difficult when you just want to come home and unwind / relax in privacy, but instead need to entertain a houseguest.

Now, the egg freezing was just a backup option, and this year she is finally going through with IVF to have her child. I always assumed she would do this at home, in the country where she lives, but she has decided to have the child in my country instead as it will be ""more convenient"" and she ""wants them to have a (country where I live) passport"".

Family is important to me, but the idea of her staying with us for several months while in the last stages of pregnancy, and then having a newborn in our house until she's ready to travel home - it fills me with dread and I honestly don't think I could tolerate it.

101,Not the A-hole,"Back in February I made the dumbest decision I’ve ever made and I got a $16,000 car loan out in only my name for my best friend of 11 years. (I’m 23, she’s 24) she was out of a car and I felt like I could trust her to make the $290 monthly payment along with the $118 insurance. Her credit wasn’t too good because of some medical bills. (I know, I’m an idiot.. I don’t need a lecture)

Well, she’s made her payments on time so far, but started dating this 38 year old controlling asshole who just got out of prison in October. She told me that he threatened to kill her if she broke up with him and I made her get the cops involved, she ended up getting back with him the very next day. That was in the beginning of March. So I stopped talking to her at all. I’m just done trying to help her at this point & would like to end the friendship. I’ve come to realize she treats me like shit anyway.

She had told me she was moving 3 hours away, to where he lives, but told me she was going to wait until their relationship was stronger and more solid. 
Yeah right, within that time period he made her delete all social media. 

I haven’t spoken to her since March 18th, my grandma that raised me my whole life died on March 21st and I never even heard from her, which really hurt me. and on March 26th she sent me the insurance money over Venmo.

Well I finally decided to touch base with her and make sure she’s going to pay me for the month of May. I’m moving 8 hours away and don’t want to be stressed out while I move. I go to iMessage her and it sends as a text. 
I talked to a few mutual friends and they said her phone is shut off, she either quit her job or transferred, and she moved two weeks ago. 

I now would like to get that car back and give it to my mom, who’s in need of a car, and who I can trust to make the payments. I want to just wash my hands of the situation with her. 

Am I the asshole if I get ahold of her probation officer (she’s actually a felon, I know I’m dumb) or the police and make her bring the car back?

UPDATE: I am on my way to pick the car up right now. She finally texted me and said she understood that I was taking it and the keys would be outside.",24,54,0.91
102,No A-holes here,"Good morning aita, so I guess this is sort of humorous but I can tell while my wife is approaching this with humor, I also think she’s really disappointed in me.

So we live in a place where there are scorpions. We’ve seen them in the desert by our house but never in our house or yard. So last night I was in bed reading on iPad when out of the corner of my eye I swore I saw something moving on my wife’s side of the covers. I looked closer and it was a freaking scorpion. 

I screamed like a little girl and jumped out of bed and out of the room but was too afraid to go back in. My wife jumped up a little startled and asked me what was wrong. I told her there was a scorpion in the bed. She laid down because she thought I was pranking her and told me if I came back to bed I might get lucky. I told her I wasn’t kidding so she grabbed her phone and turned on the flash light and sure enough she saw it.

Because she’s way manlier than me she just sort of smashed it in the blanket between her hands and got up to wash all the sheets and do a check around the house for more. I was basically hyperventilating mess and was so freaked out that it was in our bed for gods sake. I didn’t sleep a wink last night and my wife is not so gently teasing me about my freak out. 

Am I the asshole here?",105,267,0.93
103,Asshole,"Me and my best friend have been trying to move in together and get an apartment in a big European city for several month. It was pretty hard as the market here is super competitive. One of my friends had offered me a little apartment in the city center a while ago, but I declined as it was not big enough for both of us to move into, and we really wanted to move in together. We finally got a super nice apartment due to some strings one of my family members pulled.

&#x200B;

We both were super excited to finally live together in a way we had been envisioning for a long time. A week or so after we moved in my friend met a guy online and they got together super quick (like 5 days after their first date). I am really happy for her and me and the bf get along really well and we do like each other. The only issue I have is, that basically from the very first date they ever had, my friend has been sleeping over at his apartment every single night. I get that you wanna see your SO as much as you can when you're freshly in love and I don't have a problem with her sleeping over there per se, but it is literally every single night. The one or two times she actually has slept in her room in our apartment have always been a blast and we had an amazing time together. She and her bf have slept over here together once or twice as well and we also had a really fun and nice time then too (I do like him as I said), but they  prefer to usually sleep at his place.

&#x200B;

My issue now is that I can feel myself getting more and more pissed off everytime she leaves to sleep at his place. I don't mind sleeping alone a couple times a week, but being alone in the apartment every single night, right after we moved in is not what I have signed up for when we moved in here together.  I know that she technically does not own me anything as long as she pays rent, but I just can't help how I feel. Every time I mention the topic she really does give me the feeling of being jealous or not understanding of her situation. I don't want to come of as if I don't want her to spend time with him or anything like that, but I really can't help the way I feel rn, which is somewhat hurt and pissed off. Me and my friend really do have a strong and good friendship and maybe I can't see that I am being an asshole rn due to my own feelings. All I ask for her is to sleep over at our place at least once or twice a week. I really hate waking up, or going to bed, knowing there is no one else in the apartment, and if I would have known, that she wouldn't be spending much time here I would have probably moved in with someone else.

104,Not the A-hole,"Over time, I've come to terms with the fact that I identify more as a girl than a guy. Even though I spend a lot of my time fantasizing about living as a woman and feel a deep sense of happiness thinking of myself as a woman (it's hard to put the feelings into words) it's also not something that is causing me negative emotions. I'm very neutral about living as a guy and it doesn't really bother me. If I had to compare it with anything, it would probably be like wishing you were a millionaire. Everybody wants to be rich, but not being rich is also fine.

The thought of wanting to transition to achieve this ""extra"" sense of happiness from completely becoming a woman has occurred to me a lot, but my truly honest reason why I wouldn't do it is because my body is very masculine. I have broad shoulders, more masculine facial features, and overall as far as my body goes, there isn't really anything ""feminine"" about it. It's honestly a complete contrast to how I feel as a person inside.

I just know that if I were to start treatment, then I would never be happy with the result. I'm afraid that I would constantly try to chase after more ""femininity"" and it would end up being a never-ending quest. And while I know that hormonal treatment can help, I don't think that in my case it would help much.

What makes me feel like an asshole is that I feel like with this explanation, I'm also kind of ""insulting"" other transgender people who are going through the treatment or wanting to. Saying that having a masculine body makes it harder to transition. Truth is, this is just how I feel about myself and I don't mean to project this onto anybody else, but I'm afraid that if I came up with this explanation then some people might see this as a personal attack?",51,88,0.83
105,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory first post ever.

I'm a 20 year old guy living with three roommates in a duplex house. Two guys who I get along with very well, and one girl who is becoming an increasingly bad roommate (in our eyes). We'll call her Sandy. 

For the first few months things had been great, bills paid evenly and on time, chores evenly distributed, etc. However, over the last 3-4 months, Sandy has been falling behind on the utility bills for the household. Our agreement is that one of the male roommates has all of the utilities in his name, and we pay him back 1/4 of the total of all the bills each month. In total, Sandy owes $309 in past utilities, which I and the other two male roommates assume will not be paid, and will only continue to grow each month until she moves out.

Presently, my male roommates and I decided that if she is going to make zero effort to pay the money she owes (which is the case, she finds money to buy and take care of animals, booze money, etc but will not pay off the $309) that we would cut her off of our WiFi access. We changed the SSID and password, shared it between the three of us, and that was that.

A day later Sandy is instantly angry about the Wi-Fi situation. She has no mobile data (cannot afford it), so our Wi-Fi is her only internet access that isn't public. Immediately after yelling about how she deserves internet access, she went and pulled the plug on the router. We plugged it back in, 20 minutes later she did the same thing. We plugged it back in again. Since then that has stopped, but still. That alone is a pretty childish gesture in my eyes. I don't believe she really has any right to the utilities in our house if she is making absolutely no effort to pay for them. Why should the other two roommates and I pay for Sandy to sit in an air conditioned room on her phone all day? 

TLDR: One of my four roommates has not payed utility bills in 3 months, and we expect her to not pay that debt or any additional debt in the future. In response we changed the WiFi so she cannot use it.

AITA for keeping the internet access open for only those in my house who pay for it?

Edit: hey guys, just wanted to fill in a little more information for context on Sandy. The two other roommates and I have brought up multiple times how she is behind on bills. She constantly says she's ""working hard and will start trying to pay it off"" for the last three months and we have seen none of this in action. She recently moved in her new boyfriend and his two cats without discussing it with any of us. In addition, this new boyfriend isn't pitching in for any rent or utilities either. He has been here for a month and a half. He is unemployed and sits around the house all day, only leaving to drive Sandy to and from her job. The litterbox for the two cats is also only cleaned every 4-5 days, not daily. Am I still the asshole?",57,141,0.95

Context: I’ve been watching GoT for years now and this is the last season and it’s really important to me. I can’t stop thinking about it. My girlfriend knows this as I tried early in the relationship to get her to watch it by starting from the first season so we could watch the last when it came out. But eventually she told me that she doesn’t really care for it and stopped for most of the year while I continued my rewatch. When I told her that the last season was approaching she started to watch again and promised that she would catch up in time.

It’s the day of and she’s once again stopped trying to catch up (she’s in S5E6) and she’s only been watching it without me as in whenever I’m over and ask to watch it she shoots that down.

To me it seems like she doesn’t care about it and I love the show. The kicker is she doesn’t want me to watch the season premier tonight because she wouldn’t be there to watch it with me. My issue is that she’s had all this time to catch up and now she wants me to risk spoilers (which I vehemently hate) and miss the excitement of talking about it with my friends.

One thing I made abundantly clear is that having a gun in the house was a big no for me. I'm a suicde survivor and feel super uncomfortable around guns. she agreed and we moved in together. 

6 months later....
I wonder out into the lounge and find her looking at guns, I ask what that is about and she says she is going to get a gun. 
I jokingly said oh a paintball gun, and she replied no a real one. I said that we agreed no guns in the house, she made a huffing noise and went into her room. 

turns out she has started the process to get a gun. I then told her I'm moving out if she gets a gun as I would feel super unsafe with one around and she told me to man up and I should feel safer with one in the house.

112,Not the A-hole,"So for a bit of context, my GF has claimed to be sick for the past couple of days, but that hasn't stopped her from going out with friends or work.


In the morning I began cleaning both our bathrooms and the kitchen and asked if my GF would help. She declined because she was sick, I was fine with this and continued on my way. After I just finished mopping, the tap and our laundry broke and wouldn't turn off. I could tell it was just a washer that needed replacing, but because it was more of a drizzle instead of a drip I turned the water and started to replace it.


We recently moved into this apartment and I wasn't familiar with the plumbing in the laundry, so it took me a while to figure out how to get the tap off and replace the washer. While this was happening my GF was questioning my ability to change the washer, even though Id done it tons of times at my old place. I was becoming irritated at this and she kept nudging me to get a plumber to do it... On a Sunday. I kept telling her once I got the tap off it will be a simple job but she wouldn't stop pestering me about it. Anyway I fixed the tap without a plumber and went to sit down.


So half the day is gone, I have assignments to do for uni, and I only just sat down for the first time today when she began asking me to do all these other trivial things that didn't need to be completed right now. I was kinda ignoring her because I just want to rest for 10 minutes, before I finally snapped and told her to shut up. She stormed out of the room and went to the bedroom. A few moments later I hear beeping from my WiFi speaker, and thought she must have confused it with the one that is in the bedroom. Although she pumped it to max volume and played the chorus to Lily Allen's 'Fuck You'. This just pissed me off even more.


She came out of the room and started talking to me and I told her I didn't want to talk and to leave me alone. She started asking me what was wrong and that it was only just a song, but I really did not want to talk to her at this time. She would not leave me alone, I constantly told her I didn't want to talk, I changed seats and rooms but she wouldn't leave me alone. She just kept asking what's wrong, what did I do. I was ready to leave the apartment just to get some peace, and she only stopped once I put my shoes on and got my keys. She asked me about 100 times what's wrong and I told her each time I don't want to talk and to leave me alone. 


As a result I didn't want to go with her to her mother's house for dinner as she just kept pushing and pushing me over the edge. I wanted some time to myself and relax since she wouldn't give it me. Now she's super angry at me for not going saying everything is my fault, her mother is texting me complaining about a $5 pizza she brought me for dinner that no one wants and I just over this day!

113,Not the A-hole,"Posting on mobile so, sorry if it’s formatted rubbish.

I’m a 25 year old transgender man (FTM), from the UK, and have been living as my true self for about 5 years now, and never in my life have I had to deal with anything like this. My previous employers handled my transition amazingly even though they are a garbage company to work for.

I started working at my new job for the postal company about 10 months ago, I had to disclose my identity at my interview because I haven’t had time to change my passport over to my current name yet, but everything else I own is in the correct name.

Now, I have disclosed my identity to 4 people who I trust, because I’m very open about who I am but only to people I deem trustworthy to keep it to themselves because I don’t want be seen as essentially the gossip of the shop floor, and if I want to tell people it will be on my own terms.

Anyway, yesterday I was working with someone who trained me when I first started and she was talking about something and I disclosed that I’m trans to her because she’s a nice woman and she’s 100% not a gossiper. She then told me that she already knew I was trans, and I was shocked because how does she know if I’ve not told her? So I asked, and she said on my first day before I’d even walked in the building one of the managers said ‘you’ll be working with this new starter, and this is what their name used to be.’ I was absolutely livid at not only telling a, at the time, total stranger that I’m trans, but also telling her what my birth name was! Gobsmacked is an understatement.

I then found out that at the beginning of the week a different manager outed me to 3/4 people in a new section I would be working with, telling them to ‘be careful’ with me, and when they asked why, he told them because I’m trans.

I’ll be seeing my union rep first thing tomorrow morning because it’s unacceptable and seeing what my options are. I don’t think any of it was done out a malice but it was a very poor and misguided decision on their part.

So WIBTA if I take it all the way? Because people could lose their jobs over this, and I think I’d feel guilty about it.

Tl;dr: 2 managers outed my trans status to other employees at work and I’m thinking of reporting them.

Update: thank you everyone for your responses, don’t know if anyone will even see this update, I spoke to one of the managers and we’ve sorted things out, I went to the union and top manager at my office about the other manager and made it clear it’s not acceptable, and I don’t want to work under her anymore and make you aware of the situation, that was fine and he told me if anything else happens come back. So today I find out other members of staff are now gossiping about me, being rather derogatory, calling me an ‘it’, and speculating what I have or haven’t had done etc.
I’m not just frustrated anymore, I’m angry and upset, I spoke to my union again who relayed it to the top manager and he wants me to see him Friday morning to make a for al complaint. 
I really wanted to give that manager the benefit of the doubt, but she’s the reason all her section know I’m trans so unfortunately it will be escalating now.",159,351,0.88

Her doctors and nutritionist have given her a very clear diet plan to help with intestinal issues. A few things on this diet is that she is to cut out acidic foods and dairy. She is also supposed to avoid as much as possible sugar and gluten. These four things are for her intestinal issues 

When she doesn’t follow this diet, it is extremely pain but that’s really it. Doctors tell her to use over the counter laxative. There is nothing really that can be done for her. Pain killers can make constipation even worst. My parents took her to the ER 5 days ago and same story.

A registered person has to be there to pick him up or we will get in big trouble with CPS. I’m not leaving work early and possibly miss my brother bus to be told the same stuff. 

I told her to it suck up take a laxative and call me back in 4 hour. She replied wanted go now. I told her to get an Uber than. She didn’t, so the pain wasn’t bad enough to pay $40. She calls my parents and they don’t answer. So she leaves a bunch of crying voice mails and texts about how awful I was. 

She ended up being fine a few hour later after she took her laxative. But she is still mad at me and my parents are very upset and annoying with how handled because I need to be nicer to her.

They cannot stand each other and so my future mother in law (FMIL) clung to my fiancée with all her might and has a really close relationship to her.She is obsessed with her and wants to spend every second of every day with her.In example: my fiancée was at a baby shower for someone in their family,FMIL grabbed my fiancée and said in front of a group of people ""This is my baby and I don't get to see her as much as I'd like to, I'd like to see her every single day if I could!"" I could go on for days telling creepy stories of things her mom has done.

FMIL has no sense of how much things cost.She will buy things on impulse just because she thinks its cute (even if she does not need it).She has not worked in the past 10 years or so and so I have no clue how she is paying off her credit card debt.  She only eats at nice sit down restaurants and she wont buy anything from cheaper stores (all her clothes come from boutiques).She is a bad influence and has always had the mindset that you buy first,think later.

FMIL has told my fiancée how she wanted her to never move out and cried and protested when my fiancée and I decided to get an apartment together.She still comes to visit (its only a 30-45 minute drive) and she sees my fiancée normally twice a week.There have been times where I had to be away for weekends and FMIL will try to get my fiancée to let her sleep over at our apartment with my fiancée (in our bed).My fiancée is as creeped out about this as I am.She does not understand boundaries and thinks she can sleep at our apartment (without permission) if we are out of town.

FMIL does not work and so she goes to church every chance she can.She listens to only Christian music and refuses to have anyone listen to anything else in her viscinity.She gets super upset if she hears any swearing, hates anything violent and gorey.  She can't stand for anyone to watch anything on TV but house hunters shows and hallmark movies.We love everything she hates in general.  
She also does not respect what we want with our pets.

Well, it’s been about three weeks since my post and my breakup. And it took almost that full time to let it sink in what I’ve really done. I self wallowed for some time and attempted to guilt trip her and get my siblings to talk to her for me. What a mistake that was. She called and ripped me a new one worse than you guys did. She told me that she was thrilled we’re not together and that I’m manipulative and “disgusting.” That left me really shocked and I had to review my behavior over the time we had been together. I think over my life I always had an idea that with enough perseverance anyone’s mind can be changed. I don’t know where I got this from. I guess I thought it was a sign of being a strong person. Like taking what you want from life even when the chances are slim. It sounds stupid because it is. I reread my post just now and cringed the whole way through. Even the language I used showed that she was right and I am manipulative. She’s a human being and I didn’t treat her with respect. I played with our relationship to get her to change her mind about something very important to her. I deserve what happened. I also have realized that our views on the relationship were a little different. She had never brought up marriage or anything while it had crossed my mind almost daily because I really was so enamored. So I probably looked insane going on about having three children. It sounds so stupid to me now. Among the things she said on the phone, one was that she found my lack of respect for her body and choices appalling. I wasn’t asking her to be forgiven, but I wanted to express how much her and her son meant to me. And as most dumped people tend to do, I couldn’t even give a shit about what I was bitching about in the first place. I miss going to the park with her and her son. Those days were nice and calm and I didn’t appreciate them. I let some fictional children and my bad habits ruin something good. I have a lot of self reflecting to do, and while I’m still sad, I know now that her dumping me was really for the best. Thanks guys for being honest.

120,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for certain reasons. 

My ex-husband and I have been married for 2 years 10 years ago. He had a child from his previous relationship who was two years old when we got together (three when we married) and five years old when we divorced. My ex was the kid's only parent - the mother died in a car accident about a year before we met. 

Our marriage was ok, but not great, and the issues we had eventually lead to our divorce. During our marriage we had a discussion about whether I should adopt his son, but my ex didn't want me to, saying that if we divorced that would make things difficult. When we divorced, he told me he did not want me to be in contact with him or his child, saying that staying in contact will make it difficult for him to move on. I consulted with lawyers, who essentially told me I had no rights to contact with his child after divorce, seeing as I was not legally related to the child. It was not easy, but I moved on. 

Then about five years ago I met my current husband. My current husband and I moved to another country three years ago, and last year we had a child, which brings us to the current moment. About three weeks ago I was contacted by my ex husband's mother, who found my contact information through some of our mutual acquaintances. As it turned out, my ex died earlier this year. She then proceeded to tell me that she was calling to ask me to adopt his child. I was very much taken aback by the request - I knew from mutual acquaintances that my ex re-married and was still married upon his death, suit seemed logical to me that his widow should be the one to take care of his child. Or his parent should. 

Turns out ex-mil did not follow the same logic. She proceeded to tell me how his widow does not want to be taking care of the child (my ex did not let her adopt the child), and that her and my ex-fil cannot take care in the child because they are old and do not have the money ( which I'm pretty sure is not true, they are quite wealthy). So my ex-mil's genius solution is that I should be the one to take in the child. 

I absolutely do not want to do it. There are three adults in this child's life who should be taking care of him - his father's widow, and his grandparents, which is what I told my ex-mil, who seemed very offended at my comment. She tried to plead with me some more, but I told her that I will not change my mind. 

AITA?

Edit: since there seems to be some confusion regarding the dates (I probably should have been more clear):
-The child was born in 2004
-I met my ex in 2006
- We married in 2007 & Divorced in 2009
- I haven’t had any contact with my ex/his child/his other family since mid to late 2010",127,812,0.96

Furthermore I have always had a passion for kids between helping raise my half sisters, spending time with my little cousins, babysitting, and as lately hanging out with my 1 year old nephew.  As I said she knows I am passionate, I am an open book and wear my heart on my sleeve. 

A few more lines of dialogue were exchanged in the car. I tried to explain myself and she told me I didn’t care about her. Then we arrived back at my place.

She got out of the car crying her eyes out saying she was leaving. I asked her if we were breaking up, she said yes. Then she got in her car and left before we could even sit down to actually talk.

I wish we could have had that talk. It’s a hypothetical worst case scenario that wouldn’t even exist until we had been married and in that scenario I would never abandon or leave my wife.",343,371,0.93

123,Not the A-hole,"So, you’re probably wondering how we got here and honestly so am I. For background, my husband was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer last year and we are facing bankruptcy. His treatments are very expensive so in order to offset the costs I am planning a silent auction for him next month. 

I posted about this on Facebook to get the word out and my sister-in-law’s friend reached out to me offered to make shirts for the event which is really awesome of her. 

She sent me the first concept and it was a design of the American flag with the cancer symbol in the middle and the word “Fight.” I texted her back to say I had something different in mind. I want something that better represents my husband and his battle against cancer and while there’s nothing wrong with the flag, it just isn’t a symbol of him or what he’s going through right now. (He is not in the military and I’ve never seen him wear anything with the flag on it. He and I both agree that it wouldn’t fit his personality.) 

My sister-in-law in law called me and ended up telling me that the flag is not offensive and if people don’t like it they shouldn’t be living in America and went on a rant about how people would be offended that I don’t want that shirt for this event. 

I’m just trying to raise awareness for my husband and an American flag shirt doesn’t seem relevant to his situation. It feels like she’s trying to make this about her and is completely ignoring that fact that this is about my husband. Am I being an asshole?",98,362,0.96

I've recently medically retired due to the disease and as part of the process I got a relatively chunky lump sum insurance payout of a few hundred thousand dollars.

This paid off our mortgage and with my disability pension my family is looked after now. I have enough left to do some necessary home renovations.

My wider family is aware of the situation. While nobody has asked  I feel like there is an unspoken expectation that I share a few thousand dollars to blood relatives, even though this would put us back into paying some interest on the mortgage again. 

None of us are wealthy in the family, everyone works for a living.

128,Everyone Sucks,"  

My brother came out as gay on Facebook late last month. Everyone in our family stray for a few aunts and uncles were actually very supportive. Since my brother’s birthday on the 2nd, we decided to celebrate his 25th coming out as gay/birthday dinner. Our parents, other siblings, and nieces and nephews, and his partner were all attending and it was supposed to be something really fancy. 

The thing is that my brother always made high school hell for me. In retrospect, it looks like a severe case of projection, because my brother bullied the hell out of me growing up. He would always call me fag and queer, would smack me if he thought I was looking at him too long, got pissy whenever I walked around the house without a shirt, and teased me to our entire family and asked when am I coming out. It was so annoying having my parents try to tell me they love and accept me no matter what when I’M NOT GAY! I appreciated the support, but I just wasn’t.

Anyways during his birthday dinner, he was introducing everyone to his boyfriend. I said I’m glad to see them happy together and that all of those years spent harassing me about my sexuality was for nothing. He inquired about more (my brother tried to shut me up) and I told him “oh, just all these years calling me a fag and acting like dick was really just HIM wanting dick”. My mom told me to cut it out and I just shrugged and went on about my day. I heard later that I started a huge argument with him and his boyfriend and I finally feel vindicated by the years of torment.

My parents, though tell me that I blew everything out of proportion and ruined his birthday dinner which was supposed to be a fun time with everyone because of some “childhood teasing”. I told her that she always took his side and that if I always tried to convince everyone that my gay brother was straight, I’d be a huge asshole, but for some reason, when he did it, it’s okay? We argued back and forth and it eventually came to a halt.

I’m just annoyed how everyone is against me. I feel like they always took their side back then and now they’re taking his side again.

130,No A-holes here,"To her credit, Kat, my sister, had an absolute shit childhood. She's 13 years younger than me (I'm 36, she's 23), and she has been living under my care for 5 1/2 years. 

Our Mother died in 2010. Mom suffered with Borderline Personality Disorder, she was horribly mentally abusive.  Her passing was a blessing to me (I beg for your understanding, she was genuinely detrimental) but for Kat, our Mom meant an escape from her Father, my stepfather. 

Growing up, I had Lila. Lila is our other sister, two years my junior. During the chaos of our childhood, Lila was the intellect, the pretty one, the star. I was the scapegoat, the receiver of our Mother's wrath.  Yet, she recognized our Mother's dysfunction and supported me every chance she got. As awful as our Mother was to me, I had a pillar of support. Kat did not have that advantage. 

I stopped speaking to our Mother when I was 17. Mother moved halfway across the USA when I was almost 19, (Chicago to Delaware) abandoning Lila at 17. She was halfway through her senior year of high school, earning a 4.0 gpa. Luckily, our Dad was there for her. 

Kat was basically raised as an only child from a very young age (Kindergarten). Our Mom, and her Dad broke her spirit. She's exactly what you'd expect of somebody who has been mentally shattered. Severe anxiety and depression, isolation tendencies, she's a hoarder (the type who hoards trash), no job. I bought her a car four months ago hoping she'd be excited to start a life.  She's ignored it. 

Her Father (my stepfather) abandoned her September of 2013. Our Mom's Social Security checks stopped, and he bailed. That's when I took Kat in.

Ever since, she's been allowed to stay with me as long as she completes a short chore list every day. For example: Tuesday is to clean the kitchen and refrigerator. We're not slobs, this is less than an hour of work. It's a DAILY battle to get her to complete these chores. 

She absolutely refuses any type of mental health support. 

It's been quite a while since she moved in with me, I'm beginning to expect more. My husband is suggesting I seek counseling because of my enabling tendencies. My heart hurts for her, she did not have a fair chance at a normal mindset, but I realize she needs a push. 

So, Reddit, this is my thought.  WIBTA if I give her MUCH more responsibility around the house to light a fire under her ass to learn to drive and get as job? I don't know what else to do.

Add On: She and I have already discussed this, she's welcome to live with me for the remainder of her life. My husband and I have agreed to build her a mother- in- law suite onto the house. Her depression/ anxiety is severe enough, IMHO, that forcing her to live by herself would trash my moral compass. I love my sister dearly.",77,81,0.94
131,Not the A-hole,"I, (17F) live with my stepmother and my father and work part time. I pay the majority of my food, clothes, school expenses, and am now saving up for a car and college. I’ve bought my phone, laptop, shoes, just about everything except some of my food and my phone bill.

My stepmother demands I pay her 200$ in “rent” monthly, and I am not against giving her money, except that it frequently goes up and she always lies about the amount she decides to get from me. 

She’s told me in the past that driving a car and going to college are a privilege and that i’m not going to do either if that means i can’t pay her 200/monthly. But here's the thing - she doesn’t work, and she’s more than capable of being able to. She gets thousands of dollars off of me and my fathers disability checks and i don’t see a dime of it. I told her i will pay 100% for all my food and my phone bill (which I bought the phone myself) and she refuses and uses that over my head whenever I ask to bring the payment down so i can do something along the lines of pay off a debt, or just buy something nice.

I argue that if i pay both my bill and all my food (which would be cheaper than 200/month) then I’ll pretty much be self sufficient aside for sleeping at her house, which i argued I shouldn't be charged for until im 18 because im a minor. 

She refuses to let me save some of my money back for college because “I’ll be in debt regardless” and told me that she doesn't care if i don't have a car by the time im 18 as long as I pay her. 

Originally it was 100/month, then we agreed 150/month, then when my paycheck came she demanded 200 and denied ever agreeing to 75 biweekly. When my income tax came, she asked for 50, and then upped it to 90, and when i went to break change for 90, she insisted i just give her 100. She chose to move us to a place we can barely afford and holds that above our head even though none of us give a damn if we live in a trailer or apartment.

Everytime i ask a coworker or friend for advice they call me entitled and that i should help her because i live with her. If she worked a job and we were struggling I would be more than happy to help. But she doesnt work and live off of me and my father's disability checks and we don’t see a DIME of it.

132,Not the A-hole,"My husband (37) told me (32) I ""ruined"" his sister's birthday. I have depression and anxiety. It has gotten very bad lately.

My husband thinks my depression and anxiety are completely made up and that I'm just acting like a hormonal teenager.

A few days ago my husband said we were getting together with 10 of his family members for his  sister's birthday. I thought we were getting together for breakfast at his sister's home.   He didn't tell me until midnight the night before that we were going to an art studio to do paintings.   I am really bad at art stuff. So I found out at the last minute we were going to do something I am terrible at in front of a bunch of people. I told him this would make me extremely anxious and I didn't want to go. He told me to ""suck it up""

The studio was a big, CROWDED open room. There was no privacy. My painting turned out badly. Normally I cope with my anxiety and embarrassment by making jokes, so I made a lot of self-deprecating jokes about my painting. A few other people joined in making some about theirs even though mine was by far the worst.  Husband said my jokes were making others uncomfortable. I didn't notice that but stopped when he said that in case he was right.

I finished painting and everyone else was still working. I was embarrassed about how bad my painting was and how everyone could see it. I know this isn't true, but I felt like everyone walking by was staring at my painting and thinking that I might be mentally handicapped because it was so bad.

I was also getting bored . So I painted my painting over with black paint and just started swirling colors around on the canvas. I was actually starting to have kind of a good time.

This INFURIATED my husband. He was hissing at me under his breath about how I was being selfish & an ""annoying goth teenager"". He said I was acting bizarre/mentally unbalanced.  He then drew his sister's attention to my painting saying ""Hey, look what \[marlenesnemesis\] just did."" Her eyes got wide like she was horrified over it. This drew everyone else's attention to it and they started saying my painting was nice why did I do that?

Husband continued whisper-yelling at me until I went to the bathroom to cry. When I came out it was obvious I had been crying and other people in our group were worried. I left as soon as I could.

My husband called me as I drove home to tell me how disappointed he was in me. He said he hates how he has to deal with my negativity and feels like he has a child to take care of. Later he apologized for harping on the issue at the studio and said he should have just left me alone. But my outbursts are a big burden on him and are stressful.

He also said my sister in law and the rest of the family was concerned about me. He told me since his sister had to be worried about me instead of just having fun at her party that I had ""ruined"" her birthday.

Am I just an overly sensitive asshole that ruins everyone's good time?

I know this edit puts me over the character limit but people were asking:

&#x200B;

I'm not seeing a therapist.  I want to, but our insurance doesn't cover it and we don't have much money to spare.  My husband says I need to help myself first, but I don't know how to do that.  If anyone has advice, I'd appreciate it

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

People are asking if my husband is the cause of my anxiety and depression. I have struggled with these issues since long before we met. I think both issues stem from being repeatedly molested by a family member as a child. It just kind of makes you feel worthless and it is also really stressful caring around such a big secret as a 9 year old. I would constantly be worried this person would come into my bedroom at night. So long story short, husband didn't ""cause"" this.

The intensity of both issues has varied a lot over the years; at some times it was fine and some times was really bad. The past 3 years or so have been bad, the past couple of months really bad. We work together without other people so I spend weeks at a time not talking to anyone but him. We also don't have a working car right now so I am often stuck at home. I actually joined reddit for some social interaction to practice social skills since I noticed I was getting pretty weird and awkward. I'm not sure if anyone has ever spent days at a time not talking to anyone but a cat but that's kind of my life right now. It's either the cat or the husband. I don't have any other living beings in my life.

I actually lost a potential client because she thought I was ""cold"" and ""distant"" and ""weird."" Woops.",151,168,0.91

135,Asshole,"Good afternoon reddit. I figure this is the best sub for the latest drama between my sister, roommate and myself (technically, they are both my roommates). 

I guess to dispel stereotypes I should say upfront, I'm 24, female and a college grad looking for a more permanent job. I work at a national chain restaurant and actually love my job. I have a group of regular customers that I really, really love, my bosses are amazing and it's a great company. So anyways, for the past month our manager had a contest that the person who could get the most comment cards or online surveys filled out would get a $500 bonus. Since my regulars are so awesome, I easily won and he gave me cash at the lunch shift Thursday. So I've basically had $500 burning a hole in my pocket ever since. 

So today one of my regulars had just come in from the shooting range. I told him that I'd never even held a gun before but I always though they were super cool. He asked me if I'd like to come shooting with him some day. I said yes. He then asked if I could come to the parking lot with him and I could see and hold his guns. I took a break and it was like...holy crap he literally had a car full of guns. I really liked the AK-47 he had, just something about it totally drew my eye. So I complimented on it. He asked if I wanted it. I told him to stop joking with me. He said he wasn't joking at all and that he would give it to me for always being so nice to him. I told him about my bonus money and he said well to be fair he'd sell it to me for $200. I was like cool. So I went from never even holding a gun in my entire life to now i'm the proud freaking owner of an AK-47! My friend is going to take me shooting with it on Wednesday afternoon and I'm so excited. 

So I just got off shit and my sister and roommate are furious with me. They say it should have been implied that we never bring guns into the house. I told them we never talked about it. They both said exactly and basically ""banned"" me from bringing my gun into the house. Which to me is utter bullshit because I pay rent as well and I have the right to have whatever I want as long as it's legal in my space.  

The both are furious with me. Am I the asshole here?",594,317,0.77

The marriage is well beyond done, there’s no chance that either of us have any desire to work on saving it. I played that game and lost. 

Bottom line, grandparents will still be in the kids’ lives, and I want them to know that I’m NTA.  I don’t need them poisoning my relationship with my kids based on whatever bs she’s told them, because there’s no way they know the truth.

EDIT:  There’s some amazing people in this place, and I’ve gotten a great variety of viewpoints on which way to proceed. I appreciate all your comments, and many of you have shifted my point of view away from doing it with my own reputation in mind. 

What is sticking with me is no matter how I choose to have the conversation, which will likely be by phone, it can’t  focus on the “who wronged who” and the details of what she’s done. I do believe that they have to have an understanding of nature of the alcohol abuse and reckless behavior so that they can be there for her when things get worse, or if she should finally seek help. 

If things get worse, God forbid, then I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with protection orders and modifications of custody. I have good legal council who’s helped me through this so far.

137,Not the A-hole,"So I work in an average scale restaurant, not fine dining by any means, but we do have expensive menu items and an extensive wine list. We usually close the kitchen right at 9pm as the chef is one of the part owners and absolutely refuses to serve people anything past 9pm. 

Anyway, our manager got a phone call at 8:45 that a party of 12 wanted to come in and dine and set up a table for them in another servers section. She did not want to take the last table as her section had cleared out and she was all done. So I volunteered to take the table without knowing who they would be. Being the tail end of spring break was a gamble as they could have been a big cheap family full of kids and totally not worth it. 

But, when the party walked through the door, at 8:55pm, I easily recognized the gentleman as a regular of ours who owns several high end car dealerships across the country. They ordered high end wines and I had to service them properly before taking their food order; I work for tips after all!

By this time it is 9:20 and the chef is still awaiting the food order, entire kitchen crew is upset they have to stay longer for one table. Not my fault as my manager is the one who allowed the late reservation. 

Finally got the food order and the chef and kitchen crew pump out the fastest meal I’ve ever seen out of that kitchen. They all enjoyed their food, ordered more wine and racked up quite the bill. I didn’t want to add gratuity to the check knowing this guy always throws down extra. So I drop him the bill around 10:30, by this time all other crew members had gone home leaving me to clean the table and do all the work myself. 

I look at the tip and it’s $500 on a $820 tab!!!

Made me stoked that I took this last table! When I get paid out by my manager he tells me I need to kick the kitchen crew some of that tip because they had to stay and work later...

Pretty sure that’s illegal, they were still clocked in getting paid their $16-18/hr whatever it may be. I refused to hand out money to them, especially after they had been gone for over an hour. Manager tells me I’m greedy and selfish for not sharing the overly generous tip.

142,Not the A-hole,"I just read the other AITA post, which made me think of my recent actions.

I'd like your perspective, Reddit. I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend, at first service was great and amazing. For reference we sat at the bar of a sushi restaurant. But the service was very 'only your server will help you.' we came in at a pretty non busy time, 4pm. We were sat down and given recommendations. We ordered based off the recommendations which was basically a five course meal. What followed was one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. It took 20 minutes between each course to come out and we didn't see the fifth course for over an hour. 

After the first 20 minutes of waiting, I kept looking around and trying to get the servers' attention but got absolutely nowhere. We were literally sitting at the bar for an hour and the chefs didn't acknowledge us when we tried asking, and one of the servers said 'sorry I'm not your server, let me go check on your food,' and then we ended up waiting another 40 minutes until our server finally appeared out of nowhere. He came to us smiling and asked if he could get us anything else, and I asked where our last dish was. He immediately went pale, didn't say a word to us, left, and returned 10 minutes later with our last dish. As he served it to us, he said sorry for the wait very quickly without making any eye contact and no explanation of what had happened. At this point, we didn't even want to eat the last dish and  wanted to ask for the check. I raised my hand and asked for the check and almost immediately, another server handed us the check as if she had been waiting for us to ask for it. Up until this point I had been fairly patient as I've been a server too. But the fact that all the other servers ignored my constant attempts to get their attention until I asked for the check really ticked me off. 

I saw our server, flagged him down and asked why it took so long for our last dish to come out. If he had had a reasonable explanation, I was planning on tipping at least 15% but he said 'i dropped the ball on this one. Sorry. But can I get something else for you? Would you like to order another dessert?'  at this point I said no thanks, paid for our bill and left no tip. I was pretty mad at the time, but thinking back on it, I wonder if I was too harsh.

143,Everyone Sucks,"For about a month now I had been wondering why out of the blue , I havent been hearing ANYTHING at all about my sons CHILDHOOD best friend of 10 YEARS'S friend for a while He wasnt coming over or anything LIKE USUAL for a while and eventually my wife noticed too. 

He was a regular at our house and our son to his as well

My son would usually mention his friend and sometimes his girlfriend (whenever he wasnt around ) regularly during normal chit chat.


So today the curiousity got the better of me so I just went and asked ""what happened with your friend lately.""

Then he hesitates then admit that while his friend and her were in a relationship she was secretly having sex with my son THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP FOR A YEAR !


I didnt want to believe that he could do something so cold like that until I got more upset and kept asking if it was true. He finally admitted it and it and showed me a conversation that he had with his friend on the day his friend found out about it admitting it to him.

Now the thing is is that his friend didnt find out about the cheating until AFTER they had broken up for unrelated reasons. My son said that it was his friends NEW girlfriend's friends were the ones to tell him. My son never did. Which made me mad. 


Now normally my son and I are like two peas but that really bothered me and kind of hurt me a little TBH when he told me that. Im not sure what was going through my head but I got angry af cussed him out called him a ""selfish POS backstabbing low life"" etc etc 


""I hope your friend clobbers the hell outta you you cunt shit""!!!!!. 


 In a fit of rage I told him to ""move the fuck out"" in 30 days saying ""I lost a lot of respect for you"" and he was like a brother to you !!  and ""You deserve to be in your own"".

 My wife and I got attached to him over the years even though our son is first.

He was too good of a friend to my son to do that. There's no justifiable excuse for what he did. I raised him to treat others the way you would want them too.

144,Not the A-hole,"Okay, I feel really conflicted about this, and I genuinely want some advice! This Mother's Day will be my first official Mother's Day as a new mom. That said, it will also most likely be my grandmother-in-law's last Mother's Day. I would really like to spend my first Mother's Day with just my own nuclear family (my husband and my son), but at lunch with my MIL today, she basically told us what we'd be doing for Mother's Day and that we didn't have a choice. Obviously it's a little different with my grandmother-in-law being sick, and I had planned on seeing her that weekend but didn't necessarily want to spend the day with all the in-laws. And I felt kind of offended that she told us what we'd be doing instead of asking, especially since it's my first one!

A little background, I think I'm especially sensitive to big family plans with my husband's family because my MIL often makes plans FOR us rather than asking, and whenever my husband tries to call her out on it, she gets mad and says ""don't start with me."" He's an only child so she kind of bosses him around.

I think part of my annoyance is that whenever we have family plans, my MIL expects us to show up 3-4 hours prior to the actual start time so my husband can do the cooking and help her get her house ready, and since she lives an hour and a half away, that means I have to get there early because it would be silly to drive two cars that far.

So after that long-winded background, my question is WIBTA if I didn't agree to this whole plan, especially since my grandmother-in-law is sick? She's in her late 80s and will most likely be on hospice care by Mother's Day. Do I just need to suck it up and realize the day isn't about me? Or can we compromise and hang out that Saturday? Would genuinely love feedback and will take my criticism!

147,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years. We live together and do not want kids. He says he’s fine with not getting married, but lately the topic of marriage has been increasingly popping up - at his prompting. I am quite open about my feelings about marriage (not opposed, but what’s the point?), but lately I have come to the realization that I don’t think I could handle my income becoming part of a “household income.”

I make almost 3 times as much as my boyfriend. No judgements on my end - he chose a field he was passionate about, and I chose one that would pay me a lot of money. Neither is wrong, in my opinion. I think he’s generally okay with it and is okay with contributing about half (closer to 40%) to our current expenses. 

My problem is that he’s kind of irresponsible with his money. He mostly pays his bills on time but almost lives paycheck to paycheck because he has expensive habits like gambling (any sports fantasy possible, lotto entires, scratch offs, casino visits), and smoking both weed and cigarettes. He has no retirement savings, a small emergency fund (maybe a few hundred), and I get the feeling that his impulse control is quite poor. 

My worst spending habit would probably be my exorbitantly expensive barre and yoga classes, but as the daughter of a wealth management advisor, I’ve always been financially savvy and have four different types of savings accounts. I know not everyone has that same financial education, so I try not to hold his spending habits against him too much (while suggesting ways he can put his money to better use). 

I’m fine with him spending his own money on those things, but I wouldn’t want to get married and have my money in anyway go towards what I consider bad habits. I love my boyfriend very much and think he’s a kind, compassionate person. Our relationship is heathy, and he makes me happy. I know if the roles were reversed, he would never feel the same way. However, I fear that you would resent him if he continued his spending habits into our marriage. I’d ruin this awesome thing we have. 

So, am I the asshole for keeping marriage off the table because I’m worried I would resent him if he spent my money the way he spends his? If so, how do current breadwinners handle bringing in substantially more but having just 50% say in what happens with those funds? Am I just bad at sharing?",43,33,0.86
148,Asshole,"First off, I offered to pay for a screen replacement. My wife and I went to visit my brother for the first time ever. We are not close (and I think this pretty much ends it...). My daughter is autistic and we have to watch her constantly.

We went over, and my wife and I split up watching her. At the last moment, right before we are about to leave, my daughter takes a glass ball on their coffee table and chucks it at their TV.

TV needs new screen. Catch: My brother just bought a fancy new super expensive TV. He wants me to replace the TV. I want to pay for someone to at least consider a screen replacement as I've just read that its economical on these expensive TVs.

I have to admit, this experience reminded me of why I am not close to my family. Everything is transactional with them. I will pay for it, if it comes to it. But... should I? AITA for wanting to just say, ""here's a check for repair costs, thats it.""

edit:

4/14/2019

I request re judgement. My brother initially said it was a $5,000 tv and wanted me to pay him on an installment plan. I said no, I will have a technician come over and repair. I had recently bought a tv and saw this one at Best buy. I was pretty sure it was a $2,200 model, and of course I was willing to buy a new one. I want to make that clear.

He finally sent me the receipt after 18 hours. Last night he drunk texted me a bunch of insults about my kids and pictures of his broken tv (but no model). The model is a $1800 TV. I bought it for him. He has significant gambling and drinking issues and is about to lose his job due to being drunk on the job. I was not going to give him cash. I was willing to replace.

We are done as brothers though.",145,59,0.71

150,Not the A-hole,"I decided to plan a surprise trip for my GF who has been having a rough couple of weeks to a nearby city. There is a major event that she is interested in and I wanted to take her. I purchased a mid level hotel from they Wyndham chain and purchased the tickets to the event. I tell her to take time off work so we could spend the weekend together and she ends up guessing what I have planned. She wants to know what hotel I booked but I decided to keep it secret as she wasn't supposed to know in the first place.

&#x200B;

We leave a few hours late and she is upset so she ignores me the entire 3-4 hour drive there. We get to the hotel and she is upset at the hotel I picked. I end up carrying all the bags by myself. We check in and she starts crying as soon as we get to the room about the hotel I booked. Every hotel is booked for the night, so I offer her to stay for the night at the hotel and stay at a new hotel the next day. She wants to go home, so again I carry the bags by myself. We check out and I can't get a refund at the time due to the manager not being there. We drive another 3-4 hours back home, she ignores me the entire way back again.

&#x200B;

The next day she asks if I want to go back. I said it was up to her and told her how i felt humiliated and upset that she felt the place we were staying at mattered more than us spending time together. She blew up about how I should have known she wouldn't like that hotel, how upset she was, her time was wasted, and how she wants space. The entire trip, if we would have stayed, would have cost me close to $1000.

152,Asshole,"TL;DR - 19 year old guy just out of prison, excluded from brother’s anniversary party. WIBTA if I confronted him about it?

Hi, I’m Jake and I’m 19 years old. I found out today that I’m not invited to my older brother’s five year wedding anniversary.
I was talking to him on the phone this afternoon and I asked him when the big party is going to be so that I can put it in my diary and he told me that him and his wife have discussed it and they thought it best if I don’t go. We had a bit of a fight on the phone about it but I didn’t push it too much as I sometimes say things I regret in the heat of the moment.

So, I’m the first to admit that I have been a bit of a troublemaker in the past and I have caused some drama in my family. I’m also currently on probation. However I’ve been working very hard at changing myself and my brother himself has said a few times that he’s seen a change in me and that I’ve been much better behaved recently.

I don’t get on very well with his wife, but I explained to my brother that I would keep away from her and keep myself to myself.
It’s just that I haven’t really seen most of my family for a few years and I would like the opportunity to see them all.

I’m thinking of confronting him about it when I’m a bit calmer to explain that I’m a different person now and that it’s hurt me a bit to be left out.

So, WIBTA if I confronted him about it or should I just leave it well alone?

EDIT: ok, I feel like I’m being a bit unfair to my brother here in that my original post missed out the fact that I only got out of prison a few months ago and it might be relevant to his decision.

EDIT No 2: I think I should add that my brother’s wife has tried to exclude me quite a lot over time. She says I’m a bad influence on their kids, which feels a bit like she’s manipulating my brother into not liking me by saying this. Also, she was the one who persuaded my brother not to visit me regularly when I was behind bars (or put money on my books), because she didn’t like the idea of the children visiting their uncle in prison. So, part of the reason I wanted to go to the party was to spend some time with my 5 and 6 year old nephews who I haven’t really seen for years.",130,101,0.88
153,No A-holes here,"Throwaway for the usual reasons.

I recently bought a house and it needed some light renovation (sanding floors, painting, that kind of stuff) before I could move in was required for me to move in.

My family and I are very close and help each other out alot. When ever there is some heavy lifting or IT work to do, they call me over. Being a single guy having just bought a house, my family eagerly offered their help doing the renovation.

The problem started as soon as I started talking about what I wanted to do with the place. I wanted to tear down all build in closets, since the house was for a family of four, and I was just a single guy. I did not need closets in every single room, and wanted to concentrate new closets into a single room, to create a walk-in closet. I certanly did not want a huge closet in my new office and home-gym. My parents however insisted that it was a horrible idea to tear out the closets, saying that it would devaluate the house, and that I could never have enough closet space. I retorted that I did not need closet space for a whole family, and that I certanly did not want a closet in every single room regardless of the rooms function.

We got into many heated discussions about these closets in the past month, but in the end I just tore them out, all except one, that I carefully dismantled, with the help of my father - saying that I'd consider putting it up again. In reality I just didn't want to deal with the shitstorm of destroying the closet that my family seemed in love with - I had every intention of throwing it out.

I have started settling into my new place, and the old closet that I dismantled is taking up space. So tonight I mentioned that I had decided to get rid of the last closet. And just as I expected, the whole discussion about the closets started over. My mother said that I ""did not listen to their many years of experience"" and that I ""was ruining my new house"" and that I ""refused to listen to advice or input"".

I started replying with my usual arguments, but ended up loosing my shit (because this was the 10-20th time we had this discussion in 1 month) and loudly stated something along the lines of:

>If I cannot throw out the damn closets, then I shouldn't have bought that damn house in the first place! The whole idea of me buying my own place was to make it my own, not have it dictated by where the previous owners integrated their f\*\*\*\*\*\* closets. Also, you are not giving me advice, you are giving me opinions, and expecting me to follow them.

I also added that the only reason I stored the last closet, was because I did not want to listen to their complaints about the closet any more. My mother was obviously hurt my statements, and went all quiet.

I felt bad about what I said, so I called my father and my mother later in the evening, and basically told each of them that while I stood by what I said, I wanted to apologize about the tone and how I phrased it.",42,57,0.94

156,Not the A-hole,"I am going to preface this by saying that as the sibling who did everything ""right,"" there is some resentment.

My parents are about to come into a considerable amount of money soon and my sister asked them to borrow ~20K to pay off her debts, her reasoning being that she wants to just pay them so that she doesn't have to pay any interest. She is only paying the minimums on all of the credit cards.

My sister is 30 years old and has no children. She lives with my parents and drives their car. Her job pays her almost minimum wage, but from what I see she has not done anything significant to try and find a higher paying job because she currently works at home and enjoys not having to get ready and drive to work. Her 20K in debt was not from school or car or necessary living expenses, it was mostly due to her hobbies. She dropped out of college and refuses to go to trade school or any job programs even though my parents have offered to pay her tuition in the past.

I recommended to my parents that they do not do it, or at least make it conditional that she get a new job if they do go ahead with it. My father who is more the decisionmaker relies heavily on my opinion. Am I the asshole for wanting to see my sister just file for bankruptcy?

EDIT: Did my parents ask me for advice specifically? No- however the conversations about my sister being irresponsible with money have been happening between me and my parents for years. My mother is leaning no, my father is leaning yes. I am also an accountant of sorts for my parents and truthfully my father was asking me how to get the money for my sister without my mother knowing if he wanted to just proceed with it.

157,Everyone Sucks,"Last week i received an invitation to my cousin's wedding. It was addressed to me and my parents. I sent Cousin a letter explaining that i wasn't going, but my parents were excited to be there.

A few days later, she called me asking why i wasn't coming.

My cousin is extremely ani-children. Mocks them openly, ridicules people who choose to have them. I'm not the best with kid but i don't hate them. I find people who complain about children to be more obnoxious than the actual children.

As the invitation made it clear the wedding was 18+, i know the wedding is going to end up with Cousin getting drunk and mocking all the parents who couldn't attend due to lack of childcare and making jokes to the parents who DID make it about being 'free from your little demons for the night'. I don't want any part of that.

When she called, i told her i was happy for her, and she's welcome to have the wedding she wants, but i wasn't interested in going to a child free wedding.

In retrospect i should have lied and said i had class or something. But she put me on the spot and Im not good with confrontation. 

She got upset and started arguing with me. She said she wanted everyone together for her wedding and me missing it was ruining her day. I was being stuck up and judgmental at her decision and i dont get to say how she plans her wedding. 

I told her that was true, but she doesn't have a right to decide who accepts her invitations. And if she wanted all the family together, i thought it was pretty shitty to not include children as part of the family. Again, retrospectively, I should've shut up. 

She told me she was taking back my invitation (fine with me, saves me the present i was still going to send her) and was going to reconsider inviting my parents (less ok, they havent done anything to her). Then she hung up. 

I let my parents know what she said. They said that while she went a little overboard, i should've just RSVPd 'Yes' in the first place.

Since she called, there's been several passive aggressive Facebook/Twitter posts, and several other family members have called me trying to get me to reconsider.

I've told them all the same thing: Cousin is welcome to plan her wedding exactly how she wants it, i just won't be there. Still, everyone has been keeping up with it being me who's the problem. That i should put my opinions aside for family, that i shouldn't care because i don't have children, that i should never decline a wedding invitation because it's not about me it's about the couple, etc. 

Now, i know i was the asshole for telling Cousin that i disagreed with her having a child free wedding, even if i was confronted directly. And if i ever get the chance, I'll apologize for being so blunt with her during a stressful time. 

But am i the asshole for declining the invitation? Should i have just agreed to go to the wedding and put my own thoughts aside for Cousin?",29,31,0.92
158,Asshole,"So my stepdaughter who is 15 is currently suffering with an eating disorder and it’s having an affect on my daughter. She’s started saying she’s fat and knowing calories in stuff, saying she won’t eat stuff because there’s too many calories etc. I told my husband that I didn’t  want his daughter talking about any of that stuff in front of my kid. He’s tried talking to her about it and she says fine, I just won’t eat at all. The other day she started saying that there was so much fat in avocado, I tried to tell my daughter it was healthy fat but she didn’t wanna eat it after that. She’s also heard her vomiting and So far I’ve just said she has a bad tummy but if she continues doing it she’s gonna catch on soon and I’m scared she’ll start doing it. I broke down to my husband about it the other day. I said I’m sorry she’s struggling but I don’t want her around right now. I think it’s better for everyone if she stays with her mom for a while and my husband just takes her out sometimes. He said he can’t really do that.

159,Not the A-hole,"A month ago I(15) got into an argument with my Dad. It had been a really stressful week for me (I had just gotten wisdom teeth removed and had to catch up in school a lot), so I was really looking forwards to the weekend. I had some homework but I thought to do it Sunday. My mom approved of that idea too. 

My dad usually just repeats what my mom says when it comes that that stuff. Thing is, my mom told him previously that I was to do it on Saturday, and didn’t update him. 

So when my dad said to do homework on Saturday, I tried to explain I wanted to do it on Sunday instead, and that my mom approved of it. But he just wasn’t having it, and kept saying to do it on Saturday. I called my mom and asked her to please tell him about the Sunday thing. I was already stressed from school and my dad wasn’t helping. 

So she did and my dad got pissed at the mere fact that I asked my mom, and that I was “just getting myself out of doing homework so I didn’t have to listen to him” or something like that

I tried to explain again: “Me and my mom discussed that morning that she was ok with it” is what I *would* have said, but he cut me off and said “you called your mom to get yourself out of this""

At that point I was fuming and decided to leave his room. He called back for me but I ignored him. He does stuff like that a lot and I wasn’t having it that day. 

I locked myself in my room to do my thing... and my dad picked the lock. He yelled at me for being disrespectful and stuff, and took everything away for the entire weekend, and I did homework, the one thing I didn’t want to do that weekend. 

Then I made it very clear to my dad I was *really pissed* after he wouldnt let me eat by myself. Later that night he called me into his room, and told me to sit down.I knew that if I sat down,I would have to endure whatever he said. So I told him “no I’ll stand right here” at the doorway. He got pissed over me not wanting to sit, even after threatening to take my stuff away for life

He kicked me out over that, and I’ve been with my mom for an entire month since. On Friday he said that he needed help moving my new bed that he just got. Except I asked him about a new bed back in 2018, and he said he would when he moved. He only got it now to try and make me come over. I said “I’m not coming over this weekend”

After I said I wasn’t coming over he said “We need to talk"", to which I said “no. I’m not talking this weekend”. I really just wanted to have a nice weekend, and after his attempt to trick me into coming over, I didn’t want to talk to him.

It honestly really hurt myself to say that, but I felt I needed to. It feels like my dad just doesn’t learn when he has crossed the line. I’m still not over the way he yelled and degraded me over that

But maybe I’m wrong. AITA? 

TL;DR: dad got pissed over me not doing homework. I ignored him and he kicked me out. Im not over it a month later and I’m ignoring him.",23,44,0.86
160,No A-holes here,"Backstory: I don't shave my armpits. This was a choice that I thought through and made for myself, despite pressure (both internalized and external). And I actually had a little mental sit-down with myself during the weeks leading up to the wedding and decided I was happier to not shave and deal with some odd looks.

My mom has a history of telling me to be quiet or change my behavior for the sake of placating other people's sensibilities. In particular, lately she's been on me about my armpit hair. She has consistently told me that I should, eg, shave before dress appointments ""because I'll get better service if they don't think I'm gross.""

However, my parents, my mom in particular, have been *incredibly* generous and helpful in the planning and funding of my wedding. My mom put in so much time and effort and money, way more than I expected, and as a result our wedding went absolutely seamlessly. It was magical. I am so grateful for all the work she put in and all of the care she showed by making my wedding the absolute best day ever.

Fast forward to wedding day: I was all ready to start the day, stressed, but in an excited way. My mom pulls me aside and says ""I want to ask you a favor.""

Without hesitating, I say ""of course, what is it?""

Mom: ""I want you to shave your armpits.""

At this point I just kind of laugh and say ""no...???"" It seems like a silly request to me at the time, plus I'd already made that decision for myself.

But she goes into full guilt trip mode: ""You won't even do this *one thing* for your *mother* on your *wedding day*?""

So I ask her why she cares so much, and she goes on a rant about how her friends are ""very provincial"" and that I look so beautiful and everyone will say ""she would have been perfect if she had just shaved those disgusting armpits"".

At this point I go silent, because I don't know how to argue with that. I mean, it's very possible that some of the guests might be grossed out by female body hair. But this is my wedding! And my body! Why should I have to change something that's important to me for the sake of not grossing some people out? For that matter, why should I cater to people who are grossed out by my body in the first place?

We left the conversation with my mom telling me that she had a razor and shaving cream if I wanted it, and me telling her I'd let her know. Neither of us brought it up again, and I didn't shave. I did think about it, and came nearly to tears. I called my now husband and he totally backed me up and told me not to back down. He said that he loved me and my armpit hair :)

The rest of the day went wonderfully. The wedding was beautiful, no one commented on my armpits, my mom seemed to be having a great time, etc.

I still feel a little sick about not giving in on this one thing after she'd put in so much work making my dream wedding happen. But it was important to me. Was I the asshole for not just sucking it up and shaving?",33,29,0.82
161,Not the A-hole,"I adopted 2 senior dogs from a shelter around 2 weeks ago. They came from a puppy mill, where they had lived in terrible conditions with minimal human contact. Their story is truly tragic. 

Even though the shelter told me the two dogs weren't bonded, I adopted them both. They seem to enjoy each other's company immensely. 

Since bringing them home, one of the dogs has made incredible progress. He is nearly potty trained and has become less fearful and skittish. 

The other dog, however, has gotten worse. He has only used the bathroom outside once. Even though I take him outside multiple times a day, he just will not potty outside. Oftentimes he will relieve himself immediately after I bring him back in.

I tried teaching him to use puppy pads, and while that worked really well for a few days, he's now regressed back to pooping and peeing where he stands. 

I can't use a crate to potty train him because 1) he has spent almost his entire life in a cage pooping and peeing in it, so the cage won't encourage him not to poop and 2) my vet advised that crating him would be traumatic and cause even more behavioral issues.  

I've tried moving him outside when I've seen him actively using the bathroom on my carpet, and he bit me. He's become more aggressive since I adopted him in general. At first, he was just skittish. But now he's gotten to where he sometimes snarls or growls when you enter the room he is in. 

I'm honestly at a loss. None of the training techniques I have read about have worked or can be used with his history. If I had seen any improvements, or even if he had been the same since I brought him home, I would have more patience. But his behavior is regressing.  I'm cleaning rooms and dogs absolutely covered in poop multiple times a day, and I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I hate myself for even thinking about surrendering him back to the shelter. When I adopted him, I was told he'd already been adopted and returned once. But I don't know what else I can do at this point.

Our only condition was that she had to maintain her grades to at least a 3.0 and she had to do a summer job/internship every summer. We even gave her a $100/week allowance!

This would be a good time to note that we live in Georgia. We have the Zell Miller scholarship and she got accepted into UGA, which means she would’ve had her entire tuition paid for. She begged us to let her go to her dream school and because financials weren’t that big a problem to us, we relented, with the conditions listed above.

She’s been telling us (her father and I) that she has a 3.7 and is doing amazing for the last 3 years. We were so proud (it never crossed our mind that she could be lying). She would also frequently post herself on her Instagram at parties in the middle of the week and drinking with friends, but because she was doing fine academically, we just let her have her freedom.

Anyways her brother is a freshman at GA Tech. He ended his first semester with a 2.8, putting him at risk for losing his scholarship. He told us he was only on track for a 3.2 this semester (too low to maintain the scholarship). We asked him why he wasn’t doing great and that he needs to be more focused on his academics when he got defensive and told us that “at least he wasn’t failing like his sister”.

This is going over the character limit so to make a long story short, our daughter has been lying the entire time about her grades. She has a 2.3 GPA and it on track for failing a class this semester. My husband and I were furious, and told her that because she wants to lie and deceive us like that, we were no longer going to fund her school at all. If she still wants to go there, she’s going to need to take out loans, and we’re cutting her off completely (total cost is about $30,000 a semester).

She was heartbroken and begged us for another chance, and that she was too afraid to come clean. Being afraid is one thing, but she should’ve told us and maybe could’ve provided resources to help her. She lied to us to our faces and made us out to be fools.

This was a week and a half ago, and she blocked us on everything. My husband thinks she’s acting like a spoiled brat, but I starting to feel really bad.

As I was boxing up the cake, the boy, who was I’d say about 8, asks me for a cookie (We give away free kids cookies) and after I handed it to him he says “is it okay if I give you a hug?” 

I was immediately uncomfortable and a little taken aback, and I looked at the mom, who was just kind of smiling at me expectantly. I just gave a little nervous laugh, turned red and just kind of mumbled “ah, noo, sorry” 

As soon as the words left my mouth the woman looked like I slapped her in the face. She immediately dropped her smile, huffed at me, and started to turn away. However, her son didn’t immediately follow her, as he was starting to walk BEHIND the counter to I assume come and hug me. She turned around, saw what he was doing, and instead of being like “hey, maybe you should stop that” she just kind of lightly takes him by the arm and says “we’re leaving”. I said in my best customer service voice “have a nice day!” And she just flat out ignored me.

The story:

Several months back, an artist joined my furry server and began advertising their commissions (art for sale). I thought their styles were nice and bought about $90 worth of different fursona pieces etc.

A month had passed and I had received little to no replies from the artist, especially not any completed artwork. I was beginning to get agitated as in the fandom we generally have socially acceptable commissioner - artist rules, such as asking for progress reports occasionally.

I was beginning to get suspicious, and as I had spent quite a lot, was trying to find out more about the artist.

Two months had passed and still no artwork received. However, I had learned that she was a woman from Venezuela, a country that was going through an economy and political crises (and still is)

Three months in I had received one completed piece out of three total pieces. She then told me her laptop harddrive had broken, which I reluctantly paid for to be fixed as I was still naive about the artwork (I believe this was my sunk cost fallacy). Bear in mind that I live in the UK and this person was in the southern Americas.

Four months passed and I still only had one of the three pieces. I would message once a week asking for updates on her situation and the artwork, but would only get a generic response every couple of weeks with no updates about the art.

She claimed that she had little to no money and was actively completing NEW commissions from customers, despite me waiting several months, which infuriated me.

I remained calm during the entire ordeal and wouldn't threaten anything, instead asking for any potential dates for the completed artwork. The dates she set multiple times would never be completed.

We're now approaching 5 months (I paid at the end of November) and still no sign of the artwork. She speaks to me occasionally and is uploading new pieces on her social media pages, but never my pieces.

I can't tell if I'm being petty for holding a poor woman to make some art that I bought several months ago, or if she owes me the art as I had effectively paid for it.

EDIT: I haven't charged back the money yet but I'm certainly thinking of doing it.

I ordered a $10 triple vodka soda drink, had just under half, go to the bathroom, and when I come back, there’s a noticeable about of Parmesan cheese in my drink. 
I start getting mad and saying, “man who the fuck did this, you wrecked my drink” “I still had so much left.” Even took a couple sips and it was pretty gross getting small chunks of parm in there..

169,Not the A-hole,"So I work at a bakery that sells these big cupcakes for $1.75 each.

A couple of weeks ago this kid (I don’t know his age, but I assume he’s around 9) came in alone and wanted to buy a cupcake so I packed one up for him and asked for $1.75 (no tax). He said he only had $1.00. I remembered cashiers letting me off the hook when i was a kid for times I didn’t have enough change with me, so I said he could take it for $1.00. 

Well the next time I worked, this kid comes in again and to buy a cupcake, but says he only has one dollar... I thought it was weird  that he didn’t bring the needed amount after last time, but I let him take it for a dollar.

 Just a note: My bakery’s flexible with our bread because it’s privately owned, so we do things like throw in a free bread if you’re a regular or if you buy a lot of things. This wasn’t really breaking any strict rules.

So the next time I work, he comes in AGAIN, says he wants a cupcake, and says he only has a dollar. At this point, I realized that this kid new exactly what he was doing. His mom has probably been sending him alone and telling him that we’ll let it go because he’s a kid. I’m all for letting a customer or kid go if they’re a couple of cents off, but this kid has been purposefully doing this and probably does it when I’m not working too. I told him I was sorry and that I couldn’t sell it to him. His reaction was like “:/ ok”’and he left the store.

However, I’m guessing my coworkers have been letting him go every time because during my shifts, he comes in and walks out immediately when he spots me.

This led me to wonder if I should just let him go because it’s only a $0.75 difference and he’s a little kid. But, I also don’t think it’s right. So, AITA?",62,548,0.97

172,Not the A-hole,"My mom (65) has questionable taste in men and has been dating this midwestern libertarian (70) for a couple years. He’s seemingly the most decent dude she’d dated- doesn’t have drinking or drug problems so that’s an improvement! We’ve only spent time together maybe 3-4 times total and aside from getting into it drunk one night about politics, our interactions have been minimal and totally civil. 

We visited them for spring break last week, and towards the end of their visit they had some friends over for drinks. One of them made an inappropriate comment about the food my sister was eating and I said as much in a way I thought was discreet and not impolite. My mom’s boyfriend full-on lost it on me for my assertiveness, screaming and cussing and insulting me in an aggressive and physically intimidating manner that was deeply personal and super overblown IMO. He did it in front of my young children and his friends, and didn’t stop until my husband physically removed him from my personal space. The hatred was palpable, and we decided to leave and get a hotel. 

My mom blames me for instigating this. She wants me to tell her how to fix it, instead of looking hard at her boyfriend’s behavior and having a discussion about the implications of his temper. I worry it’s the tip of the iceberg of his anger problems. He was not drunk! We don’t have to like each other at all, but his outburst drew a line in the sand for me because it indicated his lack of impulse control. 

WIBTA if I told my Mom I didn’t want him around my kids or in my life? She’s talking about therapy which is fine, except I don’t really know if that should include me as I don’t particularly feel it’s my issue to solve.  I’m also not particularly interested in spending time with someone who obviously hates me so much.

So he goes home and I get my best friends together for a spring break road trip. We end up driving to Las Vegas from Maryland which was a huge drive but super fun. When I get back my roommate asks how the trip was and I tell him and he FREAKS OUT. He said he assumed we were just gonna drive to the beach or something, like just a few hours away, not almost to the west coast. I told him he didn’t say anything about distance when he lent the car to me, and it’s unfair to get mad at me when he didn’t bother to say anything.

I don’t know where she found it, but the things he was arrested for were listed and they were way worse than trespassing. I looked into it more and he was charged with a felony and then pled it down to a misdemeanor. I am not comfortable with sharing what he was actually charged with/ convicted of, but it was not a relatively harmless property crime like trespass.

I was absolutely stunned and devastated and I left him. Instead of accepting it, he has told all his family and our mutual friends that he’s concerned about my mental health because I ended things so abruptly and has been asking them one by one to reach out to me. It’s been so difficult to have people that I thought cares about me trying to subtly undermine my decision to leave him. So I’ve started sending the link to the mugshot website back.

177,Not the A-hole,"Back story: I've been planning on building a crib for my future kid for a long time now(over two years). I have been looking up health and safety specifications for cribs with government sources. For gifts for holidays/birthdays I'd ask for a gift card to local home improvement store or tools related to what I'd need to build it(router, router bits etc)

Fast forward to February: In-laws say they want to buy crib for baby, but I can't say anything as I wanted it to be a surprise for my wife.

March: She goes to Florida with InLaws during march break as they rent a condo down there. I start building crib. Crib takes longer than expected to build(clamping, glueing, drying, sanding, etc). Wife comes back and sees unfinished product(she's not a very imaginative person: she has to see final product to judge) She seems ok with it and gives some constructive feedback.

This week: Wife facetime's her parents to show them I've been working on it. They are apparently furiously mad(I don't know I wasn't there). Wednesday they talk to my wife and tell her: You know James isn't a carpenter right? We'll just buy you a crib. Which sort of puts my wife in a weird spot between us. Thursday and Friday I carpool with my Father InLaw to work, not once was the subject brought up with me. Friday, my FIL comes home(wife is there) and asks her: So when are we shopping for a crib?

More backstory: This isn't the first time they've thrown my skills under the bus. They even do it in my field of study(I.T. programming and network) saying my wife's brother can do a job better(despite him never being formally trained on it and self taught like most of the other skills I've acquired)",44,99,0.95
178,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend group of about 12 people and am married. They are are all more or less really into geeky/nerdy things, but I'm just not. For example, they did midnight shows of Star Wars movies, Marvel movie watch parties, all kinds of stuff like that. I've politely declined these kinds of events and sent my husband along. All this time I thought it was fine. 

Well the latest is everyone setting up weekends they'll host some kind of Game of Thrones watch party. A bunch of us were at dinner figuring out who would take which weekend. I spoke up to say that we would happily put in money for anyone's weekend to cover cost of drinks or snacks.

The next day I got a message from one of the other women in the group asking me why we didn't host one. I said that I don't even watch the show, so it would be weird, and that everyone else seemed to have it covered. She asked me why I don't watch the show and kept saying ""You are the ONLY human being alive not into GOT. I promise.""

She said she's always thought it was weird that I didn't join in that stuff. I told her that I don't like that kind of stuff, but that I'm there for board game nights or bar trivia, that a bunch of us did a half marathon last spring, some of us have gone to concerts together, etc. 

This wasn't good enough though, and she said this: It's not really about what you have done but what you haven't. GOT ending is a huge deal, and to have someone in our group dis us and the show is hurtful. I really think you should come, you'll probably get into the show, just stop thinking you're not like the other girls because you don't like ""geeky"" things.

I was taken aback by this and have sat with it for a few days, not responding to her. For the record, I don't think I'm not like any other girl, there are millions of women just like me. I just don't enjoy that tv show. There are plenty of tv shows I do like. 

After sharing the convo with my husband, he told me that there was nothing wrong with me not wanting to go or host a party for a show I don't even like. But apparently that conversation got around to other people, because a few of the other members (all women, actually) told me I was being a snob and one of them went as far as to mock me for liking pop music and thinking I was ""too good"" for them.

179,No A-holes here,"First post ever, and it's a long post, sorry. English isn't my first language so please have mercy on me.

So, the title might make me seem like TA, but here is the full story:

I have known my best friend since High School (18 years ago). We have been close ever since those important formative years. Through boyfriends, heartbreaks, disappointments, Joys etc etc.

She was in an abusive relationship about 8 years ago and as much as I loved her, I couldn't stand seeing the way he broke her down and insulted her, after really trying to get through to her, build her confidence etc, she took his side and and he obviously didnt like me, so we took a 4 year break. After about 3 - 4 years her eyes opened and she walked out of the relationship, we made contact and our friendship just started again where we left off. She was dating a great guy who my husband and I really liked, we enjoyed going out with them, she and I went househunting for her (and boyfriend), I was the first person she called when she got engaged, etc.

Anyway, even though we excitedly talked about her wedding, I realised recently that she has 4 bridesmaids and I didn't make the cut. It hurt. One would think that things won't hurt so much when you are over 30, but I spent nights crying with my wonderful but concerned hubby trying to  understand and cheer me up.

I got over it. I was originally thinking of not attending the wedding because I know that rejection will hurt and bring back some other experiences of rejection that I just managed to work through, but I manned up, realised it's about her and I'm going. But since I found out I have been withdrawing myself from her and from our friendship on the whole. I'm not being nasty or rude, I'm just not actively investing in our friendship any longer, not going out of my way to contact her first (but obviously responding and being friendly and supportive when she contacts me), etc. She recently told me that she and her husband2b will be emigrating to another country for a few years about 3 days after the wedding (later this month) and even though I am thrilled and overjoyed for the opportunity they have (and told her that), I don't think I will be going to much trouble to maintain a friendship once she has left.

I had a beautiful wedding gift made for them, two paintings that I will be framing, one with her and her hubby with travel gear and the other with the two of us depicting a special memory that we shared. This is more like a farewell gift from me. Something to cherish good memories while possibly not making any more anytime soon. 

AITA for practically ending (or at least downgrading) a friendship because I wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid? To me not being asked (she asked other friends) showed me that I really wasn't that important to her, so I'm wondering why I should invest so much into someone that doesn't even see me as one of their top 5 friends?

Edit: I should have mentioned that I did tell her about this. I wrote her a mail and made sure it wasn't confrontational at all or accused her of anything (it's her choice after all), I just said that I was feeling very hurt and rejected. She said she was truly sorry that I'm hurt (I believe her) but that it comes down to her wedding and it's done, so I kind of need to get over it. Which I did, but I decided that if she didn't see me as that important to her, I can probably do the same?",19,28,0.92
180,Not the A-hole,"My sister is a single mother with 2 young boys. We grew up sort of Lutheran, but only going to church on Christmas and Easter--I've since become religious (as in I believe in a God, but am not tied to any one denomination) and my sister a firm atheist. My sister goes away for her job regularly and our mom was unavailable so I offered to watch her kids for the weekend (Friday and Saturday). A few hours before my sister is supposed to pick them up, she calls me saying she has to stay in the city for another night and won't be home until midday Sunday. I told her I was happy to watch the boys another day, but this wasn't what I had planned. For the last month I've been filling in for a friend (whose hand I slammed in a car door) who plays the keyboard during the worship part of a church service. This part of the service typically only lasts for about 15 minutes, but I wasn't going to leave a 5 and 7 year old alone so I brought them with me. I had them sit in the front where I could keep an eye on them while I was on stage. After the singing was over, we left. I did inform their mother beforehand that I had this responsibly and she was very clear about not wanting the boys to go to a church. However, they were already with me and like I said before, I couldn't just leave them at my flat. She didn't give any suggestions except me not going (which wasn't an option), so I told her that I was sorry but I would be taking them. I checked my phone afterwards to find several angry texts and missed phone calls. When she picked them up later that day she was still fuming. I thought she would get over it, but today she called to tell me that she heard her oldest singing ""a God song"" and that I was not allowed to see them anymore. She accused me of trying to convert them to Christianity, which IMO is nonsense. I don't even attend that church and we didn't stay for the sermon. The only ""Christian propaganda"" (her words) I was exposing them to was Christian pop music (the song her kid was singing was [Our God](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/christomlin/ourgod.html)). She's expecting an apology, but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong here, especially considering I was doing her a favor. AITA?",349,795,0.93

I told my mom about my mental health problems two years ago, but she only ever brought it up twice and basically told me “sorry but there’s nothing I can do” and “I don’t understand.” I think she just didn’t WANT to understand.
But now that my sister’s seizure medication is giving her mental health problems (don’t seem to be nearly as bad as mine), my parents comfort her and are always trying to help her. 
They also did little things that show they favor my sister. For example, whenever my sister wants to see a certain singer, my parents don’t hesitate to make my whole family go just so she can see them (it’s a 3 hour drive). We’ve done this for her 3 times. But when I asked to see a band in that same city, my mom’s first question is “who will take you?” I assumed her considering she’s taken my sister three times. My sister has gotten to see countless concerts, but I have not seen one because my parents won’t take me.

183,Not the A-hole,"I'm honestly really fucking conflicted on this and idk what to do. This may get long, so TL:DR at the bottom of it does. 

I (22M) have two younger sisters, H and K who are 15 and 10 respectively. They both have me absolutely wrapped around their little fingers and can get me to do anything. When I tell you I love those girls more than I love anything else in the world, I really do mean it. I guess that's mostly because I've acted as a parent to them for most of their lives; their father walked out on our mother shortly before K was born and we haven't seen hide nor hair of him since. Our mum suffers from a rather severe case what I believe to be bipolar, but I can't say for sure because she refuses to get a proper diagnosis or treatment, citing a phobia of doctors as her reason. 

As one can imagine when suffering with something like that and refusing treatment, she historically hasn't been the greatest mother in the world. Don't get me wrong - sometimes she was fine and was ""with it"" enough to take care of us properly. Other times, however, she'd either have these wild manic phases where she'd go on massive spending sprees and blow all our money but forget to pay the bills or buy groceries or go on party benders and vanish for days or even weeks at a time, or she'd have depressive phases where she wouldn't get out of bed for days and we'd kind of have to fend for ourselves. While I was at home, these phases were frequent enough to be frustrating, but it was about a 50/50 balance of her being okay and not. 

After I moved out at 18 for uni, things seemingly started getting steadily worse. It's now reached a point where I have to send H money each week so *she* can do the grocery shopping, and where they're both going to the local leisure centre to shower regularly because mum keeps ""forgetting"" to pay the hot water bill. There's also been several occasions where one of them has called me in tears because mum has come home drunk or high and passed out in a pool of vomit. I've tried repeatedly to talk to mum about getting help, but she just cries and talks about how afraid of doctors she is and refuses to get actual medical help, instead preferring to rely on things like essential oils and such to ""help"". 

Things really came to a head about a month ago, when H called me, absolutely crying her eyes out, because mum hadn't been home in a week and people to whom she owes money keep coming to the house looking for her. I rang everyone I could think of to find out where the fuck she was, eventually locating her as having been at some guys apartment snorting coke an hour away from the house the whole time. I was fucking furious. I live more than two hours away from their place and in a shared apartment without much space or I'd have gone and picked my sisters up in a heart beat. So I did the next best thing I could think of and called CPS on my mother. My sister's have (hit send too soon by accident, editing to complete) been placed in the care of our aunt while I look for a bigger place with space for them to come and stay with me. 

However, I have been getting a barrage of messages from my mother and various other relatives telling me how devastated my mum is, how much she regrets what she did and how she can't help it because she's *so* afraid of doctors. Also getting told I'm an asshole for doing this to my own mother I'm getting so many messages I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA or did I do the right thing?",42,59,0.89

When I received the check I found out all our drinks were upcharged to top shelf, nearly doubling the cost.  We were never asked about any upcharges, and the menu lists the option for premium drinks as ""optional"" in small text.

There was no apology, no mention of restaurant policy, and no other explantation.  The waitress was quietly upcharging everyone hoping to get tipped the same percentage on a bigger bill.

Anyways last night we had the 12947th fight again after he called me some names or whatever and tried to defend some crazy communist theory he read in some internet corner. I told him to fuck off and he told me to shut up. Then I let loose and called him a “fucking 30 year old chronic loser.” I said society’s not to blame for him being a jobless loser and that even if communism succeeded he’d still be living at home as a 30 year old broke virgin, except he’d maybe lose a few pounds working the fields than masturbating to anime every day.

Context: I am a 4th year medical student with experience in hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes. 

Recently, I was on a flight back from a holiday I took to Mexico back to the UK where I live. The flight takes about 12 hours in total, and about 9 hours in a call went out asking that any doctor or nurse on board to make themselves known to the cabin crew to help with a medical emergency. I didn’t volunteer. I’m not sure what the emergency was, but when we landed we all had to wait on the plane whilst an ambulance came and collected the person that was sick, so I’m guessing it must have been serious. 

My friends were with me and called me an asshole for not volunteering to help as I will be graduating as a doctor in about a year and I have experience with working shifts on wards throughout the hospital. 

I didn’t volunteer because, whilst I do have a lot of medical knowledge, I am not a qualified doctor yet and I have always had doctors and nurses around when I’ve been treating patients in the hospital.

So instead I offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

Money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. I do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. But she thinks I'm being stingy for not buying her a ""real"" diamond. We've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now I wanted to ask you guys if I should just suck it up or not.",3316,16715,0.89

195,Not the A-hole,"I live with my 25 year old sister and her two little girls 4 and 2. She recently started a job that is 2-6 pm and I’ve been watching them on my days off work. Here’s some background info to better understand the situation. 
 
I work 4-6 days a week usually all day. But I always work Saturdays and Sundays all day. She does not, she has those days off. She does not pay me for watching the children and I do not receive anything in return for doing the favor of watching her children. 

She got her job in January and since then when I watch them I usually clean up after them. They always make a mess with their toys and always spill their food. But I don’t mind the cleaning cause I might as well since I live here too. But I would always tell them when they made a mess to clean up after themselves. I’m trying to teach them good habits here. So on saturdays and sundays when I come home from work the house is always a mess. ALWAYS. Dishes are in the sink, there are toys everywhere, spilled juice is still on the floor, cracker dust is all on the couch. A mess and I’m tired so I try my best and clean up what I can. I’ve told my sister plenty of times that she needs to start telling them clean up after themselves. They start learning habits at this age and it gets kind of annoying when I have to tell them 10 times to pick up a toy. But she ignores me when I tell her that and doesn’t discipline them at all. 

So two weeks ago my sister went on vacation for a week. Before she left I cleaned the house spotless. Not a crumb in sight. And that entire week I made sure to have everything so clean you could eat food of the floor. The night they came back my nieces made a mess. Toys EVERYWHERE. Shredded cheese throughout the hall. And all of their luggage and clothing spread throughout the dining room. Again that night I told them to clean up after themselves. The next few days my sister had no work cause she came back on Friday and had Saturday and Sunday to chil. Well I worked all day Saturday Sunday and then Monday. In those 3 days my sister did not clean a thing. I get maybe she was tried from traveling but after having 2 days of chillin like can’t you at least broom? I know she hasn’t cleaned at all because we have this card game and she gave it to them to play with, which I have told her before to NOT give to them because they always throw the cards everywhere and we can never find all of them. That card game was still all over the floor in those three days she did not attempt to even pick them up. 

I feel like she is expecting me to clean because I’ve always cleaned up after them. But none of that is my mess and she had been home she could have cleaned. So for right now it’s now been almost a week and the living room, dining room, and kitchen are all a mess and I’m not planning on cleaning it anytime soon. I feel like she needs to clean up after them mainly cause she was watching them and they are her kids. 

So AITA since I don’t want to clean up after them?",34,77,0.93

197,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend was looking at plane tickets so he can visit his brother and found that they were pretty cheap.  He let's his bro know and the sister in law tells him what day he can come. He tells me the days and I request the days off work. Normal.  

But this is where  it bothers me. The sister in law looks for plane tickets and starts booking it for us and I guess it because they want to pay for my boyfriends ticket. That's nice and all, but I don't like that she's booking for us because last time we traveled, she messed something up and we had to pay for a carry-on. So she ends up booking it and we find out that she booked an extra day more because the other ones sold out. That extra day I'm scheduled in to work because I already told my boss which days I needed off. 

I guess it just pisses me off so much because I'm trying to move up in my job and now I'm going to end up not showing to work because I'm staying an extra day and no one wants to cover my shift and that makes me look bad.

 I got mad at my boyfriend saying I don't like other people booking my traveling because they can mess up and it's just gives me peace of mind doing it myself.. he said that ""every time he visits them shes going to book, don't come then""

He says ""I'm really making a big deal out of this. I should stop freaking out and just not show up. it's not like I didn't tell them ahead of time I wouldn't make it"" Am I freaking out? I don't know...I don't think I'm going to go again if someone else books for me and I kind of wish I wasn't going tbh because this has bothered me so much.",91,197,0.96
198,Not the A-hole,"Edit: Sorry for the confusion. I mistakenly said her apartment. I meant her house, I pay her bills and pay for my own apartment.

I recently moved back in with my mother temporarily while she recovers from a major surgery.

This happened yesterday. I was sitting upstairs when I heard a knock at the door, but mom had gotten to it before I did as she was downstairs. I open the door to the room I'm in and I hear a guy's voice talking with mom, saying he was new to the area and walking through our neighborhood for the first time and really had to use the washroom, and wanted to know if he could ""please use ours really quick"". This weirded me out, but then he started complimenting the house and said ""This is a beautiful home, you have it all to yourself?"" To me, that set off alarm bells and I came downstairs. 

Mom had opened the inside door, but the gated-type screen we have stayed closed and mom talked from behind it. Guy stares at me then goes ""Oh hi, I was hoping to use the restroom."" I said hello, and then told him he wouldn't be able to use our washroom. Mom started to interject saying it wouldn't be a problem and I told him yeah, it would. He puts his hand on the doorframe and sort of leans against the gate and says ""She already said yes"" mom started speaking up again and I told him I'm not as comfortable as she is letting strangers in the house. He stared at me for a few seconds before I told him he needs to turn around and walk away at which point he did.

I know on the surface this seems rude, and mom thinks I was an asshole unnecessarily. Here's my thought process, and I'm hoping if someone can tell me it's at least reasonable or I was an asshole for no reason. Our house is on a cul-de-sac type road, which itself branches off a somewhat sparsely traveled back road which takes ten minutes in either direction to get to or from town, or at least 20 minutes walking if not more. Our house is also the second to last house on the road. It seemed incredibly odd to me that someone would walk such an untraveled road to ""explore the area"" when there's nothing in the area and came all the way down our street to ask for a washroom rather than one of the houses close to the entrance to our road. No houses on our road are available, so if he was ""new to the area"" it would have had to been somewhere closer to town, meaning he took a 20+ minute walk down some shithole road, found our street with nothing but residential homes on it and specifically came to our house way in the back to use the washroom. I also got a bad vibe from him asking if she has the place to herself.

Mom says I'm being overly cautious and has been giving me lectures on politeness. Maybe he was truly just exploring and his question was normal conversation but to me it seemed too weird and like someone scoping out the physically impaired older woman living alone. Am I completely off base by being a jerk to this guy?",166,842,0.98
199,Not the A-hole,"My SO and I are expecting and with the help of my friends we have a very large baby shower planned. This will be the first grandkid on both sides so we are expecting over 120 people. 

Since we are on a budget we decided to throw a backyard shower at my parents house. Due to a lot of conflicting schedules we ended up picking a date that is one of my siblings birthday. My sibling only asked that we celebrate their birthday after which we easily agreed to- we are a big birthday family, it's like mini Christmas. 

Anyways we planned everything and I told my in laws several times that we have obligations after due to birthday plans. My MIL decides to have a gathering at her house after the baby shower with her side of the family (I have no problem with this). Well we are a week out and she just asked us what time they should expect us. I told her politely that we had plans after but she claims to have forgotten-for reference this lady remembers what she ate 30 years ago for dinner so I doubt she actually forgot. She then said I don't have to go but my SO- her child- needs to attend. Mind you we are having a party that needs to be cleaned up AND a birthday celebration to fit in.

201,No A-holes here,"For the record, I am not currently pregnant, nor do I plan to become pregnant. TL;DR at the bottom. 

A little backstory. My partner and I have been together for almost 8 years. We met back in college, and we seemed to agree on a lot of things early on in the relationship. My partner has Asperger’s, which he told me very early on. His brother has it too, and it is suspected, though not confirmed, that his father has it as well. We both agreed back then that, should we ever want to have kids, it might be better to adopt, since it would be very likely that our child would be also be autistic. 

Fast forward to now. We were ambivalent about having children then, but I have firmly decided since that I don’t want any. He knows this, and while he claims he has accepted it, I don’t think he really has. For the past couple months, I’ve floated around the idea of getting sterilized. 

The particular incident today started with him reminding me to look up a doctor’s name again and to call next week to book an appointment with her to inquire about getting my tubes tied. He then asked me why I’ve been procrastinating on this. I really want to do it, but I sense reluctant support from him that makes me uneasy. I explained that we haven’t really talked about what this means for our relationship, if his feelings have changed, and if he’s going to regret not having kids. I would like to have an open and honest discussion with him about these things first. That’s when he asked the question: Is it just that you don’t want kids or that you don’t want MY kids? I told him that it was the former, but that I thought we were in agreement back when we first started dating that, even if we wanted kids, we would adopt anyway. I thought he understood that I didn’t want to have a (biological) child with him, and that getting my tubes tied ensures that we don’t. Now he’s mad at me. 

For the record, I love my partner deeply, but I cannot imagine taking on this stress. He has told me a little bit about what his childhood was like and about the resources he needed when he was growing up. He was fortunate enough to go to a school that provided resources, but I know that most schools don’t provide the level of support that he received. It would be very difficult, stressful, and financially burdensome for us to raise a child with Asperger’s. While we both have decent paying jobs, there is no way that we could pay for the resources our child would likely need. Moreover, I don’t know if we both could handle the additional stress and strain on our relationship. 

TL;DR

My partner and I agreed when we first started dating that it would be better for us not to have children because he and some members of his family have Asperger’s. Now that I want to get sterilized, he thinks I’m an asshole for not wanting to have his biological children, who would likely also have Asperger’s.



EDIT: Since there has been a lot of confusion, I’ll add that I don’t want children. At all. With anyone. That’s why I’m getting sterilized. I absolutely despise them, don’t want to bring a child into this world, and know that I would be a terrible parent. I consistently refer to children as “crotch goblins”, and I literally cannot stand to be around them for more than 5 minutes. I told him all of this yesterday, and he understood, though I think he was deeply saddened by it. Also, I didn’t actually tell him that I didn’t want his kids because he’s autistic. But, if I’m being honest with myself, that’s even more of a reason in my mind not to have them. If I can’t stand children, how would I handle one that requires even more attention and time? I am just not cut out for that. 

Also, he was the one that suggested way back when that we do adoption if we wanted children. Obviously, I won’t be doing that now (since I hate kids), and he has since decided that he wants a biological child instead. Will we part ways over this? I don’t know. That’s why I wanted to try and gauge how important this is to him. He understands and even concedes that my reasons for not wanting children are good ones, but he still wants a kid.",182,217,0.9
202,Not the A-hole,"I (29F) am currently going through a divorce, and it's looking like I will have to move in with my parents for a while (for free) to get myself on my feet. I have two kids (5M, 2M) who will be living with me there. 

My parents are both highly religious Mormons. It is a very high-demand religion with very specific rules and beliefs, and their whole life revolves around it. 

They raised me as a Mormon, and I believed every word until about 4 years ago when I researched the hell out of it and found a lot of holes in the logic. At that time, I left the church and had mine and my oldest son's names removed from their membership list. I've been agnostic ever since. 

Since I've left Mormonism, I've been raising my kids to think for themselves. I want them to question what they're told, do their own research, and decide what they believe. But they are still young and impressionable.

Today, my mom babysat my kids while I was at work. I arrived to pick them up just as they were saying a prayer for dinner. I saw my 5-year-old fold his arms and bow his head--something he's never done before tonight. It rubbed me the wrong way, but I didn't say anything about it.

On the way home, he told me that my mom told him that when we die, we'll come back to life and live again. I asked him a little more about it, told him that no one knows what happens when we die, and different people believe different things, and asked him what he thinks happens. He said he still believed we'll come back to life.

I don't have a problem with him believing certain aspects of Mormonism. It, like other belief systems, has a lot of good principles. My problem is that my mom knows I don't believe in any of it, knows I don't want my kids raised Mormon, and is teaching them about it anyway. My problem is that my mom recites her beliefs as fact instead of belief. She'll say, ""Everyone will be resurrected after they die,"" instead of, ""I believe everyone will be resurrected when they die."" She's an extremist, and to her, her beliefs are solid truth, and that's how she shares her beliefs with my children. 

I'm worried about what she will teach my children when we're living there day in and day out. How much she'll influence their thoughts. I had a lot of shame while growing up Mormon (it's a religion that breeds shame), and worked to let it go once I left the church, and it scares me that my children could grow up with the same shame. 

So my question is this: am I the asshole for asking my mom to refrain from pushing her religion onto my children, even though we'll be living in her house for free for a while?",73,192,0.92
203,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds awful but hear me out. 

About a month ago, my brother-in-law came over for a visit but had no one to watch his dog. So we said he could bring the dog with him, as long as they leave with him (since he has a history of leaving them at his moms house and not telling her when he’ll pick them up.) he said he would take them with him when he left.

He comes over that weekend and he brought a puppy, which we didn’t know about, and his full grown bulldog (we knew about this one.) The puppy isn’t potty trained at all, so we had to keep an eye on him and our niece, who was left in our care while he went out to get lunch or whatever. 

Sunday, we had to go shopping to get groceries and we asked if he’d be at the house when we came back. He said yeah and we left. When we came back, he was gone but the dogs were still in here. He left one can of dog food and 4 puppy pads for potty training. My life has been a living hell for the last month. 

Every morning I wake up to peed on carpet, poo in my kitchen, and my furniture chewed on every corner. We can’t put the puppy in the kennel or locked in a room cause he whines to a point of no one getting sleep, so he’s free to roam out living room. The stench of our front room has kept us locked in our bedroom, no matter how much I clean, it still smells awful. The worst of it, I have 3 cats who are deathly afraid of dogs and I was fine with locking them in a room for the weekend. But this whole month they’ve been too terrified to leave the room and when they do, they get chased around. One of the cats got out and hasn’t been back in a week.

He’s been leading us on about picking up his dogs saying “Oh, I’ll get them next week” or “Mom will bring them here next week.” He’s 3 hours away and we can’t afford to drive over there and drop off his dogs. He doesn’t seem to really care that the dogs have been here for a month. He hasn’t called or text to see how they are, and he didn’t leave us any kind of money for dog food or puppy pads. We texted him today to see if he’d be taking his dog this weekend. He looked at it and didn’t reply. Then we said we need these dog gone, either come get em or we’ll find them a new home. He immediately got rude and said he’ll pick his dogs up eventually (no date set still).

WIBTA If I got rid of my brother-in-laws dogs?


Edit: I just got up a few hours ago and read through all of the comments. I’m glad to know I wouldn’t be the asshole but I wanted to clear some things since I was tired writing this post. 

We would let the dogs out every hour, but immediately when the puppy came back in he would relieve himself on my carpet or couches. We would put him back out right after but it was useless after the first couple of weeks (we continued to do it through the whole month). We went and bought more potty training pads, but the puppy would go off of them (which isn’t the puppy’s fault, he’s trying.) Just when we would sleep, they wouldn’t be able to go out every hour. 

The puppy wasn’t actually going to be his forever dog. My BIL had his bulldog breed with another bulldog and was planning on selling the puppy, so he can make some cash. But when he dropped the puppy off it was about 2 months old. He hasn’t received any shots or gone to the vet yet. He told us that he was planning on taking the puppy to the vet after leaving our house, but he obviously didn’t. We don’t have the money to get his animals to the vet to get them checked out if anything happens and once again he left us no money to do so.

I’m not used to having dogs, at all. I’m more of a cat person. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good doggo and pupper! But I don’t enjoy the after math of chewed up tables and pee stained carpet. So it was just kinda new to me to have a dog around me all the time (through my childhood I’ve only had cats.)

Also a small update, my husband got a text from his mom telling us she’s taking the dogs today back to BIL house. They’re no longer in our house and we are quite relieved. If I learn any more info, I’ll make another update on this post.",49,40,0.89
204,Not the A-hole,"I am genuinely baffled by what happened at dinner the other night.

&#x200B;

I was out at dinner with two friends, A and C. We're all from different countries (me, America; A, Hong Kong; C, Australia), so we were talking about our school systems and their differences. I brought up my world history class, and mentioned a song we learned in it to help us remember the order of the Chinese dynasties. I sang it as an example. It's to the tune of  Frère Jacques, and the ONLY lyrics are the names of the dynasties to that tune--Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han; Shang, Zhou, Qin, Han; Sui, Tang, Song; Sui, Tang, Song... Etc.

When I finished, I was like, ""see? Useful, right?""

My friend C immediately says, ""sure, but it's really racist.""

I asked for clarification because I seriously didn't understand what part was racist, and she just kept saying it was without an explanation.

We all live in Asia (Japan). C has said some pretty racist stuff in the past (telling me there were too many black people in my home town, calling Asian people ""Ching Chongs"" in front of our friend from Hong Kong, openly using the n word with a hard 'r' (she's white), etc.). She always plays it off as she was just kidding even though we've called her out on it multiple times. But I think that was one of the reasons I was surprised \*she\* was calling me out for the song.

For what it's worth, my friend A told me she didn't see anything wrong with the song, too. Is there some racial etiquette that we don't know about? Or is C wrong?",33,33,0.94
205,Not the A-hole,"I know the title probably doesn't sound great - but hear me out.

For some reference, I live with my brother, and also my girlfriends (polyamorous relationship)

Around February, my brother got fed up with his horrible job and started looking for a new one. Last month, he got two job interviews in the same day and felt confident both would call him back. Because of this, he informed my partners and I, he intended to walk out of his current job. We all advised against it since even with the four of us we all live very paycheck-to-paycheck and neither job had given him a solid answer yet.

He walked out that day despite our warnings. Over the next week he awaited his call-back, which never came. He called both places and both said they were no longer interested in hiring him.

I was angry because he put our rental and general wellbeing at stake by taking a gamble on the jobs. Plus, put himself in jeporty of not being able to afford his meds. (Antipsychotics, for Bi-poler)

Today was his last paycheck and I brought us all together to run the numbers. We have $300 less in income than we have in outcome. Not good.

So we started running down what to remove. He had a doctor's appointment an hour away tomorrow which I was going to have to pay for the gas for. Money I don't have for another week. He cancelled his appointment no problem. He had enough meds and refills to last till the end of May, and by then he will very hopefully have a job.

He was fine with that untill he realized I had kept hosting Easter with my in-laws in the budget. Something which, I had agreed to do all the way back in December and had been preparing for since. (Including putting money aside, making plans, buying ingredients)

It'll be tight but the money for the get-together is coming out of my income, not his. And he does have meds going forward. And either way, he's the one who decided to quit his job despite warnings.

But now he's calling me an asshole for putting a holiday get together before his doctors appointment. Pointing out it wouldn't matter if I canceled since my in-laws would completely understand.

I know my in-laws would be okay with me cancelling but I don't feel like it's fair for him to ask me to cancel something I planned ahead for and was looking forward to because of his poor decisions.

Any other time his health always come first, and I have pitched in before to make sure he always has what he needs, even when it meant it was tight for my partners and I. AITA?

Update: I'll be talking to him about this very soon, as shown to me by the people of this thread and several people in my life IRL. This behavior has been very much a pattern with him, despite my best efforts to put a stop to it. It's time for a real talk about it.  


Edit: Quick update to make %100 sure we are all very clear I am not in a polyamorous relationship including my brother. No. No no no. No. Very no. Let's never speak of this misunderstanding again. No. I have a wife and a girlfriend. My brother happens to live with us.",41,75,0.94

207,Asshole,"My wife and I have been married for almost 6 years and we have a kid together. She is more religious than I am and feels that porn is bad for spiritual health. She also has low self esteem and feels inadequate compared to pornstars, despite me telling her how attractive I think she is.

My wife and I agreed when we got married that we wouldn’t have porn in our marriage because it was a dealbreaker for her. I happily married her knowing this. As time went on, I craved porn more and became unhappy without it. For the past year, I have been looking at porn and lying to her about it. She has told me in the past that if I lie to her about looking at porn and she finds out about it, she would be willing to divorce me for it because her trust in me would be broken and it’s that serious to her. But I crave it deeply in a way she doesn’t get and what she doesn’t know, won’t hurt her or us. I’ve hidden it successfully for a year so the chances of her suddenly finding out one day is low, since I know how to hide it well. I find the fact that she’s willing to divorce me over porn to be hyper-extreme and kind of crazy. It’s just porn. I believe porn is a healthy outlet and one person shouldn’t ban another person from it. 

Am I the asshole for lying and hiding porn from my wife or is she the asshole for trying to ban me from something I deeply crave?

Edit: I’m seeing a lot of people calling me the asshole here but I didn’t list all of the facts throughout the years. My wife has had deep-seated insecurity and trust problems, and used to have virtually no trust in me DESPITE the fact that I was being honest at the time, and wasn’t looking at porn behind her back. And now that I’m lying, she has more trust in me than she used to so I don’t want to tell her hey I’m going to look at porn without you too, and ruin that closeness that we have built together. I was honest with her many times as I started realizing I needed porn, and told her this is something I need, I’m not wired to be with/see one person for the rest of my life. She agreed to watch porn with me sometimes, to try to compromise. But watching it with her sometimes makes me crave it that much more on a daily basis, it’s like a tease or something so that’s when I started lying and looking on my own, too. I’m aware of the fact that I shouldn’t have married someone with opposite views like this but when we first got married, it didn’t bother me as much. I was 18 and didn’t even know myself, I was just infatuated with her so I didn’t care about porn. Time went on, I grew and changed, and realized I love porn and sex and the act of watching sex more than probably most. I can’t change how I’m wired so why should I have to limit myself from what I love? Isnt it unrealistic of her to expect me to want to see only her for the rest of our lives? And then yeah she’ll “watch porn with me” but only certain genres that she’s okay with, I feel like I can’t even show that I’m enjoying the stuff we watch because it’ll just prick her insecurities to know that I’m getting off on another woman - even though she’s RIGHT THERE and approved whatever it is we are watching. And I can’t even see everything I want to see with her, only the stuff that doesn’t make her feel as bad. I’m a grown adult, i should be able to live my life how I want and it’s just easier to look at porn without her there and without her knowing about it.

She blew up and told me I was being an immature baby and I simple told her that I have no obligation to her, and that I didn’t appreciate the fact that she hid the fact that she had STDs. If my friend hadn’t have told me, I wouldn’t have known, and that’s shitty and she should communicate that to her partners. She told me to “grow up” and walked off.

&#x200B;

I wasn’t really questioning my decision until I told my group of friends. Half were on my side but 2 of the girls defended her and told me I \*was\* acting immature. The argument died, but it had me questioning whether or not I was the asshole for turning her down for that reason.

214,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway just because I guess. I honest to god don’t know where else to ask this question but it’s caused a massive issue in my family. 

So some backstory is in order for sure. About 15 years ago I worked in a hospital as a janitor while in college. I was tasked to clean out an old store room in a little used wing as a project. Inside this room were about a dozen very lightly used igloo coolers. I asked my boss what they were for. He told me that the hospital used to be a leader in kidney and lung transplants and the coolers were literally used to transport organs across the country. I asked what I should do eith them, he said keep them if I wanted so me and all of my friends got cool “organ coolers.” I’ve had mine ever since and have used it for sport events, camping, picnics...you name it. 

So part two is my sister’s husband. He’s 32 and a very, very gifted cardiologist and very smart. But he is so difficult to be around because he’s not conversational, he always acts bothered to be around and hes very holier than thou. And he’s visiting with her this weekend. 

We were an hour into thier visit when my wife and sister tasked me and him to pack the cooler with beer for a pre Easter picnic at our church. I’d already run out of things to talk to him about so I tried to break the ice by saying “you might like this Will, this cooler used to carry human organs for transplant.” 

He basically went white and asked me very rudely to explain myself. I told him what I said above about how I got the cooler. He just tore into for using “sensitive medical equipment” as a “parlor gag” and then accused me of stealing. I told him it looked exactly like a cooler to me and he then said I was denigrating his entire profession and acting ghoulish by making jokes of organ transplants. I tried to calmly explain to him that it’s been 15 years and he cut me off and told me I’d made “15 years of stupid mistakes.” He then stormed off, grabbed my sister and I guess took off for my parents house. 

My wife is furious with me saying I should have just kept my mouth shut she now wants me to toss the cooler. To me that just seems stupid. It’s been a great cooler and it’s been cleaned many times so whatever. If I made any mistake it was trying to make common ground with Sheldon Cooper the heart surgeon.

216,Not the A-hole,"Today I was doing some minor maintenance on my car. It leaks oil really badly so I was under the hood checking the fluids and all of that. I had my ear buds listening to Spotify when I look up and am VERY startled to see two teenage girls not only in my yard, but very uncomfortably close to me. I have an exaggerated startle response due to trauma and being caught off guard like that immediately caused me distress, but I tried very hard to remain calm. 

I removed my ear buds and asked them what I could do for them. They were kind of chattering amongst themselves and ignoring me. Basically, they wanted a ride and were rudely debating if my car could even run all right there in front of me. It was really annoying. You ever have someone blatantly talking shit about you like you literally aren't standing right there hearing every word and then have the absolute audacity to ask for your help? Yeah. So anyway I told them to kick rocks. I didn't even know who these two were and this is not the kind of neighborhood to just wantonly wander onto someone else's property without invitation.

Well, they weren't trying to hear all of that and started talking even more shit. Insulting my car, which fine whatever it IS a piece of shit, but they crossed the line by making some insinuations about me as a person, basically implying that I was a lesbian for working on my own car and I needed a man to do that. Basically, they were really trying me but I didn't want to get into it with two literal children. As an adult, that's a seriously bad look so I just kept telling them to get to stepping but they would not. 

It really seemed to me that they were trying to intimidate me by acting hard and bowing up at me. It was really embarrassing so finally I just had enough and hosed them down. This is Florida so it was like 75 out. Anyway, that did the trick and they left immediately.

217,Not the A-hole,"So future hubs (22m) and I (21f) have both agreed from the beginning that we do not want any children in the wedding, with an exception of my siblings as they'll be in the wedding party, and even then it'll be made clear that they wouldn't be there for the entire if any of the reception (their ages currently range from 3-12). 

I come from a large family, I'm the eldest of over 20 cousins just on one side of the family alone, the second eldest of 12 on the other, the majority of them all under the age of 15. While I love the little monsters, that's exactly what they act like. The family reunions are usually insane. I love my aunts and uncles but they let my cousins get away with murder. The last big wedding with the family there was running, screaming, dancing to ""baby shark"", and the like. Future hubs is one of the youngest in his family, so other than a few second cousins, there's no issue.

My family is...a tad dramatic and overbearing. My parents especially. They're helping with the wedding, but only parts like my dress, officiant, stuff like that, we're paying the rest of the big stuff like venue, decor, and catering. They're already unhappy with a lot of decisions we've made about what we want in the wedding, but they lost it when they found out we will ask for no kids under the age of 15 attending. I've been told by my parents that I'm being selfish and inconsiderate of an important family event. I mentioned that we wanted this to be an adult occasion with adult language, jokes and games and they were not okay with that either. They want us to allow all the cousins to come, have only family friendly games and songs, and allow them to have their own table at the reception to sit together and serve kid options on the menu. 

Future hubs and I are high school sweethearts, we've been very excited to plan this wedding and make it our dream occasion to celebrate with all our friends and family, but we're still young and want to celebrate our wedding in our style.

Am I the asshole for standing our ground on this?

EDIT: My first silver! What the what?! Thanks for the reassurances, everyone. <3

EDIT 2: GOLD?! thanks y'all! This makes me feel a lot better, future hubs and I are talking about security and how we're going to tell family members about making it kid free, and we're considering adding in a daycare in a separate room in the venue for those who just absolutely can't leave their kids, BUT the kids have to be in that room.",337,835,0.93
218,No A-holes here,"TL;DR - My daughter is spoiled and doesn't know the value of a dollar. We're thinking of 

My daughter is 13, almost 14 - let's call her Tara. I've come to realize that she is somewhat spoiled. We (my husband and I) are very well off and have given her a good lifestyle; throughout her and her sibling's childhoods, we made sure to make sure our children know that they are very lucky and that we will not provide for them forever. However, it seems that Tara doesn't quite understand the value of a dollar yet and refuses to recognize how much of a privilege it is to have a huge house in a safe neighborhood, private schooling, a cellphone, etc. 

I haven't yet given a punishment to her yet, but it is on the table (and she knows it). For the past few months, she's been acting like a spoiled brat. In February, she destroyed a very nice dress we bought for a school dance and was mad because ""It's not like you guys can't afford another one."" For that, we made her do extra chores as a mock job until she repaid the value of the dress (and she did not get another). In March, Tara complained to her father that she didn't want him to drop her off at school anymore because it isn't as expensive and fancy as the others in the car lot (he drives a 2013ish Volvo and her friend's parents have Jaguars and BMWs); she had to walk 2 miles to everyday for a week for that. 

This past Thursday was the worst offence yet. I'm still seething. She was being foolish at school and somehow broke her phone AND someone else's. Now, the other girl in question is a close friend of Tara's, so I don't suspect any bullying, but I am still enraged at how she handled the situation. She apparently told her friend not to worry because we (her father and I) would pay for it. We had a nice, long chat about this last night about what happened; after a little digging, I realized Tara just isn't appreciative of what her father and I have provided her with. We've had multiple discussions about it, but I don't feel she truly gets it.

So far we have 3 options:

* Take away her phone and other expensive tech away for the next month. 

* Have her get a job doing yardwork/babysitting around the neighborhood until she can pay the equivalent of her phone bill

* Have her spend the summer at an uncle's house in a middle class neighborhood close to an impoverished area, where she'll do volunteer service at the local shelter every week. She will also have to have a job.

The last one is the most brutal, as it means she can't go on a girls trip with her BFFs - a (very expensive) trip she's gone on every summer for the past 2-3 years. I'm definitely a proponent of it, however, as she NEEDS to know how lucky she is and MUST gain some real world knowledge (considering my husband and I will only cover college tuition, not anything else, after she leaves the nest). My husband, however, feels it is a little cruel; he feels like we would have to ease her into conditions that ""shocking.""",420,1389,0.97

I got evicted from my apt last month.  I didn’t have anywhere close by to go besides him.  I was telling him about it before I was out and he offered to let me stay there.  I did not ask. 

So with lack of options I took him up on it.  He even let me have his bed and has been sleeping on his couch.  He’s been really nice.  He’s made or bought dinner for us nights.  He’s offered to drive me anywhere I need to go.  He even buys this specific brand of wine I like and will offer bring me a glass when he drinks his beer.  It’s really sweet, but I’m not blind or dumb.  I’m pretty sure he’s doing all this because he sees us going somewhere.  Honestly it’s not likely to happen.  Once I find a place and can afford it I’m going to move out and we’re just going to stay friends.

Two nights ago she started laundry really late (past the time she's been asked not to because the washing machine is loud and there are people besides her in the house who work the next morning) and forgot to switch the wash to the dryer.

Back in August my wife, sister in law and my brother made plans to go to Hawaii for spring break this year. My brother and sister in law are in the final year of college, I took off a week from work, and my wife is a teacher so she had the week off. Anyway plans were made, tickets purchased and then my parents who had originally told us they did not want to go as they were eyeing a cruise at the same time, decided that we were horrible as we should have known they really wanted to go.

This is typical behavior by them but as they live in another city thousands of miles away we do not have to deal with them often and grin and bare it when we do. Anyway they pouted until we got them tickets, which I had to pay for even though my parents are very well off and easily could afford plane tickets on their own.

Two weeks later my parents mention their good friends also got tickets and would be joining us. Now we are pissed because we had our trip planned down to a t, and my parents and their friends were not going to want to do half the things we wanted to do.

So I made my parents aware that since they hijacked our vacation, they were responsible to arrange for plans for their friends and themselves. My mom became agitated and said that what is the point of a family vacation if we were going to do our own thing. I responded that it was not a family vacation because she invited their friends therefore they needed to come up with their own itnerary. I did tell her what we planned on doing and they were welcome to join but she shot down everything we planned on doing.

Fast forward to this week we all met up at the airport and although we were all at the same resort, I was confident we would still have a good time. We would do our thing and they would do ours...

Nope every tour we left to go on, a passive aggressive tone was taken about how this was a family vacation and why do we hate them and not want to spend time with them. My parents and their friends did the same two things all week, go sit on the beach and drank themselves silly. Sorry I am not wasting my week of vacation getting sloppy drunk. The last night (Thu night) after a dinner in which my parents friends got completely sloshed and my parents berated the waitress because she dare cut off said friends, words were said.

It ended in a ugly argument, we told them they were rude and assholes (not in those exact words) for basically hijacking what was supposed to be a fun trip and ruining it. 

Our parents called us spoiled, entitled brats and that we married ungrateful, entitled women and until we apologized to them and their friends they are no longer speaking to us...

232,Not the A-hole,"I (39F) have been married to my SO (42M) for 12 1/2 years. At first I got along with MIL (72F) ok enough, but she would sometimes nag me about things or make comments that would irk me. I ignored them at first, but then the comments starting happening more often and became more insulting. She also complains about various things about me to my SO. He tries to deny this, but I hear her when she's on the phone because her voice is vary loud and piercing, and he accidentally admitted to it when he told me he was tired of us both complaining to him and putting him in the middle.

For instance she has nagged both of us about not having kids. My SO and I have always known neither of us wanted kids. We both love animals, especially cats, of which we now have 5, and we are happy with that. I understand not having grand-kids is upsetting to her, but she goes beyond saying she is upset and will say things like ""most people get rid of their stupid pets and have real children when they grow up"".

Stuff like this happened maybe once a month at first, but in the last 5 years it's been happening pretty much all the time. She now seems to oppose just about everything I do and say no matter what it is, from serious things such as important life choices, to trivial things like where I shop for groceries. If I like something, she tells me she doesn't like it and lists the reasons why. If I don't like something, she tells me tells me I'm wrong or crazy for not liking it. If my SO and I make a decision together about something that she doesn't like, she acts like I forced him (like the no kids thing).

Recently she started bitching at me because I never talk to my BIL's (45M) fiancée (36F). I can't stand FIL because she is racist and trashy, and when she drinks she yells out racist or other embarrassing things in public. She also likes to pretend her food/service at restaurants is bad so she can get free food. My SO can't stand her either. My BIL has also told us he hates her and wants to leave her. MIL knows her sons also can't stand FIL, yet she has singled me out and says that because I won't talk to FIL, I am ""breaking up the family"".

So here is my dilemna. I love my SO, I don't want to put him in the middle, but after 12 years, I am tired of taking her crap. He ends up being in the middle because he won't let me tell her any of this to her face. I either want her to shut up, learn to have a normal conversation without insulting me, or I want to see/talk to her as little as possible. So I said if he won't stick up for me, and doesn't want me sticking up for myself, I will no longer speak to her on the phone or see her if he is not with me, and I will be seeing her a lot less. As of today I actually haven't seen or talked to her since Christmas. He is not thrilled about it, but he thinks it's better than confronting her. AITA for doing this? I am really just concerned about my SO's feeling here, not hers.

UPDATE 4/16: Thank you all for you thoughtful responses and advice.  I really didn't think I was in the wrong here, but my husband's not the only person I know with the ""respect your elders/ignore bad behavior from family"" belief, and since I tend to be the odd one out in a lot of situations, I really wanted to know.  I agree that my husband was being an asshole for defending his mom no matter what she says, and if things continued on that way and nothing changed, he and I would likely have a serious fight to deal with.  

There has been however, some improvement on my husband's part as of this past Sunday.  He asked if we could do something with his mom for Easter.  He said maybe she could just come to our house to see us and the cats.  (Side note: Even though his mom has said we should get rid of our cats and have kids, she also bitches to me about never coming to our house and seeing our cats, as if someone is stopping her.  I always tell her she is welcome to come see then whenever she wants.)  I asked him if she would actually show up, because she hasn't been to our house in a year, and every time he asks her she has an excuse.  (We live 10 minutes apart and she has no medical problems or issues with driving).  

So he tells me she had told him she hasn't been coming over because she thinks I hate her.  I asked why she thinks that, he says because I don't call her anymore.   I asked what he responded with, he said he told her I don't hate her.  I asked if he has ever elaborated and explained why I don't call her, he says no.  I decided not to ask why he won't explain this to her.   Then he says, ""I wish you two would just get along, please just be nice to her"".

So I responded with a series of questions:

1. Have I ever yelled at her?  His answer - no
2. Have I ever said anything rude to her or told her to shut up?  His answer - no
3. Have I ever responded with anything negative other than a few feeble comments in defense of my choices?  (i.e. ""But I love my cats"", ""But I like shopping at EarthFare"", etc.)  His answer - no
4. Do you expect me to continue to sit quietly and smile if she acts this way on Easter?  His answer - No, but don't start a fight.
5. What would you like me to do?  His answer - there needs to be ground rules set for how people talk to each other.
6. Who is making these rules, and who is going to explain them and enforce them?  His answer - I will.  I will talk to her and I will stop her if she harasses you.
7. If for some reason she behaves badly and you don't say anything, I promise I will still not lose it with her.  However, I am going to immediately go upstairs and stay there until she is gone.  Or if we go out to eat instead, I'm going to take your car and leave immediately, and she can drive you home.  Then you will probably be forced to explain why I just got up and left.  Do you agree this is fair because she is your mother, and that I have no other choice if you do not want me to call her out myself, and do you agree it would be completely unfair to get angry with me at this point if I get up and leave?   His answer - yes.

She asked where her portion was, which I told her I could only give her $1500-2000. I told her all that I spent it on besides the loan+weed. I’m sure she will put two and two together regarding the weed even if I didn’t tell her.

My boyfriends mom is the typical helicopter Mom. He is 21 years old but is still treated like he doesn’t have any control over his life. This means she is in control of everything. His appointments, his extracurriculars, and what he does in his free time. He usually doesn’t ever get a say in how he wants to spend his time, and if he misses something his mom wants him to do, she acts mad, disappointed, and holds him at fault. (For example, he drove me to work this morning and she said I should have just walked so he could meet up with her when she wanted.) 

Every time I visit the new house, to set up things the way I want them and clean everything out, she has already been there and done something. She set up the entire kitchen the way she thinks it should be for my boyfriend and I to live there. She started hanging pictures of things that she likes, which is what she thinks my boyfriend likes. I recently threw out some old stinky dog beds that had been inside for awhile, and she put them back in their original spot for her dogs to use when they come there. When she makes these decisions about our new living space, she doesn’t consider me or my boyfriends wishes. She doesn’t speak to me at all beforehand. 

I’ve spoken to my boyfriend about this, how I can’t live there unless I get to choose how things are. How I’m worried that once we move in, his mom won’t let us do anything independently. He says since we are getting to live there at a discounted rate, we should just do whatever they want. How it’s not really my place to get annoyed at his mom or choose what happens to the place because it’s not my property, it’s his family’s. I understand where he’s coming from, but when it comes to my personal living space, I need to be in control of that. I need my freedom. 

So, AITA?

Edit: The Airbnb is in a separate, small building on the property. It’s not within our house. I do think she should get jurisdiction over the Airbnb. The difference is the Airbnb is not my private space, and the house would be.",44,110,0.98
238,Asshole,"It seems as though I have caused quite a bit of drama in my family and I am hoping for some insight from other parents and people in the Midwest or other places who understand this shit.

I grew up in a medium sized midwestern town but moved to Chicago for university and stayed. My brother went to school in another big midwestern city further south, where he met his wife and started a family. 

His daughter is now 7, and is involved in cheerleading and dance, and to be honest, she is very good at it and loves it. While I love my niece and I am happy she is very excited about her activities, the culture around it really rubs me the wrong way.

My brothers family was recently in town for one of my nieces competitions, my wife and I went. While all of the girls were great dancers, the whole things made my wife and I feel pretty gross. At her dance competition, all of the little girls wore very revealing, “sexy” outfits, and many of the moves involved gyrating and twerking. Further, her cheerleading team wears dark eye makeup and bright red lipstick at events, and the outfits are about the same as what high school cheerleader would wear. Again, my niece is 7.

Later over beers my bro and I were chatting and I told him that while I’m glad my niece is having fun, as a parent there is no fucking way I would let my daughter do it and he should find a different studio or something. My brother got defensive of his parenting being questioned and things got heated. I felt he wasn’t quite getting it and at some point I said the team makes his daughter look like a hooker and the way they dance and dress the kids is completely inappropriate. I also called the whole thing a bunch of honey boo boo bullshit for bored stay-at-home moms (his wife is a SAHM). Needless to say, we haven’t spoken since.

Now, my whole extended family has heard about this and while I believe some secretly agree with my views a few are saying I’m TA for wanting to ruin my nieces fun, and that it’s “ok for little girls to dress up and feel pretty”. I think my brother is TA for allowing his wife to sexualize his first-grader and not protecting her.

So, Reddit, what do you think? Anyone else have kids in dance? Am I way off-base with this? I also want women’s opinions. If I’m TA I’ll accept my judgement and apologize to my bro.",51,49,0.95

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her Molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. Earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. I've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting Molly. Molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. She said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200B;

I still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200B;

I've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. Every single time I bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. They're not, but she's not a good fit for him. So at this point I'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  Our relationship isn't that solid but I think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr: My girlfriend and I adopted a cat and she makes him miserable. She thinks it'd be cruel to rehome him, so I'm seriously considering breaking up with her and taking him with me. WIBTA?",1387,15807,0.94
242,Asshole,"Hear me out, I know it sounds bad. So I have a friend who I told about a lot of my struggles with my sexual orientation (I’m bi, but lean towards other women) and the other day she told me that she was pretty sure she was also bi.

It sounded a little unusual to me, so I specifically asked her “so are you romantically or sexually attracted to women?” And she said “no, I just want to be their friend and get to know them better.” I’ve been in so much emotional pain over this label. I’ve had people be cruel to me over it. I can’t tell part of my family about it. So it’s hurtful for me for her to use this label improperly.

We are hosting a Game of Thrones watch party this Sunday for around 15 - 20 people. We sent out the invite over a month ago. I have a friend who RSVPd yes for her and her husband. Today she tells me she can't arrive until 2.5 hours after our party starts (and 30 - 45 minutes AFTER the episode airs)... she is upset that we won't ""wait thirty minutes"" for her and her husband to arrive since they will be coming from a previous engagement.

246,Asshole,"I have been debating throwing this up for days.

My Dad has severe depression which comes with anger. So when he initially gave me the ""clean up in two weeks or move out"" I assumed i ought to clean but his harshness was not on purpose or meant. Just stress because they want to sell and they have a shit ton of other things to do. Two weeks is putting it on the market.

Particularly since he apologized on the incident. I gave him a hug and thought everything would be alright. A note, although i have been working and doing chores to a reasonable degree, i have done cleaning bit by bit as he suggested.

Just now he brought up i only had a week left. I commented that included next weekend too even though i had planned on cleaning this weekend and today too. This showed on my expression and he commented i looked disgruntled. 

I, truthfully, commented i am still anxious about the ultimatum he gave. And he flipped out. Commenting how he gave me this statement to clean before, which although yes was not imminent nor to the degree of cleaning expected by my Dad, and he tried being nice. 

Now i'm 26. I have stuff from high school still. His suggestion to clean my room and get rid of old things is not unwarranted. But on a two week time span? When i'm working?

We are social people, and social drinkers. We like having people over and we like to go out with friends and family. Right now however I am pregnant and cannot participate the way I normally would. This has lead to me feeling ""left out"" in a lot of situations. 

Anyways... there is a restaurant right on the beach that neither of us have been to and it is clearly a drinking themed restaurant. We both have wanted to go, but decided to wait until after I have given birth to try it. It is right on the beach we go to, and his mother has been to that beach with us several times. The last time we were there she asked about that particular restaurant and we both explained how we couldn't wait to try it when I was no longer pregnant. It is something I have really been looking forward to.

He was recently hurt in a car accident that has kept him home and out of work. Meanwhile I am the one stuck pregnant and going to work every single day while he gets to be home with friends, and video games, and what ever he wants to do. Yes, I am jealous of this. Yes, I have acknowledged this to myself and him.

Well... here I am, at work, and I get a text that his mother has shown up to our house with a family friend and now they are all at that restaurant.

Me and this guy weren't just acquaintances, we were friends and all of our friends are best friends. We lived together, we partied together, and I helped him at any moment he has needed it(big or small). Not only that but me and his brother are really close too.

So it's odd to me that all of our friends are not just invited but are his best men. I don't even get an invite. In fact, forget the invite, he's never to my face said he's actually getting married and neither has his gf who I thought I was cool with but I think now I know im not.

I can't even hang out with my boys right now because they are all excited for this big thing in my friends life and they talk about all the fun they are going to have etc at his wedding. I just end up leaving because it ends up making my blood boil and everyone is just ignoring the fact that I don't even matter enough for a ""hey I'm getting married, sorry I can't fit everyone in.""

WIBTA for cutting my losses and taking the hint? The only thing is when I cut people off I completely cut them off so I might lose others because of this too but I feel like the disrespect is eating away at me. It hurts that I invest so much into my friends and someone doesn't even have the balls to tell me to my face that I'm not invited(which I was fine with for a while).

All I ever do is try to make sure my team is always on the up and up but it feels like I get taken advantage of way too often and I put up with it. Maybe I'm overreacting and I'm making this about me during a crucial time in his life.

EDIT: The only explanation I have ever gotten was from a friend who is also really close and he mentioned he thinks his fiance doesn't like me that much.



**Update:** So I just called him thanks to everyone who said I should talk to him. I probably should not have talked to him because I would have been happier where I was at. 

He was driving to work so had a short talk but wow did things just change fast right now. I bluntly asked him what's going on because I wanted clarity into this whole thing and I told him I felt disrespected to not even be told about the wedding. He basically said he knows and he felt sorry about it. I asked why and he said his fiance basically has held some sort of grudge with me ever since the first time she met me back when we were freshmen in college. Mind you this is basically 6 years ago. She apparently didn't like the fact I wasn't ""giving her the time of day"". At that time in our lives my buddies had new girl friends monthly. I rarely ever got to know most of them because none of them ever lasted long. She did last long and eventually(like 6 months after they were together) I made an effort to really get to know her because I realized she was sticking around. I wasn't ever ignoring her ever but our conversations would be super surface level before that. 

According to him she thinks I'm fake or pretend to be friendly to her just because shes with my friend. So she chose to cross me off the invitation list when they were making last edits and he went along with it. He had no reply to why he couldn't just tell me. He said he was about to park and go into work so I had to end our call there. 

I hope he has more to say than that because it sounds like he didn't even stick up for me over something so petty.

257,Not the A-hole,"I was at my best friend’s bachelorette last weekend. And according to her sister/MOH, I’ve ruined everything. I feel like shit about this whole situation, fwiw. Bride = B, groom’s sister = GS

Background: I was born in and am a citizen of a controversial country and where I live now. Said country has issues and the current government is shit. But there is also a lot of misinformation out there. I’m not here for a debate, so please don’t. I went back to do my required military service but was never in a position near combat. B and I have been friends since we were kids. 

She was cold most of the weekend but I figured it was because we had never met. The last night we were all fairly drunk and in a cab. A girl asked how you say something in my native language, and I did. GS rolled her eyes. I asked her “what?” She answers that it sounds a lot like her guy’s language, but “your people steal everything from them”. I say that’s because they’re the same language family. She rolls her eyes. 

We get back and start setting up a game of scrabble. She pulls the MOH into a side room and yells at her about inviting me.

We start the game. Rude comments the whole time. Finally, she makes a “joke” that’s just super offensive for historical reasons and I say “You know that’s not ok, right?” She gets really mad with me and I explain the history.

She answers that maybe we should stop doing bad things and we won’t be accused of stuff. I say that if a country does awful shit that doesn’t mean you get to bring back 500 year old genocidal propaganda. I add that I don’t want to talk politics.

GS says we are the new (group that committed genocide against us). GS also implies that everyone from Country deserves it happening again. I get mad and say that that is not ok, and she should be ashamed. And that there are ways to criticize Country without being a racist, and calling for genocide makes her more of a (genocidal group) than I’ll ever be. She says she can’t be racist because I’m white (I’m mixed), and that I probably committed war crimes. I say I was nowhere near anything like a combat role. She says was “supporting the genocide” and that we need to get out of (other group who also lives there)’s land. I tell her my father’s family had been there for centuries, and she gets pissed, calling me a liar. Then she starts angry crying. 

 Apparently she cried all night and Bride and MIH had to comfort her. I’m a bad person for sleeping through it. I’m also a bad person for refusing to apologize, because making her cry and calling her racist was too far, as was “talking politics”. They’ve also said everyone knows how she is and I should’ve known better than to engage.

259,Asshole,"A bit of context: I was on a field trip from a place that was about 85 degrees Fahrenheit at 10:00 AM in the morning. For some reason, the bus driver had come dressed up for snowy weather, and I happened to be on her bus. She had the A/C turned to full max and there was no way to turn it off for me like you can on some airplanes. I put my jacket on and I was still extremely cold. 

The bus ride was 10 hours long with some stops along the way, and everyone was annoyed that it was cold. Nobody could sleep without like getting frostbite. I couldn’t take it anyone. 

So I got my friends and we all shouted at the bus driver, “Can you turn the fucking A/C off! We’re fucking dying back here!” or something to that extent. The bus driver pulled over, turned off the A/C, and for some reason decided that the right time to take off her ski jacket was then. I kind of feel bad, but like, I couldn’t take it.

So, AITA?

Edit 1: I guess I’m an asshole. Rip me.

Edit 2: I should probably mention that one of our chaperones has already asked the driver to turn the A/C off an hour earlier, but that doesn’t excuse my actions. On the way back, I will apologize to the driver.

Edit 3: Okay, to clarify, we asked the driver nicely first. She didn’t do anything for an hour.

Last edit: (not going to edit this post anymore) it feels like the exact situation is very important and I didn’t give enough details in the original story. We were on a charter bus and the 85 degree weather slowly dwindled into the high 50s by the time we were complaining.

261,Not the A-hole,"I booked a blowout for my bachelorette party. My normal stylist was booked so I gave a local salon a chance. It’s custom to curl hair away from the face — just a modern (not old school) method that was present in the inspirational pic I showed the stylist. 

I was faced away from the mirror the whole time so I didn’t see that she was alternating curl directions. This makes the hair look less sleek and more old school. Plus, you can’t just take your fingers and start twisting hair away from your face to reignite the curl like with every other blow out I’d had before. 

When I was turned around and faced the mirror at the end, my hair looked so bad. I used my fingers to try to hide random unsightly locks of hair behind curls. I spent a good 3-5 minutes doing this but had to eventually fix the rest in the car because someone was waiting for my stylist. I paid, tipped 25% (probably my mistake but I’m not horrible person) and then left. 

When I got home, I realized the back of my head looked like straight up bed head. Very tangled and messy. The stylist never gave me a mirror to see the back of my head. I brushed out her work and recurled my own hair the first chance I had. 

The next day (Sunday) I emailed the salon about my dissatisfaction and never heard back. I even sent pictures of me and my hair so they’d know what I was talking about. On Wednesday, I left a two star google review. The response stated I never attempted to contact them to resolve the issue and they even posted the pictures I emailed them —  of my face. I’ve called and emailed them asking to take down the images but this salon is treating me like I’m the asshole. 

I know leaving negative reviews is frowned upon, but I wanted the next customer to 1. Face the mirror during services rendered so they can monitor what’s happening in real time and fix issues before it’s too late and 2. Ask to see the back of their head before leaving the salon.

This all started when she noticed me streaming Dexter on Netflix. She apparently was curious and googled it's content and immediately told me to stop watching it. I complied thinking it was just the show that bothered her as she didn't want to give me specifics as to why it bothered her. Roughly a year later we got married and I just thought that to marry me she had to have some level of trust with me that she didn't have with anyone else. Soon after I started watching Lucifer on Hulu. Que her finding out and freaking out about it and other shows I liked watching.

This morning was just too emotional for me since I was just watching the Walking Dead. I asked her if she had any level of trust for me to just skip scenes with nudity. She said no, I asked why she wouldn't trust me not to watch those scenes. She admitted to me that she had very little trust for me, and it would be a while before she trusted me at all. Hearing that hurt me a lot considering we have been married for over a year and a half.

Emotionally I feel crushed and empty inside. It feels like I've gained no ground in our marriage. Like after all this time together she still expects me to betray any trust she might have towards me. It's a little soul crushing to type all of this out.

Edit 1: Finished post I accidentally submitted early.

Edit 2: I've certainly received a lot of food for thought from this post, the majority of which suggests I get marriage counseling which I'd have to agree with as I'm still interested in working through this, out of our whole relationship this is the only major argument I've had with her, other than that she genuinely cares for me, and yes I do try to make her feel loved as often as I can. From cheesy flower gifts at random days to the occasional backrubs (she's a server so i know her back is hell). I do appreciate all the advice I'm receiving, and a divorce does seem a little drastic considering I just want to know what happens at the end of some of those tv shows I've mentioned.",147,158,0.92
264,Not the A-hole,"I was playing uno with some friends. It's all good fun but we don't hesitate in screwing each other over to the point where some feelings get hurt, but this just makes it more competitive.

We were playing, and as always, when cards are in my hand I keep them in a single stack instead of fanning them out so other players aren't sure how many cards I have. I fan them briefly when picking out cards and on my turn, but otherwise keep them stacked. 

The game was getting heated and the rest of the players seemed focused on screwing another guy over who had uno, so it went largely unnoticed that I only had two cards left. I played my second card, said uno and stunned the group. They had wasted all their good cards trying to screw the other guy over, so play went on, and my last card was a wildcard, so when it got to me I won.

My friends were at first dumbfounded, and then accused me of cheating by obfuscating my cards. I googled the rules and cited that you're only required to reveal the number of cards you have when you have uno, which I did. And they watched me draw and play cards, so if they were paying attention they would be able to figure out how many cards I had. 

They said that it may not be against the rules, but it violates the spirit of the game and was a dick move. I disagree - this is how I've always played and it's just good strategy. Maybe some people like to preemptively screw other players if they see their hand getting smaller, but I just play to empty my hand up until the point someone calls uno, at which point the skips, reverses and draw 2/4 comes out. So to me, however many cards is in a person's hand isn't all that relevant to me until uno.

265,Everyone Sucks,"So we have been fighting a lot lately about him being insensitive and me being perhaps overly sensitive. Last night, I went to a concert at 8:30 with a friend of his who he knows I don’t find very interesting to be around. Not a bad guy, but not someone I would sign up for 45 minutes alone with. 

BF was supposed to arrive around 8:30. I drove half an hour each way and forewent other social plans for the concert. He was at an important grad school dinner. At 8:45, I text him asking where he is. No response, so I start calling. And he’s clicking the automated response options like “Sorry, I can’t pick up the phone right now.” I’m livid at this point, because if he hasn’t even left at 8:50, he’s going to be very late. 

He arrived around 9:20. I meet him outside so the friend won’t see us fighting. While he says the words “I’m sorry,” he’s also making a number of excuses why when he was already running 25 minutes late, he couldn’t step out to talk to me. But as for why when he knew he’d be late in the first place, he has no reason except “I lost track of the time.” 

I ended up just leaving because I wouldn’t have fun due to my anger. Now I can’t figure out who is the asshole here. I feel heartbroken because I’m considering ending things due to a long pattern of behavior like this. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDITED: I'm not thinking of breaking up with him over this alone. I'm thinking of doing it because something like this happens about once a month, combined with a lot of other fairly thoughtless behavior and a repeated inability to apologize for mistakes.",57,51,0.89
266,Asshole,"So, last week was one of my best friends' birthday and while deiciding what we should do to celebrate it at work, I went a bought him a cake on my way to the company. The cake was rather expensive (around US$23, which means 90$ in my currency). At first, I wasn't planning on having everyone join us to celebrate it, just the closest coworkers (our friends), but since we aren't allowed to take breaks longer than 10 minutes and have to go in groups of 3 people, that would have been impossible. So my boss talked to HR and they allowed us to celebrate it close to clocking off time and then I decided it would be good to invite everyone from our department. We're in 18 people and around 16 of us went. Then after the birthday, a friend of mine told everyone to please pay me back, as everyone had eaten cake. The price was about US$1,55 for each, which converts into 6$ for me. Some have paid me so far and I'm okay with waiting. But then I went and told this coworker, let's call her A.

Me: Hey, A, please don't forget to bring the money from friend's bday cake.

A, frowning: Oh, no one told me about it.

ME, smiling: it's no problem, I'm just letting you know.

She then confirms the amount and walks away. Not half an hour later she gives me the money, and I thought that would be the end of it.

&#x200B;

During break time, one of my other best friends comes and tell me she went to him, asking how much I paid for the cake. He said he had no idea and then she goes ""6$ to each, that's a lot of money"", insinuating I was probably telling them more that they needed to pay so I could cash in. She then proceeded to complain that she didn't now she would have to pay, because I told no one in advance and that I shouldn't have done that.

For now, I've decided I'm not gonna do this type of celebration anymore. But am I the asshole for ~~wanting~~ (someone made me realize the wording is ""agreeing"") to be paid back after buying cake without telling everyone in advance?

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Some of the comments are telling me I'm DEMANDING to be paid back. I'm not. That was in fact the first I had the chance to speak to the girl in question. Like I wrote above a friend of mine, after the party and also my boss asked me how much I paid for the cake and that we should all split. I said okay and when my friend told the remaining people, they agreed. This girl wasn't there and then I had to tell her separately. I also, as advised, went and separately visited each of my coworkers who had paid in their desks and apologized for not telling beforehand and said I would give them the money back, but they told me it was only fair because the ones who didn't want to contribute didn't celebrate with us. No one had a problem with it in the beginning, but since this girl had, I was wondering if I in fact, had done a dick move. Sadly, I did. I'm gonna return her money.

&#x200B;

I not gonna do this kind of celebration again. And thank you all for your input, I do really appreciate it (:

&#x200B;

**I guess final Edit: Thank you so much for everyone and your input (:**

This situation got me really on a twist and now I see it was very shitty of me to accept being helped out. No matter how nicely I tried to word it, the girl got very mad. I'm seeing as to how addressing it with her and paying her money back. If everyone is fine with it, but one isn't, then I guess it's safer to not do it anymore like this and resort to my original plan of just eating the cake in a closed off group of friends and bearing the cost. And just to clarify (I don't know if people are thinking it), my friend was NOT included in the help out. Again thank you everyone!

&#x200B;

**FINAL DECISION:** Will be apologizing once again to everyone who paid, returning their money either way, telling those who didn't pay yet that there is no need to and then never buy anything without talking about it first.",139,158,0.86

268,Not the A-hole,"I posted the full back-story a couple of weeks ago on a different subreddit ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b7didc/my\_28m\_exgirlfriend\_27fs\_sister\_22f\_is\_still/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/b7didc/my_28m_exgirlfriend_27fs_sister_22f_is_still/)) but I'll précis it here for you:

I'd (28M) been with Sarah (27F) (not her real name) since we were teenagers, and we were living in different cities, trying to save up enough for a house together. Her sister Katie (22F) (again, not her real name) applied to university in my city, and after a year in halls moved in with me for economy's sake. We'd known each other forever, it was fine, solved problems all round.

Just over a year and a half ago, Sarah told me she had been cheating on me in a massive way. She had been in a relationship with another guy for about three months, and had been living in his house, only coming back to the flat at weekends when I was coming down to visit. She decided that she wanted to live with him openly and was tired of lying to me. She admitted that most weekends she would find time to go back and have sex with him if there was an opportunity to once I had fallen asleep. It was a horrible shock and I felt completely numb for weeks.

After 18 months, Katie was still living with me (non-romantically). I wasn't sure what to do about this, and when I posted on r/relationships, I was just coming round to the realisation that I liked having her around and didn't want her to leave. Since I posted, we've spent more time together socially, and on Monday I asked if she'd like to go for dinner as a kind of date. We had a really nice time, we kissed once, but we didn't go further. We both realise this is a complex situation and want to take things slowly. I can't help feeling that I'm irretrievably an asshole, though. Am I?

EDIT: Thank you all for your comments, whether you assholed me or not (is that the correct verb?). We have had a long talk, first just between us and then with her dad and aunt (her mum died six years ago). They have been very supportive since Sarah and I broke up, and we wanted to involve them before going any further. We are going to take things very slowly, and her dad is going to pay half-rent (he offered to pay to help her move out as some people had suggested, but for financial reasons that would be difficult for him and impossible for her to manage financially). We haven't decided about telling Sarah - I haven't spoken to her since it happened, and Katie has only spoken to her in occasional messages. We have talked about everything that has been raised on here at some length - it is a difficult situation and there is a power dynamic that we have done what we can to mitigate.

Ultimately, we do have feelings for each other and have for some time - I would absolutely never have dated her for revenge or for any other reason, and I would never do anything to hurt or upset her. I understand if you still think I'm the/an asshole, but I'm trying my best?",153,560,0.94
269,Not the A-hole,"Aunt(Kim) is getting married & everyone is saying I need to apologize & attend her bachelorette(she didn’t invite me, MOH did) 
Story starts 2yrs ago. Place I worked had a holiday special for 40% off all merchandise. My fam all gave me a list & said they’d pay me back when they see me. NP. Kim was the last to send her list & she sent it on the last day. I told her I’d try my best to get her everything but there’s people before her. She said to get her stuff 1st. I replied 1st come 1st serve. She told me to skip my lunch break & get her stuff. If anyone has worked in retail during holidays, u kno how exhausting it is & all u want to do is sit down. None the less, I was able to get everything for everyone. They were fine getting their items when we had our Christmas party but Kim kept pestering about when I was coming over (I didn’t drive at this time. She did.) She’s notorious for shorting people of lose change & my older sister warned me she’d do the same. I just thought well If she does, I’ll let her know it’s rude, & a normal person would realize that & apologize. Find out we’ll both be going to my lil sisters game & Kim keeps texting me to bring her items. I give her the total ($111.74). Give her, her stuff & she says she FORGOT to bring money, she’ll owe me, remind her when I come over for Christmas. Dude really? U reminded me everyday & u FORGOT? & I have to remind u when to pay me back for a FAVOR I did for u? Forward to Christmas she says she doesn’t have cash rn. I had to remind her for weeks until she saw my older sister & gave her just $111. At this point I was irritated but texted her in a joking way & said “hey dude, ur total was $111.74 lol” she says“And? Do u want the 74 cents or something? Lol” “Idc about the 74 cents. But its the principle of the matter. It’s rude. Plain & simple.” She said “We’re family. I didn’t think you’d care about money like that lmao” we went back & forth & the whole time she was being condescending, saying “do u want ur 74 cents or something? U need 74 cents?” I got mad & said “Don’t ever talk to me again. Bye” she replied “ok, that hurt” & we haven’t spoke since. Few weeks later my cousins get me in a room & tell me she told them what happened & I need to apologize or I’m no longer invited to family vacays. I said if she wants to tell me something, tell me. Don’t get other people to do it for her. So AITA? What should I do? I’m seriously tired of the high & mighty attitude she has towards the younger kids. The lesson wouldn’t be learned if I talked to her again. Do I think 74 cents is worth cutting her off? Of course not. But I refuse to be stepped all over & brainwashed like my cousins. I think she owes me an apology.",109,255,0.94

273,Asshole,"Lots of background here so I'll try to keep it simple. In late February I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and went for inpatient treatment for 3 weeks. Upon discharge I decided I'd move in with my parents in order to get my feed back under me (I'm 27). My mom was very happy to have me in the house. My dad was skeptical because he not so openly thinks I'm just ""lazy"" and I have 3 younger siblings who still live at home who I don't get along with at all.

One of my coping mechanisms I've learned is to accept the fact that I'm a nocturnal person so I don't even try to stay up during the day. The other thing I like to do is take a really, really long shower (30 minutes-1 hour) before I go to bed as it helps me with insomnia. My therapist said this is a great strategy and likes that I'm thinking creatively to solve my problems. 

So in my parents house I stay up all night and write (I'm a professional writer as my occupation) and I take a shower somewhere between 5 and 7. Well this has caused a melt down with my dad and siblings because they claim that I don't leave them any hot water. I know this is bull crap because there's still hot water when I get out of the shower. 

But even if I did use all the hot water, there's other things that can be done so we can all live here in peace. My siblings can shower in the gym at school and my dad can maybe look into getting a tankless heater for the house. I mean, the way I feel is this is just finger pointing at me when they know I've had medicallly diagnosed issues and a prescribed method of treatment to help me cope. If I were to have a septic wound that needed to be washed every morning, no one woukd be screaming at me with choice words like ""lazy fat pig."" I'm just taking a shower for the love of God.

&#x200B;

Well he started commenting actively for the past month. He’s a heavy user of /r/The_Donald, gets into arguments about how unfair affirmative action is and how white people are the most persecuted group in America, and once joked how a group of black people who did a good deed on /r/wholesomeBPT probably didn’t know their fathers. He also had a few sparse posts in /r/subforwhitepeopleonly.

I don’t like the kind of views my son is expressing. I believe he is getting most of his bigoted views from the internet. So I got my brother to put parental controls on his tablet, phone, and computer. He can only access very select sites and basically ask permission for a website to be unblocked.

Edit: For some reason, people are thinking I've never said a word to him about this views he's expressing. I have. He just thinks it's a difference in political views and don't think it's a big deal. He compares it to commenting on /r/SandersForPresident. I told him thinking difference politically is one thing, but he's young and impressionable, and the content he's viewing is how neo-nazis are born. He just chalks it up to a difference in opinion and it goes no where.

So well. He has erection issues and they are aggravated with the use of condoms, so we ended up having unprotected sex. I’m not dodging responsibility here, it’s also my fault for not strictly demanding condoms until he got tested, but here I am with a fucking STI.

&#x200B;

This has been bugging me for a few days and I just can't make up my mind whether to say something or not, hence this question on this particular sub.

&#x200B;

I live with two roommates; a guy and a girl. Yesterday I noticed that a whole roll of toiletpaper was just gone. I thought it was weird because I could have sworn there was at least 80% of one left before I went to bed the morning before. I chalked it up to a memory being a day off or just deja vu or something.

While doing groceries I get a text from my female roommate asking to pick up more toiletpaper because apparently we were all out. I said sure and picked up some but it kept bugging me. I'd just bought a pack of 20 rolls of 3-ply like 10 days before, there's no way we could go through that much right?

Before bed last night, I remember there being about 90% of a new roll left next to the toilet. I had bought the new rolls so I knew how many there were in the flat as well. My roommate came home around midnight and left around 10 this morning, so I didn't see or speak to her. When I left my room around 11, I noticed that the new roll was gone and there was an empty roll in the bin.

&#x200B;

Would I be the asshole if I asked her about what she's doing with the toiletpaper? I'm hesitating because I just think it's a pretty indelicate thing to ask. I know I wouldn't want to be asked about my bathroom habits. I'm not her mom, and she does contribute fairly in the buying of the rolls. But just, how even?  She was only home for about 10-ish hours, most of which she was sleeping. So she demolished a roll in 3-4 hours max?

&#x200B;

Update (although a bit anticlimactic):

Roommate came home a little earlier than usual today. I tried to be as subtle as possible to not put her on the spot about anything (in case it was something serious). Just kind of an off-hand comment about noticing the amount of TP we were going through. She basically just blamed it on her period and said she \*might\* have been using more than usual. I did tell her to be mindful of how much she was flushing because we've have plumbing problems before. She agreed and that was that (I hope she really does agree, and isn't just doing the nod&smile routine).

283,Not the A-hole,"**Better Title: WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop acting entitled to my belongings?**

&#x200B;

Throwaway as I'm not going to risk a confrontation IRL. Sorry in advance for poor writing, let's cut to the chase -

I'm 23F, and have a great job. Though my office is not very stylish, I enjoy expressing myself through fashion, as it's my hobby. TLDR, I care A LOT about my clothes, and have emotional ties to every article in my closet.

My Coworker is CW (37F). We started at the same time and have bonded by getting dinner together, etc.

CW has always complimented my sense of style, and NGL, feels good to get praise for it. This last month, I'd gotten rid of a few articles of clothing and had offered them to CW - she liked them.

Two weeks ago, I remember going back to my desk one day to see CW waiting for me, while also wearing my jacket. Needless to say, I was annoyed that she touched it without asking, and asked for it back. CW got upset and was offended. When I'd told her about it later, she claimed that I'm too Western and that in her culture, she is treating me like a sister. I'm not really into myself or my possessions being touched, and when I had let her know my boundaries, CW had doubled down on how I'm ""Western"".

Today's conversation echoed similar sentiment.

>**(Not verbatim):CW** : ""OP, you have great style, I love your dress with docs!""**Me**: ""Thanks CW!""**CW**: ""I notice that you only wear docs.""**Me**: ""Yeah, I collect them, they make me really happy!""**CW**: ""What size shoe are you? I'm sure we're the same size, I'd love to have one of your pairs!""**Me**: ""I'm not planning on getting rid of any of my docs soon, I collect them! I can look out for you on depop.""**CW**: ""Oh, I meant those ones. Aren't docs hard to break in? I feel like it would be less work to just take the ones that you don't wear off your hands.""**Me**: ""I'm not planning to get rid of any of them, and if I were, I would want to get money out of it, since I've put money into them.""**CW**: ""Oh, not what I meant! I would only want a pair of docs if they were given to me as a gift, as they're pricey. Those boots specifically, I can see myself wearing them at some point. You're so western sometimes!""

The conversation hit a lull, and I went back to my office and began to think that I am just blowing this out of proportion due to our cultural differences on how we define boundaries. This is why I find this hard - CW and I aren't from the same culture, so maybe she feels like I'm being too Western if I don't understand her. FWIW, I enjoy her presence aside from this, I don't feel respected whenever she does this, but am fearful of ruining our friendship by making her feel like I don't understand her.

However, though she is my friend - I'm starting to feel like a sentient mannequin.

So Reddit, WIBTA if I told my friend/Coworker to firmly respect my boundaries and not to feel entitled to my clothes or handle my things without my permission? Am I just being sensitive?

&#x200B;

**EDIT 1:** Hi everyone, thank you for commenting! I will try to reply to as many comments as I can. I realize now that I suck at writing titles, as it should be more like ""WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop acting entitled to my belongings?"" rather than the current title.

I'm getting a lot of comments and messages about the cultures of CW and I - CW is Latina, and I'm Biracial, but pass as Southeast Asian - most notably, I'm first generation and have been born and raised in the US. Reading the comments, I've had the further realization that she uses the term ""Westernized"" as a way to ""other"" me. For context, my office is dominantly Caucasian and male, so I think when she uses the term towards me, it's her way of maybe saying that I'm like everyone else, and am whitewashed due to the environment I have grown up in. I can't really think of any other explanation, especially as I am mostly SouthEAST Asian and she's from South America, which is objectively more West :P 

For what it's worth, I don't really have much of an issue of her wanting to have similar clothes to me, moreso the fact that she seemingly wants my EXACT clothes. For instance, a little after I had gotten a bomber jacket, she had also purchased one. I didn't think it was weird, and actually really liked the one she had picked up! Besides the past month or so, I considered her to be a relatively close friend, this is really just super annoying, as I would like for us to continue being friends.",99,452,0.95

285,Not the A-hole,"So I have a wonderful 10 year old daughter who uses my Instagram account to look at slime videos. she's  also addicted to the Slime YouTubers and loves buying cheap slime. 

Recently she came up and asked if she can make a slime account, I said no and she got mad and cried for 10 minutes. 

I I sat her down and explained why she could not have a slime account. and she still did not listen. she then told my sister who is now on my daughter's side and is trying to explain that making a slime account won't be bad. 

My issue is I don't want to be spending money just for Instagram, I don't want to be buying glue every single week, or already made slime every single week. and because of her age I know that I'll be doing most of the work. 

I love making slime with her on occasion but doing it more often is just not something I want to do, and because we would have to use my work phone I don't want to have slime videos on there. 

she has managed to get most of the family to think it's a awesome idea and I really dont want do it?

286,Not enough info,"Backstory- So my roomate and best friend of over 10 years came out as gay a few years back (shocking absolutely no one) and promptly got himself a boyfriend (let's call him Tom). Tom ended up moving in with us a couple months later and everything seemed fine and dandy until about a year into their relationship. At that time, my friend confessed to me that Tom had cheated on him early in their relationship and that even though they had talked about it and ""resolved it"", it had been eating at him ever since. 

He ended up breaking up with Tom, and moved out with me and another friend. During the entirety of the following year, he became obsessed with Tom. Constantly IG, FB, and SC stalking him and keeping tabs on him. He tried several times to get back together with Tom (feeling he made a mistake) but Tom already had a new boyfriend. It got very ugly for a while, even going so far as trying to seduce Tom's current bf and ruin their relationship. 

The entire time this is happening, me and my other roomate are trying desperately to help him work through this. Would would go out clubbing with him (not something I'm fond of) and I ended up picking him up from several dudes houses in the wee hours of the morning. Eventually, he ended up getting counseling and anti-anxiety meds after he started having panic attacks related to Tom. 

After about a year of this, he finally seemed to return to normal and thanked us for being there for him and helping him get over Tom. A few days later, Tom ends up breaking up with his boyfriend. My friend immediately goes crawling back to Tom and begs him to take him back (which he did). I became both heartbroken and livid at that point. After all that time and effort, it was all for nothing. It just felt like a slap in the face. after tempers flared over my friend constantly bringing Tom to our house, they ended up moving out together.

Fast forward a little over a year-

So now they live together. I still see my best friend fairly often and we are on good terms, but I refuse to hang out with Tom. Yesterday they got engaged. I am now torn. I'm certain my friend will expect me to be a part of his wedding, but I just don't feel right about supporting a marriage I feel is completely toxic. On the other hand, I dont want to abandon my best friend on arguably the most important day of his life. WIBTA if I refused to be a part of his wedding, opting to simply attend as a normal guest? Or should I set aside my feelings and tough it out for him. 

Thanks guys, any and all opinions are appreciated!

Edit: to clarify, I don't think Tom is an asshole. He made a mistake and he admitted it and did his best to move on and make things work. I even contacted Tom during my friends stalking phase and asked him to block my friend on all social media in an effort to help my friend move on, and he obliged. I guess I just resent him because of how completely wrecked my friend became over him. 

As for my friend, he's a brother to me and I will always have his back. That said, he definitely let emotions run his life and did not handle it well. It just really hurt to see what this whole situation turned him into.",31,96,0.96

288,Everyone Sucks,"I am a senior in college graduating next month. Last semester, I saw a guy on a dating app who I recognized as a professor at my university. He was a 1st year teacher, so we were relatively close in age, & I had never had a class with him. We started talking, & I said early on I was a student.

Both still interested, we decided to meet to talk about expectations & make sure we were on the same page. Neither of us were interested in anything more than a hook up, & we openly talked about boundaries regarding sex. We were both vibing the other, so we decided to hook up. It was 100 percent consensual on both ends. I also knew as a senior I would never have a class with him, so I wasn't concerned about a future conflict of interest.

We only hooked up the 1 night, & after a month or so & seeing it wasn't likely to happen again, I confided in some close friends about it who I knew would be supportive even though I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.

It somehow got out, however, & 4 months after our rendezvous, I was summoned to the office of a dean who informed me of an anonymous report that I slept with a professor. She told me I hadn't broken any rules & that she brought me in to make sure I was okay & that I wasn't forced into anything (which is great, I'm relieved & also shocked to know my university is taking reports like this seriously because it doesn't have a great history with things like this).

I clarified to her it was entirely consensual, I had weighed all of the pros & cons before deciding, & I was confident a power imbalance didn't exist. I asked if the university knew the professor's name because I didn't want him to get in trouble. She said yes, but that I wouldn't be involved in the investigation. This frustrated me, so I asked if I could write an anonymous statement (the people investigating didn't have access to my name, just his) to try to clarify & control the narrative as much as I could because I firmly believed (& continue to believe) that neither of us broke any rules as two consenting adults.

Some time went on with me hearing nothing after sending my statement. An underclassman asked me about which classes to take next year, & when checking the course offerings with her, I saw the professor is not scheduled to teach any classes even though I know his contract was for 2 years. My friends & I are almost certain this means he has been fired.

I feel so guilty, but my friends & my therapist all tell me I shouldn't. On the one hand, he's a professor at a small liberal arts school (where gossip spreads like wildfire) who knowingly risked his job to sleep with a student his very first year of teaching. On the other, I promised him discretion & betrayed that trust by not being able to keep my big mouth shut.

AITA for getting a man fired & potentially ruining his career for the rest of his life?

**EDIT for clarification:**

Some of you have made the point that this could happen with future students which is something I've been really wrestling with. What does it say about someone willing to do that their first year teaching?

Some are saying I shouldn't have admitted it to the dean. 1) I didn't even consider lying. If I didn't do anything wrong, why lie? Why risk getting in trouble for lying? 2) I didn't tell the dean his name, and I didn't say it in my statement, so I haven't actually attached his name to anything.

If I had to guess, the friends I confided in were drunk and told people. I'm not upset with them because I made the gamble in telling them. Before I told them, I looked online everywhere I could to try to find rules regarding professors and students, and I couldn't. I found nothing in any handbook saying it was against university policy, so when I told them, I didn't think there was a risk of him getting in trouble.",125,144,0.88
289,Everyone Sucks,"My partner and I have been together for 5 years.  We each have sons from previous marriages. His is 6 and mine is 8.  I have primary custody of my son.  His ex has primary custody, but he has a lot of parenting time on school breaks.  My son has severe ADHD and is a difficult to parent.  His son is a typical kid, but he often doesn't follow directions and talks back a lot.  

A couple weeks ago I pulled my son out of his school because they refused to grant him needed services. I enrolled him in a better school for him, but he was out of school for a week during the transition.  This happened to coincide with my SO's son's spring break, which he spends with us.  There were no daycamps available and my SO had little vacation time, so I offered to bring both boys to school for the week.  This is totally acceptable at my job.  I work for a small business, and every employee has kids that they bring in when needed. 

It was a hellish week.  My son was struggling more than usual due to the transition.  His son was really wild and refused to listen when I tried to get him to calm down.  He did stay home with him for 2 days, but I took him to work for 3. I had my son for all 5 days.  I didn't ask him to watch my son on the days he was off because I knew he was struggling with his behavior.  

After the week ended, I was spent.  I told him I'd scheduled a meeting with a support group the following weekend, so he'd have to watch the kids for 2 and a half hours the following weekend.  He refused.  He didn't just refuse, he said I was unreasonable for asking because he had told me he didn't want to be responsible for my son.  That true.  He did say that the previous weekend.  But after he said it, he also watched my son while I went grocery shopping with no complaint. I thought he was telling me that he didn't want to be his child care, not that he wouldn't watch him for a couple hours every now and then. I never would have agreed to be his spring break child care had I known it was a one way street.  I feel very used. 

I told my SO that I'm no longer willing to babysit his son.  He goes into work early, so whenever his son is here, he relies on me to get him to daycare in the morning.  I don't care.  He can figure it out.  AITA?",69,103,0.94
290,Not the A-hole,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years, and have known eachother since we were very very young. Since then, I have introduced him to my cousin who has fallen in love with him (metaphorically).

The two of them are best friends, and me and my cousin also get along very very well. The three of us, along with some other close buddies, are a very tightly knit group of friends.

Now my boyfriend is a notoriously clumsy person. He is a very big guy, and seemingly immune to pain. It is common for him to bash his leg on something and not notice. Once he sliced his foot open on a rock and didn't notice till I pointed out the trail of blood that lead to his chair.

Recently, he and I stayed at my cousins place for a weekend. We drank and partied a bunch, and sure enough my bf fell into a wall and put a huge hole in the drywall, appx 1 ft in diameter. Note that this is the first time my bf has caused relatively major damages to someones house before.

So we put the drunk to bed and my cousin and I cleaned up what we were able. I told my cousin about how it sometimes frustrated me that my bf seemed to have little regard for his clumsiness, and my cousin agreed, commenting that it was probably not great that the people around my bf regarded it as an endearing/funny quality and did little to prevent it. 

I said ""Even though we can fix it, we shouldn't have to fix it."" Which sums up the situation pretty well.

My cousin reassured me he was going to have my bf pay for the damages, and seeing as how my bf was too hungover to deal with it, my cousin and I ended up patching drywall the next morning.

Fast forward about two weeks. I just found out that my bf hadn't paid my cousin yet, and I was pretty angry. My bf said he was planning on paying my cousin back in beer, which my cousin seemed content with. However my cousin could really use the money, as he's just finishing university and can only just pay his rent without groceries. Not to mention that I felt my bf could learn a lesson by paying back my cousin right away instead of using IOU's. That way he'd be hit with the full financial impact of the damages he had caused.

My other concern is that pretty soon my bf and I will be moving in together, and if he smashed holes through other peoples walls, how will he treat our house?

My bf ended up paying my cousin the money which he was owed, but he was pretty upset with me for bitching at him about it.

291,Not the A-hole,"So a few years ago (precisely six) my girl friend passed away tragically in an accident while coming back from her college class. We were together for eight years (all through high school and three years in college). She was my **everything**, I had no doubt in my mind I was marrying her. We took vacations together, we went to restaurants, we visited new cities, everything. We had so many small things that were just ours. After her passing, I was beyond heartbroken. I almost didn't want to live because I genuinely felt like my entire life was swept away from me. I became depressed, lost a lot of weight, and eventually took a break from school. Fortunately, everyone at the time was supportive and helped me get my life back on track.

Fast forward now, my girlfriend (Abby) of two and a half years found a photo of her and I in my wallet (we argued over who would pay the restaurant bill and she took my wallet and went to put my card back in and saw it). The picture had ""I love you so much Michael, I cant wait to spend my life with you. You're my everything <3. Love, Jackie"" Abby knew about Jackie and how close we were and was a support. But today she got really mad. She said ""do you still love her? Have you not been able to move on?!"" She asked if I really cared about her (Abby) ""considering I still had this photo. "" I was really emotional and didn't say anything. Now i'm in my apartment and missing Jackie a lot, and even Abby. I don't want to forget Jackie because she was a major part of my life and made me a better person, but my girlfriend is really important to me. Yes - I still love Jackie and I don't think I will stop... but of course I see myself with Abby and marrying her.

293,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because the GF uses Reddit but not this sub so I don't want her to creep my profile.

Some backstory: I(31) and gf(31) been together about 5 years. We both cook an equal amount of times, we both do chores at equal intervals etc... My point is I'm a functioning adult and so is she.

This all started maybe a year and a half into dating she starts making comments on how I do my laundry or how I wash my dishes and stuff like that. Keep in mind this is MY apartment she moved into and I've been living on my own since I was 17 so for her to tell me I'm doing basic human chores wrong really caught me off guard. I'm thinking my whole life is a lie so I looked on youtube for basic tutorials about how to do chores and stuff like that but everything I'm doing is 100% on point. At this point I'm mega confused. Is she gaslighting me? Am I honestly incapable of doing these things myself?

And now she's attacking how I feed my dog and how I park my car in the parking spot we have reserved. The dog thing really pissed me off. I have a GSD that I've had since I was 23. She was old enough that I had been giving her the meds she needs for her seizures for a while because she has grand mal seizures. Her condition requires that I give her 2 pills a day. I feed my dog her pill right after I wake up and her second pill about 2 hrs before I go to bed. Recently my girlfriend has been FREAKING OUT that I sometimes give her the first pill 1 hour after I wake up instead of immediately.

She sees all of these situations, as in her word ""basic shit"". It's really getting fucking demeaning at this point. The other day she asked me to throw a couple sweaters and stuff in the wash for her and she would dry them later so I did what she asked only to be told that she ""had to re-wash them"" and that's why her night is now ruined. We've had conversations in the past of me asking her WHY she thinks I'm doing things wrong all the time.  I had enough last night. I just freaked out after she berated me for the fifth time today and I asked her ""If I'm always doing everything wrong then why the fuck don't you just do everything?"" and then arguing for an hour and then I finally said ""Why don't you go live on your own if you do everything right. I'll just live here knowing I'm fucking up everything I do"" and left it at that. Her whole family has been texting me including her friends calling me an asshole and stuff like that saying that she's ""only doing it to help"" me. I feel really bad about the whole situation but I know for a fact I'm not a fuck up and I'm not a fucking idiot. I can wash a dish, I can clean clothes, I can cook and clean up after myself but somehow I'm always fucking it up. This is BASIC STUFF. I am 31 fucking years old so I think I got this down by now and even did research to see if I was wrong and I'm not.

TL;DR gf says i dum dum but i not dum dum and i kick her out. her friends say i bad guy. am i bad guy?

When I lit up my cigarette, I was downwind from anyone nearby and perched on a wall by the statue. Halfway through, a young mother comes by and let's her two kids play on the statue in the middle of the smoking area. I stayed put- downwind- as it was my designated spot. Also, my feet were killing me and there was no where else to sit.

299,No A-holes here,"So, here's the deal. I've been sculpting for about 11 years now. I'm no Michaelangelo, but I'd say I'm good.

I was showing my classmate some of my old sculptures, and she asked me if she could commission me for one. She showed me what she wanted me to make (a rendition of one of her drawings of a character she drew), and we agreed on it.

I've been thinking about what I want the price to be. The material is really cheap, about $2 a pack, and it took 3 to get what I have in total (I like using it because it never hardens, so I can use it over and over again), the time it would take to make it (considering the detail of the drawing, I'm thinking about 1.5 hours, and because minimum wage in Ontario is 14.00, I'm estimating the price regarding that to be $21, give or take depending on the actual time), and I'm planning on buying nail polish remover in order to keep it firm (with tax, it's $2.85). In total, roughly $29.85.

Another thing I'd considered was a ""friend discount."" I'm feeling against doing it, though, as she has a decent friend circle with a few I know pretty well, too. I'm worried that if word gets out that I gave her a discount, her friends would ask me for one if they request a commission, as well.

So, I'm wondering, would I be the asshole if I don't give her a discount?

312,Not the A-hole,"I am the head chef at a reasonably nice restaurant, and we are in the process of looking for some new people to work in our kitchen. Yesterday, on my day off, I made a brief drive to the restaurant to meet and interview an applicant. On my way to the restaurant, I stopped at a red light. Even though there were no cars in the intersection and I could easily and safely made a right turn, I didn’t because there is a large, “no right turn on red,” sign by the road. There’s a camera on this light, and I’ve seen many people in the Facebook group for my community complaining about getting tickets after they’ve turned right on red at this light, so I followed the order as always.

A car pulled up behind me and honked, which really annoyed me. I turned around and got a look at the driver, but avoided letting any road rage or frustration get the better of me. The light turned green, I drove to my restaurant, and met the guy I had come to interview. And guess who my interviewee was? The guy who had just honked at me.

Very first thing, I questioned him just what he thought he was doing back at the light. His face went pale, and he started apologizing profusely (but insisting there was no traffic and I could have gone), and I responded by pointing out the sign to him, which he claimed not to have noticed. I explain to him how first impressions are everything, and when my first encounter with a prospective employee has them not taking the time to read and follow basic commands and behaving like an angry hothead, it reflects very, very badly upon them. I made it clear how our kitchen has hot and sharp objects and a strict code of conduct to ensure safety and cleanliness and how I just don’t trust someone so temperamental and negligent in such an environment.

The guy begged me for another chance, asked to reconsider, and floated around his other impressive credentials but my answer was a repetitive no.

Now, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

I was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

As a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): ""Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

I regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

My mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.

I come from a big family #1, #2, myself,#4,#5,#6. All boys. 1, 2, myself, #4 & #5 are married. 1 has 2 kids, 2 has 1, I have none, 4 has 2 one on the way 5 just married in Jan (no kids) and 6 is in high school (hopefully no kids) Wife and I are the only non LDS couple (this matters) 

We've been married 4 yrs tried for a baby for 3. After numerous doctors etc we've accepted our roles as aunt/uncle and are moslty okay with it (my wife will tear up over certain things Monica/Chandler adoption for ex)

5 is newlywed fairly young (5 is 24 w is 19) she wants to finish school and theres NO PRESSURE from this side of the family. The church doesnt condone BC and not knowing how to come out about putting off babies these 2 decide to lie to her folks and tell them its a rule/tradition that we go in order for births meaning we are holding them up.

We found out when her fam found & began spamming my wifes business page with comments like ""That looks fun but playing outdoors does not a family make!"" ""Waiting on y'all! Lets get some grandbabies going!"" And the cherry on the cake was on a pic of my wife covered in mud with 4w in the back, a beer and the words ""Work hard PLAY harder"" comment: ""If you worked hard and PRAYED harder youd be holding a baby instead of a beer🤷"" My wife deleted/disabled comments blocked them went riding has been unusually quiet since. 

We had a family supper (monthly tradition) I tried calmly talking to my bro and his wife he told me to mind my own I pointed out that not only did he know about our struggle but that this was now on my wifes BUSINESS page he said it wasn't his fault my wife is defective and that maybe his wife's fam had a point about returning to church she tried to joke it off & I snapped & said ""lying is a sin I wont be partaking in it either you tell or I will youve no idea what we've been through or how this has affected us.""

317,Everyone Sucks,"I’ve always wanted to be a mother And although I accept that there is more to motherhood than pregnancy and breastfeeding, these are the things that come to mind when I imagine it. Please understand, I am not against adoption. I think it is a beautiful way of building a family, and would definitely consider it after I have birthed a couple of biological kids.

I married my soulmate at 25 and had my IUD removed a month before the wedding. We both wanted kids and I assumed I would get pregnant on our honeymoon (spoiler alert-we didn’t!).

After two years of trying, we got a diagnosis: Husband's sperm count was so low that we would never conceive naturally. Our options were IVF (we couldn't afford) or donor sperm (husband said no). We started investigating adoption and were informed that we are unlikely to get a child under five or a kid without a disability.

  
Yesterday, I asked him to reconsider donor sperm. It would be easier than adoption and he would get to experience pregnancy and birth with me. He called me selfish, narrow-minded, unempathetic and emasculating. He said it was important to him that we in this journey together.  


I don't think we should adopt when I'm on the fence about it. What say we were given a child and I couldn't love them? I may be the asshole for feeling this way, but much more so if we actually adopted. Husband thinks I'm the asshole, as does our adoption counsellor. My friends think he's being a dick about it.

318,Not the A-hole,"I’m not the one organising the party (the bridesmaids are in charge), but I am the one who booked it - we’re renting a house for a weekend for 10 of us, so I put it on my credit card and everyone said they would send their share (so 8 people owing me money in total - I’m the 9th, and the bride’s cost is being split between us).

As you can imagine, it’s a fairly large cost in total. Only two people have paid me so far. One has dropped out after we booked, so if we can’t replace her it will be more expensive for all of us (and I’m already stretching my budget, which everyone knows). 

There is free cancellation on the place until a month before, I’ve set a payment deadline of 3 weeks before that deadline for everyone to get the money to me. If it doesn’t come in, to keep the booking I’ll have to cover the remainder myself or pay interest on my credit card - neither of which I can afford to do.

319,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of background, I graduated college in January and am supposed to walk in the graduation ceremony in May. I originally did not want to walk because I kind of find it pointless, but because my parents really wanted me to, I promised them I would walk. 

Now, I’ve gone through the process of ordering my cap and gown and my parents have already booked an Airbnb. So things are kind of already ready to go and all set up for when May rolls around. 

Today I received an e-mail from my schools president saying that our commencement speaker is going to be Mike Pence. The college is a conservative Christian college, by the way. Also there is already a petition going around the school to revoke the invitation and find someone else as I guess many people don’t want him associated with their alma-mater/current school. 

As a gay male, I immediately was frustrated as most of you can assume why. I contacted my parents and told them that I no longer want to walk because of this. They are telling me that it’s an honor to have someone of his caliber and fame speak for our very small tiny school. Which I can understand. But at the same time, not only for me but for the rest of the school, I don’t think our school should choose a political figure to speak on behalf of our school as a whole, no matter what the persons views are. I feel like that’s immediately choosing a political side for our school.

About a month ago, I had a pilonidal cyst surgery (a painful cyst above your asscrack that gets worse without surgery). I live in Canada, so it took about 5 months to get the surgery date, but I wasn't aware of the date until exactly two weeks prior as the doctors office had mailed to the wrong address. I let the store manager and assistant store manager know I would be having surgery in two weeks, and I would need at least two weeks off for recovery. Long story short, they fired me, I ran out of savings and I've been sleeping on campus and showering at the gym since (the men's shelter here is absolutely terrifying, slept there one night and promised myself I would never go back).

He waved and came over and I could clearly see he was shocked/uncomfortable to see me but felt compelled to talk to me anyways. He asked me if I was still in school and then left. Internally, I could feel rage building up. Moments later, he came back and put a $20 bill on my tray. At this point my hands are shaking and in the cringiest way possible I threw the $20 back towards him. People at my table are now watching. I start losing my shit repeatedly yelling at him ""FUCK YOU, KEEP YOUR MONEY"". Another volunteer tries to calm me down and take me outside but I start announcing to the entire soup kitchen how this piece of shit fired me just because I had surgery, and I'm homeless because of him.

Let's set the scene and the characters:

GF: 20 years old, Asian, naive as hell, but I love her to death

Me: 27, American, living in my girlfriend's country teaching English.

BTW: Belgian Twat Waffle, age unknown

My girlfriend is trying to get better at French and English, so she often goes to language exchange meetups. You can meet some colorful characters here, in both a very good and very bad way. Normally, I don't mind, but recently BTW has come into the scene. 

So GF met him and started chatting with him at a meet up. It started around 10, and they chatted until nearly 2 am. Not really a huge deal, new friend, new experiences. 

They decided to hang out again that weekend. GF lied about where she was going because she was afraid I would be jealous. That's kind of a different story though. They meet up at 3, she comes home around 1 in the morning, so 10 hours together. 

I'm upset because she lied about what was going on, and she had had many chances to inform me, so I confronted her about. She told me after she got ready for bed, she would tell me everything. So she did. It was mostly innocent, but cool, stuff they did. I had an issue when she said they were at the park and he touched her hand. I asked her to show me and it was fingers intertwined. Along with pats on the thigh and shoulder. I asked her to subtly drop the hint she had a boyfriend, she got mad and yelled at me saying I never let her have friends. I told her if she promises to drop the boyfriend hint, I'll drop asking about. She agrees, but never follows through. 

Jump to the next language exchange meet up, I go along because I didn't need to work. BTW shows up later, relatively drunk. Nothing out of the ordinary for anyone here. After the event, as usual, people meander to a nearby bar. GF and I follow along. BTW makes an obnoxious comment about me wanting to move my scooter. 

We get to the bar and this is where I start getting more uncomfortable. GF is naive and has a hard time outright saying no. She is a bit tipsy now too, I am not because I'm going to drive us back. He offers her to stay at his place, she responds with, what I thought was wildly inappropriate ""Maybe next time."" 

Next comes the cigarette. BTW offers her a cigarette. She says no. He pressures her to take it  saying it's just one. I step in because in my mind, that's a total dick move. Girlfriend is upset by me stepping in. 

He never directly insulted me, but he made a few comments that I found to be rude.  Like, who the hell really thinks China should take over Hong Kong and Taiwan completely?  

This story has been longer than I thought, so I'll do a TL;DR and wrap up here. Guy is flirty with my girlfriend, and while never out right rude, showed a lot of arrogant smugness towards me and GF. AITA for hating him?",41,49,0.88

331,Asshole,"TLDR; I think my boyfriend is gay and I told him. He flipped out.

&#x200B;

We've been dating for the past 5 months and he's been a perfect boyfriend to date i.e. remembers all anniversaries, plans all our dates and books reservations in advance, carries the groceries, my parents love him, etc.

Just one thing, I think he is gay. It started with a small suspicion recently when I introduced him to one of my gay best friends, X. X is one of the most good-looking but also the most outgoing, friendly guy I know, and everybody loves him. But the first time my boyfriend met him, he was so uneasy around X. He blushed a little when X jokingly flirted with him, then stuck close to me. The whole evening, he was so nervous and awkward, I had never seen him like that before. He was sweating and didn't speak much, and when X asked him if everything was alright, he replied very coolly, ""I really dislike this restaurant, I'm going to leave first if that's okay, get \[her\] home safe ok?"".

I felt a little weird about it because I had never seen him like that. When I got home he refused to talk about it. But I began noticing that my boyfriend would always unconsciously be agitated or angry if I brought up anything related to homosexuality or talked about X. But sometimes I suspect he has no attraction to me, and is only having sex with me because he feels insecure about his sexuality. He doesn't look at other women but sometimes when a handsome guy walks by him on the street he chooses to put his arm around me and walk on the other of me.

He is from a really religious family so I didn't want to create trouble but yesterday, I confronted him about it. I asked him if he thought about guys before, and whether he could possibly be gay. He freaked out, asked me if I had been hanging out too much with X, called me names, said I didn't trust him, acted hurt and asked if he had not been the perfect boyfriend, stormed out of the house and threatened to break up with me. That was yesterday and I haven't heard from him till today. Am I the asshole here because I think I did the right thing here?

332,Not the A-hole,"I've been pet-sitting pretty regularly for eight years. Have had 100+ different animals in my care, tons and tons of houses/clients, etc. Some of it is just stopping by to walk a dog or feed a cat, but most of it is the house-sitting kind where I stay at their house and take care of their animals/house while the owners are away. Nine out of ten times, the owners specifically tell me ""Eat whatever you want!"" and say ""we stocked the fridge/cupboards for you"" or some variation on this. So yeah, I'm living at this house 24/7 for a week or two, I do end up eating food. Not exclusively their food- I'll bring my own ingredients to cook or get takeout sometime, but I will regularly eat their food during my couple of weeks here.

That being said, I don't eat/drink anything expensive or rare looking- only stuff/brands that can be easily found at the store. I don't drink their booze. And I keep track of everything I eat. At the end of the week, I'll go grocery shopping and replace all that I can, but there are usually a couple items I can't find to replace at that particular store. But I figure that's fair- they said ""eat anything you like!"" and, for all intents and purposes, I only ate a couple things.

I mentioned this to some of my friends recently and they all basically agreed that they wouldn't eat anything. Most of them had housesat before at some time and all claimed not to have eaten any of the home owner's food. They didn't act like that would be horrendous of me, but they were all pretty matter-of-fact about ""eat anything you like"" just being one of those things people say and they probably just meant some chips or something.

Edit: Adding more info for clarification.

Yes, the property is under my name. My thought process was if she was paying $800 for just rent before then $700 is fair for everything, especially since it pretty much falls in line with monthly expenses. Yes I'd the property owner but why would us renting & paying this much a month be more reasonable, because I'm not the owner? Some people were bringing this up.

Edit:Coming to the general consensus that I'm not the asshole (maybe I'm biased lol). Again $700 was for mortgage, utilities, all renovation costs are being covered by me & never asked for any money towards this. Also every time we go out I pay, never brought this up as I'm fine with it, but outright trying to handle everything would stretch me thin.

I wrote out a roommate agreement, allowing them to live in a bedroom upstairs for 4 months while they get their lives back together. We charge them rent, but they haven't paid anything yet (this is ok as it was in the agreement - rent is due at the end of the month). They don't have jobs yet, either, as they moved in with us from another city. If it's important, I own the house.

They have 3 dogs - an old Pomeranian, an intact beagle,  and an unfixed female beagle/ chihuahua puppy. The puppy is the daughter of the intact beagle. She is 7 months old. 

Well, said puppy went into heat last week. And due to the irresponsibility of my housemates, the puppy is now pregnant by the father beagle. Inbreeding at its finest. 

When we first became aware of the issue, I was kind of in shock, just listening to what the housemates had to say about it. They were upset by it, but want to sell the puppies to make money for their rent. My husband raised the idea to them that it seemed immoral to sell these incest puppies. But they shrugged it off.

I have now offered to pay to have the puppy spayed, thus aborting the puppies. My roommates do not want to abort the puppies, but are ok with me having her spayed after the puppies are born (this is not an option I gave them). 

This upsets me for a couple of reasons. One being that we are already over the city limit for number of animals in our home (their 3 dogs put us over that limit). Next, as I mentioned, neither of them have jobs yet. They would be responsible for vaccinating and caring for these puppies. 

I am also an advocate for adoption, and this goes against those values. I also can't imagine making a tiny puppy give birth - it seems dangerous because of her size. And we also aren't sure if these dogs will have any birth defects due to the close inbreeding.

343,Not the A-hole,"AITA? Hear me out here. 

My guy and I are 22. We have decent jobs and usually financially, we are okay. But we aren’t rolling in money. We have a 2 year old son. We own a 3 bedroom (small rooms, no closet space) and one bathroom (tiny bathroom) house. 

I have a friend who is 19, working two jobs and in college. She works her ass off. She has a boyfriend who just...doesn’t. He cannot keep a job and she’s paid his way and taken the financial burden for the past year since they moved in together. They are being evicted now for not being able to make rent- and he still hasn’t gotten a job. Refuses to work in a factory or food service. 

Anyway, they asked to move in with us. If it were only her, I’d say yes without hesitation. I care for her and see she works really hard. But, my guy and I are not on board with her guy. For one, we know he won’t pay what he says he will as he can’t keep a job. For two, we just don’t know him very well. 

We told my friend we’d let her move in, but not him. We were both honest about why- completely honest. She is now furious with us, saying we are selfish and letting them be homeless. Which is simply not true- they just don’t want to live with their parents. She won’t come without him and is now refusing to speak to us. And when she does, it’s the “you’re being selfish and a bad friend” line. 

I feel bad for her struggle. I do. And I hate seeing her struggle. I see she works SO HARD. But I can’t bring myself to let her drag him into my life when I don’t trust or really even like him. And quite frankly, I don’t want to alter my son’s way of life (or mine and my guy’s) to accommodate them. 

AITA? Am I being selfish? I feel crazy guilty about this and can’t tell if I should or not.

All of the sudden they've decided they're going to do a destination wedding in Moscow Russia. I told him that I think that's awesome and i'll make sure to send a gift and that he better make sure he takes pictures because I can't wait to see. He said ""what so you're not going?"" I told him i'm sorry but that I won't go to moscow. I've never left the country, don't have a passport and have a deathly fear of flying, for reference I live in michigan and the couple time's I've been to Florida even though the rest of my family flies I'll drive (besides road trips are fun right?). 

  
He's now upset saying that I'm not supporting him, I told him the rule with destination weddings is always that you have to be prepared that not everyone's going to be able to go. He's now upset because not only am I not going, none of his friends are going his stepson isn't able to go because the bio dad (who we've had issues with in the past but I understand his reasoning for this) won't sign off on his son going to Russia, basically only his parent's will go. Now some of them don't have the money, I seem to be the only one just scared of leaving the country, and the rest just don't want to go to Russia (because like.... who wants to go to russia?). He's saying we're not supportive of his wishes, which I disagree with he chose a destination wedding which automatically means a lot of people can't go, and he chose a really weird destination, which a lot of our friend group is LGBTQ and russia's known for not being friendly to that group. But my family is saying because of how long we've been friends I should get over my fear and go support him.

346,Not the A-hole,"My birthday was a few weeks ago.  It was during vacation (Spring Break) as it is every year.   We went to a children’s’ theme park that day.  I was just happy our kids were happy!  But I will admit I was hurt that my husband didn’t so much as give me a birthday card.  When I admitted I had hurt feelings, he said “this Spring Break trip is your gift.  You aren’t grateful”.   Since his birthday is right around the corner, I asked if the trip counted toward his as well.  He yelled and called me a selfish bitch. 

I was very thankful we were able to take that trip.  I made that very clear!  I just had no idea it was also a birthday gift. 

Now HE is about to have his birthday, and he has given me tons of expensive ideas for gifts for his birthday.  

AITA if I don’t spend what he’s asking on gifts?  I feel like if he’s going to blow mine off, perhaps it’s just time to do inexpensive, tiny gifts.  (We usually do nice gifts, so this might shock him)",88,156,0.94

348,Asshole,"I have a feeling I am, but I wanted another opinion. I will accept my judgement. 

There is this park by my house that I walk my dog in every day. It's not a park where there are a lot of children as there isn't a playground. It's a wooded area with a paved trail through it. It's only about a mile long. My dog is a medium sized brown mutt, about 40 lbs. She's a little shy, so she doesn't bark or even go up to people she doesn't know. We walk to this park every day, and once in the park I let her off the leash. She always comes to me, and if I see another person or another dog we don't know, I will call her back and wait for them to pass. She has a few dog friends who are there a few times a week who's owners also let them off the leash. The dogs play and I make small talk with the owners. My dog loves this park. She runs and plays in the woods, chases squirrels and the occasional deer, plays with her dog friends, and even gets the occasional treat from a passerby. 

Let me start by saying that I understand why leash laws exist. I know not all dogs are friendly. I know not all owners keep their pets up to date on shots. And I know there are people out there who are afraid of dogs. I know I'm probably being a jerk for saying this, but I really don't care. My dog is not going to hurt you, but I will leash her while you pass so she doesn't accidently brush up against your leg or something. 

So, yesterday, we were in the park as normal and I was letting my dog run. She was in the woods, so when I saw  grumpy bitch walk up, I didn't bother calling her back since she wasn't paying attention anyway. The woman stopped and told me my dog needed to be on a leash. I said ""is she bothering you? I just like her to be able to get some energy out since she's couped up inside all day. I'll put her on the leash until you pass"". I called my dog back, and went to put her leash on her and the lady said (very angrily) ""your dog always needs to be on a leash, you stupid woman"" so I unleashed my dog and walked away. My dog paid absolutely no attention to her. She yelled something back at me that I didn't hear and I just put my earbuds back in and ignored her. I refuse to be talked to like that. 

My husband says I should have apologized and put her on a leash. So AITA?

EDIT: Ok, I'm the asshole! I figured. I accept my judgement. Also, there's no need for personal attacks. It seems like some of you need more dogs in your life.",351,332,0.8
349,Not the A-hole,"So I was having lunch with my dad at a food court. The food court was pretty crowded and my dad and we finally found a 4 person seat to sit. Mid-way into our lunch, an elder couple asked if they could take the two other empty seats beside us. We agreed. 
We were both minding our own business and enjoying our meals. The husband finished his meal and got up and left the table. The elderly lady quickly finished her congee and left the table leaving behind the dough stick (the congee came with Chinese dough stick).
The cleaner was clearing the elderly couple's dishes and ask us whether we still wanted the dough stick. My dad said it wasn't ours and the cleaner just took it away with her. At this point, we were done with our meal, when the elderly lady came back to the table and was shocked to find an empty table. She asked us where her dough stick was and we just pointed to the cleaning lady. The elderly lady started blaming us for not stopping the cleaning lady from taking away her dough stick as she just left the table for the washroom. She even demanded us to pay for it. My dad and I did not want to start a commotion and just left. 

FYI: Her husband has left the table for a while now and when she left we just thought she just forgot about her dough stick. She also took quite some time in the washroom so we thought she just left too.

352,No A-holes here,"To provide some background, I am a petite female working as a language lector. I only teach people individually and try for my lessons to be fun. Each lesson is just me and the student (max 4) in my classroom for an  hour, which seems to work for everyone, and the results are  pretty good, but it is also the reason why I try to pick my clients  carefully - feeling a bit vulnerable all alone with them.

So  about half a year ago a lady contacted me about lessons for her two small kids (girls 7-9yo). At first everything was normal and fine, the kids were sweet and excited to learn. Until one of the girls started saying creepy stuff. She would draw a house and explain that ""there lives a cannibal who eats kids"" and go on in detail explaining how the man chopped somebody up and which part he is eating/cooking/grilling.

The first time, I was shocked and told her mum, but the mum just shook it off, but it keeps happening. As the lessons went, I found out that the kid's favorite movies  are gruesome horror movies, which she is capable to find online on her  own, and which she states ""are not scary to watch, they are so funny!""

Probably  the last drop was when we were playing with dolls, and this girl  arranged them all to lie on the floor of the dollhouse with one standing  in the middle and made me and her sister guess what has happened, we  tried ""she is reading a story to them"", ""they are playing a game"", etc.  nope! IN the end, she exclaimed excitedly ""NO! SHe has poisoned them All  because they were annoying!""

Since then  I have to explicitly ban murder/killing from every single game because her sister, who was originally visibly scared of it, started getting in on the ""fun"", and I am starting to feel that I have to cut my connection to this family ASAP.

I am already creeped out by that kid, and cannot imagine spending time with her alone when she grows bigger. I  have already heard about her ""digging a hole to bury a classmate in,  because they are naughty"", and her own mother commented ""I am just waiting for somebody to disappear"" in a half-joking half-serious manner.

So,  AITA? Is this a normal kid behavior which will pass? Am I  overreacting? Am I a scaredy-cat? Or do I rightfully feel in potential danger? I have no idea how to break it to their mom, who is a very sweet person...

Edit: I should probably add, that another thing which makes me back out is that I have seen the kid physically attack her mother a few times it pretty normal situations. The reaction was totally unexpected, 0 to 100 in a second. I don't want to get in such situation, because it could only end in trouble...

Edit 2: I feel I need to defend myself here - I have NEVER scolded, criticised or shunned the kid, or any other. I have never given her a reason to feel bad, and would never do that. I treat all children as individuals and with respect, it is the reason why we have such good relationships. When I ban murder from the games, the kid laughs, because she takes it as an inside joke, not being criticised.",29,111,0.94
353,No A-holes here,"So for some context I’m 19 and I have bad knees along with some other stuff. I did some construction in the past and fucked my knees up. As a result I carry a cane around with me in case I have to squat down because I can’t stand back up on my own. I typically carry it with me when I go out to the mall, with friends, movies, etc. and I’ve noticed that people take a different attitude with me when I walk with my cane. They act a bit nicer, are more patient, and a few times have been a bit more charitable than they probably would have normally. I’m not disabled at all. I can function perfectly. Run, jump, lift heavy objects(from a standing position), and all of that good stuff. I’ve never given off an impression that I’m disabled until after I get treated a certain way. I could probably explain that I’m fine and don’t need the charity but I feel like at that point I would have to argue the reasoning for using a cane and give my life story to every person who over apologized for bumping into me. But I’m also afraid of getting called out for walking fine after something like that. So i tend to overplay it for the person. Ill limp a little bit more typically or overplay how disabled I am. I feel like it gives the person a more justifiable “I did something good” or whatever but I always feel bad afterwards. 

Am I an asshole?

I know this is a bit confusing so if you have questions please ask

EDIT: So I feel I should clarify two things. I do definitely need the cane and I don’t oversell anything to try and get things.

I have frequent minor seizures that don’t really have any discernible reasons for occurring, I was going to get scanned to see if thy were epileptic or not but things happened that made me unable to do so. Regardless I do need it on me in case I need to stand or keep myself stable.

The overplaying occurs after the deed is done and i never let it get past someone moving around to bring me a thing or open a door, in which case I oversell afterwards. This might not change anything and if I’m still an asshole I’ll 100% accept that",59,40,0.79

My brother has a total of 5 kids. 3 of them are from his ex wife (deceased) and my mother has had custody of them since shortly after the birth of the youngest, which was over a decade ago, because my brother was in prison for quite some time. He’s been out for about 4 years and now has 2 children from his current girlfriend - a 3 year old son and a newborn girl. Both my brother and his gf were tested for drugs at the hospital (I’m guessing because the baby girl must have been tested) and they both came up positive and had custody taken away. My mother has decided to not pursue custody because she can’t afford it plus she is older and disabled and can’t handle anymore children, especially small ones. His gf‘s mom tried to get custody but she wasn’t deemed fit herself so right now both the kids are in foster care. Gf also had two other kids, their father has custody. He (understandably) does not want to pursue custody of these two. Both my mother and my brother have begged me to take custody of the kids and I’ve been very firm in my refusal. I have 4 children of my own, i work full time, and I have no room in my home for them to live comfortably. I would not be able to afford childcare for them and I cannot afford to quit my job to be a stay at home parent for whatever length of time I would have them for.  My husband is completely behind me on this. They are the ones who made the decision to do drugs, it’s not my responsibility to raise their kids now that they’ve been taken away. However, my mother vehemently disagrees (to the point of name calling) and believes that since she’s taken the older 3 that I should take the other 2 so that they can continue to be raised by family and all the siblings can still grow up together. I already barely speak to my mother because of childhood trauma, and this is making me feel like it would be best to sever ties completely but before I do I wanted to make sure that I am in the right and that I don’t have a responsibility to my brother and his children.

She's 5 now and at the ""test my limits"" phase and they never set rules for her that aren't food related. Don't eat in the family room, don't take food upstairs, etc. There are things that are assumed, but no consequences were ever defined for her.

Yesterday she went too far and ran 6 houses away from my parents front yard. They weren't able to easily catch her and a big deal was made. She was told no more tv for the rest of the day. When I got there she and I had a talk and I set actual rules for her when she's outside. As we were getting ready to leave she made a run for it again. This time it was obviously to test her limits because she always stayed 1 driveway away from me and would stop and wait for me to get to the next driveway before running any further. She stopped at the same house as earlier, and stayed out of the street. I took her home and made her go to bed an hour or two early and let her know she's grounded for today and the other consequences of her actions.

She said she just ""wanted a better view of the sunset"" which was obviously BS and I called her out on it. We set actual boundaries for being outside, discussed what happens when she breaks them and I let her know the priveledges that she's losing by not behaving. No beach vacation, no school bus (she loves the idea of the bus for some reason), no trips to the pool, zoo etc. After she went to bed I texted my mom and told her what was said and the BS excuse she gave.

This morning my mom picked her up and my daughter and I told my mom what was decided so that she'd be on the same page as me. to make sure that my daughter understood what was allowed and what wasn't I asked her questions about what allowed and what wasn't. ""Are you allowed in the front yard by yourself?"" No. ""Are you allowed on the back deck by yourself."" Yes. ""Can you go next door to visit X without telling grandparents?"" No. ""What do you do if you want to play with X?"" Ask Grandma. ""What do you do if you want to go for a walk?"" Ask Grand-Mom interrupts ""No, don't give into her excuses. You're just playing into her hands."" I asked her to stop going over what I was saying with my daughter because it's disrespectful to me and confusing for a 5 year old.

""I'm just stating my opinion.""

""No, you're disrespecting me in front of my daughter.""

""I'm allowed to have an opinion.""

I guess my point is that I felt a little betrayed that this person portrayed such a different image of herself online to what she looked like in real life and so that reflected in me during our date, but I've always been brought up to treat people the way I'd like to be treated and I can't imagine going on a date with someone who's just made it a big friend zone is all that great an experience so I'm torn between whether I'm an asshole for acting the way I did, or she's an asshole for leading me on under false pretenses

366,Not the A-hole,"To clarify, I’m male and my fiancée female. A few months ago we were all at a festival with a notably liberal atmosphere and everyone was intoxicated – it was towards the end of the night and I had just gone off to sleep in my tent. Both the would-be instigator (I’ll call her Sarah) and my best friend (let’s call her Deb) are bisexual with polyamorous tendencies and have fooled around together both on their own and with guys before. They both have boyfriends who are aware and don’t mind this. My fiancée and I on the other hand are both straight as arrows and strictly monogamous. Both Sarah and Deb have privately commented to me before this incident that they find my fiancée really attractive (they’re not blind!)

Obviously I wasn’t around to hear this, but from what my fiancée has told me, Sarah and Deb started joking around with my fiancée about exploring each other’s bodies and getting sexual sometime. My fiancée thought they were just kidding around and joked along with it. However at one point Sarah paused and said, in a more serious tone “Well then, shall we go ahead and do it now?”. My fiancée froze in shock and Deb said “Um, I don’t think we should do that without asking Skillful_Hedonist if he’s cool with it…” and so Sarah dropped it.

When my fiancée told me this I was very annoyed. I know they’re both sexually liberal and that’s cool and all, but Sarah knew that we are monogamous. I feel that not only was it disrespecting our relationship by trying to encourage her to cheat whilst I was asleep, but was a bit predatory to proposition her whilst she was that intoxicated. I worry that if Deb hadn’t been there to shut it down, she might well have pressured her into it since my fiancée is quite timid. 

I told Deb how pissed off I was and she apologised but said they were just joking around, and that Sarah was just drunk and might’ve taken it too far but didn’t really mean it. I don’t think such excuses would fly if it was a male friend of mine making the proposition, and the fact Sarah’s a woman shouldn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, my fiancée feels it’s mainly her fault for going along with the joking part without immediately saying no, but then she tends to blame herself for the wrongs of others due to self-esteem issues. 

Deb later mentioned to Sarah that I’m annoyed with her and she sent me an apology message which did seem sincere. I said I forgave her and have since hung out with her in a group situation, but at the same time the friendship has been noticeably damaged. Deb is stuck in the middle and has tried to encourage me to rebuild bridges with Sarah, claiming I’m exaggerating the significance of an isolated incident and ruining a perfectly good friendship over it. But I don’t really want to, and would prefer that we avoid contact as much as possible, only remaining courteous for the sake of the rest of the group. Is this unreasonable of me?

370,Not the A-hole,"I'm renting a room from a guy for a ridiculously low price. My landlord also lives in the flat and I have one other flatmate.

I moved in and then went home to visit my parents for the weekend with the intention of bringing the rest of my stuff back with me. When I got back, he told me he was starting to get worried and was going to call the police if I didn't come back that night. He didn't call or text me the whole weekend. Later that week I spent the night studying in the university library where there is no phone service. When I left around 3am, I had several texts asking me where I was and if I was a ""party girl"". He talked the next morning about how the girl who rented the room before me used to go out in short skirts and heels.

I went away for two weeks and I received multiple texts from him asking me to meet him in the dining room to talk. I told him in advance that I was leaving and when I would be back. I paid my rent early before I left because he will only accept cash payments. I asked him what was wrong and when I called him later, he only wanted to ask me when I was coming back. This information was freely available to him on the note I left pinned to my door.

He went to China for a month. He left me and my flatmate a list of chores which we did. The flat was spotless. When he was due back, I spent the night working in the library until the sun came up. Then I went home and crashed. I woke up to shouting. I had several missed calls/texts from him. I went out into the dining room and found him shouting at my flatmate (and then also me) about how angry he was that we hadn't been answering our phones. I told him that I was asleep and he said that I should answer his calls no matter what. He was also furious with my flatmate because he'd tried to go into her room and broken the door handle. He was angry with her about this for some reason even though he was the one who broke it.

I spent last night in the library working and am still here. My phone blew up with a bunch of texts and missed calls from him. He told me he's been waiting up all night for me and that he won't go to work until I come home. I'm honestly scared of what he'll say/do when I get there. My flatmate is moving out so I'll be alone with him for the next month. He also said in his flat advertisement that he would ONLY rent to female students which didn't set off alarm bells for me at first because I assumed that the person who posted the ad was a woman. It's been kinda weirding me out ever since though.

So, WIBTA if I reported him for being an unregistered landlord? I'm not positive he is but it's likely.

UPDATE: I went to my university and they've arranged emergency accommodation for me for tonight. I'm going to try to move out by Saturday.",20,58,0.94

375,,"For context, I work in a small company that contains 6 employees. I am second in the org chart and I report directly to the owner/CEO. We operate primarily in two small rural towns and while we have a significant volume of work that we do, it tends to get repetitive and the problems we solve only impact the local community as opposed to something that affects the region or some larger area.

Over the past week I have been dealing with trying to replace an administrative assistant who was offered a position that pays more and is closer to her home. When my boss and I discussed the matter, I told her that I wanted to keep her if possible and I was authorized by the owner to ask the employee that if we did match her current offer would she be willing to stay. She said that she would. In discussing the matter with the owner, the owner expressed privately that she was concerned that the staff member would always be looking for more money and she didn't want to participate in a constant bidding war (I have major issues with this statement, but that's another post). 

Later that day, unaware of my boss's position on the matter, the staff member came into my office, told me she needed advice from me as a friend, not as a supervisor (she and I are the only two employees in our second office and have developed a great relationship), and then asked me whether I would stay or go if I was in her position. I asked what she wanted out of her career and she said that she wanted to be exposed to several different types of disciplines in our industry and that she wanted more complex work because as she phrased it, ""she was getting bored"". I then advised her that we were a ""small town company"" and that we handle ""small town issues"" and that probably wouldn't change. Further, I told her that while we could match her compensation, we couldn't match the distance to her home, that she was an excellent employee, and that while I had no doubt she could succeed on a larger stage, I doubted that the company would be able to provide that opportunity. She thanked me and told me that I had helped her make up her mind to leave. 

I then contacted my boss and informed her that keeping the employee was no longer an option. My boss asked why, and I told her about our conversation. My boss was livid. She said that I had betrayed the company, that it costs money to train new people (which I don't deny), and that I did not do what was in best interests of the company. I believe that I did do what was in our company's best interests because while we may be able to satisfy the employee for a little while, the deeper issue would only resurface later and we would have to readdress her leaving all over again.

The crime happened about a year ago, but I have been a bit of an emotional mess since then. It threw me into a very confusing spiral. 

It is important to note that I have no received counselling (only medications from doctors) because it is too expensive in my country, so this is definitely a factor in why I feel like this I think. I have also been trying to help myself and get any resources I can. 

But, thinking of the name makes me completely shut down and it is not the person I am seeing’s fault at all, and I feel so horrible. I just don’t think I am ready to date someone and think of that name. The name just gives me so much anxiety and takes me back to what happened. 

This sounds kind of stupid, but it has been plaguing my mind for a few days. I think that I should explain to him what is happening, maybe stop seeing him, and definitely figure out what I can do to get better on my own. I just don’t want to be a horrible person.

379,Not the A-hole,"So I made this account specifically for this post so I could vent.

Me and my fiancé have been together 11 years with a 9 year old son. Three years ago we decided that we did not want to have any more children.

We as a couple went to both our doctors to see about getting our tubes tied and what each surgery entails for both of us. After this we came to the agreement that since the males surgery is a lot less invasive that he would get his tubes tied.

We were not in a rush so I didn’t pester him about not making appointments and such. He would agree to call then would forget and never follow up.

Things changed when I did fall pregnant again. The pregnancy didn’t last but it put my butt in gear.  

Today I asked if he had called his doctor to see about setting up the surgery. He has now decided that he no longer wants the surgery and wants me to get it. I have no problem if he said he doesn’t want it but since the lost pregnancy he has insisted up till today that he is getting it done and to not worry. 

I’m upset about the sudden change after three years and the past few months of promising. I’m not made he doesn’t want it I’m mad over him stringing me along the last months since he said that he hasn’t wanted it since the pregnancy.  I just feel like he strung me along so he could make himself feel better while lying to me",295,422,0.95

383,Not the A-hole,"So some quick backstory and sorry for any mistakes, I’m on mobile. I work as an usher at an auditorium. It’s a pretty laid back job and we’re often just tasked with making sure the patrons are following the rules. There are the rules that we set, like no food and drinks and the rules that the clients set, like seating.

Today we were hosting a full day of adjudicated dance recitals, and the client hosting the event asked that the first two row closest to the stage be blocked off so no one could sit there. The dancers sometimes preformed off the front of the stage and if we didn’t have it blocked off, parents would of course be clamoring around right at the edge of the stage and it had the possibility of disturbing the dancers. We also had to block off some middle rows so the adjudicator could have their privacy and we ran out of the rope barriers that we normally use. This means we had to improvise and we used some long strips of tape to block off the rows. We also put of signs asking people to not sit in the first two rows.

Enter mom, dad, brother, and sister. So I’m doing my thing, and keeping my eye out into the audience and I notice the two little kids wandering. Now it wasn’t super full and they were just wandering up and down the row they were sitting in so I didn’t really care. Soon after though, the little boy (maybe 5 or 6) left his parents, went under the tape and sat right in front of the stage. Now I started to pay a little more attention now and saw the boy start to move around and bounce up and down a little.

So I quietly go up to the father (who I now see is wearing a military uniform) and politely ask him if it’s possible to move his son out of the front row. I explain that our client requested that they be empty. He seems annoyed but begrudgingly goes and tries to bring his son back to where they were sitting. Well the dad barely said anything to the little guy before he throws a huge tantrum. The dad then scooped him up and took him outside.

Well as I found out from overhearing their later conversation, not ten seconds after the dad left the chamber to deal with his son, their daughter who they were there to see dance, comes onstage with her group. And then finished the dance just before the father returned. His wife picked up the other daughter and they both mumbled angrily under their breath about how he missed his daughter dancing because of the tantrum and all because the staff that asked him to move his son. As he walked past me to the exit, he gave me a look that was so cold, it lowered the temperature in the auditorium.

So reddit... am I the asshole for causing the chain of events that meant this dad missed his daughters dance recital?",118,302,0.95
384,Not the A-hole,"My childhood was abusive.  It took a long time after I left to seek help.  It took a lot of therapy to stop living in survival mode, even more to be able to trust other human beings and a hell of a long time to accept that one of my abusers was a child living in the same situation.

Six years ago I finally reached a point where I could try to have a relationship with my older sister (18 months age gap) we are both adults now and hadn't seen each other for five years at that point.  I agreed to go to a restraunt for a meal with extended family members that my sister would be attending.

When I accepted the invitation I reminded everyone that I have a severe allergy to [unusual and possibly identifying food item] and that i could not sit next to anyone eating [food item].  My sister takes a bite of her burger, says ""this has [food item] in it"" then leans across the table and breathes on my face.

I walked out, took Benadryl and called my boyfriend to pick me up.

My therapist was stunned into silence when I told her.

My family backed me up at the time when I said I was done with her.

That event undid a lot of work I had done in therapy and cemented her in my psyche as the monster she had always been to me.

I'm now getting a lot of pressure from my family to give her another chance.  I have a four year old, she has a three year old and the extended family want to be able to see both of them every holiday without having to arrange two different things.  If she's there I refuse to be.  My extended family wants to do big family meet ups over the next year and want both kids at everything.  I am being told by everyone that I need to get over it and stop making people work so hard to have a relationship with me and my child.

I don't want my child to ever meet my sister, I don't want to be in the same room as her ever again.

Well, shortly after high school ended, she kicked me out because she didn't like my boyfriend at the time. So I moved in with my grandpa. Mom broke her lease to move in with her (abusive) boyfriend. So not only did she owe that apartment complex money, she didn't return the router/modem or pay the last bill. The internet company sent it to collections, it's over $350. I was not aware of any of this because she used her own email and I didn't live at the residence so I didn't get mail.

386,Not the A-hole,"My cat, Midnight, is about 12 years old. She is, and has always been, one of the sweetest cats I own. Like curls up on my chest under the blankets, licks my cheek, and purrs herself to sleep. I've had her for almost 10 years, and she is my baby. 

She's very nervous around others because, before coming to me, her previous owner abused her and tried to drown her in a river. So she'll usually hide under a bed or a couch when my boyfriend and I have company. She may come out if our friends are quieter or if we're not moving around much. 

A friend of ours came by today with her son, about 7 years old. He knows we have cats. Our other cat (Rocky) is a ham. He's a huge fluffy cat that loves people. He will approach anyone and flop across you as long as you pet him. So when her son asked where the cats were, we directed him to Rocky but he said he wanted to see Midnight. I explained that she's shy, so she's hiding.

Shortly after, I watched her come barrelling out of the bedroom and into the corner of the kitchen. So I scooped her up, and she was shaking. My friend's son ran out after her, laughing. I told him again that she's shy, and now she's scared. I warned him that if she gets scared (she is a very small cat), she might scratch him to protect herself and that he should leave her alone. 

I put her back in my room and shut the door. I told my friend what I had told him, and she took him into the backyard with my bf so he could start grilling up lunch. At some point, her kid came back inside while I was cooking, and went into my room. He ended up cornering Midnight, and in self-defense, she scratched him. And since he had his face near her, she got him good down the side of his face. He started screaming and crying and told his mom that my cat attacked him.

My friend was furious because her son was so badly hurt (I will admit, it did look painful, I think he pulled away while she was scratching and her claws got caught in his skin). She said that if I didn't get my ""vicious"" cat put down or declawed, she was going to sue us for her kid's medical bills/medicine/etc. 

I didn't even pretend to consider either option. Declawing is cruel, and I'm not putting down my baby for protecting herself after I warned him AND separated her. But my neighbors (who heard the commotion and came over to check on everyone) insisted that, no matter how sweet my cat was before, she seriously injured a child and that ""something needs to be done.""

He saw the doctor yesterday after they left-- there was no sign of infection, he was utd on his tetanus, they were told to get some Neosporin and keep it clean. No damage to his eye. The husband asked if Midnight was doing okay (everyone who knows her knows how skittish she can be). He assured me that he had a talk with his kid abour respecting animals and respecting the rules in another person's house. I did tell him that I wasn't comfortable with them coming here for the time being, and he understood. Friend is still angry because she still thinks my cat should have been trained better than to scratch someone in self defense. She's dropped the ""I'm suing"" line, but she still thinks I should declaw my cat, which I made very clear I will not do. 

Also Midnight has been so overjoyed by all the extra snuggles today. Thank you all so much for your advice.

387,Not the A-hole,"Hey lovely Reddit people! Thanks for reading and for sharing your two cents. 

&#x200B;

Right now I'm staying a long-term AirBnB rental. I love this place. The host is awesome. It's right across the street from a giant park with a lake for sketching waterfowl and fishing in the spring and summer. The bus station is a short walk. And it's in a quiet residential suburb. It's split into an upper and lower portion with separate entrances. Earlier this year I spent two months upstairs in the attic and had a wonderful stay. 

&#x200B;

Late last month I moved into a bigger downstairs room. I've been here about a week now. There are two other guests. A young woman I haven't met yet, and a young man who lives near the front door. So far I've seen him a couple times but we haven't interacted beyond a hello/what's up both times, but overall I get an unfriendly vibe from him. That's totally fine by me, but it plays a role in what happened. All our rooms are oriented toward the kitchen.

&#x200B;

This morning I got up early for a doctor's appointment. I was hungry for breakfast, but because it was about 5:15 AM I didn't want to a douche and fire up the fan and fry up beans or whatever. So I dumped some oats into a bowl and microwaved them for exactly 45 seconds; I hit the minute plus button, then pulled them out with 15 seconds to go to avoid the obnoxious beep. I dug my spoon into the oats and started for my room, when I heard loud, stomping footsteps coming from his room. Alarm bells went off in my head and I was suddenly terrified, so I ducked into my room, closed the door, and locked it behind me.

&#x200B;

I heard him then spend a couple of minutes angrily cursing me out (not me specifically, though surely he could have seen the light under my door, but generally whoever used the microwave). Basically he was saying things like, ""We're not playing this game so early in the fucking morning, being loud, people are trying to sleep, fucking bitch, etc."" It sounded like he opened the microwave to see what was inside and slammed it shut. After a couple minutes of this he went back to his room. I'm in my room shaking like a leaf and freaked out because I have to tiptoe past his room to get out the front door. 

&#x200B;

I got my stuff together, slipped out the front door, grabbed my shoes, and put them on in the backyard because I was worried he'd come out and yell at me if he heard me. I was scared about running into him tonight, and I haven't so far but now I'm scared to use the kitchen or to bump into him. I messaged AirBnB and the host to ask if I did something wrong. The host made it clear I could use the appliances (he's a great guy) and never mentioned a limit on them. I really feel bad that the guy was so upset, but I don't feel like I did anything unreasonable. Am I wrong?

388,Not the A-hole,"My husband, our young son and I live in a house with only one bathroom. My husband will oftentimes disappear into the bathroom for 45mins, an hour even one time close to 2 hours! Any attempts to persuade him to hurry are futile and the boy and I left to fend for ourselves. Fortunately, my son has a private little corner of our backyard where he can go relieve himself in emergencies, but it can be torture for myself or any other women stuck waiting to tinkle. 

One time it got so bad, I had to take my neice all the way back to her house only to find it locked up tight. So we came back and I almost beat the door down till he finally, graciously, relinquished the bathroom. My poor neice was so embarrassed and uncomfortable! 

And God forbid he pulls the dreaded ""poop to shower"" combo! You will literally wait for hours! I have finally got him to where he will unlock the door before he jumps in the shower so we can at least get in to relieve ourselves.

And it has going on for years! I remember being on maternity leave, and being so resentful that he would come home and dissapear for an hour or so while I waited with our newborn. I was so mad that he could take that time for himself so easily when I couldn't even find 15 minutes to shower! 

Today was just more of the same. My son and I waited and waited for him to get out of the bathroom. When I finally told him to hurry the f up, it still took him another 25 minutes to get out and at that point I was ready to go to a neighbor's. His response? ""I thought you went when you got home from work?"" and ""you should have told me earlier"" 

I try really hard not to hassel him too much because, after all, we're talking about a normal bodily function that sometimes requires time. I try to respect his privacy and only knock or tell him to hurry when there's an emergency. But when that happens I feel like there's no urgency to wrap things up! 

And here's where I know I really start to sound nuts: I have to go in after him and a lot of time it doesn't even smell! Zero evidence that he was ""using the facilities."" I really don't want to know what he does with his bathroom time, I just want him to be more respectful of the fact that other people have needs too!

I want to know at least a few days ahead of time how many people I'll be hosting so I can prepare accordingly. They also have some significant dietary restrictions. I'll absolutely accommodate for their needs if they are planning on attending but it's a hassle that I'm not thrilled about undertaking just for the hell of it. 

&#x200B;

Which brings me to my question: WIBTA if I told them that I need a definitive ""yes"" or ""no"" at least three days ahead of time and that if they can't commit then they'll be missed but are not invited to show up last minute? If I do this I'm almost sure I'll push them to saying no, which will make a lot of my husband's family sad. I'll basically be rocking a boat that's been left alone for ten years. 

&#x200B;

My husband says he agrees with me, but I also know he would never insist on anything like this on his own. I think that I have a point, but I also know if I do this I'll be knowingly challenging expectations in a way that is very likely to upset a lot of people.",137,874,0.97
390,Not the A-hole,"Background: This guy (Dave) and my fiance have been best friends since 2nd grade. Dave has untreated bipolar (that he refuses to treat) and over the last 2 years has become increasingly difficult to be around. He complains constantly and sometimes has a violent temper.

He's also a member of my weekly tabletop group where he spends most of every session bitching about his life situation, his ex or sniping at/attacking my fiance. He barely interacts with anyone's characters but mine and even snipes at Fiance in character.

His life is in the toilet right now and we're like his only friends...

What really makes me uncomfortable is:

-He constantly (but only when we're alone) brings up rumors  he's ""heard"" about me faking my disability (I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user with Ehlers Danlos) or about what a terrible parent I was (due to my worsening health I gave up custody of my son to his grandparents).

-He keeps bringing up this other girl he likes and how she was fat and shy in highschool but got into rock climbing and is super fit and confident now -- including showing me before & after pics. I'm in treatment for bulimia/possible Atypical Anorexia, which he knows about.

-He keeps saying stuff like ""if it weren't for fiance, I'd totally try to go out with you"" or tells me if Fiance and I broke up, he'd side with me.

-He keeps giving me money and I can't shake the feeling that eventually a ""I bought you dinner, you owe me"" moment will happen. 

Anyway, on Saturday I was talking with the host of game group about why Dave would constantly attack his ""best friend"" and Host goes ""He's jealous of <fiance> and wants to get in your pants? It's been obvious since day one.""

Hearing it so bluntly kinda made all the pieces fall into place and I freaked out a bit. 

I've been becoming more and more uncomfortable around Dave for years but I kept making excuses for him ""he's just having a rough time"" or ""it's just the bipolar"".

On Sunday, I told my fiance how I felt and that we needed to break it off with Dave. He agreed but I feel guilty.

391,Not the A-hole," My wife runs a food catering service that mostly caters to massive events like weddings or other parties and often times I help out or take over if she's unavailable but I mainly help run a logging business which Youssef, a friend and coworker of mine (we're friends but not super close, we don't hang out often mostly just talk at work) told me he's getting married. We live in a rural part of West Virginia and I've never met that many people who weren't Appalachian hillbillies like me, very rarely do we meet foreigners and he's the only non white person I know. He's an Egyptian immigrant and so is his wife and they're both christians. This is what leads to the conflict. He looks at the food options and basically just points to meat dishes that look good never once asking what the ingredients are. I make a bunch of samosas, ribs, meat pies, sausages, a few pizzas, and of course cakes and other desserts. The day of the wedding comes and we serve out the food, this is the biggest wedding I've ever attended or catered and it looks like there might have been 700 people. People from all over the Middle East showed up and this is what lead to the conflict. Since he's a christian he doesn't have dietary restrictions however most of the guests were muslims. I honestly feel like a jackass that I never even considered this. Also none of the meat was halal and I feel stupid for not knowing that there's a special meat preparation muslims need to do and I really feel bad for my ignorance. Most of the food is eaten and one old man in a very thick arabic accent asks me what the food I ate is. I couldn't understand him well so his son comes up and translates from arabic and asks me what this food is. I explained to him that baby back ribs are pork ribs marinated with our special bbq sauce. He then loses his shit and starts screaming at me in arabic and I'm really confused and then his son explains to me that pork is Haraaam and that muslims cannot eat it. He starts telling everyone else that there's been pork served here and then he asks if the meat is prepared halal. I have no idea what that means but I'm pretty sure they're not so I tell him no and he tries to attack me but his son restrains him. His son walks to me in private and in a upset but calm manner explains to me that what I did was considered incredibly insulting to the guests and I give him my apologies for my ignorance and I would never intend to do that. All of the guests are screaming at me and I feel unsafe so I pack up my stuff and leave. We lost some equipment in the incident but we still profited even with those losses. We were bombarded with hate mail, calls and bad yelp reviews. I call up Youssef and ask him wtf this is about I tell him this is his fault for not telling me about the dietary restrictions fo the guests while he blames me for being ignorant and not assuming the food should be halal.",65,51,0.89

394,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for formatting and stuff, on mobile and usually just a lurker.
I'm 18 and my brother is 22.  He's been obnoxious and lazy most of his life, but it's gotten much worse. 
Near Christmas last year, he went to a party with some friends, smoked a ton of weed and then decided to drive. My parents have asked him not to drive while high endless fucking times, that they'd pick him up. But he never listens because he doesn't like that they tell him he needs to cut back on partying and getting high and do something useful with his life.
But on his drive home, he lost control of his car, (He says he doesn't remember exactly how he lost control), spun out and hit a tree off the side of the road above the driver's side door.
He was injured, he hit his head and hurt his neck, and part of the side of the car cut into his leg.  
He called an ambulance and they had to get fire-fighters to cut the door open.
He was taken to hospital and was there for 3 days. He ended up have some fairly serious damage to his calf and knee and now has a slight limp. His neck was in a brace for a while but that's mostly fine now.

But since then he's been acting like he's a fucking veteran who was injured doing something heroic. 
He's posted on Facebook about how he'll never recover from that night and how cruel fate is and other stupid shit. 
My parents are letting him get away with this bullshit, he quit his minimum wage retail job because ""It's too hard with my leg"", but won't work anywhere else. He sits at home playing games, smoking weed, and letting my parents treat him like a toddler. They cook his meals, clean his room, do everything for him and won't say no. They even give him money so he can ""Feel independent"".  Money which just goes to weed, games and Uber eats.  Not to mention they paid his fine for driving under the influence. 

The other night he made another self pitying bullshit post, so I got mad and called him out in the comments. I told him he needed to stop acting like a whiny bitch, and that it was his fault for getting high like a fucking moron and driving. I said he needs to stop sitting at home feeling sorry for himself and do something. 

That's when shit hit the fan. He blocked me on Facebook and deleted the post. His friends messaged me, saying I was an asshole for calling him out like that. 
He told our parents and they told me it was mean and got all upset with me. I told them they need to stop treating him like a baby and make him live with the consequences of his actions. But they won't. 

Am I the asshole for telling people what really happened and telling him to stop being a baby? 

Tl;Dr my brother smoked a ton of weed, tried to drive home, hit a tree, got injured, his a slight limp, now self pitying, refusing to work, living off parents, pretending he's the victim. I call him out and everyone is mad at me.",48,225,0.96
395,Not the A-hole," My partner and I have been together almost 2 years now and money - wise things aren't too bad but also not great. I work 30 - 40 hours a week depending on the week/month and I have been supporting my partner since I started working again after being unwell for a long time. The thing is is that I have always been fully prepared to support her as I knew things weren't good for her before we got together. It's been a struggle but we get by and honestly have it better than alot of people. I make about $900NZD per fortnight after tax and she makes about $400NZD per fortnight which helps alot but still isn't heaps. But again I'm not complaining about any of it. My issue is that recently I checked what we call ""kiwisaver"" and I have been putting in about $250 (I have my % at the highest possible) per fortnight of my own money and my employeer has been putting in around $80 a fortnight. This will eventually help me buy a house, hopefully in the next few years as I'm getting up there . Thing is my partner had no idea I was putting in that much and she has told her family who are now angry with me saying I am the reason we ever struggle and I need to put it down to 2% rather than 8% which would dramatically decrease my contribution . WIBTA if I continued to have my money going into that account at the highest percent ? I understand my partner and her family don't want us to struggle but I also believe buying a home is a priority for me! Reddit help me WIBTA???

EDIT : I also had no idea I was putting in so much money we checked it on a whim recently and were shocked to learn how much was going in and both decided it's alot but 100% worth it for our future it's only since her family found out that it has become a problem.

UPDATE: I'm sorry friends I've been asleep ! We didn't have a chance to talk about anything as I went to my sister's after work yesterday , we ended up having a big fight whilst grocery shopping because I said to her please don't talk about my kiwisaver with your mom it makes me anxious and she didn't take it very well.

396,Not the A-hole,"18 y/o high school senior here. My mom's been abused basically her entire life, including by my dad, and when I was seven my dad started to threaten her with death if she didn't divorce him and move back to the US. He took all of our money so she didn't finish the divorce entirely as we had to flee to live with her parents before we were totally broke. My dad accused her of kidnapping (even though he knew we were leaving), dragged her through US federal and circuit courts, and she was acquitted and got custody. However, he also received mandatory visitation, mandatory phone calls/contact, had to pay no alimony or settlements, and only pays minimal child support ($300/month).

As I've grown up, he and his family have continually denied that any of the abuse happened. His entire extended family insists my mom poisoned me and lied to me even though I witnessed and remember this abuse. However, aside from this, they do try to be good family, paying for flights to visit them, buying me clothes, etc, but their denial of these events really bothers me. Besides, even with a generous estimate of how much they pay (including child support) the amount they contribute still doesn't really cover the cost of raising a child, which my mom's parents have pretty much covered while my mom has been trying to recover from her trauma and find a stable job. My dad and his new wife on the other hand are very well-off, spending a lot of money on private school and expensive clothes for his other kids.

Now, I got into my dream school, and my dad is insisting that if he pays for my college (asking for $15,000 for the first year, even less after that if I become an RA and get the scholarships I applied for), I have to visit with him and his family more and start to distance myself from my mother, which is a non-negotiable for me. My mother is everything to me. He won't acknowledge any of the abuse he perpetrated against her for the eight years they were together, calling both me and her a liar. He keeps criticizing my mom and her parents for not being able to pay more for my college education, and calls my mother a ""lazy"" woman who is the ""source of all of my anxiety"" and has poisoned me.

I have been thinking about telling him that until he pays me back, he can't use my furniture, tv, silverware, etc.  Is this too harsh?

401,Asshole,"So we have this friend who, to put it politely, sucks the oxygen out of whatever room she is in. She talks loudly, rapidly and lengthily, makes every conversation about her, interrupts others, and one-ups people's stories. This is part of the problem. The other part is she is food obsessed. She has struggled with her weight and she often insists she doesn't want anything to eat but then fills her plate.

Recently we had her and her husband over for drinks, appetizers and hockey. We all gathered around the tv on the couch -- except for her. She sat on the floor next to the coffee table where the appetizers/snacks were and pulled up to it like she was sitting at a picnic table. She then started eating like it was her personal meal.

Her husband impassively sipped his beer and watched the game, seemingly oblivious. My wife has some sort of soft spot for her and tends to overlook her oftentimes rude behaviour. I sat there gawking at her for a moment or two, then said ""Hey, think you could save some for the rest of us?"" I meant it in good humour and thought I came across light hearted but she looked at me offended, as did my wife. The husband didn't say anything. 

Later, after they left, my wife gave me royal shit and said that I had clearly embarrassed her. She said I was mean for commenting on her eating knowing that she has had weight struggles in the past, and said it was not my place to say anything. I disagreed and said she was being rude, and, doubling down, said she drives me crazy with her constant talking and domination of conversations. This made my wife even more upset. Everything is awkward and uncomfortable. My wife feels I should apologize. I feel doing so would validate her boorishness. Am I the asshole?


**EDIT: I appreciate the comments and discussion this post has sparked. I think I know the answer. I am the asshole *not* for the *fact* of speaking up, but for the *manner* in which I spoke up.

402,Asshole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about two months and I guess today she got her period. She mentioned it slightly and said something about bleeding through her underwear. 

I asked her to stop talking about it because I thought it was gross.

She told me she understood, but I should know these things since we’re dating.

I told her I didn’t need to know anything about it because I’m not a girl and it’s not my responsibility.

She told me that she understood and would just keep things like that to herself, but her friend called me an asshole.

Edit: we are both 16 

Edit 2: we aren’t sexually active as she is uncomfortable with it. So it doesn’t really seem like it’s my responsibility for what her body goes through. 

Edit 3: okay, I understand now, I am the asshole. I will try my best to maybe learn more about it and keep my mouth shut. I do really like this girl, but it was just something I was grossed out by. But I will start trying to be a better boyfriend.

Thank you for the advice 

Edit 4: I didn’t think this would blow up as much as it did. And I get that I wasn’t being open minded, but I am willing to help her through the pain she feels and buy her snacks and cuddle her into oblivion and all that. Just, if she does complain about bleeding, I hope she keeps it to a minimum.

403,Not the A-hole,"Let me start by saying that I love my wife. We get along, and there is a reason why i married her; because she's awesome.

However, nobody is perfect, including myself. My gripe comes with her attachment to instagram. Normally, a husband being upset his wife is spending too much time on social media would be clearcut: he's not the asshole. But let me explain more.

We both love fitness. I was a personal trainer before we met. Last year, she converted her account into a fitness instagram. She's been very successful. It's a compilation of videos,  posts, and more. It's not a provocative account like those girls who post ass pics. It has substance. I should also note she works a full-time job. Normally, I despise influencers and the whole culture because, by definition, it's a self-absorbed activity.

I get upset because this consumes her. We finish our days, and she'll basically sit on the couch on her phone either posting, answering questions, or putting all of her workout stuff on her Insta stories. It takes time and if i ask something like ""babe can you set the table while i cook?"" she says ""yea"" but does nothing because she is absentminded. I end up doing it all. If we are watching a show, she just stays on her phone. Couple this with the fact she always wants me to take pictures and I get pretty upset. If anyone has seen that Instagram Husband video, that's a hilarious parody.

At this very moment she is standing in the kitchen on her phone when she told me she'd cook. It's been 25 minutes and I hear nothing. She is standing there on the phone.

I've tried setting boundaries.  I've said it gets in the way of our relationship. Sometimes she'll lash out say she's trying to build a blog and that I should be a supportive. Other times, she agrees and puts it away. There is no black/white here.

Last week it turned into a fight. The usual cycle happened. She came home. I cooked dinner while she was glued to the phone. She was on it during dinner, with basic  convo. She was on the phone while we watched the sopranos. It was when we went to bed and she sat on her phone for another hour that i lost it. I became apoplectic an it turned into a huge ordeal. I called her selfish. She countered that there will be times in marriage where I will have to devote large amounts of time to something, and that the other partner should be supportive. This makes sense because I will be starting work at a law firm soon, so I too hope she will be understanding at that time. Still, I am furious because the whole thing is frustrating and I can't tell if I'm being selfish or not.

AITA for demanding (or at least wanting) her to put the damn phone away?",73,175,0.95
404,Not the A-hole,"Hi, before I get into this I'm just gonna admit right now this feels like a weird and petty argument, but maybe I'm just suffering from selfish tunnel vision? 

My SIL is getting married in June. I am a bridesmaid. Huuuge wedding, they went all out... she hasn't been a bridezilla - very kind , but has been definitely picky and strict (she deserves to, it's her wedding).

I've been growing my hair for years and got tired of it. Yesterday, I went from hair down past my butt and had it cut into a short cut, like a pixie. I cut so much of it because I donated to an organization called Wigs For Kids, they make wigs *for free* for children with cancer and alopecia. Overall, I donated 48 inches of hair. I absolutely love it, the hair stylist said it was perfect for my face shape, my fiancé loves it, it's been such a confidence booster.

I posted a picture on instagram today along with a picture of the bundles of hair I sent off to donate. I later get a text from her saying I should have asked before I cut all that hair off as she doesn't think it'll match her extremely feminine designs/decorations, I'm in her wedding party and now will stand out from her and the other girls (they all have long hair too), and wishes I had waited just a month to cut it. 

I literally didn't know how to respond. I've never been in a wedding before and I've never been married, so is this normal? Should I have asked her before making such a dramatic physical appearance change?

TL;DR - cut four feet from my hair a month and a half before my SIL's wedding, she does not like my new look and says I'll stand out, I'm in the wedding party, idk how to respond.

Edit: People are questioning my hair lol. So the hairdresser wrote four feet on the paper she gave me for the donation (she bundled & wrapped the hair), I later opened the package to measure it as it was still in my mailbox and it was about THREE feet of hair, so around 36 inches. She's was good at cutting hair but not math & measuring I guess lmao. 

Also, my SIL and I got dinner and talked. Neither of us are upset, she just said she had a bad day (caterer canceled on her) so my hair was another unexpected surprise related to her wedding and she did overreact. She said she loves the haircut and she's sure it'll look just as great in the floral headbands still. We're all okay now, thanks everyone for the advice :)",385,1990,0.97
405,Not the A-hole,"A couple weeks ago my wife’s parents flew over and stayed with us after we just had a baby. One night while watching the movie *The Patriot*, I asked FIL if he ever thought we’d see a conflict on American soil again. He said that he thinks another civil war will happen because their needs to be a revolution since liberals are destroying our country. This led to him saying something along the lines of, “I’m fearful for my daughters’ and grandchildren’s futures because of you and brother-in-law’s political beliefs. I believe you two are destroying their lives.” I immediately said that was fucked up and offensive. He then said, “I’m sorry, but when I see something that affects my family then I’ll say something.” He repeated the awful thing again, kept calling us socialists, and never apologized. The conversation ended even though I wanted to punch him in the face. 

&#x200B;

One thing to note is that my wife, her sister, BIL, and myself are all college educated, upper middle class, and yes, Democrats.  Our children are well taken care and our wives are our equals.  Raising a family is a team effort.

&#x200B;

The next day I texted BIL what he said. He rightfully gets pissed. Unrelated, the next day after that FIL responds to BIL’s sister’s Facebook post regarding her 2-year old’s cancer journey and how important it is for everyone to have access to medical care without it bankrupting them. He posts, “Brainwashing isn’t natural and neither is Socialism.” He doesn’t even know BIL’s side of the family.

&#x200B;

The next day BIL calls FIL and goes off on him for posting that and about what I told him - calls him an asshole, said he always hated visiting him or having him over, told him to stop sucking Trump’s dick, and a few other things. It ends with them saying they’ll never visit each other again.

&#x200B;

The mother-in-law is now a part of this. Now the focus is on how BIL reacted, what he said, and how I told him what FIL said. I’m now partly at fault for telling BIL what FIL said. What FIL originally said is now forgotten in this drama. My wife and her mom can only talk about what BIL said, and not what FIL said to start it all. I eventually snapped at my wife and told her to give BIL a break since he’s been on an emotional roller coaster because of his 2-year old nephew. I understand that it’s her father that he’s talking about, but for fuck’s sake, he’s an asshole. She thinks BIL should’ve handled it like me.

Background: So, my boyfriend (31) and I (27) have been together for just shy of two years. We've been incredibly happy until now - the first six months I couldn't stop worrying about when the other shoe would drop, but it just never did! We decided to commit, we've signed a lease together and are all set to move in next week.. which leads us to the issue. 

&#x200B;

So my boyfriend works really difficult hours, this last week he's been regularly doing 12+ hours a day. I practically live at his anyway so I thought I'd be helpful and start clearing out the freezer last week. I love him to bits but honestly he's a bit lazy when it comes to upkeep - he had month old courgettes in his fridge that were looking less than great. Anyway, freezer was cluttered (we're going to have to fix this in the new place) and I came across these little bags? They had what looked like white gunk in it, honestly didn't think twice about it, just thought it was an old bag we'd used for peas or something. Chucked it in the bin. 

&#x200B;

Last night I get out of the bath and I have like five missed calls from my boyfriend, obviously I think it must be some sort of emergency, so I ring him back and he is *panicking*. I mean full on panic. I honestly thought he was dying. 

&#x200B;

But then he starts yelling at me about why the freezer is empty and how dare I go through his things and I had no right to do it! Now I'm just really confused and then he says something about throwing away his reserves. 

&#x200B;

Yes, that's right. His *reserves*. 

&#x200B;

I have no idea what he's on about so I ask him and he says he's been saving his sperm in case anything happened and keeping it in the freezer. Honestly, I feel like such a jerk, but it was so ridiculous I just started laughing! I feel so fucking bad about it - but honestly, he genuinely, honest to god thought he could freeze his own sperm in the freezer! Like, surely you would just go to the GP and ask about the process if you're that worried?! 

&#x200B;

He hung up on me and today was really cold - he's messaged me and said maybe we should reconsider living together.

So, I (21F) work in a Accounting Company with my cousin (22F) and part of our job consists of keeping in contact with the owners/representatives of the Business in order to make sure everything is being payed correctly.

One of these owners is, for lack of a better word, a fucking creep. My cousin does his books, which means that she has to talk to him in a daily basis.

It started innocent enough with him complementing her looks or her clothes, but now it has gone too far.  

He always says something along the lines of wanting to marry her (mind you, he’s already married and is in his mid 50s), send messages and selfies on her personal number, and most recently sent a long and disgusting audio commenting on a pic she posted of her wearing a bikini, mostly saying that she’s hot, he would love to be with her, and he can’t believe how beautiful she is. 

Also, every time he comes by the office he looks at her like she’s a piece of meat - literally does the ‘looking up and down’ her whole body thing, and he’s so obvious about it that it became a joke in the office “here come de creepy dude to eat her out with his eyes!” 

Well, he would always say that one day he will come and have lunch with her, we never expected that to really happen, but boy, were we wrong. 

Today he showed up right when we were leaving for lunch, my cousin freaks out and tells our supervisor that she’s not dealing with this right now and he stalls  him until she leaves, practically running down the stairs, she’s shaking and sweating,  we even went to another restaurant so we wouldn’t bump into him.  

She is really scared of that guy, he makes her super uncomfortable, this has been happening for the past year and an half but only escalated to things like this in the last 6 months. 

I already told her to talk to HR and have his business transferred to someone else, but she says “it’s fine, he’s a client and there’s nothing much we can do” 

I know our boss takes this super seriously and would never allow one of the clients to continue doing this with his employees, but she doesn’t want me bringing this to him.

I asked why she wasn't given an invite and he said it was because we hadn't been together long enough for her to be considered an automatic invite.

For context, we have been together for almost 2 months now. It pisses me off because all of my friends will have their partners there. I told him that if my girlfriend isn't good enough for an invite, then neither was I, and said I wouldn't be coming. My friend got quite upset at me for this and told me I was being silly. He said they could try and squeeze her in if it meant so much to me, but I told him to shove it. I don't want her to be thought of as just an afterthought or an inconvenience.

A bunch of my friends are upset with me now. They are upset that I won't be there (we don't get to see each other too often anymore) and that I was potentially burning bridges over something so insignificant. My girlfriend said she is ok with not being able to go, but for me, it's the principal of the matter.

Am I the asshole for standing firm on this?

EDIT: To clarify, for those suggesting otherwise, the couple HAVE met her twice before, and they got on well. Particularly his fiance.

Also, for those saying +1s are only for couples together more than a year, I know for a fact that 2 of my friends who have only been in relationships for around 4-5 months, BOTH got automatic invites for their significant others. Neither of them live together. My relationship apparently falls under some bullshit cutoff timeframe.

EDIT 2: I get it, I'm an asshole. If only the invites came out a month later, because then we would count as a 'real relationship' apparently and she would probably get an invite.",592,1089,0.88
410,Not the A-hole,"So I(26m) own a condo where i live, and have had a roomate(31m) here for 2 months. I went out of town for 2 weeks on a business trip and left my roomate 200$ To water my plants. I really fuckig love those plants and have nurtured one of them for over a decade. When i came back many had died and they were all clearly uncared for. 

I was livid and frankly really sad, and when i talked to my roomate he said he watered them and refused to give me the money back. My state is a no cause eviction state so i gave him the court mandated 30 day notice and told him to find a new spot asap. When i was telling him i was definitely emotional, and could of handled the whole thing better, but I was just really upset. 

Now he is saying i am a shit person and rent was too high and everything else. He also made a post on social media about the whole thing.

AITA?


Edit asking for info:
Some of the plants were complex to take care of, including some that require a specific temperature range be maintained and others requiring non direct watering etc..

411,Not the A-hole,"I'm (38F) on a small trivia team that always does pretty well in the 8 or so years we've been going - usually showing up an hour early to get a table and food. One of the women on our team Laurie (35F) joined when she moved to the neighborhood a few years ago (we were all friends prior). 

Recently Laurie has had two kids (4 and 2) and she views this as her ""mom's night out"" except she never stops talking about her kids when she's there unless it is to talk about her favorite baseball team. The rest of us (a married couple 32M/F and myself + whomever I may be dating at the time) are all child-free and perfectly happy about it (probably helped by the fact that we're listening to her stories of her kids all the time) and only I am a baseball fan, albeit for a cross-town rival and much more casually. 

My eyes pretty much glaze over any time she starts on one of her lengthy stories about how fascinating her kids are, but I try to be polite. And I've had dates comment on it afterwards that ""Wow, she really only talks about her kids, huh?"" One night I walked home with her in total silence while she talked about her kids just to see if she would notice or try to engage me at all about ANYTHING else. She didn't. The couple and I routinely joke about it when she's not around, but she's still our friend and we haven't wanted to say anything because we knew it would hurt her feelings.

Cecilia - the other woman on the team - and I recently started planning a trip to Paris in June and have been excited to discuss new ideas for our trip when we meet up, occasionally with off-topic interruptions about Laurie's kids or Laurie's baseball team. I've been conscious of the fact that it's not something she is really interested in so we don't let it dominate, but it's hard to avoid it as a topic. Usually if we're not talking about something she cares about Laurie will be following a baseball game on her phone instead of talking and that's how it's been with this. Today we received a text message asking us to tone down the talk of our trip because it's ""bumming her out"". I took some time to calm down and edit my response so that I didn't flat out insult Laurie or her kids:
> 
 ""Respectfully, I get that it's not something you are interested in, but by extension that could include many of the regular topics at dinner in which I have no interest, but tolerate because I know they are things you care about. Considering that this is something I care about a lot and that our trip will be over and done with in 3 months, listening to us occasionally discuss it over 10 more nights doesn't seem like it's asking too much."" 

Laurie's response is that the time spent on the topic has been growing steadily and she will just show up later to trivia because she doesn't like being excluded and ""actively alienated"" by something she can't participate in.

**Edit:** Thanks everyone for the perspective. We had trivia last night and the entire conversation was not discussed (I know how much you guys like communication and therefore this is probably something you will not approve of) But no children or travel plans were brought up either. It was thankfully not awkward. Some more info: Laurie is not a Stay-at-Home-Mom, she has a job, and adult coworkers and friends that she sees regularly so this is not her only socialization with people. Also, while we are long-term friends, we are definitely not ""go on vacation together"" level friends.

Today two more people joined the group, and asked my classmate L if anyone could give them a ride. He said ""oh [my name] can pick you up at your house at 6am, no problem"". I wasn't even asked! It's starting to get on my nerves, WIBTA if I told them I'm not bloody Uber?",20,28,0.91
419,Not the A-hole,"I volunteer with a local organization as a ""friend"", meaning I spend a couple of hours every week or two weeks with someone who's lonely and doesn't have much human contact. My current ""client"" is an elderly (over 90) man, who is almost confined to his apartment due to having trouble walking.

I was assigned to him because of some shared interests, but also because he had asked for his friend to be female. He has been widowed for decades, and the person he's had most contact with is his own son. At first he treated me like any other person, but recently I've been uncomfortable with how he's been acting. It's getting to the point where I'm considering ending the friendship, but I think I might be overreacting.

At first it was just him being happy with me being comfortable enough to just get things out of cupboards for our weekly tea without him pointing out what's where. Then he started to sometimes tell me I look nice. A few times he has asked for a hug. Last week I took off my hoodie and wore just my t-shirt and he told me I ""looked so nice it was bad for him"". This week he told me how nice it was that I have long hair, and how lovely it is to have someone feminine around (even though I'm not. I wear t-shirts, hoodies and jeans and no makeup at all). Later he called me and told me he was sitting on his balcony in the sunshine, imagining that he was on a beach vacation and that I was sitting next to him wearing a swimsuit.

I'm not all right with this. He comes up with something new every week, and I just don't want to go anymore. But he's an old man and very much a ""product of his time"", and probably thinks he's making me happy with his compliments to me. And I guess I would be flattered if I didn't have rather severe issues with my body image and even my gender identity (my post history is mostly about those...). But he's just trying to be polite, and having a bit of fun and playing at being young and dashing again. I feel like I'm seriously overreacting and should loosen up and play along even if I don't want to. 

I'm seriously considering just calling our volunteer coordinator and telling I want to change clients (or have a break from volunteering), but WIBTA? There is a shortage of volunteer friends, so the old man would most likely become horribly lonely again the way he was before I started to visit him and he doesn't really deserve that. 

Edited to add: I've told him an occasional hug is ok, but told him the swimsuit comment was not appreciated. I've also started to make sure I keep my hoodie on and zipped however hot his apartment is. He has started to ask about my ""boundaries"" recently, and I don't even like hearing that word as it makes me think of either BDSM or a sugar baby/sugar daddy relationship.",38,35,0.88
420,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit, posting from a throwaway because my other account is all about my major and work. I’m a student at a large state school majoring in botany.

I am half black, raised very middle class, like metal instead of rap and skateboarding. 
 
Everyone on the trip is white except for this dude “James” who is also black. James is basically on the “flowers for jocks” program that my advisor sponsors because he’s a huge football fan. James is a piece of shit and I think his goal is to fuck as many white Arizonan girls as he can. 

Here’s the issue, all of my classmates, being the well meaning liberal students that they are think that James and should be friends. Whenever the travel plans are made, they put me in the same Range Rover as him, same hotel room as him and same dig group as him. When I’ve asked the person who’s job it is to not do this, they’ve said things like “you guys look like you’d be friends.” I don’t have the heart to tell them how fucking racist that is.

I have been very trusting with her and agreed to let her live in the dorms even though the university is well within driving distance. As a result she is open with me. A while back, Lauren came to me saying she wanted to go on the pill. I asked her why and she hesitantly told me that her and her boyfriend (he's 15, not some college boy thank God) were having sex and they used protection, but she didn't want to risk getting pregnant. I wanted to scream. The girl is 14. I sat her down and told her that I was happy she came to me and that she could go on the pill, but I didn't think she was emotionally mature enough for sex. She argued that if she was emotionally mature enough for college she was emotionally mature enough for sex, that it was her body and I couldn't do anything about it. I disagree. Lauren is extremely intelligent for her age, but she is still only 14 years old and not old enough to realize this could hurt her. So I told her that she was not allowed to go to her boyfriend's house when his parents weren't home and since I had no other way of enforcing this (again, she lives at school) I would be tracking her phone. She said okay and walked away. Lauren living at school makes it impossible for me to enforce rules and follow through on punishments. Lauren and I hardly ever butt heads so this has never been a problem before. I can track her phone all I want but she could just leave it in her dorm and that's exactly what happened. I found out that she was going behind my back and going to her boyfriend's. I've thought about talking to his parents but from what I can tell they're pretty apathetic.

We have always been close and my parents have always been supportive of most of what Will and I have chosen to do. They have never been vocal about lgbt things except passing comments like “Oh they are so cute together” and things like that. 

Well, Will came to visit me after school let out three days ago and in a flurry of tears said that he was gay and how I’m the only one who knows and that nothing will ever be the same and that he just wishes he could die so he wouldn’t have to “go through all of this.” I know that he is bullied at school a lot for being quiet so I’m sure this is what is on his mind about being gay and his classmates bullying him even more. 

Obviously I was super concerned when he told me this and since I live on the other side of the city, I offered him to stay at my place for the night. 

The whole night I didn’t sleep because I was worried about his safety. I got up a few times in the night and checked on him sleeping just to make sure he was okay. I spent all night tossing and turning and trying to decide what to do. 

The next morning I drove him to school and he didn’t say anything except for thanks for the ride and he made me promise not to tell anyone.

427,Not the A-hole,"We will be heading into our sophomore year of college, and sharing a dorm room that has 2 rooms with 2 people in each room, plus a living room and kitchen. 

We got into one of the nicest dorms on campus that is hard to get into, because I entered and won a lottery (in which the prize is priority housing) by spending hours entering my name into the raffle, while none of the other three did. For reference, the number that they were assigned was in the thousands- without me winning the good lottery number, there is NO WAY they would have even had a chance of getting placed in this nice dorm.

While visiting our room for next year a few weeks ago, we noticed that one of the two rooms is larger than the other. While we haven’t talked formally yet, my roommate and I said that we should get the bigger room because without my effort to get the room we wouldn’t even be in it, and also, I am an athlete and have to report to school a month before everyone else and stay longer as well, even over holiday breaks. 

The suite mates said that they should get the larger room because my roommate has a boyfriend who will probably (their words, not mine) be over all the time and I will not want to be around him, so I will seek refuge in their room, so it makes sense that they should get it (I happen to be very good friends with roommates BF, so this most likely wouldn’t even be an issue). 

I don’t agree with this sentiment at all- that is a theoretical situation, whereas my reasoning is concrete. And honestly, I thought that is was typical that the person with the higher lottery number gets to choose their room. 

I plan to talk to them soon, but would like to know first- would I be the asshole if I claim the larger room without doing something more 50/50 such as drawing for it, even though I will be spending much more time in the room and am the reason that we got the room in the first place?",36,62,0.97

440,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit!

For those who don’t know, misophonia is basically a sound sensitivity. For the majority of people, it’s chewing. Some have it way more severe than others. My husband has had it for basically his whole life, but it’s really only come about more seriously since we started dating.

We can barely eat meals together anymore unless there’s TV or music blaring – I like to talk during dinner and I can’t do that when there’s something on in the background, loudly. If I want a snack before bed, I have to eat in a different room or let the food it in my mouth until the enzymes break it down until it’s mush. If I accidently let the tines of my fork or the sides of my spoon touch my teeth, it’s the absolute worst thing.

I do my best to avoid these things. I try to not eat crunchy foods when he’s around. I do my best to make sure there’s something on while I eat. I naturally swallow very loudly no matter how much I drink and he always tells me I’m doing it on purpose (literally not, I’ve always swallowed loudly, it’s just the way my muscles are, I can’t do it any more quietly, I’ve tried). I’ve been trying for three years but every single time I make a mistake, I’m met with glares and “stop, you know that affects me.” I’ve absolutely passive aggressively walked out of the room to eat somewhere else and I know that’s probably not the best reaction, but I can’t chew any quieter?!

We were getting ready for bed last night and I asked if he had thought about seeing someone about it. There’s no definitive “cure” but there are some coping techniques and I thought that he may be open to at least seeing someone once to see what options there may be. Nope.  Turned into a short fight (it was late and we were both tired, so we dropped it). We’ve tried to figure things out before but the only solution we’ve ever come up with is loud music and nothing crunchy (I like salad, god forbid).

He texts me after he left for work this morning basically saying that I need to stop making him feel guilty. I told him that I’m not doing it on purpose, but that his misophonia affects me too. I just want to have a meal with my husband. I want to be able to fill my contacts case without him angrily leaving the room (this is a new one that I just learned about this morning). I want to not me glared at when I eat a chip out of the same bag he’s eating.

I understand that it affects him and it’s pretty serious. I do my absolute best to avoid the things that avoid him, but am I unreasonable in thinking that it’s okay to say that it also affects me? I’m not perfect, sometimes I make mistakes, I don’t think expecting 100% compliance is reasonable. I just want to eat a meal with my husband without constantly worrying that I'm a problem.

Am I the asshole here?  


EDIT: Thanks for all the replies, I really appreciate it. I'm going to talk to him tonight and remind him that I know how much it affects him, but that he needs to realize that I can't constantly walk on eggshells. I also sent an email to a local audiologist that specializes in tinnitus and misophonia to get some more information on how their treatment works to see if he would be more willing to go if I've already done the leg work.

EDIT 2.0/MINI UPDATE: again, thank you everyone. We had a short talk last night (he had a crappy day at work and I had the start of a migraine, so we weren’t in the best headspace to have a real conversation). We both agree that we need to work on this. We’re going to work on making essentially a list of what the triggers are and how we can best avoid them. He’s going to work on being okay with just music and not reacting so quickly and angrily and I’m going to work on not getting so upset when he does have a reaction because the sounds do truly hurt him. I briefly brought up the kid thing and he says as of now, he doesn’t see a problem. He hasn’t had problems around our friends kids and his niece/nephew, but if issues do come up, we’ll work on tackling it together. I’ll bring up the audiologist/therapy again when I a) hear back from the clinic and b) once we really give properly trying and working together a shot.

I’ve known this girl for around 3 years and other than the light flirtatious messages she sent me in the very beginning nothing has really happened between us. On the evening prior to the incident, she said she had broken up with her boyfriend and was in a bad emotional state. She said she didn’t want to travel all the way to where she was put up and asked if she could spend the night in my room. I said yes. Later that night we had a couple of drinks with our common friends and went into our rooms by midnight. She then proceeded to change into her nightdress in front of me. I tried to look away but it happened very suddenly and everything that was meant to be seen, had been seen. I ignored this and proceeded to immerse myself into my phone. She was wearing this black crop top and a lace white panty which I won’t lie was extremely fucking hot. My room had a queen bed so I tried to sleep as close to one edge as possible. Right as we were about to sleep she started talking to me about sex including topics like how her boyfriend only lasted 2 minutes and how she was part of the reason because she was reaaaly good and how she had been in threesomes before. I told her to stop talking about it to which she just laughed and we slept.
Morning at around 9 am we woke up at the same time. She told me how she didn’t want to get out of bed because it was so comfy and made some of the most seductive sounds and poses ever. I won’t lie, this is when I got an erection. I hid it with my blanket and tried to sleep some more. This is when she came closer to me and slept next to me in a little spoon position and put her butt very close to my crotch. I knew she could feel my erection but she was okay with it. Every few seconds she kept moving her but closer and closer. She then took my hand and kept it on her bare stomach. She asked me to gently rub it and I did as I was told. This happened for around 90 minutes. I waited 90 minutes to make sure she wanted to do the deed before I made any move. 90 minutes in she made it more obvious and started moaning. This is when I said fuck it and slid my hand up her T-shirt to feel her boobs. She immediately removed my hand, did the no sign with her finger, got out of bed and went into the bathroom. I didn’t know what the fuck happened and was in complete shock. To avoid the awkward situation I told my actual roommate to come back to my room and he did just that. After this the girl left in some time and mater that day when we met at the event she hugged and kissed me like nothing happened. 

Can someone explain to me what the fuck happened? Did I force myself on a girl? Did I take advantage of a situation? I’ve been feeling like a real piece of shit since then. This has never happened to me and I don’t know what to think of it.",50,52,0.89
442,Not the A-hole,"My roommate recently bought a memory foam mattress for 500cad which for her is pretty expensive. Recently she accidentally locked my cat in her room for about 7-8 hours and he peed on the mattress. It completely soaked through it and she doesn't feel like she can salvage it. She is saying that because it is my cat I should pay for it. I'm offering to pay half because yes it is my cat however I don't feel like it's my fault that she locked him in her room. She is saying that I should have heard him meow but I was either sleeping or had my headphones in and playing a game. I really don't feel like her locking him in her room is my fault and I feel like paying half is more than fair.

For information my cat is very independent and it's very common for me to not see him unless he wants to be seen so him not being in my vision for a few hours is normal.

445,Not the A-hole,"My brother and his wife are looking to adopt internationally. My SIL is very eager to become a mother and has already begun picking out potential baby names. She shared some of the names with me and wanted to hear what I thought. They were all traditionally Chinese names (I'm assuming since that's where they're adopting from). I don't remember all of them but one of them was Wang Shu, which is (she tells me) a god from Chinese mythology. I thought all the names were beautiful, and it sounds like my SIL put a lot of time into picking them, but I thought it was kind of strange that put an effort to pick only Chinese names. When they had been trying for baby before, my SIL was very vocal about wanting to name their child Evelyn if it was a girl, after both their grandmothers. I said something like ""These names are really pretty, but I thought you were dead-set on Evelyn."" She said she wanted to give her daughter a name that would ""reflect her culture"". I've never heard of anyone doing this before and I thought it was interesting. I told her this. I didn't say the word weird so the title of this post is a little misleading, but my tone may have implied it and what she took it as. She didn't seem upset at the time, but an hour ago I got a phone call from my brother and apparently she is very upset. AITA? Should I apologize?

Disclaimer: I wasn't trying to persuade her to give their daughter a more common name. I just think it doesn't make sense to name your kid something different based solely on ethnicity.

448,Not the A-hole," My husband and I began looking at getting away from the city a few years ago. We had a small checklist: husband wanted permanent running water, I wanted a house. We looked at many properties before we stumbled across this one by a fluke. It has two permanent creeks and a small house and is absolutely perfect. The property runs adjacent to a national park so it will always remain secluded. We both instantly fell in love and even though it was quite out of our budget, our parents both loved it as well and helped us purchase it. The property itself is almost 100 acres and is the very last house on the dirt road. (Also, I should mention that the seller of the property was an elderly man who only used this place as a weekender and owned his permanent home in the city)

One of the main things that drew us to this place is the permanent creeks. They are full of swimming holes and one of the best ones even had a rope tied to the tree. Real estate agents said that a few local kids had used it because previous owner was never there and didn’t mind. 

The road turns into an easement to get to the national park entrance and the creek line is the boundary of our property to the national park. The swimming hole in question is about midway between the easement and our house. Over the years, this swimming hole has become well known to the locals and there is a path that has been made to get to this swimming hole that is on our property.  

We certainly didn’t like the idea of strangers walking so near the house so Husband puts up a wire fence across the path and a no trespassing sign. Within days of putting it up, a woman walks around the fence and to our house to yell at us saying that she has been walking this path and swimming for 30 years. We politely tell her that it is private property and just because the old owners didn’t mind doesn’t mean we do as well. Less than a week after this incident, somebody posts about the fence in our local suburb Facebook group and while many people were angry, many understood as well. We’re not asking people to not swim. We don’t own the water, we’re just asking people to go to the national park side to access the swimming hole (because we DO own right up to the waters edge). However, about another week later, our sign is stolen and the wire fence is cut. We have made it very clear what our reasoning is. We purchased this property for privacy and so far, people are more invasive than if we had purchased in the city. Just today, I was out mowing (we haven’t replaced the sign or fence yet) and 3 girls come walking from this path and walk directly across the front paddock, essentially our front yard. Am I the A-hole for wanting to protect my privacy? 

Tldr; The access to a really awesome swimming hole, that has been used for generations, is on our property and we don’t want people trespassing to get to it.

We haven’t sought any legal advice and I doubt we will.

450,Not the A-hole,"My SO is borrowing a laptop from me, but it's my second laptop and it's a bit slow so she prefers to use mine.

So, while I was just getting settled for a mid-afternoon nap (been working a lot lately...), she put the second laptop at the end of the bed, to the right of my feet, and got in on my left and started using my primary one. Which is fine, obviously I wasn't using it.

I couldn't get to sleep, since it's the middle of the day I don't know what else I expected, so I turned over and stretched my legs out and heard the loud thunk sound of macbook hitting (edit: laminated) floor. The cold metal on the sole of my foot in the process alerted me immediately to what had happened, and I looked at her somewhat exasperated and said (admittedly, probably with my voice raised, though it wasn't intentional, but I was in a state of shock/disbelief/panic) ""why on *Earth* did you leave it there?""

Her response was that it was clearly my fault for kicking it off, how was she supposed to know I would 'fling my legs out' (her words), she was just leaving it there to charge, I'm childish for being unable to take responsibility for my mistakes.

This made me angry, so I snatched my primary laptop back off of her, we had an argument about whose fault it was (no name calling or anything, nothing mean, just me giving my POV and her repeating what I wrote above with our voices raised). She stormed out. 

So, I'll be honest, I don't think I am TA but maybe I'll get some perspective here. AITA?

Edit: I wrote ""second laptop"" all the way through, but it actually belongs to one of my friends. He kindly lent us his second laptop while hers is currently unavailable. Maybe that explains better why I was pretty panicked.

He's dating my best friend who wants to be abstinent until marriage. They've only been seriously dating for a few weeks now. But they def liked each other for longer.

This is the same guy who had a competition with his friends over who can get the most head in a month. The hotter the girl, the more points. This is the guy who will laugh and brag over scratch marks on his back. He HAS cheated on girls in the past.

She is very religious and will not have sex until marriage. She's 19 and hasn't had her first kiss yet. She says that her first kiss needed to be with someone who she cares about. Her first KISS needs to special to her. She got so mad when her prom date tried to kiss her, because of that boundary she had. I have never seen her more upset and she LIKED him. We're best friends and I know all her values on sex and romance. They are very important to her. There are guys she really crushed on that liked her back. She never gave them a chance because of her values.

He's going to break her heart, I know it. Even if he doesn't, shit will go up in flames. Then I will be caught between the two people I care about the most. I don't want them to be unhappy. This is a bad thing. They are NOT sexually compatible. I know he can't wait. 

He knows about her abstinence till marriage thing. He keeps saying that he doesn't care and it doesn't matter to him. That he likes her too much and he's willing to respect that. He does not see another girl for him and has never felt this way about a girl before. But like, he's only saying this now.

She was telling that she wants to have her first kiss with him soon but she wants to wait for the right moment, so it's sweet and special. I told her that was cute and asked her if she ever planned on doing anything more. She asked if I was asking about her abstinence. She said it's a core value of hers and she will never change that for anyone, no matter what. I asked if she thought my brother was okay with that. I asked how she thought that'd work out or how long she thought he was willing to wait. She just changed the topic.

Apparently she texted him later saying that she was worried if they were a good idea and asked if he was sure he was okay with her abstinence.

When I saw him, he screamed at me. He's furious with me for trying so ""sabotage"" his relationship. That I'm being selfish and need to mind my own business. My concerns about being caught in the middle are selfish. He said I'm bored. He cussed me out. He was so mad at me. He called a bitch and everything.

We have targets to hit in this business and one of them is team members absense. This one agent had been absent for about 50% of his rostered days but always seemed legitimately sick and followed all the rules with letting us know supplying documentation etc.... 

Well, when I found out we had to let some people go he was literally the first person who came to mind. So i let him go.

Recently, we were watching a popular television show from my home country (he is from a different country). Never before has a television show from my country been internationally popular, so maybe I’m being overly sensitive because of this, but I asked him extra-nicely if he would please be quite while it’s on, as it is culturally very important to me and is only on for 20 minutes.

He talked the whole way through it and then called me selfish when I told him to please PLEASE be quiet, just for 20 minutes because I didn’t want to miss any dialogue.

455,No A-holes here,"So I've been vegan for over 4 years now. At every family event I have to bring my own plate from home (2 hr drive) and just warm it in the microwave. I dont 100% mind that, but a lot of the dishes are vegetarian and would be vegan if they just substituted or left out the butter. I've had people I barely know be more accommodating, it just feels like I'm unwelcome when they cant even have vegan salad. But I still always go to see family.

This Easter though, they want everyone to pay $30 (each) to go to a fancy buffet. Most of the money is going towards getting some roast beef or something. The only stuff I can have is the fruits and maybe the vegetables if they dont have butter. I wouldnt even spend that amount at a vegan restaurant, let alone a place where I'll definitely be left unsatisfied. Others have offered to pay, but it's the same problem, I dont want other people paying for me to be unsatisfied either.

I know it's not everyones cup of tea, but i figure that people can just unfollow, unfriend or mute me if they don't want to see it.  A lot of my friends have actually been really supportive, and curious on why i decided to get involved in activism, and some have even decided to go vegan after hearing my reasons. However, some people get really weird about it, and tries to start arguments lol. 

  
A few months ago i was out with the same group of friends, and this guy (John,24M) found something resembling a beak in his nuggets. He was super grossed out, and demanded a full refund, and he hasn't eaten chicken since.

Story: So this weekend i went out with my friends to eat at a burger joint. I ordered a vegetarian burger, with no cheese in order to make it vegan. When the burger came i noticed that they had added the cheese, so i asked the waiter if they could remake it. He said it was no problem, and took the burger away.   


So i can't remember the real conversation word for word, but i'm gonna do my best to paraphrase it.   


John: Why would you send the burger away, that's such a waste of food  
Me: It's not what i ordered, i don't want to eat cheese  
John: Isn't it kind of hypocritical that you say you care about the environment, and then throw food away?  


Me: Dude, you're eating beef. Besides,  it's more of an ethical thing. I think cheese is gross, i don't want it in my food.   


John: Chill, it's just cheese. Why are you acting like you're better than everyone else?  


Me: You're the one who started it. I don't want breastmilk in my food, just like you didn't want a beak in your food.   


John: That's different though, it was more like a sanitary issue. People eat animals and their products, that's how it is. Are you gonna get mad at a Lion for eating a gazelle?   


Me: I'm pretty sure lions don't get their panties in a twist when they find out that their food used to have a face.   


John: Oh fuck off. You're the reason nobody likes vegans.   


After that, the discussion kind of ended, but the mood was pretty awkward. I feel kind of bad for ruining the mood, but on the other hand, i feel like John was the agresseor here. I don't think i said anything that was way out of line. If you're that offended by finding parts of a bird in your food, then maybe you should reconsider eating mashed up dead birds, lol.  


The other friends who were with us are kind of split. Some of them think that John should have stayed out of my business, and some of them think i was being too defensive.

I love my grandpa and I want to help him, but I don’t want to continue to feed his habit of asking people to help him for free because I think it’s very disrespectful. This is my job, in a sense.

460,Asshole,"I went out with my friends to a local pub a few weeks back, this pub is child-friendly so there were a few kids around. I genuinely have no problem with child-friendly establishments so am not one to kick up a fuss unless my enjoyment is effected.

I'm having a bit of a sweary conversation with my friends and someone walks up to our table and asks me to keep the language down because of their kids. I reply that this is a pub and I'll speak to my friends how I would normally speak to them. They say they're not comfortable with the language, I repeat that it's a pub and I will speak to my friends like an adult, and they're welcome to go somewhere else if they don't want to hear swearing. At this point they say that the pub is child friendly and I should behave appropriately, I reply that yes it's child friendly but it's still a pub and pubs are for adults, and if they want a child-orientated environment where there will be no swearing there are plenty of those available.

The argument ended there and they went back to their table. My friends were pretty split down the middle about the whole thing and a little embarrassed, I don't regret standing my ground. I maintain that I have no problem with children, hell I love children, but I resented being made to feel like I had to be on my best behaviour in an environment intended for adults where the whole point is that you unwind.

Edit for clarity:  I live in the UK and it's extremely rare to find a truly ""non child-friendly"" pub or bar where children are not allowed (usually the most you get is not at the bar or not after a certain time), it's pretty much expected by default that pubs/bars will welcome children. The pub in question is our favourite in the area with by far the best food and beer selection, hence why I didn't want to go somewhere else.

Might as well add this because I've clarified it for someone else:  It was after work hours on a Friday night. It's a fairly standard pub layout, bar at the back with a smattering of booths/tables. We were sat near the bar. I really don't remember what swear words I was using, I don't believe I was being all that loud - My partner was there and she usually reigns me in if she feels I'm being too loud.

Background:
I’m a 17 y/o transman. (It’s relevant, promise.) My mother sits in bed 6 days a week, does nothing but smoke pot and go on Facebook. My father, while he does work 70 hours a week and supplies the majority of money for my family, is an alcoholic and avid coke & meth user. (I don’t have anything inherently against drug users, but it’s different bc they’re my parents.) I have maybe 1 home cooked meal a week, otherwise it’s fast food or frozen meals. 

I’m not allowed to have a job or have a bank account, but I have both behind their backs. They’re not abusive in any way, they don’t verbally abuse me or lay their hands on me, but they’re far from being good parents.

When at home I’m deadnamed/misgendered, unless they’re making fun of my preferred name/pronouns. When they’re at school (the school knows I’m trans), it’s the correct name/pronouns. I’ve going to a clinician for support for my transgenderism, which my parents organised, so I know they’re not against me being trans. At the clinician it’s he/him, but when we leave it’s back to ‘normal’. When confronted about it, both of them just say “We’re not ready to call you Nate yet.”

They’re REALLY good at keeping up appearances. Our house has a lot of pretty expensive stuff (my parents both have the newest iPads, we all have access to Netflix and YouTube Premium, etc.) Yet I have trouble finishing necessary items around my house like clothes or toiletries. I have asked for necessities rather than luxuries, and have been very open about the fact that I need things like clothes and toiletries, with no response other than “Don’t be selfish. You’ve got a roof over your head.” I buy my own clothes now, but back when I was 14 or 15 and I couldn’t get a job, it was really annoying to have one outfit to wear every day.

Using the money from my job I’ve earned about $2300, and have been in contact with a friend’s father about a little apartment I could rent for pretty cheap. We’re talking about me moving once I’ve become a legal adult in May. We’ve talked about moving in on the 20th, 2 days after my 18th birthday.

Now the wedding in India - it’s important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the UK so I’d love for them to see me get married. 

The problem comes with the menu - in a Hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don’t serve meat. You just don’t. In fact, what’s served at a wedding is something called a [sadya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhya). It’s fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. My wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family ‘won’t be able to cope’ without meat. I’m of the opinion that they’re all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it’s that bad run to a KFC after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. It’s also not like there won’t be any meat - there’ll be non veg food at the Sangeet, there’ll be meat at the reception. 

Also during the English wedding I sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being Hindus don’t partake, but I told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

So, WIBTA for not wanting meat at the wedding?",1963,14878,0.89

467,Not the A-hole,"As background: Her brother was a heroin addict and was clean for 20 years before relapsing through stealing their mother’s (my
grandmother’s) pain meds.

I’m 25 and live away from home.  My mother raised me alone after being widowed when I was 14.   I found out recently she has access to my trust fund bank statement (I know how much Reddit hates TF kids but bear with me.)  With that said, it also might be worth saying the trust comes from my deceased father and not her.

I was diagnosed bipolar and borderline about two years ago.  I’ve been medicated ever since and it’s been the best decision I’ve ever made.  My life has changed immensely and vastly improved because it has stabilized me.  I’ve enrolled in grad school and committed to what I want to do.

I will admit that I turned to drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism a bit before I was diagnosed.     After this she sent me to a new psychiatrist who specialized in drug abuse and concluded that it wasn’t a drug issue but just an untreated mental illness that caused me to turn to “alternate remedies.”  This was over two years ago.

My mom texted me a few days ago worried about me spending too much in a month.  She is demanding a drug test.  I have not done any since being medicated and admitted to her that I had some down days where, instead of substance abuse, I turned to shopping.  I also agreed to a plan to have her help in managing my money.  I know this is still not the healthy route, but it’s a slight improvement. 

My mom has now flipped out and is demanding a drug test even though I admitted to her my spending issues.  I’ve made mistakes but I’m also a different person and an adult who makes her own choices.  I have communicated with her (as per what my therapist advised) that it’s not about the test but the hurt she’s causing me by A) not trusting me B) constantly comparing me to her junkie brother C) making me feel like a child and not in charge of my own life.

AITA to refuse this test on the basis of these things?  I know it will give her “peace of mind” and she’s valid for being worried on the basis of her brother and because she knows I recreationally used drugs in college.   I also feel like submitting to it jeopardizes my self-esteem because I’m playing into her paranoia.  It’s something I’ve worked on so hard and feels invalidating that she doesn’t trust that.  That may sound stupid but I’ve worked so hard to change my life and being accused of this really stings.

I know it’d be simple for me to take a test and would “ease her mind” but it just feels so degrading after I’ve worked so hard.

So AITA?

TLDR:  Was undiagnosed BPD and bipolar and recreationally drank and did drugs.  Was honest with my mom and later proven to have no issues with drug abuse.  Am currently clean.  My mom is now demanding a drug test because I “spent too much to be clean” last month.",91,141,0.94
468,No A-holes here,"Long story short-ish, 

I went shopping today for my boyfriend's birthday, he is 21 tomorrow. I picked him out two very nice t shirts, and a beautiful spring north face jacket. 

He has gained alot of weight, and is overweight, and I know how self conscious he is, and latley since he's been over weight he's been dressing quite slobby, sweat pants and a crew neck hoodie usually. I usually have to specifically tell him to go put jeans on if we're going somewhere. He won't go shopping for new clothes because he gets depressed and he says he will go once he loses weight. 

Although I hate it, I understand because he is not comfortable and lots of his clothes don't fit. I am pretty averaged sized, just shy of  5'5 and about 140 pounds, he is 6'3 and about 290, so  I have been very frustraded with him not making an effort and continuing to not try to lose the weight because it is affecting my sexual attraction to him as well as us being able to go out and do fun things as a couple, due to him him being self conscious. 

Anyways, I thought instead of a new watch and shoes like I was originally going to get him, I thought maybe a couple new shirts and a nice jacket would be a great idea, since he has no clothes that fit him right now. I made sure to get everything in the proper size so he would not feel upset or embarassed when he tried them on and they didint fit. 

As soon as he opened the gift, his face dropped and he said you know I don't want clothes it just makes me depressed..and I said well these are going to fit you good! And look how nice this coat is. It's going to look great. 

He got very upset and was trying not to be angry at me and said  take it back, and was being pretty rude about it (which I guess I understand because he is so sensitive about this)  I was clearly upset and he apologized a couple minutes later  and said thank you anyway, but I could tell he was still angry and upset. 

He says he told me to not get him clothes, which he did, but in my defence he told me after I got the clothes when he knew I was out shopping for his gift. I figured I'd keep what I picked out because he'd appreciate a couple new nice things to wear that fit him . 

I feel really bad I made him feel shitty, but at the same time I got him these things because like I said, I thought he'd like having a couple new nice pieces of clothing to wear until he decides to be committed to losing the weight he needs to lose. 

Just like anyone else,. I know what it's like to be self conscious but not to such a severe extent.  so I can't say that I know how he feels when he opened my gift.

so a few days ago I cam down with a mixture of the flu/period/something else, I called my auntie and told her that she could not drop the kids off as I was too sick to babysit. 

what happens the next day, I get 3 kids at my doorstep, and my auntie has driven off. I try and take some meds and power through but I was no match for the sick. 

I fell asleep around the end of my babysitting time and woke up to my auntie screaming at me for falling asleep and possibly endangering her kids. (2,5,8)

In the course of our relationship, I have quit my job to move abroad with him for his job transfer, lost touch with life long best friends because he wasn’t comfortable with me having male friends. Had a kid, put my career on the back burner to care for our kid so he could work and move up the ladder. Now I’m back in the workforce and he’s in “busy season” since he works for a big 4 accounting firm but I feel like I’m sacrificing in my new job because I’m the last to arrive and first to leave everyday since my husband works so much and my babysitter can only be around during very specific work hours even though my job is not that demanding but all they ask is that I work 9-6 and my babysitters needs have been requiring me to leave early everyday. I also care for everything around the house and do 98% of the child care when I’m not at work. I also make more money than my husband and pay for pretty much all child related things and things around the house besides big purchases like TVs and AC units which he covers.

I have been working toward a promotion but surprisingly found that I’m pregnant again. I was upset about possibly hurting my career and not getting the promotion and my husband said “who cares if you don’t get promoted” meanwhile he plans on leaving the big 4 after this year, and he is working extra extra hard so he gets promoted despite plans of leaving. By extra extra hard l, I mean goes to work at 9, gets home at midnight and then goes back online until 3 am, while also getting a part time MBA.

He’s super stressed at work, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point. I feel like I’m a single mother most of the time and I’m constantly sacrificing when it feels like things in his life have barely changed (in my POV) since we got together 5. years ago. All I’ve known these past 5 years is me taking the back seat to his career and having to constantly put mine on hold. 1) for the last 5 years he kept telling me things will get better, but they haven’t and I’m not sure him switching jobs will really change anything. 2) I have so much resentment built up, I don’t think I can come back from this.

She told me, about two weeks ago, that she's pregnant. She has always worked well with and LOVED children, and she has 3 stepdaughters with the man whose baby she's carrying. He's a great guy, he treats her well. They're both ecstatic to be having a baby, and they're hoping for a boy.

I'm thrilled for her. She's always wanted children, and while she adores the 3 girls, I know better than most just how happy she is to be pregnant. I am so happy for them, and I've been as supportive as I can be, living 4 hours away. 

But I am also horrendously jealous. I was married, tried for years to get pregnant to no avail. The man I'm with now wants kids one day, but I've had numerous doctors tell me that getting pregnant will be difficult and carrying, even more so. 

I was talking to a mutual friend of ours about Mary's pregnancy, and she (the friend) started talking about how wonderful motherhood is (she's got 3 kids), and all that happy stuff. She asked me if I was ever gonna have kids, and I explained that I want to, but it may not be in the cards for me. She asked if I'm mad about Mary's pregnancy, and I assured her that I'm not mad, I'm super excited, but that a small part of me is jealous because I want to have a kid so badly. The friend was silent and then tore into me about how selfish and shitty I am for feeling that way when I should only be excited for Mary. 

I haven't shared the jealousy with Mary because I don't want to spoil her joy, and because she and I have been friends so long that she already knows. I'm not letting my jealousy affect any of it; it's just how I feel in the bottom of my heart, buried under all the excitement because I get to be an auntie again and god, I cannot wait to hold that baby.

473,Not the A-hole,"To set the tone, yes, I love my mother-in-law. She's my husband's mother after all, and he turned out wonderful. It's just that she's been getting impatient.


We recently celebrated our third anniversary. Still going strong, loving him more every day. But less than a month after our anniversary of our marriage is the anniversary of our miscarriage. I found out I was pregnant on New Year's Day 2017, and miscarried that Valentine's Day. So it's a tender topic to ask when we'll try again.

But she asks. And asks. She gave me six months to grieve and recover, but in the two years since, she has had more than twenty phone calls with my husband asking about our plans for children. I'm not privy to these phone calls, but they always put him in a bad mood. (I say a bad mood, but it's the closest he gets to being sad.) It's hard on both of us to be continually pressured, but him especially since it's his mother.

It came to a head when she unexpectedly dropped by a few days ago while my hubby was at work. After chatting for a few minutes, she popped the question again. ""So when are you and (husband) thinking you'll want to try for babies again? You've been married for three years, right? I want some more grandbabies already!"" She laughed as if it were a joke, but she actually wanted an answer.

I was really uncomfortable and embarrassed by this, and I knew she'd called my husband the day before so already knew the answer. What I told her was ""MIL, (husband's name) and I will tell all of our loved ones if and when we choose to if we decide to try for a baby again. It's a lot of pressure to be asked about it all the time, so please just drop it, okay?""

Later, my hubby said she'd called him crying, saying how I said we wouldn't tell her if we got pregnant and that I didn't want to her to call him anymore. I have no idea how she misinterpreted so much from what I said earlier. I calmed him down (he was upset too) and explained myself and what I actually said/meant. I immediately texted MIL and clarified what I had meant. She never texted me back, but FIL also called my husband about it.

I can't help but feel she's made me out to be the bad guy. I'm grateful my husband is on my side, but his older brother apparently heard about this too. They (the in-laws) are all pretty upset even with the actual meaning of what I said. So AITA? Should I not have put my foot down and kept the peace?

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support and advice! My husband and I are so grateful for the insight from others facing the same issues with in-laws.

I have talked about it a bit with people on my Facebook and if people know us they know something isn't right; but far as the daily struggles and what the disease really does (or will do) I don't like talking about it. For one it's hard to face and when I really dive deep into it I find myself getting choked up, and I'm not interested in breaking down in front of a random coworker. Second I'm an extremely private person and I keep things close to my chest, I know some people who have loved ones who are diagnosed with various things and before they were the person was quiet/reserved then became outgoing and advocate for their loved one; that's not me, I mean I'll defend him if people talk crap but I'm not making speeches and all that.

475,Asshole,"My daughter goes to a Catholic school. She’s gone there since she was in kindergarten, so her uniform is nothing new. However, this is her first year in the high school portion of the school. The high school admits a lot more students who aren’t necessarily religious, and my daughter got mixed up with some new girls who are bad influences. She’s gotten in trouble at least once a month this school year for improper uniform, like rolling up her skirt so it’s too short, untucking and unbuttoning her shirt, taking off her blazer, wearing too much jewelry or makeup. I make sure she has correct uniform before she leaves for school, but she changes how she wears her uniform when she’s out of my site. 

I’ve gotten sick of the phone calls from school, being forced to pick her up late due to after school detention and being forced to drive her to school on Saturdays for Saturday detention. The last straw was last week when she had two violations in a week. 

This past weekend, I gave her the punishment of having to wear the proper uniform all weekend. We just did our normal routine over the weekend. We ran errands, we went for a walk, we went to church. I even treated her to brunch after church. She didn’t want to go to brunch while wearing the uniform, but I reminded her that this was her punishment for failing to wear the uniform properly at school. I even agreed to let her go to her friend’s house, as long as she wore the uniform, but she ultimately decided not to go since she didn’t want to go out with the uniform anymore. She got a couple of questioning looks while we were out, but nobody really said anything. One woman at church said it was nice to see a teenager so formal at church, which I think embarrassed my daughter, but that was it.  

Today, one of my church friends later asked me why my daughter was in uniform, so I explained the punishment, and she said that the punishment was too harsh and embarrassing. Yes, my daughter was embarrassed, but that was part of the punishment. And it’s not like the outfit is embarrassing in and of itself. She wears this to school every day after all.

I got home today after 8 hour work day and 5 hours of driving to find all the milk I pumped in the fridge had gone bad and frozen milk was taken out instead. I asked him why he didnt use the supply in the fridge. He said he couldn't find it. It was literally in the front of the fridge. I mean it is the first thing I saw when I opened the fridge.

It didnt help he was playing a video game when I got home and didnt stop for the first hour I got home. 

I got pissed and told him it was a lot of work to keep pumping milk and he just waste four bottles worth for no reason!

477,No A-holes here,"Context

I am a high school senior  my sister is a sophomore in college.

Me and my sister are very close in age so most of our lives we have done stuff together, but  I have found that I really need to have my own social circle separate from hers.

my reasoning why, i was/am a bit of a more shy and awkward girl, My sister in the other hand is the complete opposite she’s a complete social butterfly and in general she is really well liked and popular, especially among guys. She has what most people consider the perfect body, curves and in general is an incredibly attractive woman, and she would always have a boyfriend. That’s not really my issue with her. My issue is that due to this I am almost always in her shadow. that sounds a bit overdramatic- but when we’re in high school together people would only refer to me as (my sisters name) sister, and would befriend me just to get her number. It really did a big hit on my self esteem. My body isn’t traditionally feminine due to some hormone imbalances I’m working on and I do have some social anxiety, so I’m not like her.

I never told her any of this as it’s really not her fault or anything and I just thought it would be better when she left high school and it really has been. I made lots of new friends and have gotten out my shell a lot and gained more self confidence. Which is really nice. 

I have had my college planned since the beginning of this year as it’s the only place with my major in the state I live in 

So everything seems to be going fine until my sister really wants to meet and befriend all my new friends, I didn’t see it as a problem and so I let her meet some of my new friends. Now all my friends are talking about is how cool my sister is, which I don’t mind it just puts me back into that unhealthy mindset that I am less than her.

So that happened- and I was fine with that, but now my sister has been talking about how because we are so close we should definitely go to the same college. I really didn’t want this at all but I didn’t want to be rude so I kind of agreed but also didn’t? I was vague 

She kept mentioning it and even my family was all excited about how it would be a great idea and we could even room together. 

My last straw is when we were hanging out with one of our best friends from childhood- and he admitted me that he likes hanging out with my sister more than me as she’s just better at talking then I am- he admitted this in front of my sister and she said nothing. This was a really upsetting comment that really crashed down all self confidence I had been building up this past year.

When I went home I snapped and told my sister I don’t want her following me to college. I said I never want to be her shadow again. I  said she needs to stay at the college she’s at now or find a different one.

My sister started crying and telling me I’m selfish. My parents are telling me I need to apologize as well. AITA?",127,265,0.96

479,Not the A-hole,"To start, I went to a hospital to keep me safe and I could have some help that I needed. I was in a  hospital and made some friends that I’m in contact with now.

So at the hospital, we had visiting times to see our family and stuff so we could be connected with the outside. But if you did not have a visitor, you had to stay inside you room, or at least in the hallway. At one of these visiting times, me and Joe both had visitors which was really hard, considering I lived right around the corner and Joe lived about an hr away. So my mom meets him and misgenders him at first,m, I tell her,  and she corrects it. we forget about it and play card games for the rest of the visiting hour. 

After a month, I finally go home and Joe goes to a residential hospital(it’s just like a hospital but it’s like a house). 

Fast forward to a couple weeks from now and I’ve talked to all my friends on the phone including Joe. I’ve told my sister that he’s in a girls cabin with another girl(from the same hospital) where’s he’s at because he’s had experience with some boys who are not very accepting. After awhile, my sister asked me what his birth name was, to which I told her that it is not my business to tell. She kept asking even when I said that. She then brings it up at the dinner table tonight. She then said to my mom that, “(my name) won’t tell me what Joe’s old name is!” My mom said asked why and I said what I’ve been saying since my sister asked me the first time. “It is not my business to tell his old name. He’ll tell you if he wants to, but he goes by Joe for a reason.” My mom tries to say that,”If he’s out already, no need to put him in the closet and sweep his ‘lifestyle’ under the rug.” I tried to explain to her that it is not the same as if someone was out with their sexuality. She then proceeded to shut me down and stop me from talking and ended the conversation. Also I wouldn’t tell my sister because she uses very hurtful things in arguments. For example, one time we were arguing and it was something stupid but she thought it would be great to say “THATS WHY YOU TRIED TO [game end] YOURSELF” I was so heartbroken that she did that but I also stopped confiding in her.

EDIT: I told my mom last night that I will not tell her Joe’s deadname because it isn’t any of her business, and she doesn’t need to know because it is not important. She seemed annoyed but mumbled an ok and went to bed. I also texted my sister that night, and this morning, asked her if she got my text. She said no like the asshole she was, and so I just told her not to ask for Joe’s deadname because she doesn’t need to know it and she needs to stop asking me. She said, “I don’t have to stop asking.

I never wanted to meet my bio parents (different parents) because I feel like I won the lottery by being adopted to such a loving amazing family that always loved me as their own etc.  

&#x200B;

Fast forward to when I turn 18 and out of the blew my bio-brothers and bio-mom finds me online and starts messaging me on facebook.  I guess when I turned 18 they were legally allowed to.  So now I find out I have like 3 bio bros and bio cousins and see my bio mom for the first time and they all look exactly like me and it really creeps me out.  I am the oldest out of all the bio-bros.  Anyways I kinda message back at first but start to feel a real uneasiness about the whole situation for a reason I can explain.  Just felt like somewhat I was betraying my own family even though my parents have always said I can meet them if I want.    I  let them stay friends with me on facebook but I just stop responding.  I asked my mom a few medical questions and she keeps saying my bros are dying to meet me and such.  I feel bad cause I am technically there oldest brother and I could imagine them wanted to meet me.  But I also feel like I don't owe them anything.  Anyways the reason I am writing this was the other day, my bio bro approached me out of the blue in a public place. I have no idea how he found out where I was. He just approached me and said hey I'm your brother.  I stood shocked and then quickly excused myself and said I had to go to the bathroom and basically bolted out of there.  He messaged me on FB right after saying sorry but he just wants to meet me and was hoping we could have a relationship.  I feel a bit of mixed emotions about the whole thing.

484,Not the A-hole,"So backstory is necessary. I bought my sister a dog with the understanding that she was getting her own place within a month or two. Well, it’s been 3 and she shows no sign of getting an apartment and anytime I ask she says “ask (insert boyfriends name here)”. I’m frustrated because I’m asking HER. She’s an adult. 

She recently posted on FB about how helping others should not ever get to the point where it inconveniences you. In response I reminded her politely that I’m still holding her dog (that I bought) and that she promised she’d be moving in an apartment. Her response? “Ask (boyfriend)”

I told her I’m rehoming him if she doesn’t get her stuff together. He’s causing a whole bunch of added stress on me and my fiancé since we are already worn out from long hours at work and school as well as planning our wedding. We have three pets of our own and this puppy, while cute, terrorizes our young cat.

I also recently started having stress related pseudo seizures. It’s making my life hell. Having to put up with a puppy that refuses to be housebroken and barks all night. It’s literally sending me to the er every couple weeks. 

AITA if I follow through and rehome the dog I got for my sister?



EDIT: the dog was asked for, not an unexpected gift. I should have mentioned that. Also she CAN have the dog now, she just refuses.",54,54,0.9
485,Not the A-hole,"I'm a first year graduate student in a very small program (there are 7 students in my entire class.)  We are assigned 3rd year grad students as 'mentors' during our first year. They are responsible for showing us the run of the clinic (we're a medically based program and must work with confusing equipment, report writing, etc.) The mentor's job was to teach us how to use this technology and perform basic tasks like how to open and close the clinic, which we are expected to do once a week.  

My mentor, let's call her Jade, did not want much to do with me. She did the absolute bare minimum to help us. I reached out to her asking for help, and she always made excuses about how busy she was (I get it, grad school is crazy busy) or said she would meet but then said she couldn't at the last minute. We met all of two times in my first semester. I was super jealous of my classmates, whose mentors were holding study nights with them, buying them pizza, and taking the time to get to know them. 

Later I discover that my mentor has been inviting every other student in my class EXCEPT for me out to party/hang out on weekends.  This was not a one time thing. I heard multiple times from my classmates about how she specifically had asked them to hang out with her and the other third years. I have not once been invited to hang out with them, which really hurt my feelings. I was already socially isolated after leaving my home state to come to graduate school, and I was struggling to make friends, and here I am being the only person excluded from parties.

Well, she's graduating, and it's a (required) tradition for first years to write their mentors a heartfelt letter thanking them and wishing them well.  I have nothing good to say to my mentor, who played a role in making me feel like total crap my whole first semester.  But I'm required to write something. Would I be the asshole if I wrote this as my letter:

Jade,

Congratulations on graduating.  I sincerely hope that your future career and your future mentors are as welcoming and helpful to you as you were for me.  Good luck.

486,No A-holes here,"Background:

My wife just graduated with a masters degree in a STEM field.  I am about to graduate with a BS in engineering have an found a job for after graduation. Her family is quite wealthy (upper class), I am from a middle class family. She is international where as I am a native born (USA). We live in the USA

Issue:

Its been a few months since she has graduated and she has not started looking for a job. Yesterday I confronted her about this and she said she doesn't like her major or the work that she would be doing. She said her family is wealthy enough to support her. I wanted her to get a job related to her major but had told her I was okay with her having any job (literally any job, waitress, real estate, insurance agent, etc), I just didn't want her sitting around all day collecting a hand out. It is important to know that she has never spent my money, we are also married but have been doing finances separate while we were in school. Am I the asshole for wanting her to get a job.",53,129,0.94

488,Asshole,"   I (20M if that matters) have never liked mexican food. Needless to say I am an outlier in my family. I’m perfectly fine with them eating mexican food but they seem to refuse to accept that I don’t like it. 

   Generally about 6 days a week we have a family dinner/order out together. I’m a closer at work so I usually come home to leftovers and therefore don’t have a say in dinner. I am never told what it is (though I could ask during my break) so it’s always a surprise. They’ll get/cook mexican about once a month or so and leave me something random like a burrito or a few tacos only for me to remind them again and again that I don’t like mexican. 

   On these days I’ll throw together some leftovers from previous nights or order out for myself. It’s gotten genuinely irritating to come home from work to see a plate of food I don’t like and they know I don’t like just to go around in a circle telling them I don’t like this food and to please tell me ahead of time so I can just order something on my way home only to have it happen again in 3 weeks. 

This has been going on for about 3 years now and I’ve completely had it with them eating for themselves and completely ignoring my preferences. I’ve complained about it to my friends several times and they always say that I shouldn’t expect to be included and it’s driving me crazy. AITA here?

It took all of 15 minutes for me to get shredded to pieces lol. I appreciate the 2 or 3 people that defended me but the rest of the posts definitely reset my perspective.

I teach first grade. We aren't notified when any drills (fire, lockdown, or shelter in place) are going to happen, so every time we are expected to react as if it were a real emergency. Today there was a lockdown drill, but since I didn't know it was a drill, in my mind, it was real. I went to turn off the lights (our doors are always locked and closed) and heard a firstie calling for help in the hallway. I opened my door, grabbed his arm, and pulled him into my class.

&#x200B;

After the drill, I got reprimanded for opening my door. The principal's logic was that if this were a real situation, a dangerous person could have taken a child and made them cry to manipulate the teacher into opening their door, thus putting all the children inside in harm's way. My instincts took over and I was hardly even thinking. I just wanted this child safe. I can't believe i'm getting in trouble for this.",259,933,0.97

495,Not the A-hole,"Before anyone starts, please don't spam responses about how I can't ""control"" her. I know that, no one is getting chained to a radiator and prevented from doing anything. I just told her how I felt.

Anyway, my wife's good friend is getting married. For her bachelorette party, they apparently all plan to have one last ""wild night"" which includes clubbing, bar hopping and a visit to a male strip club. According to my wife, her friend's intention is to ""enjoy her last night of freedom, dance and flirt with as many people as she can and let loose"". Whatever, I'm not the one marrying her.

I had no worries about my wife attending, I was a bit uncomfortable with the strip club idea as I specifically avoided attending one with my own friends years back due to my marriage but as long as she was just going to hang out with the girls I sucked it up, and she's a grown woman so she can drink and have fun as much as she wants, doesn't need my permission.

However, that changed when we started talking about it more and she informed me her friend wanted to get a private lap dance and wanted my wife and another girlfriend to get one as well. I also asked if she planned to take part in the flirting and dancing with random guys and she told me ""I don't think so but who knows!""

That crosses a line for me. If we were at a wedding or something and someone asked her to dance that'd be fine, but in my opinion it's very different to be drunk dancing with random men at clubs and flirting with them. One is a harmless platonic dance, the other is a sexually charged environment with sexually charged conversation. I also wasn't at all ok with the lapdance idea. I understand it's a special occasion, but a guy flapping his naked dick near her face is still a guy flapping a naked dick near her face. I'm ok with her going and watching with friends but this is too much.

I told her I wasn't ok with flirting and dancing with men at clubs or accepting a lapdance. She admitted she just got carried away because it reminded her of her younger years and agreed to avoid the specific stuff that made me uncomfortable, apologized for worrying me and everything was great.

However, she mentioned it to the bride to be who apparently told some of the other girls, and now a good amount of her friends are pissed at me, telling me I'm ruining her fun, telling her that I'm being a jerk and making a big deal out of nothing, the bride to be said she's not sure she even wants me at the wedding anymore. My wife has my back entirely and is arguing on my behalf. So I guess my question is am I (or I guess now are we) being assholes and somehow ruining the special night? My wife says that her agreeing not to do some of the stuff it made the others feel guilty about doing it which is why they're mad, but I still feel sort of bad.",452,1708,0.97

501,Not the A-hole,"Context here: Our ""birthday budget"" is usually around £150 per child.

It was my 18th birthday in January, which is a big deal. When my brother turned 18 (he is 20 now) my mum spent about £500 on him for driving lessons etc, bearing in mind we do not have a lot of money.
My mum always asks what I would like so I told her I just wanted some nice clothes and a couple books, pretty standard. Now usually my mum takes my sister with her when buying presents for me (and vice versa) but this year she didn't so I asked my sister about it and she said ""mum apparently has something really special for you already"" and I figured it would be money or something since I'm moving out soon. 
Anyway fast forward to my birthday and she had gotten me a necklace with matching earrings, nothing else. Honestly, I was disappointed seeing as I don't wear jewelry (I'm very much a ""tom-boy"") and it's also not my style as all.
A couple weeks later I asked her why she didn't listen to what I actually wanted and just copped out and got me an necklace (which I guessed was about £60) and nothing I'd actually have a use for or like. And we argued a bit about it because she spent so much on my brother for his 18th when I have a job and pay for groceries while he lives at home for free, unemployed and doesn't go to school or anything. She got pretty annoyed and told me the necklace and earring combination cost about £300. 

Anyway, I apologised for being ungrateful and told her that I did like it I just don't have an occasion to wear it etc etc,

Now I'm moving out very soon, so I want to sell this necklace which would give me a decent amount for groceries for myself but I'm worried my mum will think I'm being very ungrateful, especially since we already argued about this. I feel like I'm just extra frustrated about it because of how differently she treats my brother when it come to money and birthdays. 

Am I being ungrateful?

I'm away at college right now and left my dog, Sock, at home because I live in the dorms and couldn't exactly bring her with me. My parents called me today and said she was hit by a car and passed away yesterday. I immediately started crying, my dad was crying, it was a mess. He saw it happen and held her while she died. He's one of those mexican dads who hates dogs but secretly feeds her carne when he's making dinner. He's heartbroken. He buried her and planted a rose bush on top. 

The thing is, we move all the time. We never stay in a house for more than 2 years, and the house we're at is already falling apart and they're planning on moving soon. She was my dog first. 3 of the 4 years she was alive she lived with me. I left her with my parents while I went to college, and I'm a freshman so they've had her since August. I know they loved her very much, but I can't leave her at that house, especially because we're leaving. 

My brother agreed to go dig her up for me and take her to get cremated, but I feel like a major asshole because my dad spent the money on a rose bush for her. I told him already about cremating her but he didn't give much of a response, just kept saying that he planted a rose bush, which made me feel even worse.

My mom says he keeps visiting her grave, and that he wont stop crying. Just typing this out I feel like the worst person in the world, but I can't leave my Socky there. 

AITA for digging up my dog to cremate her when my dad already gave her a grave.

I have been lamenting the loss of this lipstick with my best mate lately, and she was sympathetic and supportive.

So the place my cousin works at never called or replied to my resumes. 

However I just ran into her yesterday, 3 months later and after talking to her for a few minutes   (we ran into each other when she was walking into work) she said she’d tell them about me again. So she calls me yesterday and said they want me to interview today. I really had put no thought into taking the job or a new one at that cus I’m content with what I’m doing now. However I spontaneously said yes. But now the interview is in an hour and I honestly don’t want to go. But my cousin gave me a reference and said she’s excited to work with me but I just don’t know how to feel or what to do. Truth is I really am not looking for another job and one has just been sprung upon me. I know I accepted the interview but, idk....

Edit: I’m on my way to the interview now. I know for my cousins reputation the least I can do is show up. I’m just going to wing it and give it some more thought so if they call back and offer the job I’ll have a more thought out answer

Edit 2: the manager is 20 minutes late to the interview now

Edit 3: actually glad I went because the reason I was hesitant was because i thought they’d be hiring me as a host. However they said they’re looking for delivery and were interested in my doordash experience and said they’d cover mileage, include tips, and guarantee pay if there are no deliveries.

512,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory, this happened a few weeks ago over spring break. Since I was on break for a week I was sleeping in till about 2 PM. One day I woke up three texts from my mother “I need you to call me ASAP!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!” 10:20AM “Turn off your extended absence message NOW. I’ve asked you to before.” 11:35AM and “CALL ME!!!!!!” 1:25PM. When I saw this I immediately called my mom 3 times to no answer so I called her office then my dad and his office to no answer. I waited about an hour with complete radio silence until it began to get to me. I started calling around to or family members trying to find out if anything had happened to them or if anyone knew where they were and nobody knew anything. I then moved to their colleagues (they work at the same place) who had also not seen either of them that day. In all I probably called 3 colleagues and 3 family members without getting any information about anything. Some extra context my grandfather had had a heart attack just a few days before so as a person who already worries a lot my family’s health was already on my mind. At this point the people I had called had begun to text and they were now worried about where my parents were. Well it turned out it was a trivial matter and they strolled in a couple hours later. As soon as they walked in I asked if they were both ok to which they responded yes and then I got angry at them for making me worry so much. When I explained that I had called a bunch of people my mom got mad at me because “it was clear there was no emergency”. So my question is AITA for being “to worried” about my parents health.

513,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend hosts his own podcast dedicated to movies and he even has his own studio that he's renting out so that he can record there. He has some co-hosts, legit recording equipment, and he has a decent following. I always go to the studio to just sit on the side and watch as he records, but I've noticed that he's started to become a bit different ever since the start of the podcast.

On a podcast a few weeks ago, the topic was 2016 movies as my boyfriend and his co-hosts revisited some of their favorite and least favorite films of 2016. One co-host brought up Arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says ""YAWN!"" and he explains that he thought Arrival was boring. My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. He says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they ""think they're smart"" and he says that he's proud of himself for ""seeing past that movie"" and it's ""faux attempts at intelligence"". And whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates Arrival.

Then just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was MCU movies. My boyfriend brought up that he thinks Age of Ultron is a ""hidden gem"" and ""massively overlooked masterpiece"". One of his co-hosts scoffed when he said those things and that set off my boyfriend. He starts attacking the co-host for his taste in movies and started saying stuff like ""Just because I have a better understanding of the art of film-making, it doesn't mean you have to be jealous of me."" That was actually enough for the co-host to just walk out in the middle of the show and my boyfriend said ""That's fine, I only want to talk to true auteur's of film on this show."" 

And just yesterday, I asked him if we could see Shazam together, but he simply responded with ""I deserve better than those DC movies."" I confronted him and told him that he needs to stop acting like he's smarter than everyone over his taste in film and he said ""Truth hurts, doesn't it?"" And it's like this a lot. Whenever I'm watching a movie he doesn't like, he'll just scoff and say ""Typical"". I'm thinking of breaking up with him, but I also feel weird about dumping him over him having differing views on film. What do you think?",676,8361,0.99

515,Not the A-hole,"I work in an office where the person who does the occasional supply runs also brings snacks such as donuts, bags of potato chips, candy - whatever - for the whole company. Sometimes other employees (including me) also bring snacks for everyone, too. Etiquette dictates that you take one and leave the rest for others. Maybe the next day you take another.

Everyone except one guy seems to adhere to this unspoken rule. Mr. X makes a habit of grabbing a handful of lollipops, a couple of bags of chips, or even five bags of pretzels at a time, eating one and hiding the rest somewhere at his workstation. This results in some people hearing the “free snacks!” and then wondering where everything went when they go look at the tray. And no, Mr. X has never brought items of his own to share.

I  got pissed off one day and called him out on it. We had a short, spirited discussion about sharing, hoarding, selfishness, and what you were supposed to have learned in Kindergarten. He kept one lollipop and begrudgingly returned four others to the common bowl. I thought that was the end of it.

Last Friday, I happened to see Mr. X hiding six bags of chips behind his computer.  Instead of confronting him directly again, here’s what I did:

I bought three gigantic party-sized bags of chips. Before Mr. X arrived at work yesterday, I removed the small bags, and in their place, put the three gigantic bags. Sometime during the day he put the giant bags, unopened, in the tray with the smaller bags of snacks in the common area.

If  he had questioned me, I was prepared to say: “I saw you took six bags of chips and hid them. I felt sorry for you that you’re so broke and starving that you feel you have to take six times as many snacks as anyone else and hide them. You  shouldn’t have to steal to eat. I put back those tiny little bags and  bought you three giant bags of chips instead, so you won’t go hungry. I  tried to do it anonymously so you wouldn’t feel ashamed.” He never spoke to me, though, so I didn’t get to give my prepared speech. Before you ask: no, he’s not broke or starving.

I learned later that Mr. X confronted the supply guy, thinking he was the culprit for my prank/smart-ass retaliation. Mr. X asserted ""there's a reason I take the small bags - they're portioned out and with my diet, I'm only allowed  to eat a certain amount every day"". Well, sounds like the selfish jerk has justified to himself why his shitty behavior is okay. I still say it's not okay. AITA?

I'll  take the judgement of the community, and I'll also welcome suggestions about what might have been a better way to handle this. In the grand scheme of things, it's really such a stupid, petty thing to get mad about, but it really makes my blood boil for some reason!",29,109,0.96
516,Not the A-hole,"My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

I know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn’t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he’s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He’s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

Instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I’ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. 

He jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he’s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn’t gotten too frustrated yet. He’s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don’t bother him either. 

But anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I’m a massive dick. That I’m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he’s already such a good kid.

517,No A-holes here,"We have a split home. It's been that way since child was 3 months old. We share 50/50.

It's Monday night, a school night. School night bedtime has been 8:30 pm since 6th grade (11). Was 8pm since 4th grade. 7:30pm K-4. Not super strict if you ask me. We even allow 10-10:30ish on the weekends.

Anyways, I am getting ready for bed and see my 12 year old on Fornite mid game at 10:10pm. I message him and he immediately logs out. Send him an IM of giant shit pile from Jurassic Park .Gif and he says I woke him up and mom was playing the game and that it was pretty random that she logged out right after I messaged. Says GN.

Next day I ask mom how shes digging Fortnite. Says she doesn't play. Fill her in on prior evening. Tell her if she allowed it, that's a different conversation, but I'm taking his PC access away at my place for lying. He knows my expectations and I feel he was taking advantage of his mother. He knows better and we've had complaints from his teachers for sleeping during class and such. Over my way we are religious with our children's bed time during the school year.

Long story longer, Mom writes back that she can explain from her POV later. I get a message later saying she didn't know what he said to me.

She does this stuff from time to time, insinuating I shouldn't punish for things that happen under her watch. She often tries to cover for him since I am a big meany he follows threw on punishments. She even apologizes to him when I pick him up and he's had something taken away.  I'm never super heavy, I never throw out a punishment we as a household can't/won't stick too. Consistency and all.... Mom goes the other way, taking things away for silly amounts of time only to go back on it days later.

Heck, I'm only taking the PC away for a few weeknights.  Pretty lite if you ask me.

AITA?

Edit:  Bedtime at moms is 9pm during the school week.  Mom was asleep I'm guessing.  She had no idea.  Punishment and reasoning ran by mom beforehand.  It's crappy behavior on his part and I don't stop being a parent just because he's not under my roof IMO.

519,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago but my mum still likes to bring it up so I decided to share this story and ask you guys for your opinion.

I (25f) am nothing like my sister (27) and my mum and my whole family is aware of that. I have different interests than they do and it's fine (with me).

So last Christmas, my sister got a bracelet from a certain brand. My mum asked me if I'd like to have one too but from the very beginning I said no thanks because I'm just not that into jewelry.

When my birthday was coming up a couple of weeks later, my mum asked me again if I'd like to have a bracelet just like the one my sister got for Christmas and I told her I don't care much about jewelry so no, thanks.

A couple of days later, she asked me what I'd like for my birthday and I literally said: ""Please anything but that bracelet.""

Fast forward to my birthday, guess what she got me: The bracelet.

On a sidenote: This is not the first time, something like that has happened. My mum would very often give me gifts my sister really liked but which weren't quite a fit for me. Up to this point, I always said thanks and accepted them because, hey, it's a gift. But she'd always notice that I didn't really use said gifts and at later points I'd carefully mention that it's just not what I'm into.

So when I saw that I got the exact thing she knew I didn't want to get, I couldn't help but feel hurt. And I told her. I asked her why she would give me the one thing I told her I didn't want. She said I was being ungrateful and we got into a huge fight.

Before my bday I gave her suggestions as to what I'd like to get (I got some of these things too which makes me feel even more like a spoiled child) but I also told her that I'm saving up money for travels so cash would be fine. I realize I sound like a brat for not being thankful for a gift, especially since she got me other stuff too.

But I was truly unhappy with it. Not because it's a bracelet but because of what it represents. It showed me that my mum didn't listen/care all these times when I told her I'm not into that type of jewelry & I'm not gonna wear it and I feel like this was just another low key attempt to change me & make me assimilate to her & my sister. And it also made me feel bad because it was a waste of money too.

So, Reddit, AITA for telling my mum that I don't like my bday gift? I feel like yes. But I can't help it, I couldn't hold my feelings back & I wanted to avoid similar situations in the future.

TL;DR: I told my mum there was one thing I didn't want for my bday and she got me just that. I told her I wasn't happy about it. AITA?

**Edit/Update:** Thank you so much for all your responses! Some of you are saying that she might have bought the bracelet already when she got the one for my sister. I don't think she did because my bday and Christmas aren't really that close together. But who knows? If I had known that she'd already got it without knowing that I wouldn't like it, it would have changed everything. So I guess she would have told me if that was the case.

After I wrote this yesterday, I thought a lot about this situation and I came up with an explanation as to why all of this happened. On other forums, some Redditors keep mentioning the languages of love. I'm absolutely positive that my mum's language of love is gifts/presents. But mine is not. So when I told her I didn't want the bracelet, but I'd rather like other stuff (the suggestions I made were less expensive) she probably didn't know how to handle the situation. I'm assuming that that's why she got it for me anyway!?",143,544,0.97
520,Not the A-hole,"I’ve known my best friend since Boy Scouts. (probably around 7 or 8) His mom was fresh out of a divorce when I first met him. She is very religious with a job at the local college so I’ve never thought much of her.

Flash forward (18) and my best friend leaves for the marines. His mom asks for my number to sign me up for the school’s (she works at and I now attend) new “alert system.”  I think nothing of it and give her my number.

This is where things get weird. The “alert system” went from messaging me about school events to asking me to attend a movie. I confront her and she admits she was forwarding me the notifications using her number and never signed me up. I go to the movies because she’s 50+ I’m 18 and she said we would go as friends. She insists I come over after for a bit and I do. She proceeds to tell me I remind her of her ex and rubs up on me so I leave. For the next months she would message me at midnight with excuses of why I need to come over. “I heard gunshots” or “I think someone’s hiding in my closet” and I would just ignore it.

With about a week before her son comes back she starts going over the deep end. Accusing me of wanting her dead and insisting I called her a whore. Then following up with a paragraph about how she wouldn’t call me if she needed help so that her blood would be on my hands. To this I snap and tell her I never want to talk to her again. I went as far as to say I wouldn’t hangout with her son anymore because of her.

Well, her son is back before he redeploys and she doesn’t want to ruin his one week back. I went over while his mom was making him lunch and his mom ran out of the kitchen crying.

Where I work, there is a mentally challenged couple who were unfairly kicked out of their apartment building illegally. They have been living in their small car with their dog and cat in the parking lot of our work for roughly 4 months. The animals have food and water but the car is disgusting (clothes, animal urine and poo) and they animals don't get out of the car very often. They were in the car all winter and hotter weather is on it's way. The couple have told me they are searching for an apartment, but haven't found anywhere to live. They are good people and they love the animals to the point where they would be devastated if they lost the animals. And I feel horrible about it, but those animals deserve a better home and animals in my town get adopted quickly to good people. At least two other coworkers have shared the same thought. So, would I be the asshole if I called animal control and had the animals removed from their care?
EDIT (included in the comments): For those saying none of us care about the people, some more info. We (the coworkers) collectively have tried to connect them with lawyers who can work on the legal situation, the couple never went. We have fed them, we have given them numbers to landlords (mine included) and apartment complexes, we have told them about city housing programs, they don't call and they don't go. Several coworkers have shelled out money to fix their car, buy tires, buy food (it's min. Wage so we can't do a lot). Coworkers offer their homes for showers and laundry and a night to sleep. We have tried, but they just don't do anything with the help. Also, they have a housing option to stay with a relative, but have refused.

526,Not the A-hole,"So backstory here:  I grew up around my father’s friends and they’re a tight knit group.  A few years ago, my brother and I found ourselves working for my father’s friend (OB) in their company.

While working there, we discovered that OB was actually a horrible person. He refused to give any time off time off to anyone regardless of how long they’d been working.  Routinely berated the staff publicly. On one occasion he caused a man to suffer a complete mental break down and we found the poor guy in the fetal position on the floor.  

While working there, I personally got threatened with my job every week. Had an 8 hour meeting where I was blamed for everything going wrong.  Cursed at like crazy (OB’s favorite word was “Mother Fucker”).  He also moved me from Hourly to salary so he didn’t need to pay me over time for the 80 hour weeks he was FORCING me to work, without paying any owed OT. BUT I also met my fiancé there.  OB attempted to break us up on at least one occasion that I know about.  

Fast forward 2 years, 8 months, and 4 days later and I was hired at a new job. When I went to put in my two weeks notice, OB loudly and publicly fired me for one last humiliation.  He then said “I’ll make it so you never work in this town again.”  

For my new job to start, I needed an FBI background check that needed my five last employers to fill out paperwork saying that I worked there and I didn’t steal anything. OB’s Company didn’t fill it out for 3 months.  They only did when I got legal involved. In that time, I drained my savings and checking account because I didn’t want to start a new job just to quit on a moment’s notice. 

I am now three months from my wedding and my father has made up with OB and is demanding that I invite him to the wedding as he is paying a significant portion of the wedding cost. Apparently, I’m selfish for not wanting him at what is supposed to be the happiest day of my life.

EDIT 1: Father is not paying the entire thing.   He is paying a bit less than half. Largely because we’re using his preferred venue and inviting most of his friends.

A few years ago I was dating a guy we will name John (fake name) and after about 3 years our relationship ended. He wanted to stay friends and I’ve tried it but looking back at the relationship I only remember being used as a ride and as a dinner ticket. Later after our relationship ended and speaking with him he confirmed that yeah, I was kinda just a ride and a friend that wouldn’t leave him. 

Well in this relationship he moved away for school and I’m like “no big deal” and I even loaned him a tablet of mine. I had 2 and figured “sure! Why not loan it out?” But this wasn’t a gift, this was a loan, and I made this clear with him. 

Now years ago not too shortly after the breakup I asked if he would be shipping my tablet back to me. He responds with basically “no” because he doesn’t want it to get damaged during shipping. It’s a fair enough thing to say and I figured “well I may end up there relatively easily anyway so... whatever” and as time goes on I never got it back. I’m at a point where I just want it back and I’m asking him if he’ll just ship it to me. 

Now this is where the post is relevant. See, at one point we were both in town again and I happened to ask if he had the tablet with him. His response was gaslighting me saying something to the effect of “oh, that’s all you care about?” And to be real it’s half of what I care about with him. I just want the tablet so I can remove him from my list of contacts and never talk to him again. I want to purge him out of my life, and the tablet has sentimental value to me and I don’t want to give it up.

WIBTA if I told him all I really care about is the tablet at this point? 

And a note: I would only say that’s all I cared about if he asked. If he didn’t ask if that’s all I cared about I would keep to myself and not start crap for no reason. I’m not trying to start drama, I just want my tablet back.

Edits: 

Okay a second apology for being on mobile yet again. But I have some good news to share!

So first update is that after reaching him I’m told that the tablet was stolen from him. Now this makes me pretty upset but we worked out an agreement for compensation. 

I basically asked if he could Venmo me the money for replacement/value and he agreed. Now I say Venmo but I personally don’t trust Venmo and apps like Venmo, and sure enough I find some stuff I want on amazon, open box no less. So he sends me an amazon gift card to compensate for the stolen item. I’m not going to disclose the amount here as that crosses a line for me but basically I’m pretty happy with the outcome none the less.

I could have gotten a new tablet but me being an apparent hoarder of tablets I decided not to on a count of having enough. I have my android tablet and my iPad Pro and really a third tablet is just pushing it. 

To everyone who said “you aren’t getting your tablet back” you were right! But not in the way you think. 

I also want to be clear, I know I could slam him out of my life but that’s usually not me. I’ve done it in more extreme cases but in this I’m just over it and I’ll probably remove him by the end of the night. I have no desire to stay friends with him. I’ll probably leave him on social media for a little bit but basically the clock is ticking. Now, had this gone differently and I didn’t receive compensation then I would have absolutely chewed him out. At the end of the day he is a narcissistic person who I’d like to eject from my life and now that the one thing that felt it was anchoring me is gone I can finally cut that cord.

So basically I've become best friends with this latin-american guy at a language school in Japan. First time I saw him I instantly had a crush on him cause he's completely my type, handsome, thick and muscular, has the most jaw-dropping smile I've ever seen in a guy. Once I got to know him better the more I fell for him.


I am by no means a talkative person, I have social anxiety and barely talk at all, add to that I've never really had real conversation in English with anyone before, so you can imagine my anxiety in my first Japanese class that I had. Fortunately we hit it off straight away since he mostly has the same interests that I have; travelling, backpacking, food, etc and he's the most overwhelmingly wholesome and positive person I've ever met too, so he had no trouble talking to me. I guess it's pertinent to mention that he's like that because he found Jesus in his life, and he often goes to one of those youth church gatherings where the pastor is oddly hot and all the people there is all smiles and lots of young music worshipping Jesus etc. It's actually what made him to be the person I fell for. On the other hand I'm this cynical atheist who don't really care about religion as long as you don't bother anyone. 

We made lots of unforgettable memories and new friends during our study; we went to lots of restaurants, Ryokans, onsens, all the essential things that you have to do in Japan you name it, we did just the two of us. Whenever there's a chance that I get to be with him I took it without a second thought. This one time on our Hokkaido trip we hiked this cool mountain and I can honestly say that that was the best thing that has ever happened to my life. 

Fast forward a couple of months near the end of his study, where he'll leave for his home country and I'm staying for a job, I decided one day to just tell him face to face that I have a crush on him or even more than that. He took it really well like I expected, you're still my friend and all that, but his reply was not as relaxed and as casual to his normal self and there's this hesitation and uncomfort that I see in his demeanor. After that talk, he and I became a little distant,  part of it is because that I didn't talk with him as casually like before, I'm embarrassed and still thinks that he's better off without me. Part of me still thinks that I've used him in a way, I won't lie I enjoy his company when it's just us two, maybe he would've rejected all my plans to travel alone if he knew what I am,that's why I didn't tell him.",25,71,0.9
534,Not the A-hole,"This is a long story and I just wanted to get some opinion here.

My wife and her mother is visiting my hometown (small city in China) for the first time. My grandparents have never met my wife. My grandparents wanted to do a family photo shoot (of course they are going to pay for it). It is going to be one of those professional photo shoots that take about half a day. Of course, my side of the family wants to include my wife in it (extended family). My grandparents also want to invite my wife's mother but ONLY if she (wife's mom) is comfortable taking photo with people she's never met before. If she is not comfortable, she can just hangout around the studio, help with picking out clothing, make-up or stay at the hotel for a couple hours.

&#x200B;

My wife is unwilling to be part of the family photo and is angry at me saying: ""Why are you making my mom wait by herself for half a day?! That is not how you should treat your guests. You invite them over and you make them wait on their own ? That's not how you treat guests that have to fly (3 hours) to get to your city"".

&#x200B;

Now I don't think either side is ""wrong"" or ""bad"". Everyone should just do what they want to do! But I just feel like she's going overboard by saying how my family has bad manners in a very condescending way. I've told her repeatedly to stop talking about my family like that and we get into a fight every time because she thinks what my grandparents want is outrageous.

535,Not the A-hole,So my boyfriend and I have been dating nearly 3 months but we only really see each other once or twice a week. Last night we were talking and he said something about how he hasn’t watched porn in like 3 months and how he barely ever masturbates now because he has me. I said something along the lines of oh I actually masturbate more often now. And he got kind of upset saying he wasn’t fulfilling what I needed etc etc. For reference we haven’t had sex yet but we have done some other things. I said that he does fulfill what I need but that I only see him once / twice a week and I just feel horny more often because I think of him and do it myself and that’s fine. So AITA?,22,25,0.84
536,Not the A-hole,"I believe I'm technically not in the wrong because this is all in my thoughts and I haven't vocalized this or made it evident, but I wanted to see if I'm justified in the way I feel.

I kept a running donation box for 6 months in my apartment, and would periodically throw clothes in there when I felt ready to donate them. There were a lot of clothes in there near the end and they ranged from more inexpensive stuff like F21 and H&M to slightly more expensive clothes from Ann Taylor and J.Crew. Nothing extremely expensive/designer, but there were clothes in there that were barely worn or still with tags on them. I thought it'd be nice to donate everything; not to mention, I didn't have time to even think about selling them.

My BF and I have been together for 5 years, and his little sister (20yo) is a similar size as me, maybe one size larger (XS vs. S). It did cross my mind that I could've given some clothes to her, but 1) I've already done that in the past with two nice coats, 2) she's never displayed a ton of appreciation for gifts, 3) their family is not hurting for $, with an income of \~$1m.

His mom came over, noticed the box, and asked what it was about, so I explained that I'd been wanting to donate the clothes. She said, ""Oh! I could just drop it off at the donation center in \[underserved town next to hers\], if you'd like?"" I thought that was really generous of her, and took her up on the offer after double checking it was not a chore for her.

Anyway, I saw his parents again weeks later and mom said, ""You had some pretty decent stuff in there! I took and saved some for \[sister\].""

I can't help but feel totally annoyed with this. On one hand - yes, mom was kind enough to drop it off for me. On the other hand - the clothes were meant to be donated.

So.. AITA?",70,34,0.9
537,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé and I are getting married in July. We’ve been engaged for a year and a half and have most things planned already for our wedding.

The problem started about four months ago though. All of a sudden, we have both sides of our family butting their noses into the wedding and giving their opinions on everything... We even have some weird triangulation where I’ll address something with my future mother in law, and she’ll text him to try to convince him otherwise. 

The worst of it though is my mother. She’s always been my best friend. The problem though is she’s super assertive and takes over anything she works on. With my wedding, she’s decided that she wants to buy all the booze, that we should have custom water bottle labels (which neither my fiancé nor I care about), that we now need a day of coordinator, that we need to plan for what people should do between the ceremony and reception, has started bringing on herself to plan these things and more. 

Sometime we talk for 45min straight with her just telling me what we should do for the wedding. I get 2-3 words in. It’s started happening that if we say no, she gets incredibly upset. We only want a simple wedding, but she keeps making it bigger and more complicated, plus tells us stuff that we want is silly and will confuse people. 

I’ve noticed that when we get into these conversations, my heart starts pounding really fast and I start feeling super anxious— to the point I’m getting nightmares of her telling me everything I have to do in my life and that I don’t have enough time to do it all. I’ve woken up in tears from it. I start feeling overwhelmed when we are talking and then I snap and say something like “Mom, you aren’t listening to me. I need you to stop. This is too much.” This offends her to the point she yells or cries.

She’s dealing with some bad work issues and feels unappreciated there. When we don’t use her ideas or tell her to back off a bit, she feels her help is unappreciated for the wedding. I feel like she’s having a bit of a mid-life crisis of not feeling needed anymore. Last night, she told me that she wishes I would have just eloped.

I don’t want my wedding to break apart this close bond my mom and I have always had. I’ve dreamed of my wedding since I was a little girl. Now, all I want is to marry the man I’m in love with. We’ve already spent so much on deposits and my bridesmaids have bought their dresses, otherwise my fiancé and I have said we’d cancel it and actually elope.

540,Not the A-hole,"Basically I have a boyfriend who sometimes live streams on a website called twitch.
Sometimes on his own and sometimes with some friends.
He’s live-streams are fairly decent he has a donation bar , a be right back screen and so on.
He mainly streams games like CS:GO , Apex legends stuff like that.

Last night I was watching his stream. He was streaming with two of his friends and it was going pretty good , the stream was working like normal they where making jokes and laughing which I was fine with because they where funny jokes. 

Until his friend (in my opinion) takes it to far saying out of no where: “my brother had a party and two of his friends that came around where gay. I had to disinfect my whole house , I actually did”

I got really upset and stoped watching the stream then later on my boyfriend called me and I told him I didn’t like his friend. He sounded shocked and asked why so I told him I was upset my the homophobic “joke” this guy made.

My boyfriend defended him saying it’s just a joke and it’s just his friends sense of humour so me and him got into a fight about it.

It might have been a joke and I truly believe with the right audience you can make any joke in the world but on a live stream where anyone could be watching it isn’t right. He also said it so seriously and kinda angry which is what shocked me. It sounded like a statement not a joke.  He wouldn’t make that joke at pride so why make it on a live stream?

542,Asshole,"So a few months ago a distant friend of mine died, not close enough to be a best friend or anything, but enough to chat over drinks and whatnot every now and again. Every few weeks there'd be a cascade effect where someone would post a glowing tribute to them, quickly followed by a dozen more people and to be honest I found the whole thing kinda gross, as if it was a game of one upmanship other than respect.

So I reported the account, provided a link the the death via local newspaper website and waited a few days. Suddenly the page is now a memorial page and those friends are kicking off because someone desecrated this dead persons memory by reporting a dead person as dead. Now there's a witchhunt to find out who did it because the family wasn't consulted, something I wasn't aware needed to be a thing.

544,Asshole,"So, my job involves counselling children who have been abused and neglected. I hear pretty terrible stuff and see children go through terrible things because of flawed systems (child protection, family court). As you can imagine, it's highly stressful and emotionally demanding. On top of that, I was a child who lived through domestic violence and family separation. So while I am able to create good therapeutic boundaries, I can't stop some of the stories/situations triggering my own trauma.

So over the last 8 months, I had a lot of changes at work (moving offices, new staff, moving offices again, changing service structure) and I went through some stressful times (e.g., losing family dog; fall out with family member; caring for an injured family member). By December, I was really stating to feel the stress.

I tried doing more self-care but I kept feeling more stressed. I tried ignoring some of the things that bothered me, telling myself that it's only my issue and it's not worth telling my colleagues about it (my team is extremely caring and nurturing, but I didn't want to bother them). I tried reframing the issues so that I look at them in a positive light. I tried focusing on my job so that I can just move past this stress. I guess I repressed all this too much because I had a meltdown last week.

It happened when my manager announced that she was pregnant (first pregnancy). Don't get me wrong, I was extremely happy for her! But I had a emotional meltdown soon after that. I cried for hours and felt crap for days. I was repulsed by work and had to take time off to sort things out for myself. I didn't realise why I was reacting so strongly to my manger announcing her pregnancy. So I had to reflect on it for some time. I finally realised that it was because this was ANOTHER change I had to deal with. And it's kind of a compounding change because she's going to go on leave and someone else has to come into her job etc.

Since this realisation, I have also realised that I am experiencing compassion fatigue (or vicarious trauma) and the combination is not going to be helpful moving forward. So I have decided to change jobs.

I want to tell my manager about my decision. And I want to be honest. But WIBTA if I tell her that it was her pregnancy that was the last straw? Or should I just focus on the work stress getting to me? TIA.

EDIT:Thank you everyone! I didn't feel completely comfortable about telling my manager the full truth. So thank you so much for clearing this up for me :) I will definitely just stick to the stress getting to me (the actual reason) as my reason.

At this stage, we have had to homeschool the children for six weeks and I have had 60% of my total assignments due, so wedding planning has been on my backburner for the last six weeks, since I've hardly had time to do the urgent stuff I've needed to do.

548,Not the A-hole,"Disclaimer, the events described actually transpired a couple years back on my 17th birthday, but recently it was brought up and my parents doubled down on their belief that I was overreacting.

So to preface this, I'm a very private person with a small family and group of friends. Large social situations like parties make me really uncomfortable and I find little joy in them. So whenever my Birthday rolls around my Mother usually just bakes me a cake and we celebrate it as a family at home. But on my 17th Birthday, a rich family friend was throwing a party at their house and my entire family insisted that I go with them. Initially I was really hurt that my family would go to another person's party and leave me alone on the night of my birthday, but I'm not necessarily close to my family so I decided that I would be fine just staying home alone and playing online video games with my friends. But the situation really starts to turn shitty for me when my Mother and Father start guilt tripping me into attending the party with them. Guilt tripping almost always works on me so I end up attending the party with them. We were there until late into the night and I was miserable the entire time. The next day I was in a bit of a sour mood and in a text conversation between me and my mother I let it slip that I was very upset and felt as if my birthday was ruined. She let my Dad know about my feelings and when he got home he let it rip into me about how he thinks I'm very selfish and acting completely unreasonable and like every time I mention I'm unhappy with the way my family treats me, he goes on a tangent about how his own father was an abuser and super shitty and I should be grateful that he isn't like that.

This event got brought up again a couple days ago when, years later, I discovered a birthday candle shaped like the number 17 crammed into a drawer in the kitchen that was most likely suppose to go on top of my cake that I never got.

550,Not the A-hole,"This is from a memory of mine that my cousin reminded me of. It's a long and honestly uneventful AITA but here goes nothing.

A while ago, my family went to see my cousin's for Lunar New Year. To them, being 17 meant I was too young to be seated with the adults, so they sat me with the younger children in a tiny kids chair. At first I didn't exactly mind as I think kids are hilarious and fun to be around also figured their adult table was full/they wanted someone to watch over the younguns.

...Until they served me tiny portions of food fit for the 10 year olds I was surrounded with. I didn't want to be rude, but I was visibly annoyed. I was on my high school's varsity swim team, and they knew I was famished from the long drive and getting off of practice a couple hours ago. Heck my family and I cooked some things up to help with the gathering, and all I got was some soup and a rice cracker, with a tiny piece of moon cake to follow.

I said if there's a chance I would get a chance at the other dishes -- the one the adults ate from, which my cousin's mother (who served me and the kids) said perhaps once the adults are done...which by then I knew nothing would be left. 

The idea crossed my mind it might be because I'm half Asian half European, and I was used to being looked down upon by some people in either side of my family, like being nicknamed ""the mutt"" or ""unclean"". Her tone and the way she eyed me set it off for me, but I may be wrong -- who knows.

In the end I told my mother I was leaving and politely left as quietly as I could to go walk to a chinese restaurant to have my own chinese new year.

...which brings us to present times when my cousin just recently tells me now that her mother was furious at me for going against ""her"" culture, and was why I wasn't invited the following years.

These side effects were episodes of psychosis,hallucinations, loss of coordination severe nausea, trouble urinating witch resulted in getting gout, and crying in my shower for hours becasue I felt the need to kill myself everyday for 6 months. 

My wife and this friend listed below started talking to each other and my wife started to send him selfies over the course of a few days. He told her it made him feel uncomfortable so she stopped. When I was going through the side effects she told me she didn't ""know how to help or be supportive"" I went through a car wreck that was not m fault. I broke my ribs, fractured the fingers in my right hand, had whiplash, and a concussion. 

The same friend is going through a hard time in his marriage because his wife came put as transgender. So he was feeling lonely and depressed so he texted my wife about wanting to find some ""pussy"" to have and how they should go to a ""club"".

My wife said ""you'll find someone to stretch that itch for you."" He replied ""Took bad you are taken."" I feel this is a pretty clear indication of crossing boundaries. I told my wife we had a fight and it led to him texting me calling a pile of shit.

Earlier today, she made a post on her instagram saying that all men ""Mooch off their relationships w/o regard to how it makes the other person feel."" As someone who identifies as male and thinks of her as a friend, I half jokingly responded asking if this applied to me. Her response was that no man is an exception.

I claimed that this view was inherently sexist on her part, she argued that the fact I needed to ask proves her point. I felt really offended by this comment, as if she was saying that I only look out for myself, also I thought we were considered friends.

The exact words I wrote were ""That's... Pretty assuming, ngl. I love you to pieces, but I will disagree with you on this point. I don't think men are inherently evil or out for themselves. Some are, absolutely. And yes, typically it is men, not women, but to assume every single man is a leech is... Just sexist. I love you, but I'm sorry, I think the language you're taking here is very, very strong.""

Their response was litterally just ""i dont care haha. As a feminine person i have experienced the worst men have to offer and I don’t feel the need to be sympathetic to people who ask me to take time out of my day to comfort them and affirm that they’re different from other men."" 

My final response, in summary, as it reveals a ton of personal information, says that I have experienced the worst that women have to offer, making me a victim of multiple crimes. However, this doesn't give me the right to hate all women.

They haven't responded.

I feel like shit and I don't want her to feel hurt, but I don't think I said anything wrong. I think she was completely incorrect and hatred towards men is sexism. Does this make me an asshole?

555,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory on mobile so please forgive grammar/spelling errors.

My husband and I were gifted a couple’s massage for Christmas, but have not been able to use it yet. Recently a mutual friend of ours had a massage and was telling us how great it was over a few beers. 

Husband is very blunt and asked if our friend got turned on by the masseuse/ did he get lucky. Our friend answered by saying it was a very relaxing experience and the woman was totally professional the whole time. 

Not happy with this response, my husband begins saying he always gets turned on during massages. He continues to explain how all massages are sensual experiences between two people. This segues into describing what happens in our bedroom. I tell him I didn’t feel comfortable with him sharing this information and asked him to please stop. He responds by telling me I’m too sensitive, but continues sharing intimate details about our sex life.

At this point I am over the conversation and go inside to bed. Unfortunately for me, our bedroom shares a wall with our garage (where they were) and I can hear everything they are talking about. He continues to describe past massages and how he has been able to score happy endings (prior to us meeting). Tries to coach our friend (who is also married) on how he too can get a happy ending during his next massage.

Not wanting to listen to their conversation progress further, I go back outside to tell him I can hear everything and to please STFU. He is visibly annoyed by my being upset and tells me I’m being a overly sensitive bitch and need to stop. Again, I go to bed in order to avoid causing a scene.

Now I don’t really care if my husband gets a boner during a massage. I understand he is human, but his ability to brag about it in front of me makes me uncomfortable. There are certain things I know in the back of my head (like he jerks off to porn or goes to strip clubs with his friends), but I would prefer not having it rubbed in my face. Before now I have never questioned his faithfulness to our relationship, but giving advice to another married man about cheating invites in a little bit of doubt/worry.

At first I wanted to let this just fade from my memory, but it has eaten away at me since it happened. This morning I tried to confront him about it and was again told I constantly complain and need to stop being so sensitive. 

Our friend did ask if he’d still get turned on if it were a man and he said he’d never let a man massage him. I’ve never had a massage and was really looking forward to finally getting a real one with him, but I have such mixed feelings about it now. Perhaps I really am being too sensitive...

So, am I the asshole for being upset about my husband getting turned on by a massage (from a stranger) and bragging about his ability to receive happy endings?

EDIT: when I first started writing this, I honestly thought I was upset over him being turned on by other women. I’ve come to realize I’m more worried about his faithfulness around other women. I’m sorry for the misleading title!! This has been a very confusing past couple of days, but thank you for your honest responses. I needed to hear a lot of it more than I realized.

EDIT 2: after reading through all the responses I tried to give him one final time to apologize. Instead I was told he wasn’t serious and is not going to censor himself, especially in front of friends. I now realize my feelings don’t matter as long as he looks cool for other people. Pretty sure this isn’t going to work itself out.",74,41,0.88

This is my second child. I have a child from a previous relationship from 10 years ago. This is my husbands first child and it has been a really tough road for us. Married for 5 years and we suffered with infertility until this year. We are very lucky and over joyed since we had accepted he would not have a child of his own. 

So we announce the news to close family members. The day we announce it we find out that a cousin on his side of the family is also expecting Damn near the same due date. We are overjoyed for the young couple! 

MIL informs me a few days ago that she and her sister are planning a double baby shower for me and the cousin and i just dont know how i feel about that. Ive already experienced the excitement of baby showers with my first, but my husband has not. This is the cousin first baby and she young, she should have her very own special day too. 


AITA for not wanting to share a baby shower with cousin?

EDIT: I should add: I agreed to having a shared gender reveal with the cousin. I feel like a shower is just too much sharing. And between her family and my family.. We are talking 100 people at a double shower.

EDIT AGAIN: I spoke with the cousin today about it and she feels the same as I do. She is totally on board with a shared gender reveal since it will be at a huge family event, but the shower isn't something she wants to share with people she doesn't know. 
I talked with the husband and he would like to have an event for our friends and family separate from the cousin since we arent very close to that side of the family and have no mural friends anyway.
To answer a few questions. I do not expect my in laws to foot the bill/cost and am totally willing to contribute in any way possible. We don't need to have an elaborate event, just a place for us to get together and celebrate our little miracle. I should add that I have absolutely no baby gear from 10 years ago with the expection of sentimental items that were monogramed with first childs name.  I prefer to be a  minimalist with this baby and buy as needed. I have expressed this to the in laws and they scolded me for it. 
With that said. 
There is also the issue that my family lives in a neighboring state and getting them to the shared baby shower would be about impossible since it would be in a different state. My family is poor and don't have the means for out of state travel.  I don't expect gifts, i just want the community of my loved ones.

I don't have enough money to spend on a quality fence at the moment, so I've taken to scaring the shit out of people who trespass.

Granted I don’t see everything. What I do see is a total lack of effort to intervene when the children are being completely unruly, (i.e., fighting, spitting, throwing food). I’ve never been one to really overstep on the parenting front, and usually give people the benefit of the doubt. Of course they are trying, their kids are challenging, and I should not judge. I know parenting is hard. 

At one point during the party, the older boy starts throwing his full water bottle high into the air and letting it haphazardly fall wherever. When the bottle came down smacking the ground a few feet away from my 1-year old preemie, I asked him as calmly, and as tone-sensitive as I could be to please stop throwing the bottle as it could hurt someone. His dad was right there with his head in his phone but didn’t say a word. Not a minute later, a full and open waterbottle arcs over a low hanging power line, over my preemie baby, and hits my wife’s aunt who’s sitting a few feet away in the stomach. She is wet and in shock. I turn and say “what the hell?” Dad makes no effort to apologize or parent. I run inside to grab towels and as I come back out I say to the 10-year-old, “That was one of the most braindead things to do. Not cool.” Dad pipes up, “hey they’re just kids. Chill.” I respond that they should know better and they could really hurt someone. He storms off with his boys—the party vibe was killed at that point and everyone began to leave. I fully admit that my reaction was bad. I wish I hadn’t said what I said, but I just wish the parents would step in. I feel like I have the right to protect my family, my property, and anyone I’m hosting. My sister-in-law said I do not get to speak to her son that way. I agree that it was harsh. But I was responding out of frustration and emotion-10 years I’ve watched their boys rage and act out with impunity. Just because you have no respect for other people or property, doesn’t mean you can bring your kids to my house where they act like hooligans endangering other people/property with no consequences. I’m being told that the 10 year old had a tough year. His teacher was abusive to him, etc. All terrible stuff and it makes me feel even worse for reacting the way I did. But it always seems like they have an excuse. Or some reason why they don’t need to hold their kids accountable. “Yes, what he did was wrong—it was stupid even, but he’s a kid and he’s had a really hard year and you just piled it on by swearing at him.” Am I the asshole?",244,338,0.97
562,Not the A-hole,"I'm M22, She's F21 and I met her on tinder and she was really pretty, body pics, face pics, bikini pics and she had a great body as well. We spoke for like a week and then met up last friday night at a bar near me as she was around meeting up with a friend earlier. She got there before me and said she got a table beside the window and was wearing red. I walk in and look around to the part of the bar she said she was at, and I don't see anyone resembling her pics, there's a large girl in red so I sheepishly approach her and say her name in a confusing tone. She gets up and gives me a hug and I was pretty confused at this point, I sit down and we talk for a bit and we order some beers and food and I was having a good time. She began to open up that she had some sort of medical condition and because of meds she's put on a lot of weight, like she's around 250 if I had to guess and maybe 5'7. I was having a good time but I just was not feeling it because of her weight and if she had been truthful with me from the start I never would have agreed to a date. About 1 hour in I make up an excuse of having to go to my buddies bday party and needed to leave. We split the cheque and it was kind of abrupt and I think she knew why I ended the night short. I gave her a hug and told her to have a great rest of the night and run off into the darkness. 

I instead meet up with one of my friends at her place and she wants to know the deets of the date and when I tell her everything she calls me a huge douche, an asshat, and an ass clown (laughed at that one). She said that how I was vibing with this girl and after she opened up to me I crushed her and thats what makes me an ass.

563,Not the A-hole,"I’m a 33 yr old black man living in Southern California (Orange County). I live with my wife (34, white) and two kids. We’ve been together since we graduated H.S. and have experienced each other’s phases of life. One of these phases, included my wife obtaining a license plate frame with her first car at 19 while we were dating. She’s a redhead so I assumed this came with the territory.

&#x200B;

It reads: “**THE CLOSER YOU GET...THE SLOWER I GO**”.

&#x200B;

Over a decade and a few cars, the frame disappeared and coupes/trucks were replaced with family-friendly 4-Door sedans and SUVs as we now have children (7 & 4yrs old). I never liked the frame personally, but figured it’s no big deal as it never impacted me as I never drove her car when we were dating. Now, we swap cars when needed (Costco, city driving). However, a few months ago, this frame was re-discovered and has now found its way onto the family sedan - a vehicle without tint, which I’ve had on all my cars to prevent racist bastards from causing me headaches.

&#x200B;

I was first aware of its impact a few months ago when driving near LA in traffic and unknowingly cut another driver off. He quickly sped around me, yelling obscenities with a few racial slurs, as he made sure I knew I drive like an asshole. I communicated this to the wife, explaining what seemed obvious at the time, that the frame gives off an aggressive vibe that brings the rage out of anyone. As a black man, I purposely don’t display things on my car that can insight any kind of anger as I’ve been on the receiving end of that behavior more times than I can count. Now, with kids in the car, it’s all the more reason to go as incognito as possible. Her response to me was that she liked it and decided to keep it on the vehicle.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, I heard worn brake pads from her car one morning, so I took her car out early one weekend morning to assess during my drive to the gym. On the way, I was forced to merge into the left lane (construction) as we neared a red light. As I merged, I had to hit the brakes suddenly causing the driver behind me to throw his hands up in frustration. 2 miles later I merged into the left turning lane. As I waited for green, I checked my phone and then heard honking from behind.. same guy. As I walked into the gym, he started yelling that I can’t drive like an asshole with that kind of frame on my car. 

&#x200B;

I came home upset, asking her to take the frame off the car. It only elicits anger on the road, especially knowing that she’s an aggressive driver herself and drives the kids around the most. She suggested taking it off when I need to drive it, and promptly replacing it when I hand back the keys. Frustrated, I decided I’m not dealing with her car and she can handle all the upcoming maintenance myself. Now, every time I pull into my driveway, the sight of the frame now truly bugs me more than ever... starting to wonder if I’m just over exaggerating.

I don't want to get the family tattoo, because tattoos are a commitment. I would rather choose what I put on my body.

I do love my family, very much. But, is this something I dont have to do, or am I the asshole?

I do not like nail polish or having my hair done, but my mom insists on doing so every so often to ""try it out"". I refuse, and she acts sad about it until I relent.

566,Asshole,"My family always gets this amazing strawberry cake for every celebration since I was a kid. The only thing that has changed is we now get it with chocolate frosting, because my nephews love chocolate.

My gf of two years is allergic to strawberries, so she can't have this cake. I felt really bad when we served it and she couldn't have any at all. So the next time we had cake, I picked up a chocolate cupcake for her. She split it with my nephews, who - again, love chocolate

Fast forward to this weekend. I got a job offer at a huge company that will change my life. I'll be making three times my current salary! I'll be managing an international team! So cool

Anyway, I told my gf first and she was super happy for me. I told her I was going to take my whole family out for dinner and tell them then. She offered to pick up a celebration cake. Of course, I'm going to pick the same cake we always have, except this time I'll order 4 cupcakes - so that my gf doesn't have to share with my nephews. I call the order in and she goes to pick it up the day-of. Dinner was great, whole family was super happy for me, it was an amazing day, I thought.

My gf was quiet today and when I asked what was wrong, she said

> It isn't about the money. But I didn't want to buy a cake that I couldn't eat and then pay extra, times four, for a treat that I could enjoy on my own

First, I offered to pay for the whole thing. I also told her that it's tradition, we always get that cake. It's like if she was colorblind and told us to not decorate the house green and red at Christmas, because she was the only one that couldn't enjoy it

She countered that we changed it to chocolate frosting because my nephews like it, so clearly there is room to change traditions. She also said that chocolate frosting is a preference while hers is not. I said it's because my nephews are family - not to imply that she isn't or won't be one day. 

She challenged me and asked if we had a kid who was allergic to strawberries, would my family change the tradition then? I told her I don't know, probably? How is this even relevant?

She said she felt like I don't take her into consideration (not true) and especially not as much as I give for my nephews. She even said nephews are spoiled. I can see her point that they do get a lot of what they want - which is why I got 4 cupcakes - 3 for the boys and 1 for her. 

She said she didn't want to eat cupcakes forever & that it made her feel like an outsider of my family (which she is, because we're not married)

Anyway, she's mad/sad at me for not getting a cake she can eat with the rest of the family. AITA and what should I do?",147,99,0.86
567,Not the A-hole,"Background info: I wasn't an easy child growing up and suffered from many disabilities growing up (I have Aspergers, ADHD, Anxiety, and PTSD). I was a very angry kid and was even hospitalized multiple times. My mother and stepfather didn't make it any better though because they have always been manipulative, abusive (cue the PTSD), and have downright treated me like an outsider from the time I was little. They have also disowned me in the last couple months out of anger ( a story for later, will share if you want me to).  I have also recently heard that they intend to attend my college graduation thru family.

I have worked very hard for this degree. It is a very big achievement for me (especially with all my problems) and don't want my graduation to be ruined. 97% of the time that I have some important event whether it be a birthday, my high school graduation or anything else they do something that causes chaos or makes it about them and I end up crying and it ruins it for me. When I have brought this up in the past I have gotten a ""Are you saying that I am a bad parent"" with a bunch of sobbing (my response is always no by the way). One of the only reason that I am wondering if I would be the Asshole in this is that I am going to invite my dad and my mother's mother (I am very close to her).

When I told this to my dad he said that I owed her and my stepfather this moment because of all I put them through as a kid. I feel justified to ask them not to come but is he right?

Edit: For more context on the abuse: On a constant basis, I was dragged down a hallway by my hair and arms. I had my head slammed into surfaces on almost a daily basis. When I was taken to the hospital to be treated (which was rare) the doctor was told that I slammed my head into things when I got upset.

I have a long physical therapy routine I need to do every day, so this evening I headed into the studio after doing some cardio to warm up, and a couple was in there doing an  P90X workout. I went in, said hi, said ""don't mind me, I'll just start my warmup routine back here,"" and pretty much shoved myself in the corner to start warming up. They said, ""we're only going to be in here for seven more minutes,"" and I responded, ""that's fine, I won't do anything to encroach on your space, and I'll be focused on my own thing."" 


Less than two minutes pass and she comes over and says, ""It's incredibly rude to come in while we're working out. I'd appreciate it if you'd wait for us to finish before coming next time."" All I said in response was ""duly noted"" and kept doing my warmup stretches in the corner.


What I wanted to say: ""There are no rules prohibiting the use of this room for multiple workouts.""

What I also wanted to say, ""Hey, guess what, you're not the only one with things to do, step off."" 


I realize people like to have their own space to work out without judgement, but at the same time, *it's a shared facility open to all tenants at any time.* If someone had come in while I was in the middle of my practice and wanted to start their workout, I would have just put my earbuds in and tuned them out.

569,Asshole,"Really wondering if I am the asshole in this situation or just being reasonable with finances. Thanks in advance for help. 

I have two daughters, Abby and Sarah. Abby is two years older than Sarah, and is incredibly diligent, hardworking and intelligent. She is a sophomore in high school, where she excels in all her subjects in school, and is in honors and higher level (junior/senior) classes. She attends a private school, where we pay a pretty hefty tuition, but it was obvious to me and my wife in her middle school years that she would do great there, so we bit the bullet and paid. She has proven us right in every regard.

Sarah is in the eighth grade, and has already begun to excitedly talk about how excited she is about the art program at the private school her sister attends. Sarah has a beautiful heart and is one of the kindest people I know. She is also very talented at art, but the program at our local public high school is good as well. She is not as diligent or hardworking as Abby is (or was at Sarah's age), and can be a bit of a slacker when it comes to STEM. She does alright in English and History, about average. 

Yesterday, we sat down with Sarah and explained to her that the private school was not a good fit for her like it was for Abby, and we are not going to be sending her there. She immediately burst into tears, saying she knew we didn't love her as much, think she was as talented, etc. We assured her time and time again that we did love her, we thought she was very smart and talented, but simply would not fit in at the private school, which is full of straight A students. She asked if we could look into more arts oriented programs for her, and we told her no because we simply do not see the same ratio of monetary value to educational value — Abby is essentially guaranteed a spot in the Ivies, while Sarah would be better suited for an arts school, which we do plan to pay for after she graduates high school. She told us we did not value her, preferred her older sister, etc. Abby overheard all of this and is siding with her sister, saying she will refuse to go to the private school again in the fall unless Sarah is with her.

570,Not the A-hole,"mobile, throwaway, we all know the drill. 

I’m turning 21 soon!! I’m super excited, but mostly just because I like birthdays, not for the drinking age - I had some problems in high school, and I’m now a little over 3 years sober. All of my friends know, I’m pretty open about it, and I don’t tend to go to big parties or clubs or anything that could potentially be hard for me. But I don’t have any problems with my friends drinking around me casually, like at small get-togethers or with dinner. If I’m worried about it, I just don’t go. It sucks being the only sober one at a party sometimes, but it goes with the territory. 

We’re planning a tiny party to celebrate, and one of my friends said she’d bring the booze. I mentioned that I didn’t want any, and she said something along the lines of “oh I know, but it’s for everyone else.” My other friends agreed that they wanted beer or something. I said that it was a party for me, and I really didn’t want to be the only one not drinking on my own birthday, so there wasn’t going to be any at all.

They said that was selfish and self-centered, and just because I chose not to drink shouldn’t mean they can’t either. 

I don’t really want to budge here. I feel like it’s not too much to ask for one night without alcohol, but am I wrong? AITA?",345,1082,0.97
571,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend (let’s call her Martha) and I live together. She’s dealing with mental health issues and is right now unable to work. She’s not on disability though, and therefore doesn’t have an income. I work 5 days a week, sometimes 6, because I cover all the expenses.

Rent, groceries, going out/ordering in, pharmacy/apartment stuff, and a hundred dollars a week for her therapy are roughly my expenses for the month. It’s really tough and I live paycheck to paycheck.

Martha does all the housework. Laundry, cleaning the bathroom, dusting, majority of dishes, keeping the apartment tidy, etc.  I’d say about once or twice a month I do the dishes, once a week I take out the garbage, and very rarely I cook. She generally makes dinner in our one bedroom apartment.

So lately, Martha’s been insisting that I acknowledge she “puts in half” in our relationship. At first I just agreed, but lately it’s really been bothering me and when she brought it up again today, I finally said something about it. It was something like,

“I think you put in the same amount of *effort* as I do, but I am contributing more right now- but that is OK. Your mental health isn’t in order and I understand you need time to get better, but I really need you to appreciate what I’m doing for this relationship, what I’m sacrificing, and how much I work.”

Martha *really* did not like my thinking this way. She said I’m selfish for thinking that, and arrogant, and that what she does at home is unappreciated. I told her that isn’t the case- if I had the choice, she would have a job and we would both do half the housework. I want her to understand that the current situation sucks for me and I’m working overtime to contribute.

I can’t afford stuff right now like an engagement ring, vacation, or taking time off (I don’t get any paid leave or sick days). Sometimes Martha will ask where her ring is, and it’s really making me feel like she doesn’t appreciate me or doesn’t understand. If I tell her I have zero money, she’ll say I don’t make enough at my job.

I told her tonight that while I appreciate what she does here at home, I’m still working overtime and putting in more *right now*, in order for her to get better.

TLDR; my girlfriend has mental health problems and can’t work, so does household stuff while I work full time, sometimes on the weekend as well. She asked me if I thought she put in half, and I said no, I put more in. AITA?

574,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my husband and I moved out of state recently. He moved before me and about two weeks after he moved, I came for a visit to bring the pets. In our new rental house, we don't have a driveway or parking, so we street park just like everyone else on this street. On the last day of my visit, my husband and I went out to eat and when we got back to the house, our neighbor came out of her house to inform us that we shouldn't be parking there (on the street in front of her house). She talked to us for about ten minutes about people parking there and having to get the cops involved and how she was mad about the way our rental was constructed, which has nothing to do with me or my husband. She finally stopped talking and we went inside with a funny story about our crazy neighbor.

That was about a month and a half ago, and now I'm living here. My husband started parking his car further down the street to avoid more interactions, but I recently purchased a car and there isn't room elsewhere to park, so I started parking there again. I'm not in the no parking zone, so I didn't see the problem. There's a clearly red-painted part of the curb, so I always make sure I'm not in the red, so to speak.

Today, our neighbor came pounding on our door to tell us that she's going to call the cops on us because of where we're parking, but she's trying to be a nice neighbor and ""tell us how to live in this neighborhood because I've been here for 66 years, this is just the way it is."" She also went on to say that she is unhappy that we have two dogs and she doesn't like where we put our trash bins. She continues to drone on with complaints and at one point says ""I could just call the cops, but I'm trying to be nice."" I got mad and said ""So call them."" To which she responded to my husband, ""And watch that, her mouth is going to get her into trouble one day."" Eventually we got her to leave.

After she left, my husband was kind of upset with me for how I responded, but I felt it was incredibly disrespectful of her to speak to us like that in our house. This is not someone who has earned my respected, so she doesn't deserve it. I'm not trying to cause problems, but I'm a firm believer in standing up for myself. So, am I the asshole?

577,Not the A-hole,"brand new account and throwaway for you guys. 

So Tuesday of last week I made my now ex-boyfriend dinner. He's a paleo junkie and I really wanted to impress him so I skipped class to slice fennel with a razor blade in order to garnish the strip steak I made for him. Yeah I really, really (really) loved him. I decided it would be easier to cook the steak in his kitchen so I went over to his place early (I have a code and open invite). I walked in to find half eaten Dominoes pizza on the counter (remember I sliced fennel with a razor blade because he's so ""dedicated"" to paleo) and noises coming from the bedroom. 

I walked in and he was absolutely plowing a good looking girl with a spectacular body. Fuck me for not eating pizza to impress him. I stood there in shock. She saw me over his shoulder first and started tapping furiously for him to get off. He turned around and hit me with the oh so classic ""this isn't what it looks like!"" 

I was speechless and had no idea what to do but I saw her clothes hanging over his desk chair. Because apparently I'm a petty b!tch, the only thing I could think was I wanted her to have leave his apartment without pants. I don't know, it made sense at the time. 

He came after me begging me not to overreact, I didn't say a word and took off to my car. In the days since he's gone from begging me to ""be reasonable,"" to begging me not to break up with him and promising he'll never do it again.

The thing is, I love these jeans. Yes as a trophy of me being petty and at least ruining something of hers like she had he tag teamed to ruin my heart and self esteem. But they are also a super expensive brand, they look really good on me and I like wearing them. 

So EX has gone from begging me to get back together with him to saying that me keeping the jeans is causing him ""real problems."" I don't give a slight shit about his problems but I sort of feel bad about keeping this girl's clothes. 

So I'm asking...I know I'm petty...but am I an asshole?

Edit: the plot thickens, I just woke up to following text:

""hi, Alyssa. This is the weirdest text I've ever written. I'm Madison and I was the girl in Aiden's room last week. I'm so, so, so sorry, I don't know how to say it other than that. The look on your face will haunt me for the rest of my life. Please believe me when I say I didn't know he had a girlfriend. I would have never been there had I known. You have every reason not to care, but this last year has been so hard for me, my dad died of pancreatic cancer in December and I'm struggling so hard and find myself making bad choice after bad choice which I how came to be in Aiden's room. The pants you have are the ones I bought the day before my dad died, he gave me ""permission"" to go treat myself and it's the last time I ever heard him call me by his pet name as in ""pumpkin, please don't be afraid to get you want, buy your jeans."" It would mean the world to me if you returned them to me. I know you've been hurt and I feel for you and I think Aiden is pure scum, all I want from him is getting my pants back. Please find it in your heart to return them to him or contact me directly. Thank you so much, Madison.""

So I guess I have to give them back...I'm in tears here.

Edit 2: just woke Aiden up at 5:45 (on Org Chem test day too...fuck him) with ""what's Madison's last name?"" He tried to give me the ""who's Madison?"" at first but then told him she texted me. He tried to talk me out of it but then relented so he could go back to sleep. So I looked her up on Facebook and it's pretty bare but she does have a ""instamodel"" sister who has all sorts of sad posts with like her holding her dads hand while has IV and then a somewhat touching insta memorial to her dad...so I'm thinking the text is not a lie.

Edit3: I just texted back and forth with her, we’re meeting at Starbucks at 9.


Edit4: (Wednesday evening—had tried to do a new post but mods suggested I just edit the op...so this is a cut and paste. Hope it makes sense I’m just starting on my second bottle of skinny girl so hope this makes sense) So wow, that first post got a ton of heat and I'm so thankful, really for the chance to get some input but also because a lot of you are very, very funny and I appreciated the laughs. I don't know what the overall verdict was but I'm ok to think I was being an asshole in keeping the jeans.

So like many of you saw, the girl (Madison) texted me overnight telling me about why the jeans were important to her and asking if I would give them back. We texted back and forth a few times this morning and agreed we'd meet at the Starbucks by campus so I could return them. I got there and instantly recognized her and she got up and gave me a hug which I thought was very sweet (I'm a hugger too) and she had bought me like three different varieties of venti drinks to make sure she got one I liked (or as she admitted later, she was so nervous she didn't know what to do) which I also thought was very cool. I wasn't sure whether or not I even really wanted to talk with her but the coffee was enough entre to get me to sit down. I handed her the jeans and she was very thankful and again explained the story about her dad and teared up. Lots of people told me not to believe her but if she's lying, she's a sociopath because I could tell she was really upset by it. I did my best to comfort her which I hope was well received.

So as we got past that the only things I wanted to know were: how long had she known Aiden, did she know about me being his girlfriend and was she hoping to continue seeing him. She said they met when he and some friends went to her restaurant maybe a month ago and had been texting back and forth ever since, she said last Tuesday was the first time they'd met in person and she said she swore to god she didn't know he had a girlfriend. She said after I showed up Tuesday she was so disgusted she got dressed in her spare clothes (fat lot of good it did me to steal her jeans if my plan was to embarrass her) and left and didn't even process that her special jeans were gone until about a day later when she stared bugging him to get them back but she had no interest in seeing him. She said she was so frustrated with him stonewalling her had stopped by to get my number directly but he wouldn't even do that so she got it from his neighbor who happened to hear them arguing...she'd had my number since Sunday but was too nervous to text until yesterday.

Lots more happened and I can expand more in the comments but I think i'm running out of room...anyways so our plan is she is not going to tell him that I gave her the jeans back and start to demand he pay for them or buy her a new pair. When he does, she'll just give me the money or the jeans and then we'll give him the old...""thanks for the jeans but us adults already worked it out...toodles."" Yes we are deceiving him but we both agree he deserves it.
Like I said lots more details but running into the 3000 character limit so I can say more if anyone is interested. Thank you for being so invested in my life. I've felt pretty rejected since this all went down and will have a hole in my heart for a long time...the kindness of internet strangers really, really helped for a few hours",2590,12897,0.9

so me and a mate went out shopping yesterday and I asked him if he wanted to see a movie and he agreed, we picked dumbo and went to look at the times. he then tells me he has to ask his mom for money as he spent it all on magic cards. 

his mum sends him 40$ and we see the movie. 

we then get out of the movie and I tell him I might bus home and he agrees that its home time, so I ask what bus he is taking and he goes oh my mum is picking me up. 
he also lives at home rent free. 

so we wander to where is mum will pick him up and on the walk there he starts complaining about how annoying his mum is and how unfair it was that he only got 40$ when he asked for 60$ he then called her a bitch.

I turned around and called him a man baby and walked off  

he is now mega pissed at me and I'm reevaluating the friendship.

579,Not the A-hole,"I'm the head manager for a bookstore. We have a lot of usual customers, including one that I hesitate to call that. For the sake of the story, we'll call him AJ. AJ is an older gentleman that would come into the store every single afternoon and stay until close, to the point where we have to kick him out. It wasn't a problem that he hung out, but he wouldn't leave. He would try to help clean up or would linger, saying he was ""coming"", when he really wasn't. 

At first, I wondered if he was homeless but then my co-worker and assistant manager ocassionally offered to give him rides home. She confirmed to me that he lived in a house and that he had told her that he had a job during the day. He just liked hanging out at our store. I tried to give him a break. Like I said, he's older. It was just hard to keep getting him out on the nights that I worked.

Another issue, is a popular one for bookstores. He'd buy a book, we'd watch him read it in the store and then he'd return it. He'd do this several times throughout the night, when it wasn't even nessecary for him to buy one. He could've just sat there, reading, like many do. I told him that we weren't a library and that returns weren't supposed to be for that purpose. He eventually stopped doing that. I was annoyed, but still wasn't going to say anything else because he really wasn't doing anything that was too out of the ordinary.

Until one day, I came into my shift and my assistant manager told me that the night before, she had walked out to her car and AJ was just sitting in it. He hadn't asked her for a ride that night, he had barely spoken to her. He just...got in her car. Now, keep in mind, she had closed the store and the other employees had left, so it was just her, in this empty dark parking lot and she saw a man sitting in her car. She freaked out, and was still freaed out. She said she had thought he left earlier, as she hadn't seen him in over an hour. She was also positive she locked her car, so she wasn't sure how he got in. She said she gave him a ride home because she was scared, but that she definitely didn't want to be around him again.

That was enough for me. I spoke to our district manager and explained the problem. She said that on those grounds, combined with the previous reports we had of suspicions of him stealing, that we could ban him. So, we did.

The only issue is, AJ had friends. They were used to him coming in and seeing him and chatting. They found out what we did and have chastised me for banning an ""innocent old man"" and told me that we took away something that mattered to him. I don't know if they know about the car situation, but I didn't tell them and just said I couldn't discuss it. They still frequent the store, but give me the stink eye. Even people who knew what a pest he could be, have said that he was just ""a helpful old man"".

581,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because bf knows my account. So I'll preface by saying I have no problem with porn, or my bf watching porn, I watch porn. My problem is with when and how he does it. 

He will take a shower, bring his phone, and jerk off before his shower with the water running. Sometimes he will just go to the bathroom and bring his phone and be in there for a long time. (How do I know he's actually watching porn? I do. Don't ask, I just do.) Once or twice he's gone to bed a little early and ""watched videos"" before bed. Otherwise it will just be in the middle of the day while we're watching netflix or whatever. 

We have a good sex life, ( I MEAN : when we have sex its good but he rarely initiates it.) We don't have sex as much as we used to years ago but I never turn him down

I don't care if he jerk off to porn, it just bothers me that he does it nearly every day while I'm here. 

I'm thinking about asking for a no phones in the bathroom rule

582,Not the A-hole,"I have a close friend who helped me in ways that are difficult to overstate - he's saved my life, been there for me when I've lost family members, and helped me get out of a dangerous situation. I owe him everything.

We both got new jobs last year in our field. His salary is 60k; mine is just shy of 100k.

Last year, I paid his taxes for him ($2500). I also bought him a used car when his broke down (another $2500), and paid for him to go visit his parents for his birthday. He always promised to pay me back, but never got around to it. This has been okay with me because I never lend money if I can't afford to have it not be paid back -- and I owe him a ton for all he's done for me. 

A couple of months ago, he called me drunk. He asked for $10.5k to pay for his taxes. I hesitated and said I needed time to think about it. He sounded very upset. I repeated my apology and still requested time to think about it - that I couldn't just make a big decision like that on the spot. He said ""whatever"" and hung up on me.

I know I'm being paid very well, but I also have goals that I would like to achieve such as buying a house and investing. $10.5k would be a significant strain for me, especially if he didn't pay it back. I care for him deeply and owe him for his profound help throughout the last couple of years, but I also don't want to be on his speed dial every time he needs money.

584,Not the A-hole,"I have stage four cancer and receive chemo every Monday. During these sessions my doctor pops by to chat about symptoms and we can discuss treatment plans and such. These visits are always held in an open room with other patients sitting next to you and nurses drawing blood at the same time. 

The past few weeks I’ve been experiencing some rather annoying (TMI) symptoms and radiotherapy was put on the table as a possibility. All I know about radiotherapy I had learned from my own research, and was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. I mentioned that I wasn’t sold on going through with it on top of my chemotherapy as I’m already pretty wiped out and don’t see much benefit. 

I had a visit with another doctor on my team who really stressed that radiotherapy seemed the best option. After this, I spoke with my nurse about it and decided I would like more information before deciding. 

My main-doctor is a very busy woman, I get that, and these weekly visits are normally very short just to make sure I’m healthy enough to get the go-ahead for treatment. Last week we had planned she would stop by for a bit longer than the usual 5-10 minutes so that we could discuss radiotherapy more in-depth, and she could outline her exact plans. When she came in I had a notepad full of questions and I was ready and prepared. When I brought it up she said it wasn’t on the table anymore and we shouldn’t worry about it. I mentioned a few things my nurse had said regarding the treatment and she immediately shoots those down, claiming the nurse was ‘completely wrong’ and ‘didn’t know what she was talking about’. 

To me this felt rather rude, and probably could have been handled better. 

This morning she popped in again and I stressed my symptoms were starting to affect my mental health. I was just asking if there was anything we could do to help. She brought up radiotherapy as a possibility...I was pretty mad at this point, as she told me previously it was off the table. So I brought up some of the questions I had before and was constantly met with, “we’ll discuss that when it comes to it,” or something of the sort. 

I then reminded her I wasn’t sold on radiotherapy as a whole, and that I wanted all the information before making a decision to go forward. I do not want to be bombarded right before with information and feel overwhelmed. (Which has happened a couple times in the past). She got a kind of annoyed look and started just going into auto-pilot and started describing the process of radiotherapy and when I would ask questions she would interrupt me and say she’ll get to it. 

I asked her to leave as I was just too frustrated to listen.

585,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I pay about $200/month for an assigned parking spot at our condo building. Our spot sits empty about 90% of the time because we don’t have a car. We like having the spot mainly for guests because it is difficult to find parking on our block (we live in a major city).

Last night, my sister who lives nearby asked if she could park her car in our spot on the way to airport this morning. She parks here occasionally when she goes out of town. I told her no problem. This morning she got here about 7am and found that someone was parked there. After about thirty minutes she was able to find parking on the street, but told me the city will ticket her car after 7pm so I needed to move it by then.

About an hour later I go out to the parking lot. I was annoyed that someone parked there and inconvenienced us. There were signs all around the lot about towing, so I called and had their vehicle towed. It was about 9am by the time the tow truck came, and I moved my sister’s car into my spot. My best guess is that someone who parks nearby noticed it’s usually empty and let a guest park there, but idk.

My husband said it was a bit of an asshole thing to do because we don’t really need our spot until later (7pm), so we could have given them more time to possibly move on their own. I feel I was justified because we pay for our spot and they are the asshole for parking there. There’s obviously nothing I can do to change it now, but I do feel a bit bad. So AITA?

589,Not the A-hole,"Okay so here’s the thing. I’m in college and i applied to get this internship over the summer. 

I’m taking this class. And there’s these 2 other people from my class. I get the material in class and they don’t, so we meet up in the library for “study sessions” where I tutor them sometimes.  

However, these people cheat during the tests in the class. I’m no snitch so i’m not going to tell the professor of course. But basically on the tests, when it comes to questions they do understand, they do them, and when they do not understand a question, they steak out their phone and  look it up on their phone bc the professor doesn’t pay attention to what students are doing during the test. Honestly there’s no excuse for not understanding all the material because we fucking went over it during the study session but whatever. 

So today I learned that all 3 of us applied to this internship that the professor in the class is a part of. The professor in the class will determine which of us will get in the internship. And you have to get at least a B in the final grade in his class to get the internship. All 3 of us are getting B’s, but my B is through 100% hard work and their B’s are from 50% hard work and 50% cheating. 

So I don’t want to help them study anymore. If I help them, there’s a chance that they will be able to get the internship instead of me. I don’t want to “assist” someone in beating me to get an internship. They seem to be struggling to understand the material which is why I offered to help in the first place. But half the time they cheat on the tests so my hard work has gone to waste. 

The worse thing about it is one of the people really psychologically convinced themselves that they got their B based off of hard work when they pull their phone out during every fucking test. That person claims that looking up the answers on chegg without the teacher looking was “hard work”. Pshhh. Whatever. 

Tbh idgaf about the fact that they cheat to pass. You gotta do what you gotta do, I guess. I’m mad at the fact that they don’t work as hard as me for their grade and are given the same opportunities as me, someone who worked hard for their grade. 

I know i’m under no obligation to tutor them, because I myself am not the professor, and I’m not responsible for making sure that they get the material. However I still enjoy tutoring them. Tutoring also helps me study myself because I become better at understanding the material when I explain it to someone else. But now that I know if they get B’s then they might get the internship instead of me, then I don’t want to help them anymore. Every person for themselves.

590,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so to set the scene I live in a condominium complex with assigned covered parking for every unit, assigned uncovered parking as an extra spot for the two bedroom units and uncovered guest parking. I live in a 600 square foot one-bedroom unit so my sole spot is my covered spot. The neighbors in the second floor unit above my next door neighbor have 5 people living in the same 600 square foot one-bedroom unit (mother, mother's boyfriend, 19ish daughter, 16ish daughter and a middle school age daughter) and three cars between them. 


I've had problems with them parking the mom's boyfriend's and older teenage daughter's car in my spot ever since I moved in. Usually about once a month. I've asked them to move, sent letters to the condo's management company and the HOA board but nothing seems to solve the issue. Before anyone suggests towing, our HOA's president has told me in person that he doesn't believe in towing cars for parking in the wrong place because it creates a ""toxic living environment"" and makes people ""fearful of management and the HOA."" 

One day I get home from work and the older teenage daughter's car is parked in my spot. Sick and tired of dealing with their crap, I park my car behind her car, switch on my emergency flashers and go inside to decompress after work. About an hour later the mother knocks on my door telling me I need to move my car, no apology, just a demand. I tell her that I'm busy and will move it when I am able, she continues to complain and get upset so I close the door on her and go back to whatever I was doing. About an hour later, I decide it's time enough and go out to move my car. The older teenage daughter was complaining that she was late for wherever she was going and I told her it was her own fault for parking in my spot and that this wouldn't have happened if she parked in unassigned parking. 

I've gotten really mixed feedback from this. Some neighbors and most of my friends think it was necessary to do because nothing else seems to work. My next door neighbor told me that she just parks in guest parking whenever someone parks in her spot and I'm making a big deal over nothing. The HOA/Property Management also told me that I went about it the wrong way and need to keep ""having a dialogue"" with them about parking in my assigned spot and that they'll send a ""warning letter"" to them in the mean time.

My line of thinking is that I am the owner of the condo, the spot is guaranteed to me under the condo's Rules and Regulations and I am under no obligation to let anyone park there if I don't wish.",74,167,0.99
591,Asshole,"Okay, so I have a four year old (half) sister and three year (half) old brother. About three years ago, I moved in with my mother because my dad had lost his house due to a divorce. 


Not long after I moved with my Mother, we had been homeless, due to my step dad's drug problem. We had been homeless for five months, much of the time I lived with my best friend. 

Well, we finally got a place, and for the same reasons, we had lost the apartment again. Before we had been kicked out, though, my mother sent him to California for rehab (we live on the East coast)

Well, we got yet another apartment in basically the ghetto. We've been living here since, and he had been gone for a almost two years, only came by christmas, which he stole money and went back to California for the girls he cheated on my mom with. 

He called twice after that, my sister's birthday and Thanks Giving. By Thanks Giving, my siblings didn't even recognize him. 

Now, four months ago. He died of a heroin overdose in December. 

My siblings never asked about him or cared before then, but since his death my mom had been acting like he was the best father to them, giving them a picture book of him, basically giving him a golden light. Despite the physical, mental, and financial abuse that had gone on the entire eight years they'd been together. 

Since this, every time my sister is told to do something (clean, eat, go to sleep, etc) she cries that ""she misses her daddy"". Every time she does, my mom caters her and let's her get away and do whatever she wants. The kids are getting more and more out and hand, bratty and entitled.

I told her today that the excuses won't work on me, I'm not her mother. I don't care if she misses him, and she needs to clean up her room. 

TLDR: abusive dad the kids didn't even remember died of an overdose, they use it as an excuse to get away with everything, I finally told them I don't care and it's not an excuse.

She is an American born Indian, but was pretty eager to go to India.
We had planned to have dinner with my extended family
And We both stayed at my old place till dinner. She did have to get used to it since she wasn't used to that sort of lifestyle.
But we roamed around the city till evening and had a lot of fun, which was nice.
When it was time to have dinner and everything seemed to have gone well, I sort of started noticing some minor problems. Like she wasn't helping with the dishes at all(I was) and was barely interacting with my family.

I had already introduced her to my uncle, who is by all means an exceptional man. He was sweet enough to learn English over the years and wrote us a poem in broken English.
Each time he made a mistake, which was honestly quite often since he doesn't know English well, she interrupted him by correcting him, and he would just smile, apologise and say he was working on it. Probably happened about 5 times. When I asked her to stop it since my uncle had probably worked really hard on it and it was a sweet gesture, she just excused herself to the washroom.
After the party ended, I didn't really waste time arguing with her or anything, I just told she was being really disrespectful and I wanted to break up with her.
I booked a room for her in a 3 star hotel for the night and told her to manage food and transportation. It's a big city with easily 10millon+ people, so that is not a concern.

Her friends keep texting me and saying that she is crying and upset and think I overreacted.
I honestly...don't know? Like I know about my decision, but it happened really fast and I still haven't really processed what happened.
Having a third opinion would be great. An honest opinion from your side..
Thanks.

Edit:she is in a hotel for 12 hours and then we had a flight.
Just wanted to clarify since everyone thinks I have left her for a long time. She had her dinner in the hotel.

And she said stuff like 'I didn't know anyone could pronounce English that badly' on his face, that kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

But it was a massive overreaction from my side.

I haven’t told her yet because I’m worried she will be against it automatically, but I think she will barely notice if I just wait and have the shower and tell her afterwards (like, hey can you believe that was vegan?!) I doubt she will even be focused on the food with all her friends and family there to socialize with and I am a really good cook. I’m making vegan cupcakes and vegan pulled “pork” sandwiches (she’s craving pulled pork during her pregnancy.) The cake will not be vegan unless i can find a baker who can make this particular cake without the milk and eggs-but as of now, everything else will be 100% vegan. It’s hard to believe it’s okay to celebrate the birth of a life at the expense of so many other lives, but that’s not even the main point. The main point is that I don’t think I should be expected to throw an elaborate party where I can’t eat anything.
I know this sounds selfish but the thing you have to realize is how much being vegan has changed my life. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression and been overweight. I struggled just to get off the couch. Since I went vegan I have lost weight and been able to do the things people who don’t have anxiety take for granted-like getting things ready to get out of my parents house. It has really changed my life. I can’t eat non-vegan without risking relapse back into my depression. When I eat animal products it makes me sluggish, tired, and sick to the point of having to take multiple naps a day just to get through the 24-48 hours after eating the stuff. There is really something to the connection between your gut and your brain and being vegan has made my life worth living again. 
I have worked so so hard to make her baby shower unforgettable. I have spent over a hundred dollars already just on decorations and food. The shower is technically my gift to her since I can’t afford the party and a baby gift as well. I don’t want to be the only person there who doesn’t get to enjoy the food and treats though after putting in so much work. So, will I be the asshole if I make her an unforgettable baby shower if the food just happens to be high quality vegan stuff?

tl:dr WIBTA if I throw my sister a really nice baby shower and make the food vegan so I don’t get sick?

Update: [redacted for being defensive of my position] I accept the judgment and I will throw the baby shower with non-vegan stuff just in case you’re right.

Update 2: [redacted for being defensive]

Update 3: I talked to my sister. I told her about my plans and showed her this post and she is fine with the baby shower being vegan as long as I make her real pulled pork sandwiches. We are posting on the Facebook invitation to let us know ahead of time if anyone has allergies but she’s afraid no one will come if we mention the food will be vegan. [redacted for being defensive] As I type this I am just now wondering if my sister is being nice and really she doesn’t want the food to be vegan, so I think I should ask again...WIBTA for going along with the plans with her permission or is she just being nice?

Update 4: yes, I was still being an asshole. She doesn’t want vegan cupcakes though I am going to make some for her some time anyways so she can see how good they can be. I can’t afford to make both vegan and non vegan food (mainly because it’s so much more expensive to make the vegan stuff to begin with though.)

******Important Disclaimer: Please don’t use my stupid idea to degrade vegans. This has nothing to do with the ideology of veganism and everything to do with the fact that i wanted to eat cupcakes at a party.

The Holiday is for 1 week.

Yesterday she got contacted by an old friend who lives in City A, she hasnt seen her in years, would love a meet up. She suggests spending day 3 of the holiday with her friend, spend the night at the friends house to meet her new baby and meet me in the airport the morning of day 4 (hope this all makes sense!) Im a bit peeved as its meant to be our holiday but I said that was fine, it would be cool for the two of them to hang out and it was only one day, the friend then suggests maybe they can hang out during day 2 as well and she can take my gf to see one of the sights we had originally gone there to see. I got a bit upset by this, explained I was upset and didnt think it was great to spend two of the first 3 days of the holiday apart, she said she didnt understand why I was upset and we would chat more about it today.

Today I get told the plan has changed again, she will spend the first 3 days with her friend, meet me in the airport for going to city B and spend the last 3.5 days with me. When I said I wasnt ok with this, that we are meant to be on holiday together and see the sights together I got accused of not being understanding enough and using the fact I have paid for the holiday as an excuse to dictate what happens during it.

&#x200B;

She was her best friend, she has a new baby and she hasnt seen her in 2 years, I do understand that but neither of us have been to this country before and the whole point was exploring it together.

We play real informally, just keep it in the lines and keep it going, first to win 6/10 sets wins that day. The issue is I'm generally able to win 6/1 or 6/2 and she then gets discouraged from playing again.

Well last Thursday I got a call asking if I could come in for an interview the next day for a position that is a step in the right direction of my dream job. I said  yes, and then went home and told my girlfriend. I said I’d need my car for the day so that I could make it to the interview without a problem. She got upset and said she didn’t want to have to take a cab to work, and asked if I could reschedule for next week when she had her car again.

602,Not the A-hole,"First post.

In Dec 2017, my wife (at the time) had an affair.  He, his wife, and their two children were close family friends with our family (including our two daughters).  For reference, I would see him a couple times a week in my house as he and my ex would run together, or take our collective children to school together.  (Our kids go to school together).  We were together for 17 years, all of our adult lives.  As one would expect, the affair tore both families apart.  There was a lot of lying, hiding, cheating both during and after in the affair.  Since the news of affair broke, I have moved out, maintained 50% custody and worked hard to build a new separate life for myself and children.  My ex and I have worked out ""most"" of the co-parenting challenges.  My ex has moved the man into the home I moved out of (which was confusing for the kids to say the least) and refers to him as her new family.  His kids are also living there 50% of the time.

Okay, that is enough of the backstory I think.

&#x200B;

The AITA situation I need the community's insights into:

So, it's been over a year and my daughter's birthday is coming up.  I have planned and paid for the birthday party entirely and am okay with my ex's new partner attending the party as much as I would rather he not.  My ex is requesting that we also have a ""family"" dinner in addition to the party.  A dinner which will be a a fairly intimate affair (pun intended), and she would like him to attend.  I have responded that I would be fine with her coming over for a dinner but that he is not invited or welcome.  She (my ex) is also fine with my new (and lovely) girlfriend attending this dinner.  I am struggling to accept him into this event as not only did he have an affair with my ex, right in front of my face, but has also not made any apology or shown any remorse or accountability for his actions.

&#x200B;

1. Am I justified in stating that he is not welcome to a family dinner while she (my ex) is fine with my girlfriend attending?

Considering my GF has not done anything hurtful to my ex or my children (quite the opposite) while he has participated in actions which have been very damaging to the children and our respective families.

&#x200B;

2) Am I being overly selfish in injecting my personal feelings into an event that is meant to be for my daughter, even if my ex considers this man to be her new ""family""?

&#x200B;

3) Any other way I am being an asshole? :)

Thanks!

603,Not the A-hole,"My son is 21.  He’s not in school and has no interest in going.  He has a job at Family Dollar with seemingly no interest in finding something better.  I’ve tried encouraging him to try either l, but he seems content doing what he’s doing now.  I can’t make his choices for him, it’s been difficult watching him waste his youth doing nothing. He doesn’t have a social life.  He will go to work and then come home and play video games.  All day l, every day.  He’s also become really unhealthy.  He’s always been a little chubby, but now he’s bordering on obese.  It’s very difficult to see my son who I had so much hope for turn into this.  

I think the problem is that I’ve made things too comfortable here at home.  He’s not pushing or bettering himself because he doesn’t have to and I’ve been enabling that. Besides the frustration of watching him do this to himself my wife and I have never had our home to ourselves for more than a couple days for the entire six years we’ve been married.  We both would like to move on to the next stage of our lives. 

I sat him down over the weekend and told him so.  I gave him 90 days to find and save for other housing.  He simply wants to start paying a little in rent and remain here.  That’s not a solution to any of my problems with him living here.  I remained firm and made it clear that whether or not he has found some where else, he’s out in 90 days.  He doesn’t seem to be taking it very seriously though.   The same day he went out shopping.  

I was on my own at the age of 17.  It wasn’t easy, but it really was the best thing for me.  I learned responsibility and independence.  I hoping the same thing will happen to him.  I really believe that a little struggle can make you a better person in the end.

Edit:  Some of the comments are pointing out that he’s unlikely to be hired at a better job with his education and experience.   The problem is that he refuses to even try.  I work tech support at an ISP and there have been times when they offer retirement packages to senior employees and afterwards hire a lot of new employees to replace them.  My in with the manager could have helped him get it. It’s not a fun job, but it’s a good one with decent pay once you’ve put in some time.  He has an aptitude for technology and it would be a perfect fit for him.  He wouldn’t even put in an application.  He said that he liked having a job that he already knew how to do everything.  He’s content with his current situation because he lives with all the perks of career while doing minimum wage work.  

As far as him not being able to pay deposits and what not.  I’d be willing to help with that, but just keeping the status quo because money would be tight for him doesn’t convince me.  There’s nothing wrong with someone living according to their means.  His current means would be a studio apt/shared housing and a decrease in luxurious.  The balls in his court as to how he wants to proceed, it’s part of growing up.",658,2523,0.96
604,Asshole,"So my ""friend"" came over about a week or two ago with her sibling, mind you he was never even invited in the first place she just kind of told me she was bringing him. We were supposed to smoke and she said that smoking helps calms down his autism and she wanted to ""let him out"", so I felt like I couldn't say no. She is also aware that I have two dogs, one of them being an extremely playful Boxer. So they come over, smoke a bit, play with my dog, play video games, then leave. However, he left his ""favorite"" hoodie at my place. So I mentioned this to my friend and told her that she could come over and get it on Sunday, which she never did, so she expected me to bring it to her on campus (we go to the same college.) I had no problem doing this, however my dog got to the hoodie and chewed a hole into it. So when I brought the hoodie to my friend today I told her that I would pay for it since we assumed it was around $30, however this hoodie is a VANS brand and she told me it would cost $100 to pay. I told her that $100 was absurd and that I can either sew it or get it tailored, I even have a friend that has the exact same hoodie but in a different color that she said she would sell to me for $10. My ""friend"" said she'll bump it down to $75 but that's still absurd to me because she knows I'm currently unemployed and truth is it never should've been left at my house in the first place. This situation has caused a fight and now her and her brother expect me to pay $75 for a hoodie that I've been told can be bought for at a significantly cheaper price, AITA

606,Not the A-hole,"Ok so, back story is that I was 23 and unmarried when i had my daughter and I am 27 now. My mother is in her late 60's. When I told her I was pregnant, she responded by saying, ""I thought you were more conscientiousness than that."" She was definitely disappointed and not afraid to show it. I have a good job and pay rent and utilities at me and my mom's apartment. I have a good relationship with my daughter's dad even though we are no longer together. 

Yet my mother has always acted distant when it comes to my daughter. She loves her, of course, and spends at least a day a week with her depending on mine and my ex's schedule. But she has refused to establish what my daughter should call her! My daughter has ended up calling her ""Mom"" because she would hear me call my mother that and everything else I suggested was immediately shut down or got an eye roll. She started to call her that as soon as she could talk. My daughter calls me Mommy or Mama.

It is now getting to the point where my daughter will ask me,""Mama, are you my mom?"". It makes me feel horrible that we have confused her and of course I explain that, yes, I am her mom and that Mom is only called ""Mom"" because she is my mother. I have had several conversations with my mother to try to address this as I find it very immature that she will not accept any other name. I suggested that my daughter just call her by her first name if Grandma is so offensive and she bawked at that too. 

It came to a head last night when my ex was over and corrected my daughter every time she was calling my mother ""Mom"" and instructed her to call her Grandmom (his mother is Grammy or Grandma, so this works to distinguish them and doesn't confuse her). It really upsets him that this is an issue and I see where he is coming from. She responded to him by muttering under her breath, ""So, I see this is a problem."" She then rolled her eyes, got up and went to her room to bed (skipping dinner).

 At first, it didn't bother me enough to argue about the fact that she refuses to be called Grandma, Grandmom or the like, but as my daughter gets older and she still doesn't budge, it is starting to feel like she is trying to invalidate or undermine my role as the only mother in my daughter's life. It's either that or a severe complex about her age...? I feel like if it bothers her so much, why can't she tell my daughter what to call her? She has to steal my name? It baffles me because my daughter is wonderful and I know my mother agrees with me. Shouldn't she be proud to be her Grandmother? Am I an asshole for pressuring her to conform? Should I force her to talk about it or am I being unreasonable?",40,85,0.95
607,Asshole,"After 4 yrs my old bbq finally quit on me.

Now, for the sake of the story, while I'm not extremely well off, I do have a good paying job. However, being youngish, most of my money is tied up with mortgages and rrsps, so there is not a lot of room for me to spend money. In fact I had even considered not purchasing a replacement barbeque until yesterday, when one caught my eye at Canadian Tire.

It was a simple 3 burner bbq on for $169, and although it was small and had low BTUs, I was perfectly content with it and talked myself into buying it.

I informed a staff member I would like the barbeque, and he wrote me up a slip to pay for it at the cash register, and then sent me on my way with the receipt to the back of the store to pick up the Barbeque.

I drove my car to the rear shipping dock to pick it up, and a staff member rolled up the garage door. Sitting there was a large hockey net for another customer, and a box containing a BBQ. I promptly (and with good intent) said ""I'm here for the Barbeque"". He said no problem, and I helped him load it into the car. Immideiatly my girlfriend noticed the brand name was incorrect on the box and mentioned aloud: ""I think that's the wrong barbeque"". He didnt hear her, and as for myself, realizing she was right, I pretended I didn't either.

When she said it again I shot her a ""keep quiet"" look. I quickly rationalized in my head that I had paid for the most bottom line bbq, and that any mix-up here would likely be an upgrade. As it turns out it was.

I handed the guy my receipt, he signed it, and I left.

I got home to unwrap a $1200 top of the line, bells and whistles BBQ.

So, am I the asshole, or did life just offer me a small gift? After all it's not like it was a small mom & pop shop, we're talking big corporate here.

You decide.

TL;DR: Paid for a $200 BBQ, they accidentally gave me the wrong one. I realized it as we were loading it into my car and didnt say anything, turns out it's worth $1200.

UPDATE:

After 3 days of deliberation on the matter, polling friends and family (and reddit), and a few excellent grilled soulvlaki and steak dinners later, I have reached a personal decision to keep the grill. Returning it at this point would serve no purpose.

In fact, I'm now approaching this as a reward from the universe. 

Many people might hold the opposite view, and see it negatively going forward, as bad karma.

However I'm looking at it as the powers that be giving me an opportunity.

To reject this gift would would be to interupt the positive energy that the universe is directing my way.

So often the laws of attraction try hard to connect through us, and we reject every opportunity as ""bad karma"" or as ""immoral"".

This is my free gift that keeps on giving in the form of cooking excellent meals for friends and family to bond over. So whenever you're in town next swing by and I'll throw something on the grill for you!

608,Not the A-hole,"I hope this isn’t too common of a question and I already know I’m going to get crap for doing this but let me try and explain. My sister (16) decided two years to let her hair grow longer and as a result clunks of her hair are left at the bottom of the shower that she doesn’t pick up. This seriously annoys me and I hate having to pick it up as it’s disgusting. However it only got worse when she began using a foot scrub which has small rock like bits in it which make the bottom of the tub feel like someone spilled sand in it and become tangled in her hair by the drain making it even worse to have to pick up. And even though I constantly told her to pick it up she never did as it “wasn’t a big deal” finally I had enough and took her hair and put it in the sink to force her to pick it up to teach her. This caused her to freak out and tell my mom who told me to stop as it was “just part of living with girls” I called her out as it was a double standard since she constantly forced me to close the toilet seat when I left it open wherever I was a punishment I considered fair and never objected to, which could be considered “part of living with boys” she told me to come to her and she would make my sister clean it up, which didn’t happen as she did it a few times then resorted to telling my mom she would do it later then never did it. I’m considering doing again as I have no other way of stopping my sister from continuing this habit, asking her doesn’t work, leaving it is gross, and she doesn’t think it’s her problem. I’m fine if she doesn’t clean down the shower to get the small rocks out, I can do that myself. I literally just want her to get rid of her hair as I’m sick of it, if you want long hair deal with the responsibilities That come with it. I don’t know, am I over reacting?

610,Not the A-hole,"For context, my wife and I have three kids: son (26), daughter (22), and son (17), and we live in NJ. The youngest son (17) is a junior and applying to college next year. He wants to major in English and live in a ""cool"" city - schools he is planning to apply to include Boston University, Northeastern, Drexel, NYU (bit of a reach).

&#x200B;

Oldest son: He went to MIT (we paid, although tuition was \~25% cheaper when he attended).  He is now a product manager at a big tech company (Google, Facebook, etc.)

Middle Daughter: She is in a 6-year pharmacy program at our state-institution (in-state tuition \~13k / year).

This brings us to our youngest son. Essentially, we told him we wouldn't pay sticker price. We would give him the same amount we were contributing to our daughter (\~13k, what state tuition would be) and he could make up the difference with scholarships, loans, and student jobs, if he really wanted to attend.

&#x200B;

To give you an idea of the price. Tuition for BU alone is $55,892 / year, if you include room and board, it is $72,052/year. The other schools listed aren't any better (in fact NYU is even worse).

&#x200B;

His argument:

1. We are being unfair, since we paid for a private university for his brother
2. He got to live in Cambridge/Boston for 4 years / we would be depriving him of a college experience that his older brother got

&#x200B;

Our arguement:

1. The COA for our eldest son was \~$20,000 cheaper per year (college prices rise incredibly fast)
2. Since he worked in tech, he was making about $20-30,000 /year just from summer / part-time work during school
3. Our daughter attended our state school instead of much more expensive pharmacy school options she had in better cities
4. But honestly, our main reason and what may make us assholes is that we don't consider the schools he listed much better (if at all) than Rutgers. If he was going to major in English at Columbia or Journalism at Northwestern, we would bite the bullet and pay. The main reason we paid for our eldest son was because it was MIT, and it would open doors for a lifetime. If hypothetically our eldest son wanted to go to BU (full sticker price)  versus Rutgers (in-state tuition), we wouldn't have paid either.

This happened about a month ago. Our family was at a museum and my daughter (5) wanted to go on a combine.

There is no line behind us yet so I put her behind her sister and tell her she can go after her. The boy is taking quite a bit of time. By the time he comes down there is a line of 4 or more children behind my two daughters. My first daughter starts up the stairs when it's her turn. That's when the worker/volunteer speaks up and asks if my other daughter wants to go up. So I ask her if she wants to go up with her sister and she says she wants her own turn. Not surprising, she's two. So I say ""She'll wait for her turn."" and the volunteer says ""If she wants to go she has to go now."" I was confused and trying to figure out if I was missing something. Then she asks ""If they are sisters they have to go together."" Now usually I'm a big pushover but I wasn't in the mood for this crap. So I said ""No she's going to have her own turn."" and proceeded to stand there fuming while each if my girls took their turns which in total took maybe two whole minutes.

612,No A-holes here,"I love my husband so much. He has a lot of social issues, & it's caused him to feel like he's an asshole all the time, which affects his self esteem. He’s touchy feely with me, but he hates other people touching him. I do have another post about sexual issues due to being obsessed with one particular fetish, not sure if that’s relevant.

The only reason I'd like him to find out if he is autistic or not is because I know some people who said therapy specific to having autism helped immensely. Since it's affecting his self esteem, I would love it if he could get help. My SIL has a brother & son with autism, & she’s convinced he is. I don't want him to think I'm *asserting* he’s autistic, but it’d be good for him to know if he is.

Symptoms: 

My husband cannot read facial expressions. He’s not aware of his own facial expressions either. He might stem b/c he constantly rubs the bottom right corner of his shirts or jackets to the point that he ruins them & we have to replace them. He has to leave a room if it's too bright or too loud b/c he says his brain basically goes into meltdown mode. Even going to restaurants is hard b/c they are sometimes noisy or too bright, & he has trouble functioning enough to hold a conversation with me if that's the case. He's incredibly intelligent (if that's relevant). He doesn't like the way his clothes feel on his skin. When I met him he even wore two different brands of shoes because one felt better on his right foot, & the other felt better on his left one. We're basically naked all the time at home, just so he can be comfortable, ha. At work, he sits in his office with the lights off all day, & gets frustrated when someone enters it b/c it's hard for him to focus on work again after, especially if they turn the lights on. He even took the extra chair out of his office so people are discouraged from staying in there too long (even though he's made some good friends at his job, so you'd think every now & then he'd like to slack off w/ them. NOPE, only at lunchtime b/c that's when you're *supposed* to hang out with friends at work). He's incredibly rigid when it comes to his moral code & expects everyone to act in the most ethical way, which of course doesn't always happen in the business world. He was even yelled at & called insubordinant by his boss, since he refused to lie to an important group of people over some numbers (his bosses’ boss loves him b/c he’s competent & his boss ended up being punished with 2 weeks of management training over it, lol).

620,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

I (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, I splurged on a £2000 ($2600) HP Spectre with the highest specs. I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

Now, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.

I should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.

Anyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

My mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

However, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over £500. I understand that £2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

So, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. But am I for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

\- also, I know I'm not TA for asking for the replacement, I just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether I'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(",1653,16375,0.91
621,Not enough info,"My daughter is 13. She’s been dancing since she was five, but around 2 years ago, she started taking dance much more seriously. I’m not sure when, but sometime within the last two years she has also developed an eating disorder. She has lost so much weight and is constantly fighting tooth and nail at meal times. Sometimes if she eats what she thinks is too much, she’ll spend half the night exercising in her room. I’m usually the one that drives her to dance after school. I bring snacks for her to eat in the car, but she doesn’t touch them. Last week, I decided to drive her home instead of to dance. I’ve told her that I don’t think she should be dancing after not eating. She has been miserable lately, saying that her dance teacher hates her. She is also constantly putting herself down, saying she’s fat and ugly and a horrible dancer. I hate seeing her like this, and I’m pretty sure dance has played a huge role in this eating disorder. She was very unhappy about being taken home instead of to dance, though. She claimed that dance was the only place she’s happy. And my partner said I should’ve talked about it with him first before making the decision, which I’ve done but been shut down. I admit, I wasn’t thrilled when my daughter started getting more serious in dance, having to pay extra money, having to spend the entire weekend at the studio, having her grades slip. But pulling her out now isn’t about that. Dance seems to be making her miserable, no matter how many times she says that it makes her happy. She comes home drained, snapping at the rest of the family and just wanting to disappear into her room. This eating disorder has been a nightmare, and I truly think that dance is making it worse. AITA for making the decision, on my own, to pull her out of dance?

EDIT: I’ve gotten a lot of questions about whether my daughter is in therapy and whether she has been officially diagnosed. The answer to both of these questions is yes. She’s in treatment right now, and one of her doctors suggested taking her out of dance, but she has been resisting, and we’ve been hesitant due to the fact she loves it so much. But when I took her out of dance last week, I did so with the doctor’s advice in mind. 

I am seeing a lot of suggestions that perhaps we should change teachers or studios, and I plan to look at some of those options with my partner and my daughter for a hopefully less intense atmosphere for her.",312,1635,0.97
622,Not the A-hole,"Me and my girlfriend recently switched gyms so we don't really know any of the people there yet. The other day while my girlfriend was doing squats I was on the other side of the room doing weighted pull ups when a woman approached me, told me she'd seen me around a few times and that she had wanted to get into lifting too and if I could give her some tips.

So we talked for a while, I kind of explained my split to her and how rep range, approximity to failure, diet, sleep, and training frequency mattered. 

Then my girlfriend came over and almost pulled me away from her telling me she needed me to spot her on bench. I could already tell that she seemed unhappy about me talking to this woman although I had just talked to her about training. 

Later she was upset at me but seemed to mostly supress it, but also told me what I was thinking flirting with other women. I told her it was nothing like that and we had just talked shortly about training but it didn't seem to satisfy her.

626,Not the A-hole,"
My friend was recently the victim of a ‘stalking’ situation (it turns out that he wasn’t stalking her, but being overall very creepy and clingy with her) and they stopped being friends sometime in January.

The dude that was ‘stalking’ her is in my class. He’s my lab partner, and while I don’t talk to him unless I have to, we do talk occasionally.

He keeps talking about her. This ended like three months ago and he still talks about how every time he listens to music he thinks of her. He also said that he was going to try to match classes with her so that they can talk and they can try being friends again.

I told my friend about it as a precaution. Just letting her know that he still obsesses over her and that he was trying to match classes with her and join the clubs that she’s in.

She didnt take it too well (understandably) and last week she went to the social worker about it. I had the text messages and they called me down to show them.

I guess she told them because they called me
Her mom said that the situation (him following her around, trying to find out where she lived, learning her schedule) and her decision not to be friends with him anymore based on that was my fault. She told my friend that I don’t want her to date other people (he had a crush on her), that I don’t like it when she talks to other people and that I don’t like the fact that she has other friends. That I’m manipulative and that I made everything happen and escalated it myself.

I’m confused because I didn’t *do* anything. I’ve never done anything to make her mom think that and my friend said that what she said isn’t the case.

Now I’m confused. AITA? Should I not have said anything? Was I wrong for telling my friend ? I really hadn’t meant to start anything and this isn’t a post for ‘validation’. I am genuinely confused and I’m hoping someone can point out what I did wrong, or didn’t do wrong.",16,40,0.9
627,Asshole,"So here it goes, I have a friend that I met through college and have stayed friends since then. She’s always having fundraisers and raising awareness for the Children’s Network Hospitals and has raised generous amounts of money (which is awesome  on its own) for this organization. She always gets into long-winded emotional stories about how they’ve been a blessing to her brothers wellbeing and all that. But here’s the thing, he’s not cancerous, or has any rare, debilitating disease; he’s diabetic and sucks at taking care of his wellbeing. Rarely tracks his own sugar levels, eats all kinds of junk and doesn’t even lightly exercise. He’s his own demise. Diabetes can be a serious disease if you don’t take care yourself but it is and has been a very manageable disease in the medical world (I’m diabetic myself & so has my grandmother since before I was born). So one day when she got into one her stories I mentioned to her “well maybe if your brother took better care of himself he would be just fine” and that took her overboard, she started saying that I’m a horrible friend and that I don’t know what it’s like blah blah blah. I just ended up saying “he’s diabetic, not some special fruitcake, get over yourself” and walked away.

This is going to be long.  Also, if you haven’t seen Shazam! yet, don’t read this.  There is spoilers.  

I had my son with my ex.  When we all lived in Canada, I had 50/50 custody with my ex, until my now husband and I moved to a different province.  At that time, my ex wanted to go to school full time and we agreed that I would take our son full time, and his dad would see him as often as possible.  

We had him full time for three years, then his dad moved to the place we were living and we went back to 50/50 custody.  All totally amicable.

5 years ago my husband got offered an amazing job in California.  I wanted my son to come down with us, but I felt super guilty about taking him away from his dad again so we talked about it and I told him that if he wanted to live with his dad, I understand.

He decided to stay with his dad.  TBH it sucks and I miss him every damn day.  

We send child support every 2 weeks, I text with him all the time, he comes to stay with us for 6 weeks every summer.  And we have always been super generous with gifts - we sent him $500 at Christmas.  And we are going to give him living expenses and help with the cost of his post secondary education.

So my son went and saw Shazam! on Friday afternoon.  We were going to see it Friday night.  He texted me and said “Hey the mom in the movie reminds me of you!”

Okay ... I watched the movie.  And saw the mother.  Who abandoned her kid.

Holy shit.  I was in tears.  I texted him and told him how much that hurt me.  He said it was a joke.

But I don’t feel like it was.

I am so hurt that he would do that.  I would never ignore his birthday (which is in 4 days), but I’m wondering if I should still send him the birthday money I was planning on, or if I should limit myself to a card and a phone call.

I am too upset to figure out if that would be too bitchy.  Would that make me the asshole?",40,117,0.94

631,Not the A-hole,"To tell you the truth, I dread them coming over because they terrorize my brother (9) and dog. Not in obvious ways, but they'll all be on a game and then the two of the them team up against him, not sharing my brothers own toys, getting my brother in trouble by getting him to shout words he shouldn't, like ""Nigger"" and ""Faggot"" not only that they mess up his room, get him to do shit he shouldn't be doing like jumping off his bed and calling him a pussy when he doesn't.

Now on to what they do to my dog. My dog is a 85lb/38kg German Shepherd who is 3 years old. They'll pull his tail, put their hands all over his face and mouth and also run on our wooden flooring to make my dog slide into the wall as he thinks its a game. My dog isn't aggressive at all to children and is very tolerant, but last week I saw my dog's hair going up as the younger one who was being egged on by the 14 year old told him to pull my dog's back leg. Now German Shepherds tend to get bad back legs and my dog doesn't like his leg's being touched. He basically almost snapped at him and his Dad called the dog a mutt.

This is where I stand up and fucking shout at the kids calling out the Dad (my brother) for being totally oblivious to his gremlin of children and that they are the way they are because he can't get off his fat fucking ass and see how much of little cunts they are. I eventually tell them to fuck off and never come back into our house again.

633,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my husband and I are roommates with my sister. We're all on the lease and have been living here for about 3 years. 

My sister met her current boyfriend about 6 months ago, and after dating for a month, he began staying at our place more often than not.  He basically moved in a few weeks later.  I thought that it was pretty fast, but ultimatly chose to let it go because my husband and I are planning on moveing out later this year anyway.

The last 6 months have been extremely drama filled and they fight constantly. My husband and I for the most part try and stay out of it, but inevitably, I'm the shoulder she cries on after every argument. 

I have my own problems with this guy; chiefly that he quit his job recently and basically mooches off my sister and does nothing but drink beer and play video games all day. I've told her several times I think she can find someone who cares about her more and treats her better.

The main issue though, is almost every time they get in a big fight my sister breaks up with him and kicks him out. Invariably she ends up changing her mind in the next day or two. She's done it probably 10 times in the last 2 months alone. Every time it's happened I would be supportive about the breakup initially, but when she takes him back I have to let it go. Whenever I would try saying anything even slightly negative she'd get upset after every ""make up"".

Last night she kicked him out again, but of course I get a text at 4 am this morning saying she changed her mind.

This time I had enough. I texted her back that I think she's being cruel constantly making him think he's homeless and that even if she wants to kick him out she needs to legally evict him. Until she's actually ready to make a concrete decision, she needs to stop going back and forth like this because its toxic to everyone that lives here.

She only replied that it doesn't matter as my husband and I are moving out soon and she ""hopes we're happy wherever we end up.""  I tried talking about it more and even apologized if I hurt her feelings, but she's pretty much ignoring me now.

I dont feel like what I said to her was wrong, but now I'm wondering if I should have said anything at all since she's right about it no longer being my problem soon.

They sent us pictures of the puppy and I asked if they named him yet and they said they were waiting to name the dog till after I had the baby. Now, I know the name they have in mind. When I was pregnant with my first kid - my husbo and I had mentioned it before to them and they even bought us glasses from some random restaurant with the same name. We'd call the baby ""baby Barry"" (not real name). Cut to two years later - they now act like they had nooooooo idea we ever mentioned that name. If they want to act like they had no idea, then why do I have the glasses? WHY DO I HAVE THE GLASSES??

I don't like to tell anyone the name of my unborn child, seems like bad juju.

635,Not the A-hole,"So, I'm ready to get roasted here but I will accept my judgment. I got married about 6 months ago, and my family offered to pay for most of the wedding. This was a HUGELY generous offer and I appreciated it a lot. I work in public service and there's no way I could have afforded a wedding at all. While I knew that by accepting the money, I really needed to let my family have the final word on a lot of decisions, I had one hold-out request that blew up into a huge fight. 

My parents have a neighbor, let's call him Charlie, who is just complete trash and NOTHING like any of their other friends.  I have nothing to do with him, and if he shows up at their place, I leave. He's racist, he's bigoted, he's exposed himself to women at parties as a ""joke,"" he's grabbed women while drunk, and he's a terrible alcoholic. Inexplicably, this guy is Teflon with my parents' friend group and according to them it would have been unthinkable to snub him. 

Now, we fought about this - an ugly fight. Tears were shed. I begged. My dad (he's mean) called me the ""c-word"" (and more) and threatened not to come to my wedding at all. He left me sobbing on the street and told me I was killing my mother because I am such an ungrateful bitch.

I am ... not proud of this but I caved. I was feeling vulnerable. I didn't want all the ugliness, my dad is seriously ill so every fight feels like I can't take it back, and my mom promised that Charlie would be escorted out at the first sign of trouble. I wasn't so sure, particularly because my group of friends is VERY diverse and my husband isn't white, but I trusted her that it would be okay for a few hours and I, according to her, ""wouldn't even know he's there.""

Fast forward to the wedding. Charlie gets rip roaring drunk and starts trying to fight our DJ. He's screaming ""fuck you,"" flipping him off, he's mad I guess because he doesn't like the music? The bartenders cut him off and he's escorted out. I didn't know this at the time because it was all handled so quickly. When I found out, I called the DJ and bartenders personally to apologize, but I'm livid. I'm so embarrassed. I know how easily this could have been worse, it could have just as easily been my husband's family, and I don't know that I would have ever been able to apologize enough. 

I am so angry at my parents for bullying me to invite Charlie, especially because he did exactly what I knew he would do and they act like no one saw this coming. AITA because I could have and should have walked away from their offer to pay and sidestepped the issue? Or is it fair of me to be upset because they used a generous offer coupled with a threat to blow up my family and estrange themselves to manipulate me to do something that made me horribly uncomfortable and it caused potentially disastrous consequences?",924,8427,0.94
636,Asshole,"Posting on mobile, all that fun stuff.

So obviously I (22M) have my father's last name. Only problem is I haven't seen him in 15 years. My parents separated back then and I live with my mom. Immediate family is her, my stepdad, half sister, and grandparents (on my mom's side). 

As I came into adulthood, and especially through college, I kept playing around with the idea of changing my last name. No one in my immediate family has his last name and it's the one thing connecting me to someone that had almost no impact on my adult life. A few months ago I finally brought up the idea to my mom. She wasn't crazy about it but was fine with me taking her last name.

Here's the problem. I don't want her last name. It doesn't go well with my first name. I know it's superficial but I want my name to have a nice flow to it. She wasn't happy when I brought up that point. Said that I'd be betraying the family, etc., but after all these years I want a name that is my own and is something I'm happy with.

637,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so, allow me to start by saying that this post isn't nearly as drastic as some of the others on here. I'm just having the slightest bit of internal conflict, and I'd like some outside prespective. 

I quit my job of three years roughly three weeks ago. My boss cut my pay, and I was fairly under appreciated for the amount of work I did. Another company offered me better hours, and a higher rate of pay. I did what I felt was right, put in my two weeks notice, trained my replacement, and started my new career.

Everything has been going fine at my new job. It's a bit more physically demanding, there's a lot more paperwork, and I'm definitely a bit more stressed, but it's nothing I can't handle. That being said, three days ago I got a job offer out of nowhere. I was offered a higher base pay, better commission, and better hours by another company in a completely different field. This job would also give me a normal 9-5 schedule, and weekends off. I've wanted this, but not been able to attain it for over five years.

Now, I know it's not wrong to do what's best for me, but I still feel kind of bad about leaving my new co-workers like that. A friend got me hired at my current job, and fought like hell not only to get me hired, but started at the pay I need to survive. My co-workers have been amazingly supportive and encouraging. We're getting ready to head into our peak season, and me leaving them with only two employees could be detrimental. I seriously don't want to put them in a compromising position, but I have a lot of variables to consider. Money has been tight for months, I have to move in August, and I don't have a penny saved. 

I don't want to fuck over my co-workers, but I feel like I have to make the best choice for me. I put my last job before my own personal interests, and after three years, I got fucked. I really don't want to risk losing a fantastic opportunity due to blind loyalty again. I've passed up so many good jobs, and I don't want to let any more slip. So, Reddit, WIBTA?

With bad people no less 
Some druggos, woman beaters ( this one guy in particular bashed her friends face into a barbeque) obviously after the threesome. 

Anyway, it destroys me really, and i wish she never told me but i guess she just thought she should be proud of herself or something.

I completely lack the sexual adventure both her and all her past screws have been on and i feel resentment. 

Like i say in previous posts. All ive ever really done is f***in work 60+ hours a week and she for past 3 weeks been working 12.

So, thats off track sorry but, would i be the asshole? I literally get shivers down my spine whenever it crosses my mind. My imagination is crazy. 

Edit: for those saying im nit picking at one problem but theres more im keeping away.

Yes in the first 16months of our relstionship, she had secret rendezvous with her old ""bff"" (sex buddy) behind my back however insisted its because she has no one in her life and without hom, if i ever broke up with her, shed have nothing.

Too those saying i knew since the start of the relationship, thats true.
 6months in the relationship she and i went to meet her mentally disabled brother for the first time, someone she told me she never introduced any of her boyfriends too, it wqs literally that day of arrival that she decided to tell me some guy was messaging her, and ill never forget the quote.
""Oh hes saying remember me? I fucked you as you went down on  ""girls name"".

However i tried playing it cool, i did like her, shes pretty, is a sweet girl.

And i have further resentment that she decided to work as a bikini waitress and got a guys number, much more to that story but alot as far ad i know nothing physical happened.

But i keep forgiving her mistakes, anf try to roll through and be strong but it eats me up all at once.

I feel like because i work my damn ass off, she was on a free ride. She goes from random boyfriend to random boyfriend, to meeting me. Has a house, a puppy she always wanted, a car, etc. All that i helped her do. However for 5 years she insisted on working in a cafe doing no more than 20 hours a week.

This year alone she has had 3 messages with guys shes known from work, in my history theres alot more story..

My partner came home and told me this story (as I've written above) and I sympathized with him that of course his intentions were not to offend anyone, and the dog probably loved the attention, but at the same time one should not pet strange dogs without asking as the owners don't know their intentions, you don't know what their training is, and the owner does have liability for their dog's actions. One bite = potentially an expensive issue.

640,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: 

We have our 3yo son and my 6yo stepdaughter whom I’ve been with since before she turned 2. We’re very lucky to have two healthy happy generally well behaved kids. However, they have had their share of meltdowns usually from being tired/hungry/sugar whatever. SD had definitely had worse and louder meltdowns even into the age of 6, due in part to the nature of going back and forth between households but largely due to being very spoiled by my husband’s stepfather and mother since they lived with them before I was around. For example, she would flip out about wanting something and SO’s step dad would coddle her, call her princess and sweetheart and try to give her whatever she wanted in that moment. I once witnessed him drive an hour round trip to get a stuffed animal she was screaming about. He STILL carries her around like a baby and spoils her bad behavior whenever he’s around. She actually pretty much reserves her bad/bratty behavior for when he’s around as she’s pretty good most of the time otherwise.

We were at a big party yesterday, tons of people, kids, candy, loud crowded etc and in the third hour our 3yo had a meltdown about wanting someone else’s play doh or something. He yelled and cried, I’m sure it was annoying and not cool but I was handling it by not giving into anything and was about to take him outside to calm down. This is when stepfather in law says “[3yo son’s name] what the hell is wrong with you?” (Not the first time he made a rude comment to him, but the first time he cursed AT him). I said “excuse me, but please do not curse AT my THREE YEAR OLD.”  To which he kind of awkwardly laughed and didn’t really respond. We left shortly after without saying goodbye.

Now I feel kind of bad for calling him out, and I hate having “drama” with family. I’m sure he just thinks I’m a bitch for saying anything... but dude I’ve never met a 3 year old who hasn’t had a meltdown. This guy never had babies or kids so he doesn’t get it, but I feel like any grown adult should know not to curse at someone else’s kids especially for what I would consider normal behavior. When I say “meltdown” I just mean a couple minutes of yelling and crying, not thrashing around, hitting or taking things. Not even screaming the way my stepdaughter has in front of him while he calls her princess. 

So, I know reddit often hates annoying kids, but yes, I took him outside right away so he wouldn’t annoy people and I’m not saying his behavior was ok, but I feel like it was well within the realm of normal toddler behavior. AITA for calling him out at a party?

ETA: we don’t have “rules” about adults cursing around our kids generally, and even we don’t “watch our language” when talking about other things (we’re from the northeast where saying “fucking” is like saying “um” for many people) but I feel like cursing AT someone is different.",15,26,0.87
641,No A-holes here,"AITA Honestly not even sure where to start. 

Husband announced Saturday he doesn't love me any more after getting caught out lying and generally being a knob. We had been arguing about how he keeps making a mess financially. I discussed very calmly that were both unhappy and there just doesn't seem much we can do. He says after I explain why I feel unloved that I am right, he thinks that he doesn't love me to behave the way he does. I say I understand and we should go our separate ways asI do not want to be in a marriage and be treat badly and he shouldn't want to be in a marriage with a person he doesn't love. 

He then says that he doesn't want to go home, so can I give him time to work some thing out. I basically say very honestly you cant afford to live alone so need to make peace with going home to live with your parents. He says he thinks he can, but he has made a mistake ""I talk him into the Grave"" and he just said what ever to stop the conversation. He doesn't see a way out of the mess he has created. So said he didn't love me. Now he wants to work on things and I am honestly at a point where I cannot see how to come back. I am not sure I want to try any more. He kept saying I do love you but I felt backed into a corner. 

I didn't even get upset over him saying it as it was almost a relief that its because he doesn't love me not just that he likes to torture me. I have always loved him but I am basically his mother now and he doesn't want to be in charge of looking after any part of his own life. I think he did just say it to hurt and make the confrontation stop. He is struggling to get through life and feels hopeless but he does love me. But wanted to take the cowards way out. 

I am the Asshole for just not wanting to try anymore even though I still love him. When it easy and everything is going good, he is great were great. But if any thing goes wrong it becomes my job to sort it whilst he sticks his head in the sand.

643,Not the A-hole,"Not too long ago I 'came out' to my mother. If you can really call it that. I just told her that I 'like girls and guys', you know, the stereotypical bisexual coming out shit.
For background information, I'm currently 15, a girl, and live with my mother and stepfather while my sister is at uni. 
Anyway.
After that, my mom and stepfather have been treating my best friend (let's call her Gwen) differently. They are convinced that Gwen and I are having a secret lesbian relationship behind their backs and I'm no longer allowed to have my bedroom door closed when Gwen's over.
I've told them a million times that we aren't together, that Gwen is just my friend, but they won't listen. Anytime Gwen shows any form of physical affection towards me it's gives them more reason to add more rules onto what I can and can't do when Gwen's over. 
Its unfortunate because Gwen is a really affectionate person. And sometimes I wanna cuddle with my best friend on the couch. 
I know it's their rules and their house but AITA?

EDIT: I feel like I should add more background information. Gwen has been my best friend for 5 years. Up until I 'came out' my famy loved her. We've invited her to family trips and all that. She's basically a part of the family. I dont have feelings for her in a romantic way and probably never will. 
I understand that I'm 15 and still have to follow the rules. When I ask for the reasoning of the rule, there isn't a reason that they're willing to give me.
It isn't just the 'the door can't be closed' rule either. It's the constant whispering behind my back about Gwen and accusations of me of dating her. At one point, a friend of my sister took a picture of us walking together outside and sent it to my mom. It feels like my privacy is constantly violated. Like I'm constantly under a microscope and everything I say to and about Gwen is judged.",72,78,0.91
644,No A-holes here,"This happened last friday.

My \[18M\] friend \[18F\] and I were just casually walking around the city and drinking. Usual friday stuff. We started at around 7 PM and when clock hit 11 PM she told me that she is feeling really sleepy and wants to go home. Thats understandable. 

&#x200B;

At this point both of us are drunk and we can't drive. So, she is texting her friend (Some kind of ex) and asks him to pick her up to go home. We part our ways and after 30mins I get a snapchat. She is driving around the city and drinking with other guys when she obviously told me that she wants to go home.

&#x200B;

I asked her today about this situation and she told me that she was feeling sleepy and was going home but that guy persuaded her to stay and drink with him. It wasn't her plan to continue partying but she did it anyway.

she packs her bag and gives me a hug and leaves. 

At around 10 I decided to text Hannah's mum to ask how it's going and she gets super confused at my question, I said you have my daughter right? she goes no, hannah is with her dad this weekend I have no teens with me atm. 

so she calls Hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. 

I walk over to Hannah's mums house and we drive up to Hannah's dads. 

turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, I was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out.

 when we got home I made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months.

648,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is thirteen. Her mother left more than ten years ago, and since then it’s just been me and my daughter. My ex recently decided to get back into contact with us. She sent my daughter a birthday card back in November, including money for a plane ticket to visit her in New York (we’re in California). Obviously, my daughter was ecstatic to hear from her mom and immediately wanted to jump on a plane to go, but I was hesitant and told her I needed to think about it. I mentioned maybe she could go over the summer, but now that’s coming up and I’m still uneasy. We haven’t spoken to my ex wife in practically a decade—I barely know who she is anymore. At one point, maybe when my daughter was five, she did come back, only to suddenly leave again and I had to pick up the broken pieces. I’m not sure if now is going to be any different. I suggested to my daughter that maybe I could go with her on the visit, but she didn’t like that idea. Then I suggested maybe her mom could visit us instead. My daughter hated that idea even more.

649,No A-holes here,"My husband and I have been married for 7 years. We knew from the start of our relationship that we both wanted kids and intended to adopt. Since we were both in our early 20s when we got married both agreed that it would be best to wait a few years before bringing kids into the picture. However, a year into our marriage I got pregnant with our daughter June. It was unplanned, but we were financially stable and wanted children anyway, so we were both excited to become parents. 

&#x200B;

When June was 2, we adopted a baby girl, Charlie. We were involved during the pregnancy and there for her birth. From the beginning, I felt a difference between my love for my daughters. When I held Charlie, I adored her, but it felt more like holding a friend's kid than my own. I expressed this to my husband and he said that he felt the same awkwardness, but he was sure it would pass as we spent more time with her. I agreed. 

&#x200B;

Every book/blog/website I have read says that while it's normal to feel this way at first, time spent together bonding would fix it--that it was temporary, a postpartum depression of sorts. For my husband, this was true, but 3 years later, my feelings have not changed. In many instances, behavioral issues inhibit bonding, but this is not the case. She is a wonderful little girl, who is, in many ways, more well-behaved than her sister who is 2 years older. 

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my adopted daughter. But not in the same way I love my biological daughter. I can't get over the feeling that she's *not my kid* or that I'm taking care of my friend or family members child and not my own. AITA?

&#x200B;

Note: I would never *ever* tell Charlie any of this. I don't act on my feelings or show favoritism toward June. I treat both my girls as if they were biological children. ",545,2088,0.94

I try to finish my errands and homework before going to sleep. Showering means I have to take my makeup and contacts off. I don’t like going out and feeling dirty when I come home/Iay in bed, moreover. As a result, past ~7pm, I can’t go to the library anymore to study or hang with friends. 

Sometimes my days will end as late as 5am, so I’m a little frustrated that she’s dictating my grooming schedule. Is it appropriate for her to tell me when I’m allowed to shower?

UPDATE

I touched upon all your points! Thank you.

She texted back: I can move it to 10pm. But I ask for flexibility and compromise on your end too since we’re living in a shared loft apt. I’d suggest learning to take a shower near 8-9:30pm and then going back to the library or etc. see how you feel, it’s nbd. Lots of ppl do it. You can take a shower in the morning too if u really feel dirty still. I know my request is not unreasonable cuz lots of living arrangements & dorms agree on “quiet hrs” which includes showers.

I had to buy a brand new washer and she constantly leaves piss soaked clothes in the washer like it's a hamper.

i’m a 17f first year uni student and i live in a shared accommodation area that’s sort of like a bunch of really bad quality apartments

i share a floor (one kitchen two bathrooms) with eleven other people

i went on a date with this guy (25m) a couple weeks ago and we talk sometimes just over text

(i didn’t know he was that much older than me until after our date)

i made a joke about him bringing me food and he started saying that he could stay and sleep in my room and we could cuddle

i told him i wasn’t comfortable with that a, because i’m still underage and after our first date told him i wasn’t comfortable doing anything further until i’m eighteen
b, i have anxiety and i don’t even know this guy 
c, i live with eleven other people
initially he said yeah, fair enough

but he then sent me a message saying i was being selfish and a bitch because he had anxiety too so he wanted to cuddle me and he would ‘control his urges’ 
am i the asshole?

edit: y’all are right he’s a thot i’ve blocked and will avoid him with a very wide berth from now on
just needed someone to affirm i wasn’t being overly sensitive or some shit lmao thanks 

edit: some of y’all are telling me to inform my floor
the problem is that he lives in the floor above us and his keycard gives him access to my floor, there is also 24/7 security about a hundred metres away that i can call (most of the time it’s a really nice guy with three daughters so i feel safe calling him) and if he takes any sort of action towards me i’m capable of getting him kicked off campus

661,Not the A-hole,"I had my car at the dealer for some warranty work some time back. During that time they had to remove the front windshield and rear glass. After the work was done they put the glass back on the car. This was an unnecessary step but regardless they did it.

The starting numbers of the vin are partially covered. You can still tell barely tell what the numbers are but its not 100% visible. 

So i go to the dealer who then tells me they outsourced the work to another company. I contact the company who then tells me the front windshield out of alignment isn't a big deal and the rear glass can be ""fixed"" by covering up the scratches with paint (it will supposedly blend it in with the border). I haven't responded yet but the only real fix is to replace the rear glass. This will mean a VERY expensive fix since the glass is hundreds of dollars. Not to mention getting the front windshield fixed which could easily break during realignment. In other words I would have to argue and demand that the items be replaced.

671,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want anyone I know to see this and rob my house lol

In my childhood room, in one of my drawers, I have a cookie tin filled with cash, which I've been saving up since I was a kid. Basically it's all of my childhood allowances, Chinese New Year money, money from summer jobs etc. I've never bothered to deposit any of it, so altogether, I'm guessing there's $2500 - $3000 in bills that I've saved up over the years.

Sometimes my family uses this money as ""emergency cash"". e.g. last year we needed a $300 garage repair. I gave my dad permission to use the money since we literally had no other options for paying the repairman (he didn't take card).

So, today, we were talking about something unrelated when my dad randomly jokes about my parents taking $400 out of my box when I wasn't home last week. I was really taken aback that he would even joke about it... but it turns out it actually happened. They needed cash for some errand and didn't have time to go to the bank (I've honestly forgotten what the errand was already, but it wasn't THAT big of a deal that they would need $400 in cash within minutes).

According to my dad, they've already replaced the $400, but I don't know exactly how much money was in the box to begin with so idk if they actually replaced the right amount or not (I do trust them, though, in general). I started telling them this, things escalated into a fight and we haven't spoken for a few hours.

My parents' defence is that a lot of that money was originally ""theirs"" (e.g. allowances they gave me), and I was keeping it in their house instead of being responsible and depositing it. I agree that keeping all that cash is irresponsible, but that doesn't mean there's an open invitation for my parents to use it (or go through my drawer in the first place). 

I told them they're sending me a harmful message about boundaries. But they insisted that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and that boundaries like that shouldn't exist since my mom cooks me dinner, helps with my laundry when I'm home, they pay part of my tuition, and I get to stay with them rent-free whenever I like. That's all true but I would move out permanently, pay my own tuition etc. if they told me to... they literally INSIST on paying tuition so that I have more money in my bank account in case of emergencies. They also say that I would've never found out if my dad hadn't let it slip out, and there's no point in causing a big conflict over something that's already over and done.

tl;dr I keep $2500+ in cash in a box at my parents' house. They used $400 without permission. I freaked out, they think I'm overreacting and that I shouldn't complain since we're very close and they do a lot of stuff for me.

The issue: my wife has two sisters one of whom works as the service provider for me and my company.

Last Christmas, my mother in law asked me about getting a big backyard toy for our son. I told her to talk to my husband about it. A few days later she was ordering our son the big outdoor toy, and so I figured she’d talked to my husband about it.

Well, she didn’t. My husband didn’t know about it until I brought it up the day it was being delivered. I don’t know if she did this on purpose, or if she thought that they had talked about it or what. It actually turned out OK, but it was maddening at the time. 

Our sons birthday was recently, and she specifically asked what kinds of toys to get him. Our “rules” were simple, or at least we thought. Toys that were “sturdy,” that had one (or at most 2 pieces) and that didn’t make noise. 

Our son has Autism and doesn’t comprehend some things, and once he’s been given a gift a certain way, it HAS to stay that way until it’s modified by him or else he has a meltdown. NOT A TANTRUM. 

When we went to celebrate, she got him a LOUD vehicle that does not stop unless you turn off the whole thing (and our son knows how to use on and off switches, plus there’s no volume), a bag of little cars (small and cheaply made, that will all be lost in a week) and a set of little signs and vehicle cones as accessories for the cars. 

Now, I’m NOT UNGRATEFUL, even though I sound like I am, but I’ve had to take the batteries out of the vehicle, and give him only one or two cars. My son doesn’t understand why he can’t have ALL of his toys NOW.  He doesn’t understand why the vehicle “doesn’t work anymore” and wants me to fix it. 

I hate that I’m put in this situation when we put parameters in place so this doesn’t happen, and she ignores them. 

AITA for wanting to inspect the toys, or ask for a list of what she’s going to buy him before she does, and if she doesn’t abide by our “rules” she’s not allowed to give him ANY toys??  

I know this may be excessive, and I MBTA but she doesn’t have to deal with these toys that she gives us. She doesn’t have to deal with him being mad and having a meltdown because if I hear that vehicle one more time, I’m going to break it in half myself!!  

EDIT-She also joked about the toys after giving them to him, but I don’t know if that was out of embarrassment or because she thought it was funny.  I’d say it was out of embarrassment, but she had just talked to my husband about what was acceptable the day she bought the presents. 

SECOND EDIT-Comment I made below “For the record, my husband thinks YTA (meaning IMTA). 

Even though my husband is upset about this as well, he thinks that if it gets to the point where we end up telling her she CAN’T get him toys as gifts, that she will anyway and find a way to get them to him when she babysits or some other situation (like giving him a gift in a crowded restaurant). 

I told him that if that’s the case, then she can’t see him alone, and we will stop dining out with the. He thinks that’s too excessive. I think that a boundary has to be set with her, and this is the only way to get it through to her. ",64,167,0.94

679,Asshole,"I'm using a throwaway account because I've promised not to publicize any personal struggles, but I'm in a lot of pain right now and I just have to know ... Am I the A-Hole here? My husband is in a job that overwhelms him, sandwiched in a commute from Hell. To make things worse, I have Dysautonomia, a chronic illness that leaves me unable to work or do all but a pathetic amount of housework. This leaves him to cook dinner every night, and our house is a mess of embarrassing proportions. 

I've often taken to social media as a way to fight boredom and feel a little less isolated. I only get out of the house maybe 2-3 times a week. I feel guilty about it a lot, sitting around unable to do anything while he's buried under so much stress. This may be a good time to point out that he has type 2 diabetes so he's not in great health either.

Lately I took the plunge and started actually making content. I can just put makeup on and do a video in bed. Extra bonus is that, thanks to said makeup and decent editing, I don't even look that sick. This makes me happy and I've even graduated to making videos at my desk.

Here's the problem: I still feel guilty. And my husband is rapidly resenting the fact that while he's cooking dinner, I've just posted a video. When he's cleaning the kitchen, I'm going live with the kids playing in the room. I have the kids help my husband where they can, and I do my best to balance my time. I'm there for my kids at the drop of a hat, whether I'm in the middle of a live stream or half way in or out of makeup. I don't let this take away from anything I give our kids. I just can't do much for HIM. I can't help him in his job. I can't make his commute easier. I can't hold a job myself and make more money for the family. I'm there to listen to him vent and help him with minor computer issues, but I can't provide any solid relief for him. I'm just sitting here making videos.

He now says that he feels that if I didn't waste my energy on my phone, that I'd be able to help him more. I can't convince him otherwise, even though I couldn't do any of that before. I know he's miserable, and I don't want him to be jealous, but I literally can't stand not doing anything with my time. AITA?

Edit:
It's been so painful reading these comments. So many well intentioned comment suggesting wheelchairs and mealprep ... I literally don't have it in me to sit and chop and peel stuff most days. And when I have anything at all I give it all to trying to catch up, but it's nowhere near enough. My doctors have come to the final suggestion that I just accept my level of not functioning, but I can't when I have kids that need me and my husband resents me so much.

2nd edit:
Also, I do my best to connect with him and support him emotionally. I said earlier that I listen to him vent, but I can't solve his problems and that makes him mad at me for being useless.

I've also reached out to vocational rehabilitation to try to find a job that I can do, and I literally stumped my worker. We couldn't find anything. The conversation just went back to ""if only you could ..."" She even asked how my doctors could possibly be ok with me living like this.",93,67,0.9

2. When we started dating he was very clear that he had donated sperm in the past

4. Actually ask him last week and he tells me the fertility centres last updated him at 47 kids

I was... Not expecting that many. 

It's clearly my fault for not asking how many. At the time, I literally said I ""didn't care"" about his sperm donation and ""didn't want to know"", so I can't blame him for not telling me how many. I literally told him not to.

Provider is a lot older, more conservative, says boys can’t have long hair because only girls can, used to call my son a sissy if he cried when I left him. Overall, provider gives good care but these things REALLY bother me.

I go to school full time and in the summer I’m taking all online classes so I thought this would be a good time to pull him. I let my provider know this was a POSSIBILITY (did not confirm yet) and they started bugging out, sending me messages about how much they’ll miss him, telling me how another child just let and they had to get another job to make up for that income, etc etc etc

We’ve paid for full time care the whole time he’s been in their care, but we only use 4hrs/4 days a week. Sometimes I’ll bring him there so I can run errands but the location is 20 minutes out of the way. Provider has offered for us to “hold our spot” for the summer and pay part time care and have one drop in day a week. Although I think that deal is bunk, they are trying everything to get us to stay.

I asked about her if she was single. And she is like yes but she isn’t the one looking to date. I said I would prefer her younger sister.

Linda got super upset turns out that her friend asked about me in particular, and wanted to see if I was up. I didn’t know that until after the fact. I treated it just like real life tinder.

689,No A-holes here,"First, this is completely my idea, not her idea at all. and it may be a terrible idea.

My fiancé (41F) is amazing.  She’s changed my (41M) life.  All I want to do is be with her and make her happy.   Her name is a very common and simple last name and you’d need to look over 10 pages of the phone book to find her.

I grew up Mormon.  I love my family, and we all have loved our last name.  Its strong, iconic, unique.  I’ve always loved it until I realized many of the things I’ve been taught was a complete sham and that I’ve been in a cult.  It’s made me make the worst decisions and I’ve been thru hell trying to get myself out of the hole.  I am absolutely devastated by this, my life with true happiness had only begun a few years ago when I left the church.

My dad is amazing.  My brothers and sisters and brother in law are amazing.  From small Conversations I feel like they know the church is wrong but stay because of tradition and the pleasing of their parents (many of who are dead) and for the simple fact that if they left they’d have to come to grips with all the time and money they’ve spent was a sham.  

What upsets me is “what about the next generation?”  We’re not doing what’s right for them to stay with something that isn’t honest.

Anyways, I would like to take my sweethearts name for the following reasons:
-  she is amazing and I want to be everything she stands for.  All I want to do is make her happy.
-  my name doesn’t represent who I am anymore
-  id like to send a message that what is happening with Mormon children is not right.  

I should note:  she has two children with her name.  I have 4 with my name.  To change my name would mean my 4 children would have a name different then me.

Also note:  the Mormon religion is very traditionally patriarchal, so I think that my taking the her name would be absolutely insulting to almost everyone related to me.

690,Not the A-hole,"My dad divorced my mother about ten years ago and has rented out his house to a mother and adult son. They have lived there for 6 years and have become part of the family. We all have Thanksgiving and Christmas together, they basically are family. They have a cat and a dog.

My dad has a new girlfriend. Let's call her T. after 2 years dating she moved in. She has two pit bulls a male and a female. Before she moved in I asked if they were aggressive. I was told they weren't. I asked because I bring my husky everywhere and wanted to know about her safety. Well it turns out that the male is extremely aggressive and has to be separated from any other animals. the dog of the ""tenants"" and their cat have been there for years, so it's hard keep them separated while giving preference to the family pets. the pits get locked in the master bedroom. When the pits need to go outside they lock the family dog away in a room so that they don't see each other because if they did, the male pit would kill the family dog.

When I went up to my father's house for Christmas, I noticed the cat had a limp. I learned that the male pit attacked her. she survived. They kept everyone extremely separate after this. I told T that she needed to get him castrated because he's an aggressive dog. She didnt agree and said that at 3 years old he's an ""old man"" and that she felt like that would be cruel.

I just got a call saying that in an accident the cat got left outside and the male pit chased the cat and cornered it in the backyard and killed it. My father is paying for medical bills that racked up by trying to save her.

I'm having a hard time with this because the dog is not socialized, it doesn't like other animals,the family friends and their pets have been there 6 years longer than the new girlfriend, and she refused to fix her animals. I feel like this could have been avoided if they castrated the aggressive dog and spent more time socializing and training.

Our family friend called me and told me what happened. I told her that if that happened to my dog I would give my father and T the ultimatum, that she had to castrate her dog to prevent another attack happening to the family dog in the future as well as muzzle him. And that if she didn't do that, I would call animal control and have him put down. Where my dad lives has pretty strict laws on aggressive breeds. she is giving my father the ultimatum tonight. so AITA for getting involved in the situation? I know it's not my pet, and I don't live in the house, but I feel like that cat was a part of the family and was killed in a horrific way that could have been avoided.

692,No A-holes here,"Ok so I know this sounds really bad but hear me out. 

I’m in high school and this really good friend of mine identifies as genderqueer.
I have been super supportive throughout our friendship as people can be very mean if somebody is different. 
Initially she just casually mentioned it every once in a while. She wore a lot of boys clothes and said she hated girly things. She wanted me to call her with a masculine name she chose and I have been doing that ever since she asked me. 

She started being more open about who she was and wrote she was genderqueer in her insta bio. She basically became a celebrity at our school and everyone thinks she’s super cool. I though it was great that people were so accepting. 

However, she recently got into a relationship with this guy and she changed completely. She ditched her tomboyish look, started wearing makeup, skirts etc. She also asked me to call her with her real name again. When I asked her, she told me that she still identifies as genderqueer and always posts memes about the LGBT+ community and “the struggles of being genderqueer” on her Instagram. 
She told me she still dislikes girly things like twilight and the like. (That doesn’t really mean anything though) 

I know that being genderqueer is not the same as being a trans man but I still find this behavior pretty weird. I think that she was trying to discover who she really was (and this is great) and really thought she was genderqueer for a while but now realized she isn’t but doesn’t want to lose her popularity. 

I told another friend we have in common what I think about the situation but she said I sound transphobic and I should re-evaluate my opinion.  

AITA for thinking this? 

Edit: I didn’t expect this post to get so much attention, I wanted to answer you guys but there’s too many comments, I’m really sorry.

 I didn’t want to call her out in the first place because as many of you said, it’s really none of my business. However, I wanted to know if I was a bad person for thinking this as my other friend said. I just wanted to have a discussion but I was scared of being hated at school so I came here to share my opinion and see what other people thought. I’ve received a lot of constructive criticism and I thank you guys for being really nice in the comments. 

I think that really, the only thing that bugs me is that she used to call ‘girly things’ stupid for so long and made me feel inferior for liking makeup and the such and now she likes the exact same things. But I think you are right guys, everybody is allowed to explore their identity and people change in time and I am in no place to judge her. ",101,267,0.9
693,Not the A-hole,"I (23m) am a tattoo artist (using a throwaway because my main reddit has my work username) and so is my best friend (24m). He has been dating a girl for just over a year, and she's a bit timid in behaviour. She is quite insecure and doesn't really like jokes about her, but I get on with her really well and I've done most of her tattoos. 

My buddy and I do a lot of tattoos for each other as gifts or just for a laugh, and the other day we decided to give each other silly little tattoos that we would cover up with bigger pieces we're planning in a few months time. We do this quite a lot - as people with a ton of tattoos, we don't really see a problem with getting tattoo cover ups or removal. 

Anyway, he gave me a silly tattoo of an inside joke, and I thought that was kinda sweet, to be honest. When it was my turn to get him back, he gets his ass out because he's planning a backpiece that goes down onto his ass and will cover this one. 

So, I decide to give him a tattoo of my name in a love heart, just basic linework with no colour. The thing is, my name is Connor. His girlfriend's last name is O'Connor. This didn't really click with me at the time. Basically, I give him this silly tattoo and when his girlfriend sees it, she briefly reads it as her last name (not wanting to lean down and look up close at his ass in a studio full of men) and she takes it as some sort of dedication of his love to her. She tears up a little bit with happiness, and then it gets awkward.

All of us are initially confused as to why she's so happy about this, and then it clicks. One of our other pals lets her know that it's my name and not her's, and she immediately starts balling with embarrassment and runs out of the shop. My buddy feels awful about it and he goes after her after I've wrapped the tattoo.

She says that she feels humiliated and she doesn't want to be around me for being heartless and not seeing the connection, but I really didn't mean it offensively.

694,Not the A-hole,"So off the bat, I agree with his sentiments but disagree on the way he handled it. My SO and I, along with my sister and her SO, were out for my birthday, walking around a park.  At this park there’s a large 9/11 memorial that lists all the names of the people who died and has a somber feel to it, however it’s also in a sunny spot in a beautiful public park.

My SO mentioned how some people have started taking their wedding photos in front of the memorial, and how it’s becoming an issue because it’s disrespectful; people have posted wedding photos at the memorial with all the names photoshopped out. My sister and her SO agreed and noted that the memorial in their city also has lots of people taking silly selfies and stuff that’s not appropriate for what it is.As we walked back, we noticed a wedding party (including the bride in her wedding dress, groom, kids, parents, the full party) in front of the memorial, taking photos. We couldn't walk through the memorial because of the photo-taking, so we went around. 

As we were about to come up on them, my sister’s SO and mine started joking (so we thought) about confronting the party or making them feel bad for using the site. My sister and both begged them not to, but in a slightly joking tone (we were laughing and smiling) because we didn't think they were serious. Then as we passed, my sister’s SO stayed quiet but mine went up to them and yelled out “It’s a 9/11 memorial, you shouldn’t be taking those pictures here!” or something along those lines. I couldn’t remember clearly  as I felt so embarrassed and kept walking. He didn’t linger or confront anyone directly, and by the time I glanced back he was already walking away from them.  I’m not sure how much the wedding party understood what was going on, but they definitely looked confused/concerned momentarily and stared at us as we passed. Luckily there was no further confrontation. My sister and I basically power walked away from them.

Afterwards, my sister and I basically felt it was rude and didn’t accomplish anything besides put a damper on someone’s special day, but my SO disagreed and seemed happy with what he did (and my sister’s SO agreed with him). I’ve never been embarrassed like that at something my SO’s done and I feel kind of bad I wasn’t able to be supportive - instead I just disagreed with him while not even directly facing him and then abruptly stopped talking about it. So, was my boyfriend rude, or did he do the right thing and I should support it? Did the wedding party deserve to be berated or are they free to take pictures wherever?

697,Not the A-hole,"A bit of background -- my husband and I have been married for a year, together for 3 years. He's chronically late to everything, I dont think we have ever had a date where I did not wait for him for at least 15 mins. He was let go of his previous two jobs for being late all the time. He's also late to almost every one of his classes back when we were at school together. Edit: I'm also the type to be early to everything, so I am used to waiting a bit (not just for him).

Today, I waited for my boyfriend for over 1.5 hours at a comedy show. He texted me and told me he was running late. I said it was ok since the show didn't start yet and tbh, I'm used to him being late anyway. (It was only 1:45pm, I got there early to get some seats - the show started at 2:30pm, so I lied and told him to be there at 2pm.) 

At 2:30pm, he said he was JUST leaving the house and catching the train -- he asked me if he should call an Uber and get there in 15 minutes instead of the half hour it would take for the train. Uber in NYC, during this time, is super expensive and we live FAR. So I said not to, because I could wait until 3pm and the show doesn't end until 3:30 anyway. 

Anyway, when it's 3:15pm, he says, he is walking over and I told him I'm leaving when the show is over because I'm tired of waiting for him and I'm sick of him being late to everything. 

He turns it back onto me for making him come all the way out here, getting mad at him for being late but not letting him call a car, and then leaving before he even arrives, wasting the drinks I ordered, and making him get dressed up.

I bought some stuff but then put the rest in savings for later in my life, but my mom had different plans. Without even telling me she used both my money from grandma and my brothers to pay off credit cards that were used to by appliances for the house we recently built.(however I find it infuriating that she did tell my brother she was gonna use his)

I was mad but there was nothing I could do, and I wasn’t going to keep ranting to her about it since she at least used it on useful things. However we still had her agree that she was gonna pay us back in full at a later date. Now skip to yesterday, me and a friend wanted to go to the movies and he even offered to pay since he just kinda wanted to do something other than just stay at my house. But my mom insisted we use this new credit card gift card thing she was given, we said ok and went off. After the movie was over I noticed the card was no longer in my pocket, I asked my friend if he had it but he didn’t so we started to look around the seats and everything. We ended up just telling the front office to call me if they found it.

Now skip to today when she asked me for it back, i begrudgingly tell her that I lost it at the theater some how and immediately she asks me to either pay her back or do a lot of big chores, this is when I just kinda say sorry and how I don’t even know how it could get lost (fuck me right?

Every month I spray the washer and dryer with alcohol and then run through some bleach-soaked rags so that the machines will not smell like him and get on our clothes (which we wash separately).

My daughter gagged after putting on a shirt yesterday and I realized I had forgotten to take care of the machines properly recently. My own clean clothes stank, so I sniffed every item of clothing the three of us own, gathered up the stinky ones, and then cleaned the machines. As I was throwing the bleach rags in the dryer, my father-in-law walked out the back door and saw me. He asked what I was doing and why it smelled so strongly of bleach. I told him I was just doing some monthly cleaning. I have never told him about my cleaning practices because he's made of glass and will throw toddler-like fits if confronted with anything that makes him feel bad about himself.

Why are you doing this if you hate it so much?”.  She said,” I’m so fucking sorry I vented a little frustration to my HUSBAND. Please forgive me, I’ll shut up now.”  It was hard not doing a huge eye roll and “vented a LITTLE”.  She’s been mostly giving me the quiet treatment since.  It’s awful to say, but I’m honestly not minding it that much. 

My mother has offered to be our babysitter if my wife ever wanted to return to work.  My wife is obviously unhappy, nothing I’ve been able to do has helped that.  All she’s doing is making us both miserable staying home, but she’s trying to make me feel like an asshole for asking her change the situation making her unhappy.  ",436,3402,0.97
703,Not the A-hole,"Tldr at the bottom. For context, I am a grad student and work part time at a liquor store in Florida. We have some weird regulars. I call this one ""hat guy"". Hat guy is especially creepy to me. He comes in every few days and leans into the counter to stare into my face while asking me vague pickup questions. He has lately become really insistent and fixated.

Over the months, I've started shutting him down by answering his creepy questions with things like ""no I actually don't like you at all."" To which he's always like ""ahh classic you, you're just so funny."" I've been more & more honest & direct to this guys approaches and he takes it as though I'm flirting. When I try to speak to him with just pleasant customer service script, I've gotten ""what's wrong with you today, you're usually so funny etc"" so I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't.

The other day, he came in touting to my coworker that he and I have this special connection and we're always roasting eachother. I'm a little frustrated that my clear ""no""s to him have been willfully misconstrued. So i give him the normal customer service treatment, which is sweet and not passive aggressive. He then dives into the ""what the fuck is wrong with you today"" thing. I respond, ""what, aside from being funny and smart?"" (my mistake but dude I'm fine pls leave me alone). he says, verbatim, ""I'd also say thay you're quirky, annoying, and a BITCH."" There was some real anger behind the bitch part like his vitriol is bubbling over. anyways. I quip that my husband must like me well enough. Hat guy tells me that my husband would agree with him, just ""secretly."" It fizzled down from there and he left. 

Yesterday, he came in with a woman for the first time ever in the months he's been shopping with us. As soon as they walk in, he sees me & loudly says, ""oh fuck."" He turns to the woman and mumbles something. When I check them out, he tells me he's sorry for what he said the other day. The woman he is with glances between us for more of an explanation. Seeing my opportunity to call him out, i said, ""yeah he called me quirky, annoying, and a bitch."" He frowns and grumbles ""I'll be in the car."" Before he backs all the way out, though, I look at the woman and remark, ""I would actually have full managerial support to never serve him again."" I wrap up the transaction by wishing them a wonderful weekend. He looks at her and says, ""told you"" before they both leave. The woman looked pretty shocked, but seemed less appalled at my behavior and more taken aback by his.

The revenge felt good in the moment, but I wonder if I was an asshole for using my position in customer service as a manager to embarass this man, even if he has been a creep.

Tldr: creepy customer constantly harangues me at work, going as far as to call me a bitch. He came in with a woman and I told her what he had said in an attempt to embarass him on purpose.

She told me the rejection was nothing personal and asked if it was because of that, and I just told her ""you're nice and all, but honestly, friendship is kinda like the consolation prize, or a participataion trophy, I don't wanna see you anymore that's all"". She honestly seemed kinda stunned, and she did a double take before telling me i was an asshole who is ""throwing away a genuine friendship"" and hung up.

The groom's brother is Deaf, and also has hearing aids, and he also had a completely blank look on his face, because hey, we couldn't hear anything. Neither could any senior.

I was talking to my cousin several weeks after the wedding, and I mentioned the lack of microphone, and he told me ""it was a $20 surcharge, so we decided you could all go without.""

I told him he was being unreasonable, and a dick for not even thinking that HIS OWN BROTHER, would be sitting there with nary a clue as to what was happening., and that I'd have given him the stupid $20 so that we, mostly the brother, could feel INCLUDED.

712,Not the A-hole,"My dad got a job in another country when I was 12. His parents were horrible to my mom after he left, to the point of telling her to her face that she was unfit to be a parent on several occasions. My dad knows about this but he's never stood up for my mom before, and in fact he gradually began to criticize my mom for ""disrespect"" aka her having a life that doesn't revolve around him and his parents.

&#x200B;

My sisters and I had to work with not having a dad around during our early teen years. I became a sort of emotional crutch for my mom; she told me a lot of stuff she couldn't tell anyone else, but even then I suspect she never told me the full story because she tried her best to not let her struggles influence our relationship with our dad. But by the time he switched jobs again to be ""closer to home"" and moved back when I was 16 we'd already restructured our family unit to allow for his absence. Sadly he seems to be the only one unaware of this and keeps trying to insert himself and ""be a dad"" to us when he can't even remember our birthdays.

&#x200B;

One Sunday he and I were left at the lunch table while my mom and sisters went shopping. He was going on about something and I was giving basic one-word answers while scrolling on my phone when there was suddenly a pause in the convo and then he said, ""Why aren't you looking at me when I'm talking to you? Can't you look up?""

I hadn't had a face to face convo with him since he moved back and only now did he seem to realize it. And at that moment it hit me that I was unable to do it. I couldn't even come up with good excuses, only repeating over and over that I couldn't while my heart was hammering in my chest because every time I tried to even tilt my head up I felt a very physical wave of nausea and had to stop.

&#x200B;

He wouldn't listen. He kept insisting I was his daughter, he loves me very much, why can't a father even talk to his child face to face. And I was just sitting there boring a hole into the table with my eyes because I had no good answer that didn't involve unleashing all of my resentment on behalf of my family in the middle of a busy food court. When he started raising his voice I knew I had to cut him off somehow, so I yanked off my glasses (I'm shortsighted to the point of being unable to make out facial features across a table from me) and finally looked up in his general direction.

716,Not enough info,"As background. A few months ago now, I broke up with my girlfriend of nearly three years. My reasons for doing so involve steadily feeling unhappy in an unaffectionate relationship, financial troubles in our last year and generally not wanting to feel that the person I loved resented me. 

&#x200B;

My moral conundrum began when I discovered she had left her Facebook open on my computer. I know and understand that not deleting it immediately is an asshole thing to do and I fully accept that and regret it, but my particular issue arises in what she had told her friends about me.  She told them that I didn't show her enough affection, that I did no work around the house, that I spent most of my free time playing video games (this is true) and that I had just been using her for money and sex. She and her friends had also found out I had downloaded tinder the day after the breakup. I understand that this in particular is an asshole move and have judged myself harshly on that count, my only excuse involves the hurtful things she told me in the hours proceeding from the breakup.

&#x200B;

To this, her friends rallied behind her, assuring her that I had been emotionally abusing her and that they were glad she was out of a toxic relationship. Later on, when we met in person over a coffee, she proceeded to tell me that I had been emotionally abusive towards her by not showing her enough affection and attention. I can't help but feel that this is not abuse. Symptoms of an unhappy relationship yes, but I feel like this cheapens what abuse actually is.

&#x200B;

I personally felt that she wasn't affectionate enough to me, had long since stopped being romantic, that she treated my feelings as if they were less important than hers, that she held me to higher standards than what she would hold herself to in household chores and feeling emotionally unsupported through one of the most difficult times in my life. 

&#x200B;

Do I get to call this emotional abuse? I've been mulling over this situation for months but I still can't resolve it. Am I the asshole here and blatantly in the wrong? Am I abusive, and should I seek counselling to make sure that I don't hurt another person?

Anyways, when my parents got divorced last year I definitely took the hardest emotional hit of my parents and 1 brother. It was very hard for me to adjust to life without having my dad in my everyday life. 

My mom pretty much immediately started online dating and talked to a few guys here and there all last year a couple of which I met, but none of them became close with my mom until recently. My mom found a guy and they spend a lot of time together. He’s always at our house and never they’re never at his house. Yes I have met him and shook his hand and all, but I really have no interest in getting to know him and forming a relationship with him. Therefore pretty much anytime he is at our house, I go and hide out in my room, leave in my car, or whatever etc. 

I’m not sure why but for some reason I’ve sort of taken up a habit of just getting into a bad mood when he’s over so sometimes my mother will ask me something and I’ll respond in a not rude way, but certainly not in a respectable, manner full way.

I am 16M.

My bio dad and my mom got a divorce when I was 12. Neither of them did anything horribly wrong, they just weren't compatible. It was a clean divorce and they get along well. There are no longstanding issues.

I spend the majority of my time living with my mom and her boyfriend since her house is closer to my high school, but I recently spent spring break at my dad's house. I brought this up with him, and he said I should stay out of it. My friends are also giving me mixed advice, which is why I'm posting here.

My mom has been dating this guy for about two and a half months now. Why they thought it was a good idea to move in so quickly is beyond me, but that's beside the point. Well, it's not beyond me why HE wanted to move in, but I'll get to that. Overall, this guy is okay. I'm not going to say hes great, or even good. But he's tolerable. We both don't like each other, and we both know it. Neither one of us has explicitly said nor done anything; we are not trying to start shit. We manage to just coexist.

I don't so much care about my relationship with him. I have a dad, he lives 15 minutes away and we have a good relationship. I have my driver's license I can go see him whenever I want. The only thing that really matters to me is his effect on my mom and on my younger sister (10 years old). 

My mom usually seems to be happy with him. Happier than when she was single, at least. There are no major problems at the moment, but I feel like there are some red flags that shouldn't be ignored. 

First off, he drinks too much. I'm not going to say he's an alcoholic, it's not that bad (yet). But once a week or so, he gets home real late at night a little tipsy. He's definitely not the type of person I want my mom being with when he's drunk. He's not physically violent, but he has a shortened fuse and is always looking for something to complain about. I can see how sad my mom gets, and how scared my sister gets when he's like this. There is a high probability, in my opinion, that things could get worse. It really would only take one more bump in the road for him to completely fall off. I think it's best if we get out of this situation before the inevitable.

Secondly, he's just a self-centered person. Everything he does is about him/ for him. He never does ANYTHING for other people. And when he does, it's always with a groan and because he has to. It's not like he's out working long hours to put food on the table either. He works four half-days per week bagging groceries. I, a 16 year old, work more hours, at a harder job, to get more money, and go to school at the same time. He basically uses my mom for a house and for sex (which there is a LOT of, not that it matters, really).

My mother has BPD and an apparent symptom is that she always needs to know what I'm doing. 80% of our conversations are her asking me the exact time my bus is, which class I'm going to, whether the class is over, who I'm with, which train station i'm at, and so on. This causes me a great deal of stress and has often been bad for my social life, since I'll have to always send her texts including when I'm with friends or my phone will get bombarded with texts and calls. 

In the morning, my mother insists on waking up at the same time I do and follows me around telling me what time it is and how much time I've left before my bus arrives, even though I always have my phone and/or several clocks laying around. She also often lies (consciously or not) about the time, saying it's 7:30 when it's 7:25, for example, in order to make me hurry. I have good grades and have never missed a class or an exam. The only reasons I'm late are reasons out of my control, like transportation issues (I live 1 and a half hour away from uni), or a couple of times staying in bed too long because I was physically and mentally exhausted, but it's only happened twice and I'm doing everything I can to avoid it.

Today, my mother forced me to write down my whole timetable so she could always know which class I'm in. She has memory issues because of the meds she takes, so she never remembered before. Then, she asked me the exact time my bus came every morning. I refused to tell her, hoping that way she wouldn't be able to follow me around and tell me how much time I've left. She told me I shouldn't count on her if I get sick or am in trouble from now on.

 Her constant micro-managing has taken a toll on my mental health, and I believe if I don't set boundaries right now, I'll never be able to get out of her influence. She can be an absolute delight and living with her has more upsides than downsides, but this specific part of her is ruining my life. Am I the asshole?

I'd done that several times beforehand, but now I could counter her argument that ""everyone does it"" (referring to the micro-managing). As always, her threats ended up being empty. We hugged and she said she would try to send me less messages. She refused to say anything about the bus, however. This has happened several times before (the whole ""promising she'll try harder"" thing), so we'll see if this time she actually holds onto that promise or not.

EDIT 2 : I just realized I made a mistake which might've caused some people to misunderstand what I said. I've always thought BPD was short for bipolar disorder, not borderline personality disorder.

No there are no animal rescues here... Animal control or what passes for it simply kill animals. Primary focus would be more cats or dogs (spay neuter and release). Wild animals... Not a concern sadly.

729,No A-holes here,"Throwaway - my brother uses reddit. 

I am male, 17 - (18 in August) and my girlfriend is 17,(also 18 in August). 

The other day I had her over at my house and we were just watching some TV in my room. Things led to another and we started making out, me on top of her, etc. I am not allowed to have girls in my room with the door closed and I was alright with that rule. I had my door about halfway open and I didn’t see but suddenly my door slammed all the way open so I threw myself off of her. I felt really embarrassed and bad, and I think she did too.

A little later, I took her home. When I came back my mother said “I don’t think you should have girls in your room anymore.” At the time I was still embarrassed so I just let it slide but the more I thought about it I got more upset.

When I came home later that night my family was playing games and i just went back to my room and my sister asked, “Aren’t you going to join?” and my dad responded with, “He’s probably going to clean his sheets now.” I’m not sure why but that really threw me over the edge and i just locked myself in my room for the rest of the night. I am afraid to face any of them because I feel like they’re just going to ridicule me more.

My siblings and parents have told me multiple times that I am “a grown ass man” and they use that often, except when it comes to me being my own person. I have also proven myself to be safe and smart when it comes to being sexually active. 

I want to ask to be treated a little more like an adult because I almost am and mainly just for more privacy, like maybe being able to keep the door closed. WIBTA?

edit: More information that I didn’t think of putting in. My sister is 4 years older than me and still lives with us. She can have her boyfriend spend the night and sleep in the same room, door closed etc. I’m not really sure where/when the change happens.

731,Not the A-hole,"My old roommate, who I'm not exactly friends with, but am fond of, keeps showing up without invitation(I occasionally invite him to dinner parties). Currently he is sitting at my kitchen bar drinking coffee. This is about the 8th time this has happened in 3 months. The first time it happened, I was home alone (smallish woman), it was late for me maybe 10pm, I was dog sitting, and we hear a loud knock at the door. Dog was scared, hackles up, I was scared, no one knocks on my door late at night or otherwise. After an uncomfortable half hour of me hinting he needed to leave, I finally was like I'm going to bed I'll walk you out. 

The last time he came over, he ended up interrupting our plans and needing a ride.
I have already asked him not to drop without calling first. He is very polite, though easily offended by other men. He is definetly not in any way threatening or sexually coming on to me. I don't know exactly what his living situation is, but he does have a place to stay, though he doesn't have reliable traspo.

Currently he's dragging his feet on leaving, I said I needed clean my house and have alone time a half hour ago, and he's finding reasons to stay a little longer. I feel bad it's raining but I don't want him here. AITA, for being kinda fed up with him, or his behavior normal? 

EDIT: I feel like I really need to add this. I appreciate y'alls concern. I recognize that the warning women need when they could be in potential danger and I don't want to downplay that.

733,Update ,"Original is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aneyb5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_maid_of_honor_at/

So I log into this account from time to time and still a handful of people wanting to know how things were going. I decided to wait a bit until the actual wedding so I could do one final update.
To recap, best friend moved to a city where my ex lived last year, I encouraged her to get uh touch with him, they started dating, she got pregnant and they fast tracked a wedding. She asked me to be her maid of honor, I asked this subs opinion on whether or not I was being an asshole for refusing. It was pretty mixed response but very intense on both sides. After lots of soul searching I decided I would do it.

Wedding was yesterday and it was actually a great time. It wasn’t without hard feelings. I still very much had feelings for Greg and those feelings came out in me getting very frustrated with him when he wouldn’t return emails or phone calls about what he wanted to do. But Tammy was much more patient and kind with him and it really reinforced that feelings of not, he’s not the guy for me.
The ceremony yesterday was small and very beautiful and they are so in love with each other it’s almost sickening. I cried my eyes out both out of happiness for them but also after close to 10 years off and on, Greg and I are officially “over.” It’s never happening—and that’s a good thing but still worthy of tears.

On a good note (massive /s) my dry spell with men continues and I didn’t even get laid as the maid of honor at my best friend wedding. Yay! All of Greg’s friends were married or serious and Tammy’s brothers are off limits. The awesome guy who danced with me all night long was amazing in every way but I guess my penis wasn’t big enough for him to be attracted to me. The only single available guy was Greg’s 65 year old uncle who gave me a ride on his Harley motorbike, but even that fell through and I’m about to hit the embassy suites breakfast by myself.

Anyways...as a final note, this community saved my mental health during a really rough patch and I so appreciate the moderators and commuters for helping me see things clearly enough to be an adult and be there for my best friend. As hard as it was, I would be even sadder had I not been there yesterday. Thank you again.",186,3931,0.97
734,No A-holes here,"My dad works abroad. Last week he visited my mum and me, to spend time with us for a week. My mum was at work, and I had to practise the piano for my Grade 8 exam that was the next day. (UK - Grade 8 is the highest grade in musical exams).   


While I was practising, I was struggling on a particularly hard scale. I heard my dad behind me, so i turned around and he was recording me. He said 'Don't mind me, carry on.'

&#x200B;

I resumed, but I felt under a bit of pressure due to the fact that i was being recorded. I said 'Dad, can you stop recording? It's distracting.' Then he said 'I just want to record you so that I can hear you playing after I go back to \[country\].' So I told him that I had an important exam the next day, and also due to the fact that I was playing badly it was kinda embarrassing. He seemed kinda disappointed and left.

736,No A-holes here,"I am 28 and have been married for 3 years to my college sweetheart. We realised after the wedding that we had very different expectations. There is no real love between us. I grew resigned to my situation and just accepted this is how life will be. We are civil to each other, even care to a certain point. But there is no affection or attraction.

About 1.5 years ago, a female coworker and I got put on a project that required us to spend a lot of time together. I had interacted with her before and always found her pleasant (even attractive) but time made me realise we had very strong compatibility. She was in a long term committed relationship as well. One evening, we went for dinner after work. She brought up the fact that she had noticed I had been morose at work for a few months now. I admitted that I hated my life and dreaded going home every day. She listened patiently and told me to say all these things to my wife directly. She gave me a couples counsellor’s number who had helped her sister once. Also assured me that I could rely on her at work for some time while I focus on setting things straight at home. 

Having someone care so much about me just triggered something in me. For the first time in a long time, I wanted to try and fix things instead of feeling sorry for myself. My situation didn’t improve much as I didn’t see much enthusiasm from my wife, but it did become slightly more tolerable.

Without realising it, I was spending more time at work to be able to spend time with the coworker. On one such day, I stupidly told her I liked her. After that evening, things changed. She admitted she was attracted to me too and that we were treading down a dangerous path. She said she knew I was in a vulnerable position and I wouldn’t truly try to fix things if she were constantly around and that it was unfair to everyone involved. She wanted to be around for me as a friend but nothing more. She made it very clear we could hang out but not alone and definitely not with alcohol involved. Also that she would prefer if I didn’t talk negatively about my wife with her. 

I was upset but couldn’t deny her logic. We grew distant. She still always has my back at work and helped me find another job when I was frustrated with work. She’s a good friend.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, she broke up with her long term boyfriend. She only mentioned it in passing. But it is evident how heartbroken she is. My first thought on hearing the news was happiness and that I’d not healthy. I have strong feelings for her but I do not want to hurt my wife who has finally found some bearings in our marriage. So I decided to cut off contact with the coworker. It is shitty but I still think it is kinder than the alternative.

She has very few friends and is a very private person so I don’t know how she’s holding up. She has done so much for me, I feel like I am wronging her horribly and abandoning her in her worst time. 

Am I the asshole here? What can I do differently?",117,238,0.92
737,Not the A-hole,"This is kind of hard to explain but I'll do my best. I was shopping in the grocery store with a half-cart type cart, so it's somewhat maneuverable. In the same aisle, well ahead, a woman is shopping using one of the scooter carts things that you can borrow from the store. All of the sudden, the woman starts going full speed in reverse down the aisle right at me but isn't looking where she's going at all. At first, it was no problem because the aisle was wide enough that I could move to the other side and she would just go right past me. Right before she passes by me, she turns the wheel so the scooter starts coming right at me. I didn't have any time to do anything else but basically sprint forward for a few feet to avoid a collision. After the near miss, the woman completely stops the scooter. 

I am a pretty jovial person so I turn around and jokingly say ""that was a close one"". The look on her face is pure disgust with me. She is just staring at me with this appalled look on her face. This pisses me off, because it was blatantly her fault and she wasn't looking at all. I then say ""you do realize that it was you that almost ran into me"". She starts yelling at me and blaming me for the situation. I could have probably walked away at that point but I don't mind arguing with people in public if I believe they are 100% in the wrong. So we end up going back and forth for like 5 minutes, and it was pretty hilarious. She is yelling at me about not being a gentleman and I was telling her she needs to look where she's going. At one point she yelled ""I'm handicapped"" at me, but I told her that doesn't mean she can run people over in her scooter.

The whole situation was like a scene out of Curb Your Enthusiasm, where I was Larry David. Another funny part, after the argument, we both continued to shop next (within 10 feet) to each other for like 5 more minutes. I couldn't find this specific drug my wife wanted to save my life and I guess the woman was looking for something too. Out of nowhere the woman puts it into reverse and comes at me AGAIN! I move and say ""you just almost hit me again"" to which she replies ""you shouldn't have been standing there"" and scoots off into the sunset.

738,Not the A-hole,"This girl was my best friend. We did everything together and seemingly never got sick of each other. That was until she got a boyfriend.

I’d ask and get an excuse every time, but again I wasn’t mad. 
Fast forward a few months and my best friend and her boyfriend get engaged. It was exciting and we talked about it all the time. And she told me I was her maid of honor. She told me this multiple times. Well after a few months she decided that we didn’t spend enough time together and that someone else should be her maid of honor. I found out while I was on my way back from a week long vacation, while scrolling through Facebook. Yes, I found out on Facebook. Not even from my best friend herself. I was mad and upset, texted her, and got excuses about how “we don’t hangout anymore” and “you have your own life now”.

741,Not the A-hole,"Second time posting, let's see if I can avoid an asshole verdict this time, hey? jks, I accept whatever the verdict happens to be.

So, basically my mother is a worrier, to the point where I'm certain she has generalized anxiety (Which would explain where I got it from, nature and nurture wise). She doesn't like me walking alone in the afternoons (not even at night, just because she thinks I'll stay out too long and the sun will START to set), and has specifically said she is more worried about me out alone than my brothers (including my younger brother) because I'm a girl. I do understand that. Things are crappy for everyone, but this is an issue that does more commonly affect girls. Whatever.

Right now I'm trying to become a writer in a professional sense. I know it will take a long time to make a living off of, so I've got my 'day job', but I do try to push for the career I actually want when I can. So I just discovered that there is a networking event for writers being held across town, about an hour and a half's bus ride away. I want to go there to talk to people, get tips on the industry, and hopefully show a little bit of my own work to people to see if they have any interest in it.

Since the event is on a weekday (starting around 6pm), no-one can drive me, and my parents will be too tired to pick me up when it ends at 9pm. That's fine, I'll just catch public transport. If I had any friends then I would ask them if they wanted to come so I could get a lift, but I don't so I can't.

With that being said, my mother isn't comfortable with me taking public transport across town that late at night. I understand where she's coming from, but I'm 20 years old now. If I can't go across town to network with people, how the hell am I supposed to ever start my career?!

I can't just do it anyway, either. Because the only work I can find is part-time, I haven't had the funds to reliably move out, and thus am still living under her roof. So is it a 'her house, her rules' situation? Should I listen to her and just skip the event? I desperately want to go and meet people that might be able to help with my future, but am I just being selfish/impulsive? I have done this sort of thing before when I was living in a different state to get away from her protective/controlling nature, and took all the proper precautions that time.

WIBTA if I told her that I'm going and she's just going to have to deal with it? Of course I would try to help ease her nerves about it. I would keep my phone on and charged, and would call her as many times as she wanted to let her know I'm okay. Is that (plus the fact that I'm an adult) enough to justify it?

EDIT TO ADD: Well, I talked to her. She said I had to get my license and then I can be independent. Besides the fact that it's a moot point because my grandparents chose this week to visit so I have to be at home to entertain them. So fuuuuuun.

My boyfriend and I live in a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment in a major city.

I love his brother a ton, don’t get me wrong. He’s really a great kid. We just both work extremely stressful jobs and when I come home, I like having my privacy and being able to relax. Right now, I can barely move around due to a king size air mattress in the living room, clothes and things everywhere, and empty beer cans/food all over the place.

Yesterday, I told my bf that if his brother is just planning on staying a day or two, it is absolutely fine for him to stay with us. I also said that if he is planning on staying for awhile that it may be better for him to stay with us for a bit and then stay with a friend who lives in the same city or perhaps get a hotel room. We literally barely have the space for the two of us to live comfortably in this apartment.

When she ears, she shovels food into her mouth, and frequently spits things out and eats them again.

Once I went to her house with a few other friends. It was disgusting. She'd written all over her walls, there was mould in the damn kitchen and a muddy bike on the sofa. She has two rabbits, both of which have mange and hump each other because their cage is so small and empty.

It's not a money thing as we all go to a private school, and we're all reasonably well off. It's just not okay.

744,Asshole,"So I (22M) am a masters student at university and my friend (21M) dragged me along to a birthday pres which had a lot of first year students (mainly aged 18, some 19). 

It was a mix of guys and girls. One of the drinking games is called ''Never Have I Ever'' and its almost always sexual. 

It was more of a thing you do in first year rather than other years, and people in first year usually lie about the sexual things they've done. I know this because I was a first year who used to do the same thing. My friends from year admitted they did the same too.

So during this game, there were about 4 girls (18F) and 3 guys (18M, 18M and 19M) and my friend and me. And the first years were saying stuff like ''Never Have I Ever....had sex with more than 30 people'' and they'd all drink. And ''Never Have I Ever...had sex with a teacher'' and they'd all drink. And even ''Never Have I Ever...had sex in public'' and all drank.

They had a huge /r/ihavesex vibe.

I know for a fact that these 18 year old kids, were chatting shit. An 18 year old who is coming into uni from sixth form/college is highly, highly, highly unlikely to have done all these things (especially 30 people, wtf?). I know how they feel, I've been there and done that, wanting to fit in, but I felt it was so cringey that I just called them out on it. I said ''Never Have I Ever...chatted shit about how much sex I've had'' and they all looked at me confused. So I said to them ''Look, I know you lot are first years, but I know you're chatting shit about all this stuff. You don't need to lie to fit in''.

749,Not the A-hole,"There is this guy who I met freshman year who seemed rude but had no friends so I felt bad for him. We never talked but then summer came around and he asks to video chat which we did a couple times. When summer came to an end we got brunch and he started crying in the middle of the meal talking about how he has no friends and how his roommates we assholes for not being his friends (even though they were random roommates). I tried my best to console him and give him a shoulder to cry on.

We didn’t talk for a while when he asked if I wanted to get food and a movie. This is where I began to get super uncomfortable.

He always seemed to get into some really serious topics and would say things like “if my kid was gay I would feel like a failure as a parent” and “I don't understand why girls are always afraid of men. I think it's just an excuse for them to be rude.” I tried my best to explain in a calm manner but I was honestly really upset during the whole dinner.

Somehow we got to the topic of dating and he said we might as well start dating cuz that’s what we were doing without the sex? which was kind of insane to me given this is the second time we were hanging out in like 4 months?  I kept telling him I wasn’t looking to date anyone right now but he kept insisting. He just wasn’t taking no for an answer and I was getting really uncomfortable. I was ready to end things until after the movie when he said that I was his best friend at the school which seemed so sad to me that I ignored my gut.

He asked me to go to a football game with him a while later. I spent the first couple minutes with him, then left to see someone. Coming back after the first quarter, I see him harassing a woman who was sitting next to her boyfriend. All I hear is her yelling “please just leave us alone” with a terrified look on her face. I asked him what was going on he explained that these fake fans were sitting when they should be standing for the team. He seemed to be totally proud of himself for yelling and invading this persons space after her repeatedly telling him to stop.

This is where I totally flipped the switch and listened to my gut and told him my friend needed me and goodbye. I didn't answer his texts and unfollowed/blocked him.

Near the end of the semester, he texts saying that he understands that he may have made me uncomfortable with the dating thing and that he’s sorry regardless if I respond. I thought this was mature but did not respond due to dealing with my own mental health issues that landed me in the hospital a few days later.

Yesterday he sent me a text that just says “You’re a fucking cunt.”

Am I the asshole for ghosting him? I feel really guilty but the whole “not having any empathy for anybody” and “not respecting boundaries at all” really scared the shit out of me. I don’t know where the “I’m protecting myself and having boundaries” and “Try to be as empathetic as possible” line is here.

Not to brag, but I make some damn good chocolate chip cookies. The recipe is secret and it took me years to get the way I want it. The cookies have become a staple of the retreats and the owners have started telling people about the cookies to convince them to buy a retreat spot. I don’t get paid for baking these cookies and I don’t even get reimbursed for the ingredients to make them. I started doing it just because I liked baking them and giving them to people. 

It was fun at first but now when I walk into the shop on retreat times I get bombarded with “oh did you bring cookies? Where are the cookies?” I can’t tell you the last time I got a “hi how are you” from any of the retreaters or the other staff that work solely on the retreats. Half of the people who come to the retreats don’t even know my name. They call me “cookie lady,” despite being reminded of my name several times. 

This month I’ve got a friend in town and told the owners I couldn’t cook for this month’s retreat. When one of the other retreat staffers heard this they said “we will miss your cookies.” Not “we will miss you” or even a “have a good time with your friend.” I feel like at this point my entire worth to them is placed in the damn cookies and I don’t even want to bake them for them anymore. I love baking- but part of that love is experimenting with other stuff and the one time I brought brownies instead of my cookies I got bitched at. I feel forced into making them and it’s not fun anymore. I don’t even get paid to make them, but suddenly it’s expected of me and it gets me nothing but stress and hurt feelings.  

So, WIBTA if I stopped baking them and just told people to deal with it? ",115,1117,0.97

754,Everyone Sucks,"Me (20) and my gf (18) have been dating for 18months now and in that time money has always been a difficult area for us. I work part time (2 days a week) as well as attempting to work as a musician out of my parents house - who recently have started charging me weekly rent. I also pay for my phone plan, weekly sport etc. My gf has had a job since we met for the most part up until about 3 months ago where she started Uni and decided not to work due to workload.

&#x200B;

I obviously don't mind the occasional lunch date, bowling, cinemas etc - of which I have to pay for due to her lack of funds as if I didnt pay, we literally would have nothing to do every time we hangout. Recently she asked me to pitch in for her contraception pill. Now of course my first thought was ok, $20 every couple of months isn't bad I guess... until I took into account that her Dad gives her $500 a month for 'living expenses' and I pretty much buy everything when we go on dates anyway as her dad refuses to give her money for ""food"".

&#x200B;

Of course an argument followed and I double checked actually how much I spend on ""us"" monthly... $340 to her \~$30-40 max. I brought this up with her but she stated because I offered to pay I'm now holding it over her head and thats not fair, therefore I should still pay for the pill. She also said ""food"" isn't fair point vs cinemas etc - a point I completely don't understand as when we hang out a ""lunch date"" is her favourite thing to do.

&#x200B;

AITA for saying I already pay upwards of $300 a month for us to do things therefore I don't think I should be paying for the pill?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should mention I don't mind contributing to the pill as it's a 50/50 thing and a necessity, I already sent her $20 through for this month but she refunded it. I'm just stating that I feel it's unfair for me to cover so many of 'our' finances and her to still ask me for money and use the ""it's both of our responsibilities"" excuse. 


EDIT2: She has no expenses that I’m aware of other than travel - she mainly buses to and from Uni. She also lives with her mum, doesn’t pay rent and food is provided for her.",48,37,0.78

So everyone was having a good time, drinks, finger food and the kids were having a good time running around with water guns and water bombs as it was a hot day.

The kid then continued to spray me.. after about the 4th time I said that it was enough and to please stop. The parents just kept laughing (I had not met them before the bbq). The next time the kid sprayed me, I grabbed his arm and took the water gun off him which resulted in him bawling his eyes out. I refused to give the water gun back and this resulted in the parents having a go at me. This just made me pissed off that they wouldn't discipline him themselves.

758,Not the A-hole,"So this happened about 2 months ago but I'd like your guys opinions on the situation. 

My best friend of 10 years and I have been distant for a bit as my life has been getting significantly more involved these last few years. I'm now married, working on adopting a 1 year old and have a steady and amazing career, so to say the least I'm quite busy. To top it all off he now lives in Utah for work, so when he does come to visit I try to make time for him but it doesn't always work out that way. 

Flashback to 2 months ago and my wife and I are on our way home from doing some shopping a few towns over(we live in a tiny city). He calls me and says he's coming over, but I'm obviously not home and I tell him as such and when I'll be home. Instead of an average response of ""ok"", he says to me, ""I'm gonna break into your house."" Thinking he's kidding, I let it go. 

I finally get home and I notice that his cousins truck is down the street so I assume he's waiting for me to get home. I unlock my front door and to my surprise they're both waiting for me on my couch. I was livid. All he could do was laugh, thinking it was so funny. I spent the next ten minutes yelling things like ""dude that's not fucking cool!"" He tells me he got in through my unlocked bedroom window, which makes me feel uncomfortable. 

We hung out for a few hours before I tell him to fuck off and leave, that it wasn't funny, how pissed off I really am, and that he had no right breaking into my house regardless of how funny he thought it would be. That argument escalated and now we're no longer friends. AITA??

759,Not the A-hole,"I’m a guy who’s in good shape, even though I’ve taken about a year long break from exercising, today I wanted to get back into it because of some of the side benefits - better mental clarity, better focus, and also largely because I missed the feeling of working hard and then feeling good as you slowly get better at a thing.

The one thing in the realm of exercise I’ve never really gotten into is cardio (I’m skinny, so I wanted to build muscle rather than lose weight), but today was just such a nice day I really felt like going out and taking a run. I went after sundown, because I reside on a busy college campus, and I really didn’t want to bother anyone with my expectedly poor running.

I was stopping and starting lots as I got into the rhythm of things, and probably had pretty bad running form, as it was my first time ever doing this in a public setting. A group of girls were walking on the other side of the street, probably coming from a party, and as I was taking out my earbuds to change the song I was listening to, I heard them laughing at me, pointing, and then mock cheering as I turned to look at them. This made me feel really anxious given that it’s my first time running in public, and then this anxiety started to turn into anger.

With one earbud still out, I called over to them “hey, don’t knock it till you try it! I’m sure running would work better than the other weight loss techniques have so far for you!” And then I turned away and kept running. Before you say they were possibly just laughing as a group at something else, they were definitely laughing at me.

760,Not the A-hole,"I’ll just get right into it.
My 19 year old brother got his 18 year old girlfriend pregnant and she decided to get an abortion. I am really close with both of them, and I can say with 100% confidence that they are people who are not fit to raise a child. I also think it was a good decision on her part because she has unstable mental illnesses with urges to harm herself and hormonal disorders that exacerbate her emotional state. I don’t think that she could safely go through a pregnancy. She does have a therapist and a social worker as well as regular medical providers she sought consultations with before making the decision because she has no family to support her. She and my brother both live with my parents because they work minimum wage jobs and have no education beyond high school.

When she suspected that she was pregnant, I was the first and only person she told (besides her therapist and social worker of course) and by the time she told me she had already made up her mind. She asked me if I would take her to the appointments and be there to support her through the process as a friend. She also asked that I not tell my brother because she knows that he would probably react poorly and might become irrational. I agreed with that. He is a hothead who struggles with alcohol and pills. He’s also been arrested for assaulting a neighbor over a much lesser issue. So I agreed to not tell him and just supported her through it. My brother never even knew she was pregnant. I of course was put in a really difficult position that I didn’t want to be in, but I did what I felt was right in my heart and decided to be there for her.

With that being said, I have extreme guilt over the fact that my brother had no say in this. The past few weeks I’ve been questioning myself and the morality of the situation. I’m not questioning the morals of abortion and I don’t want this to be a debate, but I am questioning the morality of not telling my brother. I almost feel like it’s his right to know.
Of course I’m not going to go back on my promise to stay quiet and tell him. If he found out he would justifiably be very upset and blow this situation up to the point I could him ending up in jail again. I also know that this girl needed my support, asked me not to tell him and that it was probably for the best. But why do I  feel so terrible about keeping it from him? Was I morally in the wrong by agreeing to  take her to the counseling sessions, consultation and doctors appointment?

761,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend of one year (we’re both 22) is currently staying with me for a month while he figures out other housing. In the meanwhile, he’s been using my car to commute to work, and going out to eat. He’s paying for gas, but he’ll often drive 10 miles out of the way for lunch, coffee, that kind of thing. It annoys me and I think it’s somewhat inconsiderate to be driving my car so much when I’m not even driving it much myself. 

I haven’t really expressed this, and today I was annoyed that he was going 20 miles out of the way for a restaurant, partially since I didn’t expect to be doing that. He badgered me to explain why I was annoyed. I said I didn’t want to explain because it wasn’t a big deal and I didn’t want to argue about it but he insisted.

When I explained that I was annoyed because of how much he was using my car, he yelled at me about how selfish and inconsiderate I was being because he wasn’t actually using my car that excessively and was paying for gas. For context, I make much more money than he does. He recently saw me filing my taxes and saw the exact amount, and referenced it. You have X money, why are you being so selfish! A lot of my friends from home make way less than you and are way more considerate and wouldn’t make such a big deal. Fine, I just don’t drive your car anymore, I’ll just Uber to work (he doesn’t have the money to do this). 

I don’t mind him using the car to get around, get groceries. It bothers me a little that he uses it to get to work every day, to be completely honest. It generally annoys me when he uses it unnecessarily, in my mind. He explained that he isn’t borrowing it for trips, or using it in any unreasonable way like that, which he’s not. 

It’s not a particularly nice car, but it is my car. I didn’t want him to stop driving it entirely, but I did want him to recognize how he was using it, and to maybe be more considerate of his usage.

763,Not the A-hole,"So, I have an 8 year old son from a previous relationship. My husband (who loves my son like his own) and I have been happily married for almost 4 years, and we have a 2 year old daughter together, whom my son ADORES. Ever since she was born, my son has been constantly asking when his last name will be the same as ours. He currently has a hyphenated last name of mine and his father's, and I kept my maiden name included with my married name. I've kinda just given him vague answers in the past, but lately he's started writing it on his school papers and asks much more frequently. 

It's gotten to where I'm considering it, because his dad hasn't ever really been a very involved dad. We split up when he just turned 2, and he didn't see him very often, nor pay child support until he was 5. He lived in our apartments for a full year, and still only saw him maybe 2 times a month for an hour or 2 at a time. Last May he up and moved for a girl across the country and he hasn't been back. He'll go for weeks or even months without talking to our son. I've brought up the idea of the name change with his father, who simply says, ""No, he'll get over it when he's older,"" and refuses to discuss it. My son calls my husband ""Dad"" and my husband is 100% a full-fledged dad to him, and he always says that my child is his son, no matter what. 

In my state, if it's determined that it's in the child's best interest to have their name changed, a judge can decide to allow the name change even without the other parent's approval. Obviously it doesn't affect that his father is still his father. So, AITA if I go ahead and petition for a name change so my son has the last name of the rest of us in our family? ",108,357,0.95

767,Not the A-hole,"Background: I moved in with one of my best friends (let's call her Kate) around 6 months ago. She grew up with several siblings and they all shared bedrooms and very much had a ""what's mine is yours"" policy. I had one older brother growing up, because of our differences we didn't share clothes and other items, and we had a lot of privacy, separate rooms with the doors always shut.

It seems our childhood habits have carried on after we've left home. I shut my bedroom door when I'm at work, but often I will come home to find it wide open. Of course it's Kate, so I'll ask her and she'll say something like ""oh I ran out of deodorant, I just had to borrow yours"". To clarify, I have NO problem sharing my stuff. I just hate the thought of someone else barging in my room without my knowledge - I'm an introvert, it's super important for me to have personal space, that's just for me, to decompress. Anyway, I told Kate many times I don't mind her using my stuff but please ask before she goes into my bedroom, unless of course it's an emergency, she needs a tampon, something like that.

I should also mention she always comes into my room without knocking when I'm in there too. I will ask her not to but she just brushes my requests away, saying that I really can't be doing anything too private (sorry if this is TMI but I don't masturbate and she knows that), but she doesn't seem to understand that you don't need to be doing something private to want privacy.

So the other day I came home from work and my bedroom door was open, not only that but my wardrobe door was open too. I looked inside and clearly Kate had been looking through it. I went downstairs and drying over the radiator was a hoodie that had been in my washing basket that morning, so she had obviously been rifling through my dirty laundry to find what she wanted to wear. 

Honestly, I really had to try and contain my anger. I waited a couple of minutes to calm down, then went and told her calmly as I could that I thought it was totally out of order that she had gone into my room and gone through my stuff without asking, when I have told her many times that I'm uncomfortable with that. She acted completely oblivious, and said I have always let her borrow clothes. I said yes, fair enough, but she KNOWS I would like her to ask before going in my room. She said it's very unfair as she trusts me and allows me in her room anytime, I never have to ask, the door is always open, and clearly I'm hiding something if I'm this secretive about my bedroom. She kept trying to twist it and make it sound like I don't trust her, and think she's going to steal or mess up my stuff. I said that's not it, I just *need* somewhere that is MINE and mine only. She doesn't understand, and has told a lot of our mutual friends. A lot of them don't care tbh and think it's just roommate drama (I guess it is lol) but the ones who do care are really on Kate's side, they say I'm being OTT. So AITA here?",37,216,0.94

771,Not the A-hole,"To give a little background, my boyfriend and I live half way across the country from his family and anytime they have ever visited him in the past (meaning in college), they stayed with him and slept on the floor in his room. However, we are now living together in a one bedroom apartment with a dog. 

His parents had told him that they were wanting to come and visit and without even asking, he told them they could stay with us. He even told me that he waited to tell me because he knew I would be pissed. 

Now this isn’t the first time that they have came to visit. Last time, they stayed in a hotel, didn’t like it, then switch to a different hotel because they didn’t want to stay with us. I’m assuming because they felt awkward about me being there. 

So, they arrived on Tuesday night and are staying till the following Thursday. To be fair, they are spending 3 of those nights visiting surrounding towns. However, the biggest issues I have are the fact that he doesn’t realize how awkward of a position it is for me. 

For example, I wake up a solid 2 hours before him and deal with our dog. However, since the only place they can sleep is in the middle of the living room, I’m trapped in our room to make sure I don’t wake them up. Additionally, I have to wait to make breakfast because of the same thing. Not to mention, I am in graduate school and I have the biggest exam of my program in 2 weeks. So I am stressing over that on top of trying to tip toe around his parents.

Fiancé is on a boys trip to Vegas this weekend. I had planned an awesome girls weekend with my best friend so I wouldn’t worry about him but she cane down with the flu so I’m a ball of anxiety. He was suppose to go play poker and that was it. The reason for this is the last time he went he got drunk at a pool wet club, passed out in a cabana and woke up to a topless girl giving him oral sex. I know that sounds insane and I didn’t believe it at first but after lots of discussions and verification of his friends I came to believe his account of the situation. It doesn’t change the fact that another girl had her mouth on his penis and it breaks my heart. 

With that in mind when this trip was announced I told him how uncomfortable I was with it after the events of last time. He promised me it was just to play poker. I was not great but ok with that. Well he texted me earlier this morning and said “he I know we talked about me not going to xxxxxx, but all guys are going and will have the car and I don’t want to get left behind.” I said back that he promised he wouldn’t go. He said the situation had changed for something couldn’t have accounted for. I told I’m again I didn’t want him to go. He asked if I was forbidding it because people in love don’t forbid anything of the other person. I said no but I wanted him to keep his promise.

773,Asshole,"Throwaway account.

Last week I sold my boyfriends Xbox and 6 of his games for £400.

I did this because for the last two months he has been depending on me financially, despite the fact I (f20) am a student who can hardly provide for myself. 

I work a part time job while studying because my student loans don’t cover the cost of living. 

Meanwhile, my boyfriend (M22) has been out of a job for two months and lives in a flat by himself. In those two months he has put almost no effort into finding a new job. Instead he was spending all his time playing on his Xbox, literally depending on me for money.

Last week I just kinda lost it, I was fed up of him putting no effort into getting money, and I didn’t want to pay for another months rent, so I instead sold his Xbox and games without his consent in order to pay his rent. 

I do feel guilty but I’m hoping at least someone understands my reasoning. AITA?


*Edit 1 
Why didn’t I communicate like an adult?
 
I tried talking through with him like an adult on numerous occasions. I tried explaining that I can’t afford to keep paying for his food, bills, rent and everything else he needs to get by. He has borderline nothing in the bank account. 
Every single time I talked to him about his job search or tried talking to him, he would shrug it off, he never put any effort into the conversation.
It was always a case of ‘yeah yeah I’ll start looking tomorrow’ or ‘yeah I know’ ‘yeah’.
He never stared looking for a job as far as I knows. 

I felt like him being on his Xbox was the sole reason, wasting all his time on that instead of productively searching for jobs. I did use the money for rent because it was due, and he would’ve had nothing to pay for it, but also because I thought it would be good to have that distraction out of his life. 

*Edit 2 
Why didn’t you just let him get evicted?

I didn’t want him to become homeless. He isn’t that close to his parents and so can not rely on moving into their home. I think losing an Xbox is way better than becoming homeless.

*Edit 3
I know what I did was illegal and theft. See last point from edit 2.
My boyfriend was furious when he found out I sold his Xbox, but he never bought up charges, he never said he would sue or report to the police - he knows that he depends on me financially.

*Edit 4
Yes I understand this is theft, no need to keep repeating it in every single comment.

Saying that I think I will break up with him soon.
I say this because so many of these comments have been saying dump him

*Edit 5
My last edit sounded way worse than I intended. 
I said I think I will, I didn’t say when. I don’t mean right now right this second and leave him with nothing. I read pretty much every single comment on this post, and a lot of things mentioned made me realise I can’t keep on living with someone literally leeching off of me. I’ll end up just as broke as him if I continue at this rate. I have already spent near 2K on him in the last few months - digging through the little I have saved since I started working part time at age 14.

777,Not the A-hole,"After high school, my best friend and I both moved to separate cities.  We stayed in touch over the emerging internet (this was just over 20 years ago).  First email, then AOL IM, then social media, etc.

On two instances were supposed to meet up.  One when he was coming to my city, I took two days off of work, and he shows with friends.  I see him for all of about an hour, and he goes off with his friends.  Did I misunderstand this? I went back to our conversations and he knew I was taking days off to see him and said we’d be hanging out most the time.

The second instance, I was flying across the country to meet up with him.  He cancels two days ahead of time saying “Yeah, I never really had the money for this trip, honestly.”  Thank God I had other friends in this city.

Online, he acts as if nothing happens.  But now even his online persona starts to get unbearable.  He’s been fired from about 3 jobs in a row, while my career is booming.  His love life is falling apart while I’m having fun playing the dating field. If I mention anything good going on in my life, he feels the need to either one-up me or bring up something stupid I once did in high school.

It got so toxic that I decided to cut him off completely.  I shoot him an email outlining all of the reasons why:  He’s ditched me twice in person, and his jealousy is causing him to shoot me down whenever he can.  He emails back offering me the chance to apologize, I tell him this is exactly what I’m talking about.

This was almost exactly 10 years ago.  For about a year, I get weekly texts, emails and messages from him that I don’t respond to.  It’s like dealing with a crazy ex.  I finally block him on all forms of social media.  A few years later, I make the mistake of un-blocking him on Facebook to which he starts sending me more messages.  I respond “I’ve moved on, please stop contacting me,” and block him again.

Flash forward to last week he was visiting a mutual friend and he sent me a video message (shot by our friend) saying “We’ve been arguing and fighting for so long, let’s just bury that hatchet.  If I did anything wrong, I’m sorry, and I forgive you for everything, too.”

I send a quick message back saying  “I wish you the best, but we haven’t been fighting this whole time, I’ve moved on and I hope you can to.  Please respect my wishes going forward and stop contacting me.”

Our mutual friend says he is going be to devastated by this.  Apparently he’s at a really dark place right now and really thought that re-connecting with me would be one of the things that could lift his spirits.  I say to our friend “He had to know this was probably going to be my response”

Am I the asshole for not even giving my old friend a chance after 10 years?  My point of view was that he became a source of negativity I just didn’t want in life, and even if he’s grown up now, I don’t want to revisit those old days.",32,74,0.91

For context, I’ve posted about my sexual preferences, and some gaming stuff, but nothing beyond that. No porn or the like, on reddit or my search history as a whole.

When I asked for the reason why she had intentionally invaded my privacy, I was told that the reason didn’t matter because she’s my mother. I had figured that at some point I’d be considered responsible enough to not have my privacy invaded on a whim, or at least my parents would be tact enough to not bring it up.

I consider my preferences to be my business and not my parents’, and I’d like to at least be allowed to be a little more independent in the years leading up to college. 

I’m ticked to be sure but I can’t deny that some people could be more problematic than I am, so am I the asshole here?

EDIT: Because there’s been a bit of confusion: this isn’t a thing about internet safety- I’m not an idiot and my parents know that. Like I said in my post, when I asked my mother why she checked she said that she wanted to know what I was doing online, not because I might be getting scammed or the like.",37,31,0.84
779,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20’s and have been together for 6 months. A few days ago she found out she was selected as a Fulbright finalist and will be moving to Europe in August for 10 months. I’m extremely proud of her and I’m happy that she’s fulfilling her dreams but I can’t help but feel a little sad that she’s leaving. I’ve been trying my best to keep those feelings contained and to just be happy for her but it’s been a little difficult and I’ve sort of been distant with her these past few days. 

Last night we were at a bar celebrating this girls birthday party but also kind of celebrating my girlfriends huge achievement. Long story short, she started posting on Instagram and Snapchat right next to me about how she’ll be living in Europe in a few months and will meet one of her friends in Paris. I didn’t say anything but having her flaunt that in my face when she knows it’s a sensitive subject brought down my mood and made me shut down. She then went to the bathroom so I got on my phone for a little bit and was still on it when she came back because I was reading something. Admittedly, I didn’t really feel like talking at that moment and the phone was my escape but I couldn’t have been on there for more then 5 minutes after she came back. She then told me I looked miserable and to go home if I was having such a bad time. I told her I wasn’t having a bad time and I was here for her. I questioned why she was upset and she kept telling me to just go home because I looked miserable but I said no. She said she was leaving and Ubering home then and as I followed her out of the bar she kept turning around telling me to stop following her. She got in her Uber outside and called out to me saying “BABE” implying she wanted me to follow her and get in the car but I just said “No, I’m not going with you” so she gave me the middle finger and took off. That last bit made me upset and I texted her afterwards asking what the problem was and said that this wasn’t some game where she runs away and I immediately go chasing after her. She said I looked miserable when I was on my phone and humiliated her because I couldn’t even hold a conversation. Today we talked about it more and she says that she’s incredibly hurt because it’s unfair for her to have to censor her excitement around me. She says my excitement for her isn’t genuine and that I say all the right things but don’t mean them. She says she understands that I’m sad but if the roles were reversed she would at least make sure I felt celebrated and excited first and foremost and that after the celebration we would start having those conversations about how she’s feeling. In response I said, “If it was me getting a huge award I would like to celebrate with you but I would try to avoid flaunting it in your face until we’ve really talked about it. I’d know that something this big is obviously a good thing but it affects you too as my girlfriend so I’d try to be aware of your feelings.”

i am one of the guild leaders for a gay male guild on world of warcraft. for us, having a space to be openly gay around other openly gay guys is comforting. wow still has a lot of homophobia, especially in raiding guilds. some of us have also met up in real life once or twice yearly. general lgbtq\*, genderqueer, and lesbian guilds also exist.

recently, a new member joined our guild who self-identified as gay and gender non-conforming transman. in their words, they were born a female but dress in a more masculine style so they don't feel comfortable using a female identity, but also maintain female physiology and are interested in men. from the guild's perspective, there is no issue here and they were fully welcomed.

the issue arose in our guild discord server. we are 18+ and we have a #nsfw channel where we share adult images. this channel is opt-in, clearly marked, and not mandatory. when new member joined, they began to share some pornographic material of trans men (no bottom surgery). no one had an issue with this but they did not much attention if any at all because i think this type of pornography is less popular with our members.

new member complained in private that they felt excluded because other images shared got comments but not theirs. we let them know that they were welcome to share images but that people were free to comment on whichever images they liked. we didn't hear back. a few days later the user shared some revealing selfies. one user replied ""wow, looking good"" but then someone else shared something else and the attention was redirected there. the new user said the person who shared after them was transphobic and trying to drown out their images because it had a vagina and not a penis pictured (their words).

i re-messaged the user in the private that the drama isn't appreciated and that there was nothing transphobic about what the other user did and name-calling was unacceptable. the user replied to us that they wouldn't stand by if someone was being transphobic. they continued name-calling in the public channel so i didn't hesitate to remove them from the in-game guild and the chat server.

the next day, users that weren't online at the time saw the remnants of the conversation (i removed the personal photos for privacy) but one took issue and felt like the situation was transphobic. ultimately this led to a heated discussion amongst members. i loathe how much drama this has caused.

At first we were content with pretending the other doesn't exist, we just interacted with my mother really.

I thought he was joking because we literally never talk in the first place but he was serious. My mother, like every time a conflict between him and I happens, refuses to choose a side. He wouldn't let up and kept referring to me as ""young lady"" so I decided to double down and start calling him daddy.

B) I'm not stupid I know it carries a sexual meaning too, which makes this even worse (better for me?)

It’s enormous for my face and it has a big bump in the middle. I’ve been made fun of mercilessly for it ever since middle school. No guy has ever wanted to be more than friends with me because of my nose. In 10th grade I heard a guy I had a huge crush on talking to his friends about how big and ugly it is and it honestly scarred me for life. 

I’m graduating high school this year and my parents have offered to get me something really special. I think they were expecting for me to ask for a trip. Instead, I asked for a nose job.

They’re both really upset. They’ve been telling me this means I’m rejecting my Jewish heritage and that I shouldn’t want to change because that’s just giving in to the bullies. The Jewish heritage thing is big for them. We live in the South and we’re the only Jews around for miles. They’ve told me off a lot for trying to act like my goy friends to fit in. But honestly my heritage has brought nothing but trouble, I’m tired of people feeling my hair for horns and the anti-Semitic remarks have increased a lot since the 2016 election.

I told my girlfriend I was starving and going to order it and asked her if she wanted anything.  She said no she would just have some of whatever pizza I get.  

So I order it and it gets here.  I grab two pieces and go back to the living room to watch tv.  My girlfriend was in the kitchen for a long while, but I didn’t really think anything of it.  She came back to the living room without any and I asked her why she wasn’t eating.  She said she did, she didn’t want a whole piece, just some of the toppings.  I thought that meant she took the toppings off of one or two pieces.  When I went out to the kitchen for some more she had taken toppings and chunks of cheese off of every fucking piece.  

I asked her what the fuck and she was genuinely confused why I was angry.  She just said that I had already gotten my pieces and what’s the big deal, she didn’t take ALL the cheese off them.

For reference, we pay for 24f's med school (19m got a full ride). Cal expects to do the same for him. So we sat him down and talked to him about what he wants to do. He says he wants to major in art history. We asked him what his plan was after that, whether he would go to grad school, etc. He said he wouldn't go to grad school, and had no solid plan.

My wife and I came to the decision that we don't want to pay for his college when 1) he's majoring in something without good career prospects (not saying there's no jobs out there, but the job pool is going to be pretty narrow 2) he doesn't want to go to grad school, which might help widen the job pool by possibly offering roles in academia and 3) he has no real plan, and when we asked him to come up with one, he refused.

He called us hypocrites for paying for his sister's med school but not for him. I told him that we're paying for her med school because she's in a lucrative field and has a clear plan (we've discussed this with her).

Am I in the wrong here? I just don't want to 1) pay for or 2) encourage him to go into a field without planning. If he wants to major in art history, fine, but what rubs me the wrong way is that he has no plan, no solid idea of what he's going to do. I know, I know, he's 18 and nobody knows what they want to do fully at 18.

796,Not the A-hole,"I work at a tech company that recently established an ""Autism at work"" program. The company made a huge push to hire autistic folks as an ""untapped talent"", which I totally get and think that it's a great initiative.

""Johnny"" was hired onto our team as a QA tester through this program. The only experience with computers he's had is working as a repair tech at a previous job. He has no formal programming experience or experience with software development at all.

I...can't stand him. The lack of experience isn't the issue, it's just the fact that he's just straight up bad at his job and obnoxious.

When he was hired he worked with another QA tester who would basically hold his hand through everything and he was able to write QA tests and do the job.

Well, management decided that he was so good at his job (that he wasn't actually doing on his own) that they'd promote him to full-time. Shortly thereafter, the other QA tester left on paternity leave for almost half a year.

Shit. Hit. The. Fan.

Every meeting we'd have to discuss the work for the next two weeks, we would talk about what needed to be done and always check that he would understand. He would nod his head enthusiastically and say that he did.

We'd meet a week later to review his test scenarios and most of them were just straight up irrelevant or showed a clear lack of understanding of the work. We'd explain why they were wrong, he'd say ""oh I get it now"", and then we'd check back a day later and his new tests were also wrong.

Eventually we got to the point where we would basically write the test scenarios for him as a team. That didn't fix anything either. He would complete the tests and claim the tests all looked good, then we'd roll our code to production and end up with major issues that should have been caught during testing.

Past all this, he's just obnoxiously annoying. Constantly during serious business meetings he will say stupid ""jokes"" that take us off track and just annoy people (""oh that doesn't work, must be because we're using Winblows rather than Linux"", ""oh our server went down, must be the damn Russians trying to get Hillary's emails"", “that task looks like it’ll take 246 years to finish, might as well just give up now”). When he has a question during testing he doesn't even attempt to be specific (""yeah so there's a problem with the doohickey where the doohickey doesn't work"" is an actual quote I've been told many times)

I brought this up with my mentor at work and was told ""he's autistic, you're being rude, he needs a lot of patience"" but I think it's a ridiculous standard to hold someone to. If he wasn't autistic he would have been fired months ago because he's just straight up incompetent at his job.

798,Asshole,"I am a senior manager at my uncle's company. I am struggling with the decision to fire a junior manager who has been downright disrespectful but good at her job. Lets call the junior manager ""Cruella"".

My uncle is an asshole and that is why none of his children help in running the company- they all work outside the country away from him. My uncle controls all power in the organisation and micromanages everything.  However, he is old and has only me to leave the company to. I mention all this because I have reported the problems that Cruella causes and my uncle does not do anything because she is his favorite. I also do not have the power to fire her until few weeks from now when my uncle's retirement date comes up.

I have 3 managers under me and Cruella is the only one out of them who disobeys my orders, especially if it means that she has to work for me. My uncle gave her control of a division of the company that is very new and profitable, and this has gotten to her head. She refuses to give reports that would help us maximize efficiency and profits in the division. She only gives reports when she feels like. The irony is that when she needs help and has exhausted all options, she runs to me. I have cautioned her numerous times but she never cooperates knowing that only my uncle has the final decision and power to punish her. 

My uncle covers for her because he wrongly thinks that she is making the profit for the division she controls. She gets her staff working like clockwork and she works hard. However, she costs the company about 30 cents on every dollar of profit as her delayed reports deprives us from adjusting on time to certain costs. The issue here is that she did not set up the division- I and my uncle did. She also is not good with numbers as I have to correct her reports consistently.

To show you how nasty Cruella can be, she even got rude to my uncle's oldest son (my cousin). Can you imagine that she had the nerve to try to remove my uncle's son (who is a silent partner and technically her boss) from a staff meeting? Of course, my uncle covered it up and apologised to my cousin for her. That was when I decided that I would fire her when I have the power. Also, my cousin gave me his blessing to fire her after that incident as he was pissed with both my uncle and Cruella. 

Currently, I am thinking of firing her and not giving her either a severance pay or her would-be last month pay.  I truly want to punish her for being insubordinate and for abusing the favour that my uncle has shown her. The funny thing is that we are in a country that has very weak labour laws. I can fire her without any problems. 

Would I be the asshole if I fired her without pay?

My mom's boss has a son who is on the lower end of the functioning spectrum of ASD, and needs eye surgery. My mom's boss usually has gotten books / comics drawn for him to understand why these things are happening to him.

My mother's boss, knowing I'm an artist, asked my mother if I could draw something for her son's upcoming eye surgery. My mother told me about it, but I gave no definitive response at the time that would indicate whether or not I'd be interested in it. My literal response was, ""Oh"". Despite this, my mother's boss assumed that I'd be down to do the project. Weeks later, my mom comes back to me and told me her boss would be sending me the details on the project soon. I was confused, and expressed concern about doing such a thing when I'm a full-time student. I was told that she ""expected something of me now"".

I just got an email from her boss yesterday detailing the project. She wants me to draw roughly 20 panels of art for her son's surgery. I became rather irritated with this, considering I never gave explicit consent to working on this thing. I went to my mom, telling her that I felt this way, especially considering I am being offered *nothing* in exchange for doing this.

My mother's response was that she thinks I should just do this out of the ""kindness of my heart"", and that she supposes we just have ""different morals"". For context- my mother is a Lutheran, and I am an agnostic. This has been a point of contention in my family for a while.

UPDATE: 

First of all, thank you for all the replies- I was not expecting this kind of response. I now realise I should have been clear prior to now that I was expecting to be paid for this work, or that I explicitly was not up to the task. I sent an email back, asking about when she wanted this done by. She told me she needs it sometime next week. I don't think that's realistically plausible- even if I *was* being paid. Though I have a feeling I'm going to probably piss off my family by refusing to do the project, I can't put my grades on the line for a project in that span of time.",96,384,0.92

801,Not the A-hole,"I'm a student and I live with 5 others in my flat, one of which being the guy in question. He is seeing a girl and she often comes down to stay with him. No problem with that in itself.

My flatmate is a great friend of mine - we spend a lot of time together, cook together, share shopping, etc, and I love this arrangement and I know he does too.

The issue is that this girl has been staying for an increasingly ridiculous amount of time. The first couple of times she has stayed for reasonable amounts of time that I have no issue with, such as long weekends. However, the last couple of times she came down she stayed for 5 days, which though I wasn't too happy about I let slide as it wasn't too different to her usual 3 or 4, but the next time she stayed for a total of 10 days/9 nights. 

I was livid, and ended up feeling forced out of my own flat for the majority of that time. Most of the reason I was pissed off was that she was eating my food, drinking my drink etc, without offering a penny towards me, or even a simple thanks! Personally I would offer money or at least bring a bottle of wine as a thank you, at the very least say thanks, if I was even staying at someones for the night let alone the next 10 days.

It doesn't help that we don't really get on either; she is jealous of the relationship that my flatmate and I have, and even though there is nothing romantic about it at all, she seems to try her best to keep us apart the whole time she is at our flat. I wouldn't say I was jealous of her but her presence does irk me; I'm a creature of habit and her being there fully disrupts my meal routine as my flatmate and I can't cook for each other as normal. However, I stress that this last point wouldn't bother me if she wasn't so rude to me in my own home. 

Anyway, he didn't tell me about her coming until the day before she did, when I told him that she wasn't welcome for that long in our flat, especially not without asking me or any of my other flatmates about it. An extra person in our already small flat was a lot to handle, and it meant that we had to have predrinks in our bedrooms/eat in our bedrooms as we didn't feel comfortable being a 3rd party to them. He basically told me it was none of my business.

Problem is, I couldn't just let it go - I'm a student so I'm not exactly wealthy, I certainly didn't want to fund somebody else. My flatmate promised me we'd work out something regarding money for the food she'd eaten. 

After the 10 days elapsed, it transpired neither of them were planning on giving me any money. He said they'd done the groceries, but they had only bought at most around 10 pounds worth of veg, most of which they'd eaten. He told me this was fair and couldn't do any more as he was low on cash. My argument is if neither of them could afford the extra money, she shouldn't have come for 10 days.

Am I the asshole?

803,No A-holes here,"Short term post, idk mow much attention this will get in the time frame needed, but here goes:
 I'm staying at a hotel, we got in at like 3 am from a long road trip, we spent over $115 just to get half a night of sleep at a clean, peaceful, comfy, quality hotel with a decent breakfast, and they put us in the room next to the pool. So far so good. 

BUT. From about 9am onwards (and today is Saturday I might add), this group of like 5 or 6 kids have been running around the pool literally SCREAMING. And the adults were using their yelling voices too. It's happy yelling but like damn. At the top of the lungs is not necessary. This has been going on for at least an hour now. We can't be the only people here who were woken up by their noise. And I've never seen a group of kids just scream nonstop like they are, and the adults join in, at a nice hotel like this.

I'm afraid to confront them because if the parents are screaming too, they will probably just get angry and tell me to stop ruining their vacation or whatever.

Update: they're in the room across the hall from us. And they're still yelling. Dear god help me.

Final update: We just checked out. Now for another 6+ hour drive on about 4 hours sleep! :D

Extra final update: since folks seem to think I was livid and thinking I would go yell at the parents.... I never planned to yell at anyone but clearly asking them to stop screaming would have been inappropriate. Cuz I guess adults and kids screaming at the top of their lungs at 9 am is totally normal and fine and should be expected. In the future I will pre-emptively request a room far far away from the pool next time I need to sleep in at a hotel.",21,49,0.88

We've frankly had enough with him.

I will check it out at a coin star soon.He sold me these coins for 30 bucks and i heard him whispering to his friends how he just ripped off a dumbass. He also has a bunch of ration card booklets from WW2 which he sold to me for a few dollars. I have absolutely no idea how valuable these are but its sure as hell worth a lot more than a few dollars. He also sold me a 1940 M1 garand (rifle) that he inherited from his father for only  200 USD and honestly it's probably worth at least 3000 according to listings I've seen online for it.. This whole time he and his friends are snickering and whispering about how much I'm getting ripped off. I just ignore it. All my buddies think this is hilarious and they love using my gun and are really envious about my coins. I get a week later from my neighbor basically telling me how i ripped him off and i need to pay him more money or return the items. I tell him to fuck off. His uncle is furious at him because of how badly he was ripped off and he wanted to get the M1 garand. His uncle nonstop calls me demanding i give him the M1 and i also tell him to fuck off.

807,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Daycare provider cancelled care for personal reasons less than 24 hours after accepting payment for the month. Called out on Facebook for being hostile & “not understanding” after getting upset, apologizing & then requesting a refund.

Our care provider for our youngest son abruptly cancelled care for the entire month of April (and going forward) on the 3rd day of the month. She’s having a mental health crisis & has some other things going on in her personal life. I was upset with her when she told me, but I immediately apologized when she informed me on what was happening with her & have been nothing but cordial & polite since. She found us spotty care for the next 2 weeks, but after that nothing, leaving us with at least a week with no care, and scrambling to find a new daycare after that. (Which is incredibly difficult where we live)

Thursday we asked if she would pay us back for what we paid her for April, less the care she did provide. This is upward of $750 that we can’t afford to throw away.  Yesterday she posted a rant on Facebook about how we were hostile & aggressive and don’t support people with mental health issues. I’ve barely spoken to her since the first time & it was definitely not aggressive. She also told my devastated 3 year old that it was my fault she couldn’t take care of him because I was mean. My older son confirmed this.

So AITA for asking to be paid back so I don’t have to sacrifice our savings because I won’t be able to work for a good portion of the month?

My wife and I adopted a cat from a shelter last year and unfortunately it turns out she has a spinal injury  that causes issues when she squats, mainly a loss of sensation back there.  This leads to constant accidents around the house and anal glands needing to be drained, infections leading to vomit and constant visits to the vet. We've done everything we can including buying the most expensive fiber food to keep her stool soft, putting puppy pads around the house, we have tried multiple litters and litter boxes, nothing we do helps our cat. And it's worth mentioning that our cat seems very happy, she doesn't seem to be in any pain or suffering, just discomfort I think. 

The vet says there is nothing they can do to fix this aside from antibiotics and draining the anal glands when they fill up..short of that he said it's all just pain management.

I've brought up the possibility of moving her to the farm to be a farm cat (where they're very nicely taken care of) or finding her a new home or ultimately, putting her down... None of these suggestions go over well at all and leads to very tough arguments.

I have a cousin who has cancer. She’s only 24 and she’s been going through chemotherapy for about 4 months. She has really long hair and at this point she’s lost enough that she’s gonna go ahead and shave it off.

She decided to do this at a family dinner next coming up soon, and another relative sent out a group text that we should all shave our hair off to support her. The cousin with cancer doesn’t know about this, it would be a surprise.

At first I thought not many people would be on board with it, but turns out everybody is (19 people). I don’t want to shave my hair at all. To explain a little bit, my brother and I are the only two family members who are biracial (black/white). Hair for black women is often a controversial topic; there was just recently a law passed in NYC saying you can’t discriminate based on having natural hair. Imagine having to pass a law for that? The natural hair movement has been a big thing in recent years; I stopped relaxing my hair 5 years ago. I mention all this to say, black women’s hair is a touchy topic.

I’ve just recently gotten to the point where my hair is healthy and it’s down past my shoulders. I’ve only spoken to my brother and one of my more reasonable cousins about this (my black parent {mother} died when I was 7). They both basically said “yeah I get where you’re coming from, but it’ll look bad if you’re the only one who doesn’t do it”.

812,Update,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b4lqab/aita_for_thinking_about_leaving_my_wife_because/

So it's been a couple of weeks since my last post. I got so many messages for an update that I figured I may as well let everyone know what's happened.

I talked with my wife that night about my plans and about what she was doing. A commenter pointed out the irony of her cutting off her parents for determining her life while she was doing the same to me, I pointed this out to her and she became angry telling me that it wasn't the same thing. We argued about this for awhile before dropping it and addressing other issues.  We argued about 2ish hours and then decided to drop it for the night and talk about it again when we weren't so fired up. 

I could go on and on about the conversations we had the next day but eventually we both mutually decided that it would be best if we separated for the time being.  At that point I was unable to get her to stop pursuing the kids and I had made it clear at the beginning of the relationship it wasn't going to work out. 

I moved back in with my parents and we both have been looking for someone to take over our apartment lease.  

If this was the end of the story I honestly wouldn't have made an update. On Thursday though she called me while I was at work and left a voicemail that I couldn't comprehend other than just crying noises. Instead of calling back I went to the apartment to talk to her.  

When I got there she broke down and said that she didn't know what to do. She informed me that she had continued to talk to her sister and parents and instead of being happy for the kids they're actively guilting her for not doing this sooner. In addition to that she's taken the kids out a few times to try to get to know them again and it's gone less than stellar (in her words).  Apparently the oldest doesn't seem to like her and refuses to even look at her, the middle child is shy and doesn't really want to interact, and the youngest is impossible to deal with because she is constantly crying.

She's been over to her parents house (where her sister also lives, I don't think I mentioned that in the original post) every day since we last saw each other and she tells me that every day she goes over there she feels worse and worse.  She told me that she no longer feels the strong urge to adopt the children like she did before.

Since that day I have semimoved back into the apartment.  I told her that my decision when it comes to the children is unchanged, I don't want any part of that mess despite feeling awful for the kids.  She agreed and said she never meant to force me to live my life a certain way, she just feels extremely guilty about the whole situation with them.

I talked to her about possibly getting CPS involved and she said that she didn't want to do that because despite their upbringing the kids love their mom and grandparents and she thinks it would do more harm than good. I personally disagree, but if I wasn't willing to raise them I feel like I shouldn't push the issue.

My mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. She said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. It wasn't necessary. I implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

Last night I called my brother and discussed it with him myself. I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.

823,No A-holes here,"
First let me start off by saying I love my in laws and get along with them pretty well but they just come to town excessively. They live approx 4 hours from us and when they come to stay they stay for a week or more at a time.

My BIL and his wife had a baby a year and a half ago and my in laws have visited once a month for a week or more at a time with their two large dogs since the birth. 

This previously wasn't an issue has they had a second place to stay up here that they owned.  However they are planning to sell it this year and still plan on visiting as often as they do. 

My BIL used to have a spare room, but that is now the baby's room.  My SO and I just bought our first house together and we made sure to have an extra room for visitors just in case.  Well MIL has decided that it's HER room and has stated that she can't stay at BIL house because ""shes to old to sleep on a couch"". 

There are other family members that live in our area that the SOs could stay with.  And the BIL has offered to let them stay in his basement, but it's unfinished at the moment and would just be a box springs and a mattress not a room

My S.O feels as though he has some sort of obligation to allow his parents to stay with us all the time. I do not. I don't mind if they stay with us a few times a year but I'm not interested in giving up my spare bedroom to someone coming in town once a month for two weeks at a time every month. I don't care who you are.  I want privacy and the ability to plan a vacation or make plans where I don't feel obligated to be home instead of hosting all the time.  There have been a few situations where she has become passive aggressive about the fact that even though she's been in town every month for the past year we didn't make time to see her every day she was here.  And I feel it would be even worse if she was staying with us. 


AITA?

TLDR: in laws constantly come in to town and expect to always have a place to stay even though they are selling their house and don't seem to care about privacy or the fact that other people have lives outside of hosting guests. 



Edit to add: Before the baby came they came up about 3-4 times a year.  These visits are primarily to see BIL and his kid. In January when they left they originally told us they wouldn't be back for probably 4 months or so and then BIL sent MIL a video of baby saying ""duck"" and two weeks later she was up here saying ""i was missing too much!"" And stayed for 12 days. ",40,96,0.96

825,Not the A-hole,"My fiancée tragically passed away a few months back. I'm currently in the process of sorting various matters out. Two of these are the Mortgage and Life Insurance. 

I should firstly make it clear that because we weren't married and had no children I am not next of kin, her parents are.

I discovered today that because the way the Mortgage was set up, I am due to inherit the full mortgage debt to pay back but only half the house, the remainder of the house will go to her parents. This is frustrating for a number of reason, firstly when my fiancee and I set up the Mortgage I recall being asked this question and I don't believe that is the option we chose. I can't prove that so it is what it is. Secondly, the house is hers and mine, no-one else's.. We designed it from the ground up, everything in it is hours of work by us, to now have to share that seems wrong. Thirdly, I truly dont believe this what she would have wanted, it certainly isn't what I would have wanted for her but they're spinning it as ""If this is how she set it up, she must have wanted us to get the house."" And finally I got on really well with her family, I feel this has made the relationship extremely difficult to maintain. 

I'm not sure if it's relevant as to whether IATA but her family are well off, a lot more so than myself or my family. They're not stinking rich but they have a large portfolio of properties and money just isn't an issue for them. I'm by no means struggling, but I earn enough to pay the bills and that's about it.. I can barely afford them now I'm paying them alone.

Also, possibly relevant possibly not.. every single asset of hers has gone to her parents and I have not said a word. This is the law and that's fine. It probably equates to around £20,000 in total, I have not asked for nor received a penny of this and I am completely comfortable with that fact.

Now, we had joint life insurance which means I'm due a payout equal to the remainder of the mortgage. To me, this is my money to do with as I please. I paid the premiums to cover my mortgage in case the worst should happen, which it did. My solution is that I either give her parents half the money we've paid off the house and they sign it over to me or we sell the house and share whatever money is raised. Either way, I keep the life insurance money.

Their solution is that I pay off the full mortgage and we share the house 50/50. To me this is completely out of the question, why would I pay for them to own half of my house. But am I just being extremely selfish keeping the full amount for myself?",66,444,0.97

I call the person.

Me: ""Hello, is this \[name\] who drives a \[car\] at \[address\]?""

Him: ""This is him.""

Me: ""And I see you go to \[college\] and bank with \[bank\], correct?""

Him: ""... Yes? Who am I speaking to?""

Me: ""I'm \[name\]. You've used my e-mail to sign up for everything I've listed. I'd really appreciate it if you stopped."" 

Him: ""I just put down a generic e-mail freak, I didn't want the spam. Don't ever call me again you fucking asshole"" \*click\*

He seemed pretty shook and angry and understandably so. I mean, if someone called me and had all that information about me I'd be pretty creeped out as well. Figured him realizing exactly how much information he was having sent to a complete stranger would be a wake up call.

Within a few weeks I was getting 10+ spam e-mails a day from all sorts of websites. Most of them were easy to just unsubscribe to, none were alarming, and he didn't continue re-subscribing... But about 4 months ago it started getting sketchy again, and I was getting confirmation e-mails for for items/services adding up to tens of thousands of dollars. I had to check that these were just this guy being lazy again and not an actual threat. Again, it was just this guy... But I was tired of it.

So I got on craigslist. Went over to the free stuff section and posted multiple items (Chairs, desks, a basketball hoop, etc.) all with this guys phone number and address. Put on there to ""swing by any time, day or night, just knock loudly"" and ""If I don't answer, call me"" with the excuse ""I was in the basement and often had headphones on"". The posts weren't up for long, only about a day each before getting flagged and taken down... Haven't got another suspicious/spam e-mail since. Did I go too far?",53,346,0.97
832,No A-holes here,"So I've moved out of my mum and dad's now, but I still have a few things left in my old bedroom.  A few toys, but mainly a load of (pretty much mint condition) books I've collected over the years.  The plan being that when I have a bit more of my own space I can move these things over with me.

I'm a bit of a book worm and all my books are very well looked after.

So...everytime I come home, something else has been taken from my room and circulated with my 2 sister's kids (2, 3 and 5).  I come home this weekend to find one of my book box sets has been taped back together as the box has been ripped.

833,Not the A-hole,"So I have a static caravan on a holiday resort in the UK. I don't think the USA has quite the same concept, but to give some idea of value, the van cost me £55,000 and I pay £4,000/year site fees to keep it housed at the resort which includes use of restaurants, bars, entertainment, arcades, swimming pool and access to the beach. To pay these fees, I rent it out in the school holidays at around £600-700 week.

&#x200B;

I have it listed on a site that's kinda like Air BnB but only for people looking for a caravan holiday in the UK. The caravan has 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. Those bedrooms house 1 kingsize bed, and 2 single beds. It does have a pullout sofa in the lounge, so technically the legal occupancy for the fire code is 6 people max. I have decked it out nicely, it has two 40"" TVs, it has a PS4, loads of games, ridiculous amount of gadgets in the kitchen etc. etc.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the waffle but I think it sets the background. I got an enquiry this week for a date that is unbooked. When people enquire they have to fill in their party details (number of adults/children and ages etc). This person enquired for 1 adult, 5 children. The children ranging from 2 years old to 12 years old. So young children, not older teens. I  told my gf I was going to decline the booking because I honestly don't think that the caravan is suitable for 5 young children. I clean it myself every week and I only have a 4 hour window to clean before the next person goes in and I've found that the more children people have, the messier it is even if the parents try to clean really well (note: I don't charge a cleaning fee of any kind). I also think there's more chance of things breaking, especially with 1 adult to supervise 5 young children and I don't take a security deposit so breakages come out of my pocket.

&#x200B;

My gf says I am an asshole for judging this adult for having 5 kids with her and am stopping 5 children from going on holiday and that life is hard as a single parent and I'm making it harder. My argument is that this is my personal place that I rent out 10 weeks of the year, I can be choosey about the bookings because I am always full for those 10 weeks and I want to minimize the chance of any problems. I don't allow people with dogs for the same reason. Not a personal judgement, just a personal preference in my property. I often take bookings which have 2 or 3 kids, I don't hate children, but 5 kids 1 adult just isn't a ratio I'm comfortable renting to especially in such a small space. She is very angry and wants me to accept the booking. I understand her POV but I view it as an unnecessary risk.

Now, I understand all women get this for the most part, it's a part of nature. Hell, theoretically 1 in 8 people are having a period at any given time. Shes usually VERY accommodating and understanding when her hormones cause her to lash out. But on those bad months, I just cannot sleep with her. She always feels the need to sleep without pants, shes usually without pants in general, but not just pantsless, no, full commando. When shes on her period, she doesn't wear a pad, because how could she? She just pops a tampon in and hopes for the best. Surely enough, every time, my sheets look like a scene out of a murder mystery because it overflowed the tampon. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact she works mornings, meaning she wakes up 30 minutes before she has to leave and just leaves it there. She says she'll take care of it when she gets home, but its blood, it'll be completely soaked in by then. I admittedly haven't asked her about wearing a pad to bed, but frankly, I'm tired of having to wake up at 7 am to clean blood out of the sheets and having to run to the store for more bleach.

837,Not the A-hole,"I have a problem with my stomach that is basically really bad heartburn. I get it literally every day if I don't take my medication and there was a year when I could barely sleep because my stomach hurt so badly. My doctor told me to avoid tomatoes, peppers, anything spicy, anything fried, chocolate, fatty meats, and alcohol, among other things. If I eat a slice of pizza or even a mild curry, I feel sick.

I am a college student and the dining hall was a bit of a challenge for me. More often than not, the entrees will have something I can't eat in them. During my freshman year, I lost 30 lbs (down to my middle school weight) and was just eating cereal for dinner many nights.

I told the dining hall staff that I was having a hard time and they were super understanding and set up special meals for me. I appreciate it and try to request simple dishes that they can cook in a few minutes, like quesadillas or grilled tofu.

I moved off campus and no longer technically need to be on a meal plan. I could cook at home, but I like eating with friends, so I bought a meal plan.

There aren't a lot of people who need special meals because our dining hall caters pretty well to vegetarian/vegan/kosher/gluten free/other normal dietary restrictions. As a result, a lot of my friends are jealous of me because I get to eat whatever I want and they have to eat whatever is on the menu. Some of them have entertained the idea of also asking for special meals with dietary restrictions (anything from ""I'm allergic to most meats"" to ""when I eat too many gingerbread cookies, I feel sick""). I feel a little bit guilty because I essentially have a personal chef.

Am I the asshole for either of the following reasons?

1. I get to decide what I eat every day and my friends are at the whim of the dining hall
2. I live off campus and could cook for myself

TL;DR: I have a really good thing worked out with my college's dining hall because of my crappy stomach. Is it an unfairly good deal for me?",25,64,0.95

840,Not the A-hole,"My policy on spiders (at least the non poisonous ones) is: if it doesn’t step on me, I don’t step on it. I also don’t like killing things, and I don’t like cleaning that stuff up.

Because they tend to be found basically everywhere, whenever I find one I capture it in a cup and just put it outside and don’t give it a second thought. I also tend to find the amount of other random bugs and pests in my place to be much less if I just leave a spider in its corner every now and than. 

My girlfriend hates spiders. She found one in the hallway outside her apartment, and insisted that I kill it. I wasn’t so fond of that idea and did the cup-transport method and put it outside. The rest of the evening was thrown off because she was mad that I didn’t kill it. 

When I talked to her about it, it seems that the issue is that she doesn’t like spiders in her place, but for some reason me putting them outside doesn’t  satisfy that, she demands that I kill them. Which sort of puts us back at square one.

841,Not the A-hole,"So there’s this new guy at work and I was in charge of training him and showing him around. He’s around my age, (early 20s), and he seemed like a cool guy. 

I would always say hi to him, and we would do small talk, which I do with everyone that works with me. I’ll admit, sometimes i get told I can be “too friendly,” but I don’t think I was being flirty with him at all. 

This wasn’t an issue where he was filing a report for harassment or anything, but he pretty much told another coworker that he thinks I like him, and that “she’s cute, but I have a girlfriend.” 

When my coworker told me about this, I felt like if I stopped being friendly it would seem like I did like him and was mad about the gf, but it also bothered me too much to let it go. So i talked to him about it. 

He said maybe he misunderstood, but he thought I got too touchy at some points, which shocked me, seeing as I’ve never touched him, or even shook hands with this guy. He also mentioned how I was always giggly with him, and yes but I laugh at EVERYTHING, not just with him. I calmly denied it and apologized if he thought I was coming on to him.  He pretty much rolled his eyes, and went, “yeah, okay,” in a sarcastic tone. 

I was annoyed, bc to me it seemed like he was trying to act like hot shit, so I just told him I didn’t even find him attractive, and might’ve made unnecessary comments about his height. He pretty much told me to fuck off, and my manager found out about all of this. 

Now this is where I felt like the asshole, because i had been there longer, my manager automatically sided with me, and there was a small instance where she insinuated she might fire or transfer, even though I was the one who made the mean comments.

The comedian is apparently somewhat famous but I've ever heard of him. Anyways he kicked off the show talking his friends Aziz Ansari and Louis CK. I was like whoa...bold move and I was seriously taken aback and pretty defensive.


 He told more jokes and I didn't laugh once. He then said somthing about ""#movement (auto mod didn't like this term ) has run its course!""

He stopped in his tracks and called for the door  men to walk me out and that he wasn't messing around because he was sick or something.

So today we where walking back from class together and he was complaining about how no guys will hook up with him because he's fat and he just wants to be skinny (they also don't go out with him because he outs people in our homophobic college, and has already hooked up with every gay and even some straight men in our area) and then suddenly I look next to me and he isn't there, he has stopped to take the elevator. We are only on the second floor going down and he has no problems with his legs yet He always always takes the elevator.

I tell him ""hey why don't we take the stairs they're right here and that elevator is super slow"" and he says "" why you got nowhere to be"" I groan and say something along the lines of ""you know you should be taking the stairs"" to which he says ""oh yeah why is that huh?"" And I say ""because you're fat"".

I feel like I should note, he isn't just ""overweight"" or ""big boned"" he is undeniably unhealthily fat. To me, when it isn't called for, it is very rude to say it, but it's also just a fact and it's stupid to pretend like it isn't. He was also literally just saying it about himself.

So he gets upset with me saying he can do what he wants and so I get upset and say something along the lines of ""yeah, you can do what you want, but when you choose to eat ramen multiple times every day, get drunk multiple days a week, and refuse to do so much as use the stairs when it comes to excersize, then I don't want to hear you complain all day about how hard it is, you could change if you wanted to with minimal effort and you don't because you're lazy"". 

Now he is really upset with me and doesn't want to talk to me. Obviously I know loosing weight is hard, and if he even went to the gym like twice a week or even tried to eat healthier I wouldn't care about him complaining so much, but he does absolutely nothing, and I see nothing wrong with telling him the truth about it especially when he complains all the time and can't seem to comprehend that there's a connection between his habits and his weight.

849,Not the A-hole,"**UPDATE:** 

I was not expecting to post an update so soon, but I was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

Over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.

Once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physical

This makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.

She takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.

I tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.

>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.

I have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

---------------------------------

**Original Post**

----------------------------------------------------

**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.

-------------------------

My gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

Last week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

Anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.

So I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

Anyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?

852,Not the A-hole,"Every two months they do random drug tests for my part of the company. I’ve been here for over two years and have been drug tested at least 10 times. 

I don’t do anything. I don’t smoke weed, drink regularly, pills, etc. 

I have three theories. My first theory is that they think I’m on drugs because I am kind of a skinny dude. I just have a small frame so I weigh less than average. Shoulders aren’t very broad kind of thing. People sometimes assume I am on drugs when I’m on the lighter side of my typical weight fluctuations.  I can understand that. 

My second one is: when I was on second shift I worked with one other guy in the entire place. I was always pulled to get drug tested. One time the guy I worked with had a small accident on the fork truck that required a drug test. It was a Friday evening and he went and told the supervisor in the other building. Supervisor said he’d just call in the drug testing person Monday and do it then. The guy I worked with was like “I bet if it was OP you’d make him go now wouldn’t you?” And the supervisor was like “yeah, he just seems weird man.” Guy I worked with told him that he works with me every day and it’s just me and him and he knows for a fact I’m not on drugs. I am kind of quiet to people I don’t talk to much. 

Third: After drug testing me several times, they want people who can piss clean so it doesn’t make the company look bad. They hire a lot of dope heads sometimes and I’ve heard if you have so many people test positive that the company can get investigated or fined. 

I guess it just upsets me. I know they didn’t really like me at first. I’m not from the area and it’s a different culture here in the south than it was in the Midwest. I don’t really fit in and don’t have much in common with a lot of the people here so that kind of hinders what I can talk about with people. Plus I’m from a bigger city and like its just not really normal to sit around and bullshit all the time. I’ve got stuff to do and I don’t have time to sit around and BS all day. Nobody did that back where I’m from, but everyone does it here. 

I just feel like I’m constantly being judged for my appearance here. One of my supervisors thought it was kind of BS too. He’s from Florida and there’s a ton of overweight people around here. So it’s like if someone is a thinner / healthier weight it’s like everyone assumes that person is on drugs. He was just like “damn it’s like everyone’s just a fatass around here so if they see someone that’s actually a healthy weight they think it’s weird. Guess it’s normal to be overweight here.”

I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight and it just hurts my feelings I guess. I’m not an unhealthy skinny. I mean I’m skinny but I’m not emancipated or malnourished looking. Just a smaller dude. 

So AITA for being upset that I constantly get pulled for ‘random’ drug tests? There’s people that have been here 5x longer than I have and have never been drug tested.

853,Not the A-hole,"This happened just a few hours ago between me \[18, M\] and my girlfriend \[18, F\]. We have been dating fairly seriously for over a month at this point.

&#x200B;

We were on the topic of her favorite K-Pop artist (which I don't care for K-Pop whatsoever, but I try my best to pay attention)  ""Jung Yong Hwa"". As usual, she's completely fangirling over him, which bothers me a little bit, but I can understand where she's coming from. In general, she's not very complimentary towards me--every now and then I'll get a ""you look nice"" or ""you're really funny"". However, when talking about this guy, she is completely balls-to-the-wall. It's just a constant stream of ""he's so talented, sexy, hot, funny, sweet, etc."".

&#x200B;

Keeping in mind, she has never met this guy or been to one of his concerts. Only through listening to his albums and liking every single one of his posts on Instagram (she went back a few years and liked every single one forward from there). She is currently saving money to get a tattoo of his name on her chest.

&#x200B;

Now some of you might have your YTA's typed out already, but I am actually okay with all of the above, including the tattoo. What she said today is what caused me to lash out:

&#x200B;

She said ""Nothing could keep me from going to his concert in Korea this November.""

&#x200B;

I laughed and played along, making up some stupid circumstances, all of which she said she wouldn't care and would not hesitate to go to this concert. Then, making an obvious mistake, I said:

&#x200B;

""What if I was in the hospital (as in, seriously sick)? Would you still go?""

&#x200B;

I did not expect the next answer at all, mainly because there wasn't one. She just stared at me awkwardly for a few moments, then said ""... Do you expect me to lie?"". I spent a few minutes confirming she was completely serious--which she was, which left me completely heartbroken.

&#x200B;

At this time I swiftly called her a complete psycho and cut the relationship off. Was I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow this blew up.

&#x200B;

I want to clarify some things, because it seems like a lot of the comments here are following the same logic. 

&#x200B;

First, this concert doesn't even exist yet. She doesn't have tickets. She's just assuming that he will have this big fancy concert once he's back from the military, and that it will be unmissable. In the argument between us she claimed that because he is just coming back from the military, it makes the concert somehow ""different"". Just a normal concert would be worth missing to stay with me.

&#x200B;

Secondly, I asked this question in a completely joking manner. Things had been going extremely well between us, and it didn't even cross my mind that she would answer this way. I was literally laughing as I asked her this question, and in my mind I was simply teasing the fact that ""nothing"" could stop her, and this circumstance just popped into my head. At the time, I had full, 100% confidence that she would be like ""Hahaha okay almost nothing can stop me"" or whatever. I had no intentions of making her choose between him and me, because tbh I know I would lose that battle 100 times out of 100.",246,827,0.93
854,Not the A-hole,"Apologies if it doesn’t fit, this is the only judgment sub I know. 

I started my RPG dice collecting hobby/obsession when I got into D&D in college and throughout the years I’ve been slowly increasing my collection. I had loans and a part time job then so most of that money went to loans but I would buy 2-3 sets of dice on special occasions like my birthday or if I did well on finals. My family don’t approve of this since in their mind, I could be spending it on more important things.

Anyway I graduated college a few months ago (changed my major several times) and working at a permanent, full time job that’s related to my major. It pays well, I still live with my parents, and I should be loan free in 2-3 months. But I went to PAX last week where I dumped $300 on dice. These were the novelty, expensive ones, I’m talking gemstone and metal dice. I’ve never spent this much on dice at once, the ones I bought in the past were plastic $10-15 ones. But I figured it was fine as I wasn’t planning on making it a daily habit, more like a once a year thing.

My family was not happy when they found out, said I could’ve spent it on other things like shoes and clothes. I will admit my collection is big, I have like 25-30 sets plus an additional 7 Kickstarter sets that should be delivered soon.

I regularly play D&D so I do use them but maybe I was irresponsible with my money. I mean you can’t really use dice in everyday situations compare to clothes. So AITA?

857,Not the A-hole,"I'm a young black woman who was at a bar/club last weekend with friends (all races and genders). 

Everything was fine and we got into a conversation with another group that was there. 

They were asking each other about their ""type"" and what they look for in a girl, etc.

One of the guys (half white / half latino) said that as long as the girl is cute and has a good personality he would be with her, as long as she isn't black.

I was taken aback and asked him what he meant by that. He said ""no offense"", but that he would never have a relationship with a black girl, only sex.

**I asked him why and he said that in all honesty it has nothing to do with looks or personality because he has met many black girls he's been attracted to who were cool people. But he would never date one because we are ""low status"". That it's not our fault, but it's just the way it is.**

The other guys agreed with him. I said that that was racist, and they said it wasn't because you ""can't help who you're attracted to"". 

Then I reminded them that he said he had no problem with sexual attraction towards us, he just wouldn't DATE us because we are what he sees as ""low status"". 

They didn't say anything after that and just changed the subject.

The two girls I was with said that it was racist too, but that I shouldn't let it ruin my night.

Am I wrong for saying they are racist? I understand that attraction is attraction and that you can't control it, but to be attracted to someone, to like their personality, and to turn them down because you perceive their RACE as low status is both classist and racist.",31,34,0.77
858,Not the A-hole,"I’m not talking about the trash tag or anything like that. My friends, and you might have seen the video, bought some stuff for a homeless guy. I don’t want to identify them, but it was a bunch of stuff and very nice. That’s great. God bless ‘em. 

But then they make a video and post it all over social media. So... it’s not really about being nice, is it? It’s about narcissism and getting internet points. I told them what I think and they say I’m the asshole.

When I was a kid, my mom used to make me bring cokes and lemonades to sanitation workers and people all the time. We gave people coats and were always “love thy neighbor.” 

I’m trying to picture my grandma saying, “hey man, the garbage men are here. Grab the VHS camera and get a good pan on me as I approach these dudes. Make sure you get how grateful they look and shit.”

Then have a video viewing party I guess? I get that social media is narcissistic. In fact, leaving my opinion here is narcissistic. But am I really the asshole for thinking, “just give the guy the coat and move on with your day, hero.”

859,Not the A-hole,"Me (25, M) and my GF (23, F) were walking down some pretty quiet street in our city. All of a sudden, I see this guy reach out and before I know it he grabs my GF's ass for a second and she makes a gasping noise. He walks away but as he does he turns and winks at us. My GF and I swear at him and call him a creep and all that but he shrugs them off and just walks off down another street.

I asked my GF if she was okay and say we should report the incident. She says she doesn't want to that it's 'no big deal', and despite me asking again if she sure she was okay she said she wasn't that bothered. 

Anyway, when we get home I ask her once more if she is okay, as she's been quite quiet and I'm afraid she might be very upset. She says she's very upset that I didn't try to beat the guy up after he grabbed her ass and just let him walked away.

Now she's not talking to me. Now, I don't feel like I should've attacked him. For one, I could have been arrested for assault as it wouldn't be in defense. Secondly, I'm quite a skinny guy at 150 pounds and he was BIG. By big, I mean he was built like a boxer, thick muscles and all.

Im a graphic designer for a digital marketing agency and i run my own art business on the side. So on my day to day i have a few tasks that i need to accomplish plus all the other stuff that my coworkers request from me. That is my role, they need it, i design it, they post it. 

Im fast and efficient, usually work very quickly and i finish my daily tasks ahead of time on most days. Some days are more hectic and some are super slow. So when i complete what i need to do for they day, or have a few hours to kill,instead of dicking around online on facebook or shopping like everyone else in the office i use my free time to work on my side projects.

862,Asshole,"I have 2 children, a high school senior and a high school sophomore. The Missus is a cardiac surgeon while I work as a software engineer at a pretty big firm. Needless to say, finances aren’t an issue for us.

Now I’m of the opinion that my kids’ primary focus should be their education right now. They don’t have/need jobs (besides sometimes part-time during the summer), but the wife and I pretty much pay for everything. As such, the kids just expected that we would pay for their college, which honestly, was a reasonable expectation. The problem lies with our daughter: she wants to major in Comparative Literature or something related to writing. Her reasoning is that she loves writing and she’s good at it.

I’m a bit hesitant to just pay for unconditional college. If her goal was to be a writing professor, or just had a specific career goal in mind in general, I’d be a lot more willing. But as it stands, her primary motivator was just because it interests her. I told her that I’m fine paying for education, on the condition that she majored in something more “practical”. Or that if she had a legitimate plan to get from what she’s majoring to what she wants to do, then I’d be happy to pick up the tuition and living expenses, which means she just needs to pay for her own food. If she doesn’t that’s fine, but she’d have to find a way to supplement her education through loans and scholarships (and I will help her do this).

She accused me of trying to manipulate her. Truth be told, I did try to push STEM to her when she was 15-16, but she consistently brought home Bs-high Cs in stem while getting perfect As to A+s in writing. I conceded that she was just naturally a better writer, and I’ll let her develop her own issues. She’s using this information from the past to claim I’m trying to manipulate her into doing a field that I want her to do.

My POV is, I don’t necessarily care if she does a field in STEM. She can get her Underwater Basket Weaving degree IF she planned to, for example, be a lawyer (and thus has an actual use for the degree), but she can’t just major in something because she “likes” it. Unless the like will lead to a potential career path in mind.

My wife won’t take a side (she’s normally the one that has these little spats with our daughter while me and her normally see eye-to-eye). So I come to you, Reddit, to help me see if I’m being unreasonable.

AITA for wanting to add stipulations to what I’d pay for in college?

&#x200B;

Edit: For some reason, people are under the impression that I'm forcing her to major in STEM. If this is you, please reread the post; nowhere in my post have I indicated this. She can major in ANYTHING as long as she has a plan

&#x200B;

Also people are under the impression that whatever she chooses, it's set in stone, which is silly. Why would I force an 18 year old to commit to the choice they made for the rest of their life? Their interest can change and that's fine; I'll fully fund it. AS LONG AS she has a new plan of how she wants her career to go. I just don't want her entering college completely blind.

&#x200B;

In case anybody's still reading:

&#x200B;

We spoke today and she already had a list of potential careers she could do! She's going to put more research in this weekend and narrow down her top favorites. Not only that, but she's actually *excited* to learn more about all of the different careers she can do when she graduates, and what she can see herself doing for the rest of her life. I'm not stupid and I know it'll probably change at least a few times; I'm just glad the kid is actually curious and learning what she can do with her degree besides just studying it because it's ""fun"".

&#x200B;

I don't know why a lot of the comments is all ""this will destroy your relationship with your daughter"". I'm sorry your relationship with your parents is so fragile, that coming up with a few career path ideas would ultimately break it! But ultimately, I think her and I will do just fine! :)",460,430,0.9
863,Not the A-hole,"Recently my brother's childhood friend he grew up with died. The guy was always in trouble with the law. He had a wrap sheet probably 10 miles long. Few days ago, police show up at the house to arrest him on outstanding warrants, child neglect, and lots of other stuff. He ran back inside the house after announcing he was going to get a gun. He was shot by police and later died at the hospital.

Anyways, this guy used to live with my family growing up. He was a criminal from a very young age. He stole hundreds of dollars from my parents including electronics.  When he lived with us, he did mean things to me (I was around 12 at the time.) I would be afraid to sleep because he would put random objects like erasers, paperclips, pencils, even food in my mouth. I would wake up with this stuff in my mouth. Always surprised I never choked on it. There were other incidents where he would barge into the bathroom while I was using it and would proceed to laugh and make fun of me.

I never told my parents because to them, kids always lie and make stuff up (my sister used to make shit up all the time so therefore we were all liars.) So I always kept quiet about it. Well I recently told my parents what went on and they both gave me this super shocked look like I was making it up. My mom thinks I should be sympathetic towards the man's death but I honestly feel nothing. I told her that I didn't think people deserved to be shot, but his death wasn't a surprise to me. 

I also don't have much to do with my brother as he is a criminal himself. Mom is upset I refuse to console or talk to him about it. I don't allow him to have my phone number because he can get pretty annoying (asking for money, stuff, etc.) He's been asking my parents for my number and I will be pretty upset if they give it out. I'm pretty sure they think i'm this snobby bitch. Am I the asshole for not caring?

currently my pregnant wife and I are living with my parents because I travel a lot for work and my wife didn't feel safe being alone while I am out of town. everyone in the house usually pools their money and shares food, which has worked so far aside from this.

my wife hasn't had a lot of pregnancy cravings except for blue jello. she basically buys it for herself in bulk but keeps it in the communal fridge with a sticky note on it. now my wife is a very kind woman, but if I touched her jello, I'd be divorced or dead. when her nausea kicks in, its the only thing she can keep down.

my little brother started complaining that he wants jello and my parents never buy it for him. I knew what he was hinting at but there was only one jello pack left and I told him it wasn't mine to give away. he said that my wife never shares her jello with him and she shouldn't keep it in the fridge if she's not willing to share it like all the other food. I told him that you have to make concessions when people are pregnant and deal with it. I offered to get him some jello next time we were at the store, but he wanted the jello right then, so he went into the fridge and took it out. I took it out of his hand and put it back and stood between him and the fridge and told him to stop and eat something else. he threw a fit because my wife wasn't there to eat the jello and he said she could just buy more, but I wouldn't let him eat it. he's still mad at me and its been a few hours.

Carter and I play baseball together, so about an hour ago, at practice, I mentioned it was kind of a dick move of him to string my sister along when he was gay. He didn't deny that was why he was dating her, but be got offended and said that I had no idea how it is to be gay and in the closet, and that I'm essentially shaming him for coming out.

I organize an LGBTQ+ social group on Meetup.  Its been running for almost 5 years now, and it is my baby.  It has been fantastic!  The group is centred around a specific activity, and of course, everyone is welcome, not just LGBTQ+ members.  So occasionally we get heterosexual people who come simply because they enjoy this specific activity and its great! 

&#x200B;

About two years ago, an older man with special needs (I believe Down's Syndrome) started attending.  My mom was a special needs teacher when I was growing up, so I have always been good with people with special needs.  He would come every 2-3 months and I would do this activity with him and sometimes get other people to join in.  It was fine.  Lately though, he has become a bit of a sore point.  

&#x200B;

He now comes every month.  He commandeers the group and gets mad at others who don't want to do things exactly his way.  He has been rude to many people in the group, and I've also noticed a big dip in attendance.  We used to see 30-40 people every month, and lately we have only seen 10-15 people.  It sucks.  Honestly, he brings down the vibe and is ruining the group.  I have spoken to him and told him that his behaviour and his words are rude and are making people uncomfortable.  In return, he told me I wasn't a mind reader, so I don't know what people are thinking.  

&#x200B;

I want to be inclusive, thats the whole point of my group!  But I'm starting to think he is driving people away, and my group is going to slowly become just him and a few people and I'll have to shut it down.  I don't want to do this.  So I have considered banning him from the group on Meetup so that he won't see the meet ups anymore.  Am I the asshole?  ",43,233,0.98
868,Not the A-hole,"Basically title. 

I used wife it title because we are engaged and plan on getting married within this month. 

So my wife is 18 weeks pregnant. We have our problems. Mostly all originating from me just not immediately resigning to her control over whatever the situation is. Since we found out she was pregnant, it’s gotten worse. 

If I gave a lot of co text everyone would immediately assume she’s an asshole. Because, as much as I love her, she’s an asshole. 

With her being pregnant I am very excited. My goal in life has always been to be a dad. I want to be a dad. I want to be THAT dad. I already got my short khakis and my Florida tacky button ups for the special occasions. 

I posted the ultra sound on Facebook telling everyone. Super pumped. 

She didn’t like that, but she didn’t really create any mandates. 

However, two days ago she was like “if you’re coming over Friday, I won’t be home until 630”. 

I live an hour away currently while our house finishes closing, so I’m curious why she said anything. Every time I do come over it’s decided way in advance. We make the plans then I come over. I have never in the three years we’ve been together come over without an explicit instructions. Which is fine, I don’t mind the driving, and I don’t mind that amount of control, it usually works in my favor as I spend time with my parents and brothers more. 

I was super fished out by that, so I asked if she was okay? She’s recently been given some less than awesome medical news, so I assume something bad is happening. She wouldn’t tell me anything, getting super defensive to the point of blocking me for two days on her phone and Facebook. (This a very regular occurrence. It’s her way of finishing an argument)

Fast forward to today, she says she’s doing a reveal tonight so I should be here by 630. 

I asked why can’t I be there. She initially says it was a planned surprise, and I told her This is very important to me, I would really appreciate going I want to experience this”

She gets defensive then starts saying this was payback for posting the ultra sound so I can either be there at 630 or I can find out on Facebook. 



There are so many behind the scenes stuff, a lot of unknowns and things I can’t tell in case someone recognizes this. 

I will answer any questions and try my best to fill in gaps that is needed. 

Any help, any insight, greatly appreciated. 

Edit: the reason for this submission is because I’m curious.  The reason me and her work as well as we do is because I am immune to her bull. I don’t want to let myself get angry if this was a normal thing with babies. I recognize I have no really legal right here. 

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for your input and advice. I really appreciate it. 

We talked tonight about it, ended up both yelling at each other. She said she just wanted to surprise me, and that I ruined her night. Which was never my intention. I didn’t cause a scene or even say anything. I acted pouty sure and I probably shouldn’t have but it didn’t take away from it. She’s very much stubborn and hard shelled. We yelled, cried, whatever. Didn’t come to an immediate solution. She doesn’t accept defeat with this sort of thing. But she was incredibly polite the rest of the night, so hopefully something stuck there. You’re all right, we have a lot to work out and I hope we do. I have hope because that’s what I need. Hopefully we can grow from this. Or anything. Thank you, everyone. 

We did the gender reveal, it’s a boy, so that’s exciting.

Yesterday I went to a 10:00 am class and there were tons of people waiting outside as there was yoga going on until the Zumba class began. One older woman left the yoga class a little early and came up to me and this is how our convo went:

My best friend of almost 10 years has been in law school for about a year. I also want to go to law school once I graduate after taking a few years off to work, but she went directly into law school from undergrad. 

As soon as she even started studying for the LSAT she would always rant to me about how hard it was. To make it worse, I go to a college across the country from where she currently lives, so most of our interactions are on Snapchat or phone calls. In the beginning, she would snapchat herself studying for the LSAT and preparing her applications to law school all the time. I supported her through it but once she actually got in to law school, it got worse.

Literally 90% of her Instagram posts are about law school. She’ll post to her story about eating cheese and caption it something like “cheese > law school”. Her captions always have to mention law school to the point where it’s driving me nuts, because every time we actually do talk on the phone about my law school plans, she’ll say something condescending like: “are you sure you want to do it? It’s so hard. Please don’t do it.”

Not only did I support her and continue to deal with her law school life 24/7, but I would expect her to at least reciprocate the same for me. I went to a top university for undergrad and she went to a state school (where she also happens to attend law school). Not like it matters, but saying “it’s so hard, don’t go to law school” feels like she’s telling me I can’t do it, even though I made it to an incredible university and have been working my ass off while studying so I can get those extracurriculars in. 

Now I’m literally triggered every time she posts about law school on Instagram or sends me a Snapchat of her “giving her first law school presentation” or “getting an A on her law paper!” I’ve supported her but now I’m just kind of tired and feel like I’m faking my excitement for her because she’s overdone it at this point. All she ever talks about is law school and I understand that it’s a huge achievement and big part of her life and she deserves bragging rights, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s just ridiculous.

I haven’t tried to approach her about this because it’s kind of the first time this has ever happened and I’ve dealt with it for so long. If I actually do decide to say something I feel like she’ll wonder why I never did beforehand and it’ll cause tension.

TLDR; my best friend got into law school and will not stop posting about it or telling me about it. Even though I’ve supported her throughout the process, she knows I want to go to law school too and constantly tells me to avoid it or not to go.

She's tried to make excuses to why she needs her computer but I don't believe that absolutely every assignment needs a computer, else why would she still need to buy textbooks? And she's getting fatter by being online and sitting so much.

My wife and younger daughter are saying I'm being unreasonable but I don't understand how setting a limit to technology can be a bad thing in this age. AITA?

edit for common questions: She is not failing classes but her time spent with the family has drastically dropped. I pay for her schooling and paid for her computer AFTER she initially raised enough money to get it on her own (I bought it as a reward so she could keep the money). She lives with us as her school is too close to reasonably use a dorm and I don't see a point in helping her get a place of her own to worry about bills when she must focus on school.

edit: Daughter has seen this post. We are going to sit down for discussion. Update tentative.

edit: Please stop sending me harmful DMs.
***
**UPDATE:** In the time that passed, my daughters and I sat down for a discussion. My wife didn't want to sit in. She has seen the post and hasn't spoken to me extensively to it yet, other than saying after the discussion with my daughter's that she feels she has failed as a mother in letting the both of them feel like they are trapped at home. We have not talked further.

It turns out my 17 year old (Amy) found my post and showed it to her sister (Zoe) whom I originally posted about, and was much more emotional about it than her. They prepped arguments. They were both explaining they think I was out of line and disrespectful for multiple things in what I said in both the OP and in the comments. After hearing what they had to say I agreed. They demanded I apologized and I did.

Zoe showed me programs on her laptop that she explained were either class sites, code work, and other related things. That and other comments from the previous post plus private conversations helped put things in perspective of how much workload is reliant on her computer and access to internet. I asked to see her grades and saw that some classes were hovering in the 80-70% grade. Her university requires at least 75% to pass the class, so it was possible that she was failing. Zoe says that she has had less time to work on school due to work. I wanted to voice being disappointed but Amy interrupted me and asked me to please listen. She's visibly upset and not the kind to speak loudly, which was surprising.

Zoe confessed she started working to get herself money to buy things and save for things like recently, another laptop she can claim full ownership to, and for renting an apartment to move out to with Amy, with absolutely no financial help from me to get their own place to stay. They live at home, so that hasn't happened. With Zoe's current job's payrate and the work she has at school anyway, it wouldn't have been possible to move, but the intent they had was hard to hear as it confirmed many comments from the previous post. For reference, Zoe started to work when she was 15. However, Zoe has made 0 effort to contribute to house bills pays for nothing such as the internet, the car she uses right now, the water, heating, etc. She is an adult but hasn't paid for any utilities, speaking as if she were a tenant. I said if she made more contributions to bills then I would be less strict on rules.

Zoe spoke about her cousin. She has said that when their older cousin (whom my daughters are very close to) found out that she and Amy were never taught how to budget money, had a word with my wife and then taught my daughters how to save their money and to get things like credits cards. I've never known about them having credit cards before. When Zoe asked her cousin how to start moving out and doing what she says are ""adult things"", their cousin gave her guidelines in what look for in apartments, the payment plans, or just starting smaller in getting a car. She quoted her cousin and said that she believes they both should have been taught these things much earlier. I don't appreciate how their cousin (supposedly) spoke about how and when my daughters should be taught things but see their point.

We eventually came to a compromise. The previous living conditions (must stay in the house through college for help in moving out later) was dropped. Zoe no longer has her laptop or computer privileges taken away, but I am adamant that she has to be in bed by 1am or it'll be forced off. If she can lose 30lbs then there will be no curfew. She gave me an attitude but eventually agreed to the conditions, which I thought were plenty fair. They ended saying they respect me, but don't love me. That's where we stand.

Now, my family has yet to have a meal together. My daughters go out together while my wife makes something for herself and leaves me to my own devices. Though it's not uncommon for us to not sit together, it feels like this is on purpose. I'm unsure where to go from here.",653,753,0.84
878,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker here using a throwaway just in case. TL;DR at the bottom.

Background: I (24M) share a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate (25F). We’ve lived together for more than a half year without any real issues until last night. We’re both single, and I have invited girls over to the apartment in the past and have given her a heads up nearly 100% of the time beforehand, while she doesn’t really date at all. Last night I had a date planned with a girl I met on Tinder.  I figured it was possible that she may come back to our place, so I warned my roommate. She let me know she would be downtown with her younger brother (18) seeing a concert, and that they would be back after midnight. She also said she was not comfortable with the girl being there while her brother was there, but that as long as the girl left before they came home then we were good. I asked her to text me when they were on their way to be safe, but that I would have the girl out by 11:30 if things went that way. So the girl and I met up for drinks, and the chemistry was there. I invited her back to my place, and we got there around 10:00. We go to my room and start up pretty quickly. 

Shit hits the fan: By around 10:30 we’re in a joint session of Congress, and I hear the front door open. I immediately stopped since the apartment was quiet, grabbed a Bluetooth speaker, put on some music, and got back at it. While putting on the music I noticed my roommate had texted me a warning, but it was 2 hours earlier than she said they would be back, and me and this girl weren’t anywhere close to done. So I made sure the music covered any noises, and spent the next hour getting several resolutions passed. We finish at 11:30, get dressed, and she’s out of the apartment at 11:35. After walking my date to her car, I checked my phone and see I got texts from my roommate, threatening to “Scream if she doesn’t leave” and ending with “IM SO FUCKING PISSED, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS”. 

AITA here? Should I have stopped on the spot just because they got home? Or am I justified because they got back earlier than expected? Would love some feedback here. 

TL;DR: Roommate and her teenage brother came home early while I was having sex with a girl in my room, and I just put on music and didn’t stop. Roommate is pissed. ",32,32,0.9
879,Not the A-hole,"My dad is out of town on a business trip and I was staying at my moms. I needed to get something from the house though so I texted my dad and told him I was coming over to get my stuff. He didn’t respond (later learned was on a flight) but I thought nobody was home so I went in. My stepmom was on the couch watching tv and it looked like i scared her walking in through the front door. She told me firmly that I can’t enter the house without permission and If i do it again they will change the code to the front door (It is a electronic door that uses a key pad to enter). My dad calls me later and says because I don’t have a relationship with my stepmom I cannot enter at my own will. We argue and don’t get anywhere for 15 minutes. I don’t think it’s a privilege to enter my own house without asking, in this case with no response to my request, but apparently it’s a privilege to step in one at all according to them. 

Little backstory its my dads gf but easier to call it stepmom and I can’t be home alone with friends over, even if stepmom is home (because i don’t have a relationship with her), and also I don’t have access to my garage code.

880,Asshole,"I was playing MTG a couple weeks ago at the card shop with my friends and about a dozen other people like I always do.  After the first round my friends and I all noticed a pretty foul body odor.  I get that MTG players have a stereotype of bad odor, and sometimes someone might have a little funk but this was pretty nasty.  We eventually found the source and it was a guy who nobody really talked to much.  He just came, played, and left each week.  Well we tried to ignore it since he had never had this issue before so I just assumed a freak occurrence.  It was gross, but we got through the night just fine.

Well last week we went in for games and the moment he got to the tables we all recognized the same stench as the week before.  At this point I went to the owner and asked if he could say something, but he refused saying we should just try to ignore it.  Well after a round of play it got so bad that my friends and several other players were stepping outside between games just to get fresh air away from him.  I finally had it and before the next round started I loudly announced to everyone

""to whoever didn't bother to take a shower today or even this week could you please do us all a favor and learn basic hygiene.  This is disgusting and you should know better.""

Everyone went quiet and the guy in question finished his game quickly left the store.  While everyone initially seemed to appreciate what I'd done the owner gave me a few dirty looks as did a few other players.  One even approached me after the tournament and told me that was a cruel way to handle the situation.

As we were leaving, we hugged and I felt a pretty strong desire to bond with my child, so I put my hand on the bump so I could connect with him/her. She swatted my hands away and stepped back from me and told me not to touch her. I tried to explain that I was just trying to bond with my kid, and she can't understand where I'm coming from because she gets to have this close connection with him/her and I am so separated from the baby right now.

Girlfriend is probably not going to be back living with me until after our lease expires. I have been breaking my back working a ton just to get by with the extra Bills. He told me yesterday he expects me to after this month to pick up her part of rent so he can save up to move out since he will be getting a new place 3 months before our lease expires. I told him absolutely not, I am staying in 1 room of the home and him in the other room (2bed townhome). It has driven a wedge between us and I feel hes trying to take advantage of me by asking me to pay 2/3s of rent while only using half the living space. I told him if he feels that strongly about it we can break the lease and go our separate ways. I understand the obligation for her to pay but she no longer lives here AITA?

883,Not the A-hole,"I (19f) live in a tiny 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other girls (both 20). In October 2018 one of my room mates, we will call her Kayla, reported me to the manager of our apartment complex for having my boyfriend at the time sleep over almost every single night. This really infuriated me at the time because my ex and I never bothered her/were excessively loud and we mostly stayed in my room. In fact, she frequently came into my room and hung out with both of us. 

Kayla and I were really good friends and personally I would never do something like that to one of my friends. Upon talking to management I learned that I was violating the lease by having a guest stay so many consecutive nights and the fine for that was $500 and Kayla knew about the fine when she reported me. I just felt like she could’ve talked to me before doing something so drastic. And I questioned for a long time whether I want to be friends with someone that would do something like this. I found it to be petty and highly dramatic considering we are all friends and my ex and I never bothered her. 

Fast forward to now, my ex and I have been broken up since January so the tension surrounding him being at our place so much was gone. Kayla and I have both been putting in effort to be better friends to one another and we had been getting a long fairly (we’ve butted heads many times in the past). Also noteworthy, Kayla now works at the apartment complex office. 

About a month ago she got out of a long-distance relationship and began fucking our downstairs neighbor. He has stayed at our place quite literally every single night since they met except for the occasion where they sleep at his place. 

This sort of fuels me with rage because 1) she reported me and could’ve gotten me a $ 500 fine 2) her jobs partially consists of enforcing rules such as the guest limit 3) after she reported me we were on the outs for months 4) she barely knows this guy, my guy and I had been dating for a year. He stays all day and all night. Not just sleeping up with her. Also want to note that she has started treating me like chopped liver since he came around. 

Im really really tempted to report her to the office the same way she reported me with no warning. I would kind of feel guilty if it affected her job but at the same she sort of deserves a taste of her own medicine in my eyes.

886,Asshole,"To start, the cast of characters is me and my older coworker (late 50s).  As background, she is not in the same department as me, but we work on some projects together.  In our shared projects, she is technically my subordinate - but I try to view it as a collaboration.  We are friendly and laugh together and get along, but we have never had lunch together or see each other outside of work.

Now that the context has been laid out, onto the story.  The other day she came to work with a very cool hair style.  (She always has cool hairstyles.)  The underside of her hair was dyed in a rainbow fashion.  As we were passing each other in the hall, we greeted each other and I commented that I liked her hair while casually indicating the colors - but by actually touching her hair.  She thanked me and we continued on our way.  I didn't think much of it, until another coworker caught me at the end of the hall and told me it was wrong and you aren't supposed to touch a black woman's hair.  I didn't know that there was etiquette involved and I feel really bad, especially if she only tolerated the action because I'm more senior.  So, was I the asshole? 

EDIT: ok. I’m the asshole. But just to clarify some things since a lot of people are reading actions in my post that didn’t happen. I did not stroke, caress, run my fingers through, pull, pet, or yank her hair, as a lot of commenters said I did. 

As I was pointing my finger for a brief second (less than a second really) grazed her hair. I can’t say the moment was an accident, but it is not like I was interested in actually touching her hair to feel it. I was pointing at one part of her hair because she had a very intricate hair style and I was pointing at the colored part. 

Now, obviously, I need to be in better control and not let myself get that close again as people don’t like it. Although, as I said, she didn’t react to the touch at all and we continued chatting. 

Touching other people is probably something I will have to work on in general as I’m a touchy feely person. So, no, in answer to some of you, I don’t mind if people touch me. And they do. When I was pregnant people touched my belly. It didn’t bother me. Oh well. Lesson learned. ",553,1026,0.93
887,Not the A-hole,"My best friend of 15 years hopped on the antivax movement a couple of years ago. Obviously this has caused a few arguments in the past, but for the most part we avoid the topic because she knows how much it bothers me. 

So last week we got on the topic of kids and she said “Obviously I wouldn’t get them vaccinated” which even though I knew how she felt about it, really really upset me. So I responded with “I might not be able to change your mind, but if you don’t vaccinate your kids then they’re not allowed to play with mine.” 

As soon as I said that she went off about how I would be irresponsible for getting them vaccinated and how it wouldn’t be fair to the kids to prevent them from playing with each other just because I didn’t agree with her. I told her that at that point they would pose a risk to my children and just because she was willing to risk her kids lives because of her stupid reckless opinion doesn’t mean I’m going to. It got really heated and obviously didn’t end well.

Ever since then, she’s been spamming me with phony articles supporting her views all citing no existent studies and spouting the same bs. I just ignored her and honestly didn’t feel like I did anything wrong until a few of our mutual friends messaged me saying “You guys don’t even have kids, just let it go.” And “Would you really isolate your kids just because you disagree with her” and “You’re would vaccinate your kids anyway, there would be no health risk to them.” Completely missing the point. 

These friends messaging me all disagree with anti vaxxers, but are acting like I’m an awful person. AITA? Should I just drop it?


EDIT: I feel like I need to defend my friend here, she’s not and inherently stupid person. She’s actually normally very intelligent and we tend to agree on most things, the things we don’t we can normally still have a civil conversation about. This is just the exception and the seriousness of the topic tends to get us both very worked up. 

It wasn’t a question about whether you agree with anti vaxxers or not, I know most people’s opinions on that. The question was in this situation, should I just let it go because it’s a hypothetical even though it’s something I’m very passionate about. I love my friend, she’s been my best friend for 15 years and we’ve never really had issues like this before. I don’t want to just drop her. I understand the passionate responses, but I didn’t want people hating on her. Hating on the ani vax movement is fine, but I didn’t make this post so people would hate on her.

890,Not the A-hole,"My sister gets married in a few months. I will be a bridesmaid. A number of weeks ago, she came to me saying she was calling off the wedding, she confessed he was abusive and controlling - for context she listed behaviours such as him mocking her young child, mocking her body, dictating how long she could be away from him for. All the classic symptoms of gaslighting and abuse. She was, mentally, a mess. 

I myself escaped a very abusive relationship in the not-too-distant past. I validated all of her suspicions about her own relationship, knowing she was obviously going to have trouble trusting her gut/her version of reality, but I was very careful not to put words into her mouth. She labelled him, not me. I comforted her, offered her and her son a bed in my home, gave them an escape plan and supported her as best I could. 

Fast forward a week, the wedding is back on. I understand she is a victim, so I was keen not to get angry or disappointed at her going back to him. I've been there, I get it. I expressed that I couldn't unhear what she had said, that I loved and supported her, that I respected her right to make her own decisions - but I could no longer tolerate the man. I explained I would attend her wedding if she wanted me to, I wouldn't ever act untoward or ask her to choose, but that I simply wasn't capable of being anything beyond civil for her benefit. She understood why, given my past. I maintained I would always be there for her. I felt like I was willing to swallow my objections for her benefit so long as she undstood me. 

I tried to be neutral. It became apparent there was still friction on her side. It came to a head when she stated the issue was mine, I was wrong for not wanting to speak to him, I needed to accept him, and insinuated I was exaggerating my own history.

892,Not the A-hole,"So I have been paying for my Netflix and Hulu for a long time. Netflix I watch a lot, but Hulu I barely look at.

Now the other day I did the math just for the cost of Netflix every month for 6 years and ...it came out to a lot. Like it really added up. That’s not even including the Hulu account. 

The thing is... I don’t even use Hulu, I literally only keep it because my parents and brother watch my account. But that leaves me paying $12 a month, for other people to enjoy television. I only haven’t gotten rid of it because I was scared they’d be mad if I did, but at the same time they’ve been enjoying it for free for so long, how is that fair?

Also Netflix is about to bump up to something like  $15 a month to have more than 2 people watch it at a time. I currently have like 4 people not including myself watching on my account (my parents, my brother and his girlfriend). My boyfriend though currently has nobody on his account and has kindly said I could use his for free, which would give me a nice break from having other people mooch off of my account that I’ve been paying the total cost for since I was literally a teenager.

So please, if I delete either or both of these accounts to save some money, will I be the asshole? I don’t want to disappoint people or make them mad at me but rounding the Netflix costs to just $13 a month I calculated that over the past 6 years I’ve payed $936+ for Netflix that everyone uses but nobody helps pay for, and as for Hulu I don’t even use it and would not miss it. Please give me your honest opinions, they’re all older than me with their own jobs/money, is this really a fair deal?

None of his family will talk to him after he stole over 20 thousand dollars from his dad. He mooched off my mom for their entire marriage. He refused to work and made my mom work 2 jobs to support us all. That was until her found a younger, hotter woman and ran of with her, leaving my mom with 4 kids to take care of on her own. He only ever reappears from time to time to ask for money or get something. When I was in college my brother let him sleep on his couch only to have my father steal his truck and try to sell it.

He's even tried to contact my mother and apologize.

I don't buy it. Up until yesterday I had two short conversations with him and while he is acting as if he's sorry there was something telling me he's lying. So against the advice of my siblings I met him yesterday for lunch to talk.

It turns out he has lung cancer and has 6 months to live. He says this has been his wake up call and that he want's to spend his last moments ""being the father he never was"" to us.

Towards the end of it, I honestly had enough with his groveling and told him what I thought.

I told him that he is a piece of human trash and that I will never accept his apology. That he has abused me and everyone else for all this time and he's not truly sorry. He only want's to feel better about it now that he's going to die. I told him that I'm happy that he's finally going to be gone. That him getting cancer is a sign of gods mercy to the world. I told him that he's going to die alone and unloved by everyone and that all of his kids will fucking party once we get the news. I ended by telling him that the last time I will ever thing of him is when I pour his ashes down the toilet after pissing in his urn.

He's apparently told my sister what happened and after talking with her this morning she says I went over board. She says that he's dying and I should have not told him that.

894,Asshole,"I was married to my ex husband for seven years before we divorced.  He had a daughter from a previous relationship who was 12 at the time.  In the beginning we had a very strained relationship understandably, but she grew to like me eventually.  For whatever reason though I just never felt all that much of a connection to her on my part though, despite my best efforts at it.  I always outwardly showed her love and kindness.  I always thought that it might be a “fake it until you make it” kind of thing so I just kept the act up hoping one day it would become real for me.  It never really did though.  

Now that her father and I are no longer together I’m in an awkward position.  She stays in touch often.  She texts multiple times a week and is constantly trying to arrange spending time together.  I’m still pretty raw about my divorce and these interactions really are just a reminder of him and nothing more.  I’m just getting nothing out of them emotionally besides painful reminders. 

If she was a child I might try to keep up the act, but she’s an adult now.  I’ve started making excuses not to get together with her and have become as distant as possible through texts.  Giving only the bare minimum answers or outright ignoring some.  I don’t really want to be brutally honest with her since she’s done nothing wrong in all this.  So I’m just doing a slow back step out of her life.  ",74,42,0.8

I arrived at Starbucks, bought myself some coffee and sat down at the small individual table. I was working on my essay for school so I had my textbook, notes, computer all around. I had been there about an hour and was on my second coffee

A trashy looking woman with her newborn infant strapped to the front of her comes in and looks around. There was a seat available at the big communal table (but like I said, not much desk space for my computer, textbook etc)

The woman taps me on the shoulder (I had my earphones in) and asks me if I can move seats and she can take my seat. I tell her no, I came here first, I’m currently writing my paper, it would be a hassle to pick up everything and move and I need to write this essay. She then gets demanding, tells me I “need” to move because she has an infant. I start getting heated and tell her to back the fuck off and leave me alone. She looks shocked and goes to complain to the barista.  Barista says there is nothing they can do because nobody can “make” another person move seats. She then storms out of Starbucks

We're both in two different stages of life, so we don't see each other very often--usually, once during the week (if we're lucky) and, on the weekends she doesn't work, we spend all weekend together. I love her and I'm IN love with her. 

However, I don't like talking on the phone. It just isn't a form of communication I enjoy. I don't like talking on the phone at work, i don't like talking on the phone with my mother, brother, father, or friends. Once in a while to catch up? Sure! 

But with my girlfriend, it's all throughout the day texting, then it's a phone call on the car ride home, then texting all throughout the night, and then a phone call before bed. It feels like it's constant communication, even when she's not around.

898,Not the A-hole,"First of all sorry for the title, couldn't think of anything better.

Context: So, two close friends of mine had a child together recently, and named me godfather. They had some requests that I 100% agree (like vaccines, washing your hands to pick up the baby etc) and some that i don't necessarily do (like no cursing with the baby present, even though she will not learn anything) but follow, since, well, their child.

And one of the things they specifically told everyone they don't want is kissing the baby. Something related to baby acne, I don't know a lot about, but the rules were set. But their grandmother simply cannot understand that and insists on hugging and kissing the baby whenever they aren't looking.

I told the parents about it and boy they were pissed, confronted the grandmother and I thought problem solved. But no, she continued to do it and I was included on her ""avoid doing while looking"" list, and some marks (don't know if indeed acne, a regular rash or some other thing) started to appear on the baby's face.

Now to the possible asshole part: one day, I catch her with some other family members kissing and passing the baby as it was a doll for them to put their lips on, so I came in, asked for the baby kinda already taking her from the grandm. She insisted on not giving him to me, saying she was family and i'm not, and I have no right to take her grandchildren from her, to Wich I replied ""well, if an outsider cares more about the baby's health than her own grandmother, I think the problem isn't on me, when you learn to follow the rules the parents set, I'll give her back to you"" and went to another room.

Not 10 minutes later the rest of the family all left, and the mother said even if I'm right, I shouldn't have said that. I apologized but I'm divided because later the father thanked me and said I did what I should've done. So, AITA here? Do I have a position to make sure the parents rules are followed even if it's against the blood family?

Edit: to clarify, I put godfather to simplify my relationship with the parents. I am aware that a godfather is a mere title that church gave me, and I have no legal basis, so I'll explain a little further.

The parents (19F and 20M) and I (21M) have known each other for 12+ years, essentially childhood friends. We have built in this 12 years a relationship that is more firm than any other relationship I would ever imagine. When they announced pregnancy, the grandma didn't took it in the way we expected. Their relationship wasn't that good, but me and mom's sis were the main support for them in a non-expected pregnancy, with GM basically spending 9 months telling them how irresponsible they were and other things no one needs to hear about.

So when I say that I consider myself (and the parents do too) the kids uncle, I don't say it based on a mere tile that some church said I was. I say it based on the decade of memories and support we gave each other through 90% of our lives.",172,603,0.98

902,Not the A-hole,"I paid for 10 sessions of personal training just to learn some basics so I could start working out on my own afterwards. 

My trainer assured me multiple times that at the end of the 10 sessions I would receive a personalized exercise plan with all my baseline statistics. 

On the last day, instead of going over this exercise plan as promised, he aggressively tried to sell me on one of his group classes. I’m bad at saying no so I just said I would have to think about it and I would let him know. He said to come in on Wednesday for free.

On Monday he texted me asking if I made up my mind. I politely declined, thanked him for the excellent training, and asked if I should still come in on Wednesday (assuming this would be when I would get my exercise plan). He didn’t respond, which was odd because he usually responds fairly quickly.

Wednesday morning I text him “is everything alright?” and he promptly replies with a long ass sales pitch text telling me how he “doesn’t give this deal to everybody” and “it’s a crazy no brainer bro.” He offered to give me the whole first month free. I again explained that I would love to but could not for financial reasons and would hate to waste his time by taking the free month. He did not respond.

A week later I get an email from the gym asking for feedback on my training experience. I wrote something like “Not a great experience. Was promised a personalized exercise plan but just got an aggressive sales pitch and he stopped replying to my texts after I politely declined.”

I thought this was anonymous but apparently not because a few days later I got a super defensive text message from my trainer asking why I didn’t just ask about the plan, that he wasn’t ignoring me he just “gets busy,” and that he “went above and beyond to take care of me.”

He’s right that I could’ve just asked about the exercise plan, but I felt like I was being ignored, and I figured it’s not worth the trouble cause i can easily just make one myself or find one online. 

I thought he was really nice during the training so I feel bad that I may have gotten him disciplined for no reason.

903,Not the A-hole,"In two months my class is graduating. They are all excited about it. I am not. I really don’t want to go. I don’t have any friends and I won’t enjoy it the least. There is so much group pressure surrounding it, and theres a lot of money to be paid. We have to pay for dinner and then 7 tickets to the party. I have bought my 7 tickets and am now supposed to sell them to 7 people, but I don’t have any friends. So I have now paid what equals to around 100 dollars for these tickets that I am not able to sell. I will then have to pay  200 dollars for the dinner. 

I have now decided not to go. I have been to stressed and anxious about it. I cry everytime someone mentions it.  Of course, I now want my money back for the 7 tickets and I don’t want to pay for the dinner I’m not going to. It is possible they now have to pay for that, but slit by 30 people I don’t think it will be that much. I still feel like an ass for not telling them sooner, but I have really bad social anxiety (diagnosed, I go to a therapist). I have postponed this because I hoped I could deal with it but I can’t. I am not even sure I will be able to tell them I am not coming because of my anxiety. My whole body shakes by the thought of writing to them about this. I feel like they will hate me. I don’t know what to do. 

It will probably end with me paying everything and then not going, but I don’t want to throw that money away. They have never asked if everyone is going, they just assumed it. I am trying to summon the courage and write to one of the planners that I won’t be coming. I am not close to anyone in my class, we never talk. I am the outsider. I don’t want to ruin my graduation by forcing myself to be there and then just try to not cry all day. I can barely sleep because I am so stressed and anxious about the graduation party. I have cried myself to sleep over this more than a few times. I just don’t want to go. 

So WIBTA if I now told them that I am not coming? Even if it means they might have to pay a little extra? My 7 tickets they will be able to sell because they have a lot of friends so they will get that money back, they just have to split the 200 dollars between them which would be around 7 dollars each (if they even have to pay that, it is possible they created a larger budget and would have to give back a little money). 

Edit: After some people confirmed I am not an asshole, I decided to finally message a classmate who is in the party planning committee. I told her that I really don’t want to go and she knows about my social anxiety. She answered pretty quickly and said that she understood and if I changed my mind I just had to tell her. I am so relieved. I do not have to pay for the dinner. I will give back 6 tickets so the class can sell them, so I will get money back for them. One is for me to keep if I change my mind and go to the party (but not dinner). So I am perfectly happy about that. Thanks for giving me enough courage to do this! ",14,99,0.93
904,Not the A-hole,"I have a crazy aunt. But she's not erratic, or weird, or the loony-type crazy aunt -- she's a flat-out terrible person, who married my father's brother. My entire life, she's shown up late to everything, shown zero regard for other people's feelings or needs. She was the only family member who wouldn't help clean up after dinner, she would yell at her children in a foreign language, she lied to her Muslim au pair about a dish not containing pork and thus had that poor college student unknowingly violate her religion. She let her infant child use crayons on my mom's couch, got upset when my mom took the crayon away from the infant and then took the whole family home in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner because she was so insulted. There's a lot more, but you get the idea.

The worst thing yet happened last fall. My grandmother, who lives out-of-state, fell very ill, and was in the hospital (she's actually doing quite well now); several of my family members went down to visit her on rotations to help my grandfather take care of her. At one point, this aunt went down for her turn. The first or second day there, she ended up in a screaming match with the oncologist, in the hospital, which then turned into an argument with my grandparents. It ended with her telling both of them ""f\*\*\* you"" to their faces, and going straight to the airport and flying home. My parents, myself, my siblings -- we are FURIOUS. My uncle has been under her command their entire marriage, and as far as we know has just avoided the entire topic in the months since.

I do not want to invite this woman to my wedding, though I love her husband and her children, my cousins, who are now 30/26/16. I think there is an acceptable limit in terms of a way you can act towards my family, and she crossed the line. Without what happened to my grandparents, it would have been 50/50 that she gets invited, but after that I had no interest in including her in any of it.

907,Everyone Sucks,"Hey guys. On throwaway here.

&#x200B;

For context: I (23f) have been living with a host family for the past four months in a foreign country. This host family had to go through a rigorous selection process with the program I'm currently working with to host me, so it's not like my presence here is any surprise to them. I pay them each month a more than decent amount for food and rent. In a few months I may have the chance to move out, but that's not an option right now.

This host family has a fourteen year old boy who is usually home in the early afternoon every day. He does not have any friends that he hangs out with and he has no hobbies but watching YouTube and Vine compilations and listening to Bebe Rhexa and Ava Max, usually the same couple songs at least once or twice a day.

Because of my job and our location in a relatively isolated village, I am usually in the house at the same time as him every day. There is only one cafe in town, and it is not a good place for studying (it's covered in cigarette smoke and has no outlets for my ten-year-old laptop), so I usually try to do work in my room. This, however, has been rendered impossible because my host brother has rigged a stereo system to play his videos and music on thee wall adjacent to my bedroom's. Over the past four months I have tried giving him headphones, explaining that I need to study, and trying to bribe him into being quieter. Sometimes it works, but it's largely dependent on his mood, and the agreement never usually lasts longer than an hour or so.  I've taken to wearing earplugs all day and night in my house and leaving for two or three hour long walks to avoid the constant barrage of sound. I've mentioned this and a few other scuffles we've had to his parents, who are usually not home until very late at night and leave very early in the morning, they wave it off as puberty and shrug.

Well, today was raining. And I've been stressing like mad about the GREs and my lack of mathematical ability. So when my host brother came home, powered up his computer and started blasting his YouTube like usual, I went out and asked him to put in the headphones I gave him. He refused and when I asked why, he said, ""Because I don't want to."" When I told him that I didn't want to have to listen to his videos, he responded, ""Well, that's not my problem.""

Guys, I went ballistic. Full-on freak-out, F-bombs every other word. Any time I could ad an adjective, it was an expletive. Four months I've been dealing with this kid's crap and it just all came to a head. I spent a good five minutes detailing just how f\*cking disrespectful he is as a human being. I have never in my life spoken to another person like how I spoke to him.

Currently I'm hiding out in my room. All is quiet on the western front now, so I suppose that's good at least. His parents still haven't come home, but I'm waiting for when they do and we all have a really fun family get-together.

Edit: I read your comments and thought about my actions. My tirade was very emotion-fueled and I was childish myself in this situation. I decided to talk through what happened with my host brother, apologize about my outburst and explain calmly my side of the story over some chocolates. It ended up being a very productive conversation and at the end of it he apologized for being cocky and not listening to me. We finished up in a hug, and, at this point, honestly I feel like I'm the one more upset by my actions than he is. ",68,615,0.97
908,No A-holes here," My brother and I are the only family we have, I'm 26 and he's 29, and we were really close. 

  I got married 7 years ago (yes at 19, I was stupid) to my first wife but that marriage fell apart quickly because we were never really in love, just liked each other and thought we might as well give it a shot. The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. 

 Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). 

 Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?

910,Asshole,"So, about 4 weeks ago my now ex girlfriend and I broke up. It wasn't messy but we both agreed we weren't right for each other. 

The entire time we were dating she said she was on the pill. 

Now about 2 weeks ago she told me she was pregnant. And that she must've forgotten the pill once or it was during a cross over period of when she got back on the pill. I'm not really sure how it works, but I went to the doctors with her and we were told she was roughly 8 weeks.  
We both sat down, spoke about it and agreed that termination was the best option as neither of us were ready for a child and it would be raised in a broken house to start with. 

Anyway this past week I've seen Snapchats of her drinking. I messaged her and said she shouldn't be drinking while pregnant. 
She replied with ""why? We're getting rid of it anyway"". 

I said it doesn't matter, it's still our child and whilst you're pregnant you still shouldn't be drinking. 
This didn't sit well with her. She pulled the ""well you're not my boyfriend"" card. 

Am I the asshole here? Does it really not matter? Or should I still be pissed.

EDIT:

Okay, going to say a few things here because this is getting out of hand:

Im not ""controlling"". Stop getting your knickers in a twist. I 100% UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS HER BODY AND HER CHOICE. I did not say she shouldn't drink because I wanted to ""control"" her. I said it because it was a kneejerk reaction to ""hang on,drinking while pregnant is bad"". Stop pushing an agenda on this specific detail and taking it WAY out of proportion.

Secondly, not a SINGLE SANE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL would say that drinking while pregnant is a safe or smart move. The amount of people here who seem to be okay with this is astounding.

Thirdly, Not that it matters one bit, but, we broke up because we had NO COMMON INTERESTS. I actually suggested we break up. She said she wasn't really feeling it either. It was easy, it was mutual and there was no argument. We just, didn't like any of the same things, didn't have any of the same hobbies, we tried to find something we could do as a couple to be ""our thing"", and we couldn't. Sometimes things just don't work out.

Fourth(ly?), she has suggested getting back together since the pregnancy, only last week. I said to her, kindly and respectfully that this would be a bad decision, and that she's only saying this because she misses having someone there, and that in the future she will find someone who is a better fit for her, then myself. 

Fifth(ly?), I actually want the mods to remove this. Not because of the obviously overwhelming ""YTA"" posts, but because there are comments going back and forth to myself, and other redditors that do NOT help, educate or provide any purpose to the conversation what-so-ever. It has gotten out of hand. I have received personal messages of abuse (fuck off, please.), and personal messages of support from people who cant be assed commenting here because they know they'll just get instantly downvoted and have people hurling messages at them for simply stating their own opinion. 

My Ex and I have had talks since this argument. About lots of things. There is no hate between us. There is no tension. We are getting along just fine. I told her from day 1 of finding out she is pregnant, that the choice is hers. That if she chooses to keep the baby then I will stick around as a father. But I laid out to her my thoughts on the situation in an adult way and she did so as well, which is why we came to the conclusion we did. 
People do seem to forget that people change their minds all the damn time. This is NOT black and white. She MAY turn around and say she wants to keep the baby, in which case, I HAVE TO SUPPORT that decision because yes it is HERS to make. However that would also make me the father, and I will not just dissapear in the event of her keeping the baby. I do not believe in running from something like that. So yes, I would appreciate she did not drink until the abortion is done. The abortion is booked in for the 12th. 6 days from now. She found out about the pregnancy a week before she told me, so this would put her at just on 4 weeks from the date she found out, to the termination (assuming she doesn't change her mind). 
We do live in Australia. No, apparently it's not free. She said its still going to cost. I offered to be there for her during it, and to pay the entire bill. She said she didn't want me there and that she didn't want me to pay and that this is something she feels she needs to do alone. I respect this, however I am only a message away if she needs the support. 

I should not need to go into this much detail about the whole situation, and quite frankly I am disgusted in the amount of people being okay with a pregnant woman drinking. If a medical professional wouldn't recommend it, then it's probably not okay.",552,488,0.84
911,Not the A-hole,"Got married 6 years ago. Love marriage and all. Everything seemed perfect. 3 months into the marriage, we found out that my wife was pregnant. We were elated.

At 8 months of pregnancy, we discovered some complications. We were forced to fly back home where more complications were discovered, and we were told our child would only survive a few hours.

Our daughter turned 5 (years old) a few months back. She suffers from a rare genetic disorder which translates into various mental and physical anomalies.

The first 2 years was spent keeping her alive with minimal intervention. We burned through all our savings. I stopped working & became her primary caretaker. Our marriage took a hit since we both were still reeling from the whole situation.

The past 3 years, our daughter has been relatively stable. We've been fixing our marriage & I've started working part time. We're slowly & steadily building up savings.

Three years ago, my wife started talking about having a second child. I told her it wasn't the best time since we were still trying to ascertain the syndrome our daughter suffered from through genetic testing. The results would help us ascertain the probability of the second child suffering the same. That due to logistical reasons only got done partially & hit the back burner.

A year later, my wife brought up the topic again & I said it would make sense once we got healthier. Both of us had gained 10 kilos due to improper sleep & stress related binge eating. Our knees had started to hurt. Both of us failed to lose any weight.

So last year the topic was brought up again & we decided we'd start planning once our savings hit a certain point. We reached that point in Jan this year. Perfect you'd think. Nope. My wife was handed a 40% pay cut in Feb which literally wipes out the money we were saving every month. Last month was the first time our expenses were greater than our income.

My wife believes she can quit her job & freelance. She believes that together we’d be able to make more than we are right now. I completely agree but I’m afraid of the risks of it not working out. Additionally, we get health insurance through my wife’s company. If we were to get insurance on our own, we’d be paying a premium which would be at least 5 times higher. That single cost would wipe out 30% of our savings.

So, the plan in my head is to stick to what we are doing & find ways of reducing our expenses.

My wife thinks I’m a coward.

She thinks I worry too much & that things will fall into place. That a second child would be good for us & maybe bring some normalcy in our life.

I’d love a second child, but I don’t want it to be at the cost of our daughter's comfort. I know I spend too much time worrying about our daughter, but I’m afraid she’d out live us.

914,Asshole,"**Edit: Consensus is definitely I’m an asshole it seems. After reading the suggestions I’ve decided to:**

**1. Give each of my kids around 500K to go towards their mortgages/debt.**

**2. Use 5-6M to set up trusts to provide for any grandkids / great grandkids. I’m not sure how trusts work so I'll definitely consult a lawyer about this.**

**3. Leave the remainder (approx 6-7M) to charities that help kids in China with schooling and healthcare. I’m not Chinese (I’m white) but I’ve always enjoyed visiting China and have a special respect for their country and culture. I was already planning on doing this but didn’t want to include it in the original post as it might have skewed your opinions away from asshole.**

**I might post an update depending on how my kids react when I tell them. Thanks for the advice.**

---------------------------------------

I am in my mid 60's and have 7 kids (all adults, 4 daughters 3 sons).

I grew up in a very poor family and have worked incredibly hard my entire life to provide for my family. Working 50+ hours a week and investing every spare dollar into blue chips. As a result, my entire estate is worth well over $10M.

Now, to the topic of my post. Three of my kids are proud ""child-free"" adults. Not only do they not want kids, they actively celebrate it (I believe there's even a Reddit dedicated for it...). Now, if they don't want to experience the joys of being parents, that's for them to decide. I'm not going to coerce them into having kids they don't want.

With that said, I provided all my kids an immensely comfortable childhood, I've put them all through college, I basically gave them the best chance to starting out in life. Now that they're all grown up, I want to help raise the next generation of grandkids and provide for them as much as possible.

So the situation is:

1. I have three kids who are proud ""child-free"" and genuinely boast about how much extra money they have
2. I have four kids who have started raising families - intending to have more kids - and will actually need the money.

I don't want to leave a large sum of my hard earned money to my kids who will simply spend it all on their ""child-free"" life. I only want it to go to my kids who are actually raising a family. So I want to cut the three out of my will almost entirely (leaving a small amount to help with their mortgages).

I already anticipate they're going to throw a hissy-fit, so I'm not sure if I should go through with it.

Would I be an ""asshole"" for doing this?

916,Asshole,"I can’t tell if this is hormones or rational so I thought I’d come to you lovely people for advice. 

I had a baby last weekend, my first and he is perfect. 

My best friend is the first person we told. She didn’t seem excited so I figured it was shock and she’d come around. She was there for me some during the pregnancy- I had a scare one day and she came over to sit. 

She’s short on money so husband and I planned on paying her to watch our dogs this week. She watches them fairly often and sometimes just asks to because she misses them. She was excited to keep them. 

And then my water broke and all she said back was “I’m sick”. Even though we had plans the next day and had been texting all day. Out of the blue sick. I thanked her for telling me and not getting baby sick and really believed her at first. But almost a week later I’ve asked her how she’s doing twice and she hasn’t asked me how I am at all. 

During the pregnancy it was something we barely talked about because I could tell she had little interest. We still hung out at least once a week. Little interest was fine with me during it because I felt like she wasn’t just treating me like an incubator like so many tend to do. But now I’m thinking it’s deeper and I’m really resenting not even a “how are ya?” When she lives five minutes away and we had set plans in place for how she was supposed to help.

917,Not the A-hole,"I (18M) found out in these last few weeks that I got into an Ivy League college, I was over the moon of course...

But everyone doubted me. My parents said I couldn't do it. My teachers said I couldn't. Most of all, my friends also said it. They said that its so hard that I should look at applying elsewhere. 

Now some people motivate themselves by wanting to prove all their doubters wrong, but I had a different philosophy. I just didn't take their doubts of me seriously. Whenever people made doubting comments, I just treated it as if they were the opinions of a fly (now obviously I don't treat all their opinions like that, just the doubts they had of me).

I knew where I wanted to go, and I would let nothing stop me.

So when my friends initially found out that I got in they congratulated me. We met up recently though and one of them asked me ''How did you do it?? Nobody really thought you stood a chance'' so I just told him ''Honestly, when you guys doubted me, I just didn't take you seriously''. They looked pretty offended when I said that and one of them text me after said I was being an asshole by saying shit like that.

But it's true??? That's how i felt. I never took my parents, teachers or friends seriously when they doubted me, because I only saw my own reality, that I would succeed. AITA?",52,73,0.83

919,Asshole,"For those who dont know a vesting cliff is basically the moment a startup founder receives a portion of his equity. Like lets say you started a company with someone, but you didnt know them that well, youd give them equity gradually after theyve been with the company awhile. That way they dont just claim ownership and then leave the first week without contributing.

In this case the CTO of my company had a vesting schedule of 4 years, with his cliff at 1 year. So this means if he is with the company a year, he immediately receives 25% of his equity. So if his equity is 20%, he receives 5% ownership right there. Then for the next 3 years he gets equity every month, gradually until he gets all of it after 4 years. Thats how its supposed to work.

Now, if you dont make it to the cliff for whatever reason, you get nothing.

So now that that is explained, I am the COO of a startup headed into series a funding. The CTO is someone whose been with the company for 10 months. The issue is, he doesnt have much in the way of qualifications or education. I mean he is educated but theres nothing special or unique on his resume besides one small project before us and our project.

The investment group interested in funding us is trying to free up as much equity as possible, so theyre looking to trim the fat and prevent issues down the line. We are of the opinion that they want a superstar genius as CTO. The CEO of my company, along with the CVO both met with me to discuss cutting the CTO loose before his cliff.

He would basically leave with nothing after 10 months of work. They asked for my input and I recommended firing him and replacing him with someone with a wider skillset and a better pedigree.

I am the one who broke the news. He did not take it well obviously as we did basically deny him potentially millions of dollars down the line and a high paying job to boot. He also lost any claim on his prior work, naturally.

AITA? Should I have kept him through his cliff?

Edit: Just to clarify

Maybe ""nothing"" isnt the right word, he obviously made good money in his position while he had it and he is definitely going to get a great recommendation. 

But yeah he did lose a good amount. Definitely not what he was expecting so I can understand the reaction. ",165,137,0.9

921,Everyone Sucks,"I’m new to reddit and idk if this would be the correct subreddit to post in, but here it goes. Basically my roommate and my ex are currently dating (so there’s tension that has built up from that) but that’s only part of what this story is about. At my college there is a place where people who can’t afford groceries for the week can go to get a few of the necessities things like bread, noodles, toothpaste etc. For the past few months I noticed they get back to the apartment and they have all this food with them and they both told me they got it from said program. I know for a fact they both have decent paying job and can obviously afford their own groceries, and the idea of taking something that’s meant to help people in need doesn’t sit well with me because I felt they were abusing a system that is trying to help others. After expressing my concern they tell me “well it’s not our fault they just give this away, plus it’s an easy way to save money.” This went on for about a few months and eventually I’ve had enough. Wanting a bit of what I’ll admit is some petty revenge on my roommate for dating my ex I went to where the program is and told them that my ex and roommate were taking stuff because it was free and not for necessity and talked about how they were abusing the system. The person that’s in charge the program asks for their names, looks them up on the school data base and social media and this confirms I was telling the truth. Currently their pictures are on the outside of where the program is and they’re banned from going inside. They claim that I’m an asshole because I “ruined their vacation plan” because now they have to pay for their own groceries instead of using a system that’s supposed to help people that need it. YNTA when you expose someone for abusing a system right?

Edit: a point was made about how much they were actually making, I grew up with both of these people and they grew up in upper-middle class neighborhoods and their parents are paying for their college. Along with my roommate having basically a full ride scholarship

922,Not the A-hole,"So, just some background information first; We've been planning this wedding for 2 years & my friend has never been on the guest list, & when we started planning she was single, we saw each other about once every other month & spoke sporadically. Once she met her girlfriend she started seeing me more as we could do couples stuff but it's still not often we all see each other.
A couple who are invited to the wedding are very close friends I game with who live in a different city but we speak & skype often & visit each other for long weekends. This becomes relevant I promise.

Anyway, the other night her girlfriend (GF) messaged me asking what time they needed to be at the hotel for the wedding as my friend needed to book time off work. I told her that they weren't invited to the wedding & maybe she'd confused it with the party we were hosting after we returned from our honeymoon. No reply to the message straight away but saw it.

I went to bed & the next morning had messages off both the GF & my friend. My friend simply stating how she'd sort it but was disappointed in me & her GF going off at me about how we were such close friends & how I'd ruined her plans to propose to my friend at MY wedding & that she wouldn't forgive me, especially as I'd invited ""Random geeks off the internet"" (Told you it was relevant).

I muted the chat & got on with my day. When I did look back through her messages she'd played the gay card (I'm bi) & said she'd been dreaming about the wedding & planning how and when to propose. I told her she was obsessive & that she needed to realise that it was my wedding.

I got a message from my friend telling me I shouldn't have been rude to her GF & that we'd known each other a lot longer than the other friends I'm inviting, however they know my favourite colour & my partners middle name whereas she called my partner Bill for 2 years. I told her if she didn't like it they didn't have to talk to me again & they should just forget about the party though if they apologised I'd reconsider letting them attend the party though the apology had to be in person. 

Not heard from either, the GF has removed me as a friend but not blocked me.

Yesterday I was on the way home from work and decided to call in BK for a double cheeseburger (£1.49), I was  approached by a homeless man inside the store whom asked me to buy him a meal. I am happy to buy people food or donate money, but usually on my terms and not when accosted in the queue. 

So, I offered to buy him a double cheeseburger, the same as I was getting and the he asked how much it is and I told him.  He then says he doesn’t eat the beef as he is a Muslim. I’m fine with this and offer some fries. He then asks for a King Fish Burger(£4.49). Now I should say I am terrible in confrontation and saying no to someone face, I accept his request and proceed to order my burger and his. So my spend has quadrupled as a result. 

So I emailed BK to complain that customers shouldn’t have to be put in that situation. I understand he plight of being homeless, I’ve been there myself. I just feel as a company they should do more to protect the customers from this interaction.

So me and my wife have a housecleaner who comes by twice a week to tidy up. We both work, me full time my wife part time, and we just figured it would be nice to not have to worry about hectic cleaning when people come over. Plus its nice to always come home to a pristine home.

The cleaner we usually use died, she was an elderly woman who we both had established trust with, but I still set up some nanny cams throughout the house just in case. You can never really know someone, and my wife has several thousand dollars worth of jewelry and I myself have several designer watches and glasses.

But even if we didnt have valuables i would want the security of a nanny cam.

With the death of our previous cleaner, we used a third party service that gave us a younger woman. She had a clean background according to said agency.

However, I didnt want to keep it a secret that we video the cleaners anymore. Even if we did catch her stealing in the act, I really wouldnt want the drama of calling the police and finding a new cleaner. I told her outright, we videotape everything while youre here. This was meant as a deterence factor. 

The girl meekly acknowledged and agreed and everything was normal. Until later, my wife told me I was rude to tell her that. That I shouldve just video taped her discretely and let the chips fall where they may if something does happen.

While outside she was followed by this man that had been a part of a group of maybe mid 30s guys that had been watching our group from the other end of the bar all night. We had witnessed this guy get punched in the face earlier for an unknown reason. He asked if he could smoke her cigarette with her, she declined and gave him his own.

My husband and I only see her once a year due to the distance and their strained relationship. She and my husband talk on the phone about once a month. Typically, she will ask him how he’s doing, how I’m doing, and then she will talk about herself for the rest of the conversation. For example, on his birthday, she asked what we were doing for his birthday and then shortly after he answered, she started talking about how she’s scared the cancer is going to come back. (My husband’s birthday is around the time of her second birthday.) My husband said he preferred not to talk about that on his birthday (this was the first time they had spoken in weeks) and tried to steer the conversation in another direction. Then she started talking about someone else she knew who has cancer. He said he had to go and he’d talk to her later.

My husband told her to turn it off as it wasn’t the time or place as we were in the middle of dinner. It was very loud and other people in the restaurant were starring.

Most of the conversations with her seem to be focused around her cancer story, someone she knows who is sick, her final wishes, etc. Like clockwork, if there’s a lull in the conversation, she will start up about something regarding her treatment.

Neither of us had been in an apartment before except the boyfriend. We agreed on a couple things moving in. One of them being that I’d like to know before I got home if there were going to be other people there and if there were groups of people coming to ask before hand. It’s a small apartment.

She just never does it. The boyfriend will let me know on occasion. I tried talking with her about it in the past and nothing has worked. We talked about family and I said that with immediate family mom/sister/dad/grandparents I don’t really care. I’d like a heads up if I’m like getting home from work and they were still there or in the early mornings. I don’t want to be caught offguard in the mornings looking like shit or if it’s been a shit day at work I know there’s someone there.

Anyways this weekend her boyfriend told me 6 hours beforehand (2pm) that her 10 and 14 year old male cousins were coming over. We’ve never had kids in the apartment before and we live in a legal state so both me and my roommate smoke marijuana on occasion which he said and I agreed needed to be put away. I started my laundry early and kept trying to enjoy my day off just minus the smoking so that my stuff would be done before they got there. 

She comes in with them 3 hours early while I’m still in pajamas on the couch with a beer looking like a hot mess. I had to ferry my clean underwear through the living room in front of two kids. I mostly just kept away from them til I left. 

I tried talking to her about it on tuesday and I got three sentences in before she started yelling. She said she could do whatever she wants and she doesn’t need to ask because it’s family. I said yes she still needed to ask I wasn’t going to say no I’m not a dick but I want to know what going on.

I said four things that I regret.

I told her that I could leave and give my room to someone else. 

I told she was selfish and disrespectful and then left.

I texted her after I left everything that I wanted to say but couldn’t because she kept yelling and in that text I angrily called her mom loud.

She insisted that was different since it was through our landlord and it was an official business but this is some random guy she doesn’t know and that “strange men” make her nervous.

936,Not the A-hole,"So for years my partner and I have discussed whose last name we would take when we get married. I don’t like his last name and he doesn’t like mine. We don’t want hyphenated last names. We want to have the same last name and we want our kids to have the same last name as us. So the only option it seemed was to straight up chose a new last name and we would both change our last names when we got married.

We recently got engaged and are planning the wedding; as such we have started trying to organise changing our last names and getting all the paperwork ready.

The other day we spoke to my partners parents about what we are going to do and wanted to make it clear that my partner isn’t changing his name because he hates them or doesn’t respect them. This ‘discussion’ went on for nearly an hour of his parents going round in circles about how it’s disrespectful.

By the end of the conversation they had said: 1. I was awful because I’m ‘forcing’ my partner to change his last name. 2. My partner shouldn’t marry me if I won’t take his last name (because apparently we live in the 1800) 3. My partner basically wouldn’t be the same person if he changes his name. 4. My partners mum said she won’t come to the wedding.

We just want to start a new family together and while I understand the selfish argument they have of ‘well it’s the family name and you have to keep it’ their argument falls through when we bring up their daughter who changed her last name when she got married.

If you’re fine with your daughter changing her last name then you should be fine with your son changing his last name in my opinion.

The thing is, even though I hadn't directly said it before, I wasn't really expecting the money back anymore and had let it go.

After that she backed off, but later when we got back home she texted me and got mad over the fact that I brought up money from such a long time ago, and that she'd gladly pay my back but I didn't have to embarrass her in front of everyone. 

Am I the asshole for bringing up a previously resolved problem in front of everyone?",57,194,0.97
942,Not the A-hole,"Please read this because I know the title is wild and seems clickbaity but idk how else to shortly describe the situation? 

Monday driving home from work on a country road just a mile from home, a dog suddenly popped out of a cornfield a few feet from the road chasing something and I hit it. I tried so hard to break, but he was just too close. I got out of my car, saw his neck was quite obviously broken and I *abso-fucking-lutely* bawled my eyes out. I sat in the road for five minutes holding him and sobbing, I felt so fucking horrible. I have three dogs at home so my heart was just aching with guilt. My car is fucked, the bumper was ripped off and had some leak and I'm dealing with an insurance claim now over it..

The dog had a collar with a number so I called it. The woman answered and started crying. She came to get the dog and brought her 3 kids.. idk why.. and they were all just bawling. I felt so fucking bad, I hugged them all, apologized, explained what happened, and told them he died instantly so there was no pain and he just went to doggy heaven peacefully. 

I had an emergency blanket in my car so I wrapped him up in it and she took the dog home. My fiancé picked me up and my car was towed away. 

Anyways, today I get a text from her (she must've had it from her call history) requesting that I pay to cremate the family dog because I'm the one who killed him. Well, not just cremation, they want a paw print memorial stone and a little vase for his ashes and it's all going to be a total of $150. 

I haven't responded to the text. Now, honestly, normally I would as I want to show I truly regret it and am sorry because I can't even imagine my dog dying. 

But for one, I know for a FACT I've seen the dog roaming around before as the dog had very unique markings and was a more rare breed.. so I assume he's let loose frequently. Two, I'm dealing with my car insurance claim and my deductible is nearly $1k so I'm about to be in big trouble financially as it is. Three, I'm a BROKE ass college student and I live literally paycheck to paycheck. And four, it was truly an accident and there was NO way to prevent it other than the dog not being there. 

I'm really in a rut here. I have so much guilt, yet I feel like even though I did do it, it wasn't really my fault...

WIBTA if I said no to paying them for this? 

TL;DR: Accidentally killed dog while driving and also badly damaged my car. Dog's family wants me to pay for cremation and optional memorial items. I am extremely broke already. I am conflicted. ",233,787,0.96
943,Not the A-hole,"I go to school that guarantees housing. However, my current roommate's inability to compromise and empathize has driven me out of my dorm that I am paying for, and instead, live with my very-understanding bf whose apartment is an hour away from school. However, the commute is nothing compared to having to live in the dorm and I've even come to enjoy it, so having to move out 6 months prematurely is not even my primary concern.

The first red flag was on move-in day when I asked about her shower schedule and she shrugged and said, ""Oh, you know, whenever I remember to."" I didn't think much of it but as this year has progressed, I have never once seen her go into the bathroom and hear water running, come out with wet hair, or wash her bed sheets. The BO is more noticeable when she's in the room so I try to go there when she's not.

She also has a habit of bringing food into the room and letting it sit for months (there's a bowl of squash that has been sitting there since winter). I bought our mini-fridge at her request and I hardly ever use it. She lets food go bad in there and when I ask her to eat it faster, she tells me she'll ""eat it at whatever pace I want."" The pinnacle of this was me throwing out her spoiled food in December as she had already left for winter break and her yelling at me over text about it.

Another side-note: she keeps an empty bottle of parmesan cheese in her bed. She tucks the thing in like it's her child and one time, I saw it on the ground and said, ""You dropped something"" and she scrambled out of bed to grab it and tucked it back in.

For anyone who thinks I should go to my RA, I don't because my RA is the most antisocial guy I've ever met. He's nice but his entire vibe tells me he wants to interact with other people as little as possible and I'd also like to interact with my roommate as little as possible which would not happen if he had us talk things out.

This morning, after a bad night's sleep, I went back to my room to see if I could nap but she was there. The godawful smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn't be in the room without feeling like I was going to vomit. I asked a friend to come over and he agreed with me, saying ""It's not even something words can describe."" Later, I texted her asking her to shower and she told me, verbatim, to ""fuck right off"".

Even though I can't stand her, I've tried keeping things civil and she basically has had a single room this whole year. But I feel like it's gone too far. My bf suggested we take the mini-fridge back to his place as we could actually use it, but she seems mentally unstable frankly, and I'm worried she would go off at me and that it's too extreme.

944,Asshole,"I work in a mainly female industry (modeling). I have a group of friends from my agency who I hang out with backstage and at shows and stuff like that. There’s one girl in my agency who I’ve known for some time, and she came out as trans about a month ago. Meaning she revealed that she was born a male but now identifies as female.

I am not friends with her, but I respect her choices. However I am a Christian, and I have my own personal views on transgenderism. 

Yesterday, my agency booked a couple of models, including me and the trans girl, for a 2-day job in another country. She put me and her in the same hotel room. There is only 1 large king bed in the room.

I immediately told my agent that I did not feel comfortable sharing a room with this girl, although we don’t have any disagreements or anything. I just would feel weird staying overnight with her. 

My agent got annoyed at me and told me to get over it. Somehow the trans girl got wind of my request to change rooms and is now angry at me. She is now telling people that I am transphobic.

Which I am not! I just feel odd sharing a hotel room/bed with a biological male, especially when I have a boyfriend. My boyfriend supported me and said I should just rent my own separate room, which I plan to do.

However now the trans girl is dragging my name through the mud. AITA for refusing to share a room with her?

EDIT: It is a room with a King bed and a sofa bed. The hotel ran out of other kinds of rooms. I dont think any of us want to sleep on the sofa bed. 

Also, I WOULD be okay with sharing a bed and room with another female model. The idea of sharing with a transwoman makes me uncomfortable if I am completely honest.  But I don’t think that would make me transphobic.",1221,668,0.81
945,Not the A-hole,"I (f16) was asked for nudes from my close friend (m18) who I think of as a brother. He brought it up as a complete joke, and since we have joke flirted with each other in the past (of course he knows it is a joke, we've discussed an actual relationship in the past and he decided he did not want it, and I was in a committed relationship at the time this was asked of me), I didn't think much of it. Suddenly, he seems a bit pushy on this joke. I tell him to drop it as he surely doesn't actually want them. To which he asks if I would be upset if he did. He said it would be pretty hot, and I declined. He asked if it would still be a no if he paid me, I told him I did not want to do anything of the sort, especially at this age. He kept badgering me about it until I eventually told him to not text me anymore about this and turned very cold towards him. He later apologized (more for my reaction than his behavior tbh) and I accepted. 

However, this encounter left a cold feeling in my gut. I was currently in my first relationship, and this ask left me to wonder if I was seen as the type of girl who would send nudes to pretty much any guy who asked. If I had somehow built up a reputation of that sort (not a bad thing but a. illegal at my age and b. I was raised very traditionally and am still following the belief of waiting until marriage). I reached out to a trusted individual about the scenario and she assured me he was just being gross. I felt better about myself. 

Fast forward a month and a few friends (the boy and girl mentioned previously included) and I are hanging out and, skipping over unimportant details, I ended up making a joke he was a pervert (as we all do to each other, this is not a rare joke), and my friend I had reached out to laughed really hard. He looked at the two of us suspiciously, and quickly leaves. I didn't suspect much of it, and I get home and check my phone, and I have a message from him. 

""Sorry I trusted you with an odd request, it wont happen again"" and then he proceeds to block me over every form of communication we share.

946,Asshole,"Don't attack me yet, just read my post reader. So this happened earlier today and I just wanted some advice. This is really my first time actually posting something Reddit, so forgive me if I have the formatting wrong (on mobile)

So this happened earlier today after I had gone on the bus to go home today (I am currently a junior in highschool) and one of my close friends (also a junior) who I have known pretty much my whole life (we will call her C for this story) sat down next to me. We gave the usual greetings and she got on her phone. A few minutes pass by and she turns to me and shows me a picture of an old friend from elementary school (our friend Z who is a senior) and this is how the interaction went:

C: “Do you remember who this is?”

I look at the photo and say, “No I don't remember”

C: “Remember Z?”

Me: “Yeah, I do, is that her?” 

C: “Yea, it is, and I'm upset about this picture”

The photo she showed me has Z in a pretty sparkeled silver dress, and her mom standing directly behind her holding her waist, wearing a very similar dress.

Me: “What makes you so angry about this photo?”

C: “She gets to take a senior photo with her mom”

Here we go

Me: “So what about it?”

C: “It's unfair how she gets to take a senior photo with her mom and I can't”

Me: “It's not unfair, and you're not the only one without a mom”

C: “Well you have a step mom, I don't” 

Now I wasn't referring to myself when I said she's not the only one without a mom, my parents divorced when I was 5 and consider my step mom as my actual mom

Me: “That's not what I was referring to when I said that. I just know that there are other people who don't have a mom, and sometimes don't even have both parents to take a senior photo with”

C just looked at me in (disbelief?) And shoved her earbuds in and hasn't talked to me since. 

Her mother died when she was only 8 years old, and I understand how hard it is for someone to lose a loved one at that young of an age, but she is 18 now. It's been 10 years since then and she still hasn't gotten over it, so I ask Reddit, Am I The Asshole?

Edit: Id like to point out that she has agreed that she should get support, and others have told her too, but she hasn't done anything about it. I know I'm gonna get called TA for this post, but it's super unhealthy to dwell on something for this long (in my opinion)",45,35,0.68
947,Not the A-hole,"So I was sitting in my car when a red car pulls up next to mine. I notice that the red car had pulled up really close to me and I’m thinking to myself “please please please don’t knock my car”.

Well what do you know she swings the door open and hits my car with her door. I just put my head in my hands as I knew it was coming. This isn’t the first time someone has bumped my car with their door I just seem to have the worst luck when it comes to flying doors.

Anyway the girl walks away and before I can get out the car she is gone and I have no idea where she went. I get out my car and check to see if there is any damage and luckily there is none. I’m surprised the girl didn’t even check herself as it was quite a loud thud. 

At this point I’m just pissed and end up leaving a note on her back wiper saying “thanks for knocking my door prick”. I then moved my car and have been feeling guilty ever since and just want to know if I took it too far after there was no damage on my car.",29,43,0.93

949,Asshole,"For some reason, my girlfriend really loves picnics. Recently, now that the weather has gotten sunny, we've started going on picnics around three times a week. I'm honestly not that big of a fan of picnics because it seems like too much of a bother to pack a hamper and lug it all the way to a park and all that. The amount of work it takes to go on a picnic has only increased because my girlfriend has started asking me to help her prepare food. I love my girlfriend, and I appreciate her. But a part of appreciating someone is letting them do what they're good at. In my girlfriend's case, this is cooking. I could talk for days about how good her sandwiches are, especially the type with crusty bread and olive oil. For the two years in which we have been dating, cooking has been strictly her domain.

The trouble started around three weeks ago, when she asked me to chop the veggies and eggs for the pasta salad. I was okay to oblige but her requests have become bigger and bigger. I was tasked with pretty much assembling whole sandwiches, frying chicken, and baking cookies. My girlfriend knows that I don't like cooking, and I thought she knew that it was her job. I've never asked her to vacuum because I know that it's my job. I eventually told my girlfriend how I felt about having to cook for her and I thought that we both had a rational and fulfilling discussion. She may have seemed a bit reluctant about cooking for picnics herself, but she did agree that we would both stick to our own jobs. Unfortunately, she lied. Yesterday, before a picnic, my girlfriend asked me to open and cube a watermelon. I reminded her of our agreement and that's when we started arguing. My girlfriend is very mild mannered, I've never heard her actually get into a temper before. I was very taken aback and a bit miffed that she would go back on our agreement and then proceed to yell at me. We ended up not going on a picnic and I ordered a pizza for the both of us. I told her that going on picnics were more trouble than they were worth, especially because we had gotten into an argument over it. It's hard to tell when my girlfriend is in a bad mood because she hides it so well, but yesterday she broke down and cried. I don't exactly feel in the wrong but it's fair to say that I feel bad about it. AITA? ",209,300,0.87

953,Not the A-hole,"I know how the title sounds. I had my daughter when I was 19 and raised her as a single father. It wasn't always easy and we had a lot of struggles, but we made it through. She's 14 now and we are extremely close. I met my girlfriend about 2 and a half years ago, and started becoming more heavily involved with her kids (12 and 15) about 6 months into our relationship as we both wanted to make sure we were solid before getting the kids involved. She's not considered mom by my daughter and her kids don't call me dad but we're still a unit and it works out very well.

I love her sons and they love me, I'd protect them with my life and getting to know them has been amazing. They might not be ""my"" kids but I care about them and do my best to give them structure and a male figure in their lives. I also keep things as fair and balanced as I can, I don't allow my daughter to get away with things at their expense, or hang out with my daughter and exclude them. The get the same amount of gifts, we hang out the same amount of time (aside from when they go out with their mom) and so on. I've had heart-to-hearts with both of them and told both I loved them, I'd do anything for them.

My partner can have a a temper at times, and one of her less than great qualities is she'll go through topics until she finds one that upsets me enough to take the bait so she has an outlet for her frustration. She's been working on it and she's in therapy, but we had an incident recently. We had a disagreement about something and combined with a long day she was ready to argue, so she started cycling topics trying to get a rise from me. I waited for her to burn herself out, but she ended up accusing me of loving her kids less than I love my own daughter.

That got a reaction because I've never told her or her children that. There's no need, it serves no purpose and despite it being true I love all three and treat them no differently. Her own family commented on how close we are. I took the bait and we got into an argument, and she just would not let it go. This went on for upwards of an hour with me trying to explain how much I do love them when I should have just disengaged. It was late, I had work and I lost my patience so I finally told her yes, my daughter is the most important person in my life and yes, I do love her in a way that is unique to everyone else. I told her I love both boys as well and would never express my love for the kids differently, but I love my daughter deeper than I love anyone else as I'm sure she does her boys.

I now hear about it every time we disagree. I feel like she's only using it now as leverage, because I know if she truly felt I didn't love the boys she wouldn't be with me. If ITA then I guess I'll have to be because I can't change how I feel, but I'd like to know if I'm the asshole because it'll change how I approach this situation with her and how I try to approach this going forward to keep the unit balanced.",25,54,0.91

955,Asshole,"I'm a 29 year old guy, and my friend, let's call her bestie, is a 30 year old girl.

We have a mutual friend who is borderline neckbeard/nice guy, has a crush on bestie, and is extremely creepy around her, to the point where he sits beside her, rubs her thigh, puts his head on her shoulder, invites her home for drinks at night etc. The thing is that she's happily engaged, which she has said many times.

Last saturday we had a housewarming party for me, and both attended. Creepy friend did like he always does, and bestie was extremely uncomfortable but was otherwise nice to him, laughed and talked. More and more as the night progressed she turned to me to get away from him, which worked.

Anyways, to the main point. Back on monday, or if it was tuesday, she posted a screenshot of him texting her about how nice it was to see her again and that she missed him. We both laughed about it, but this is where things apparently turned sour;

I wrote ""I hope you don't think of me as shitty for saying this, but I kind of think you enable his behaviour. That Creepy friend is EXTREMELY slow in getting hints, and that she needs to give him an absolute verbal asswhooping, so that he understands, and finally stops. As long as you don't make your point absolutely 110% clear that you don't like him romantically, he won't stop, because he's slow."".

I thought things were alright, as all she said was ""I thought he'd understand with my ring on my finger and all"", and I didn't hear anything more... until about half an hour ago.

She wrote that she wasn't mad, but that she was flabbergasted and disappointed that I had written that to her.

I immediately felt shame, and apologised and that I had no intention of it sounding like I blamed her, just that I wanted to fix the awkwardness between them, and giving my point of view as to how to fix it.

We quickly made up and things are good again, but it still got me thinking. AITA?

I am in no way blaming my actions on this, but it's still important to know. I have mild Aspergers, which makes it sometime that stuff I say or write sometimes doesn't get interpreted the way I intend it t, and this is what happened here. 

What I thought was helpful advice, as I want bestie to be comfortable around creepy, turned out to hurt the most important person currently in my life.

I have no problem being the asshole, as I felt ashamed, and I apologised profoundly, but at the same time I want to hear other people's perspective as to WHY I would be the asshole, WHY what I said was interpreted as a rude thing to say, and how I should think about it in the future so I don't repeat it. 

Like I told bestie, I would never ever intentionally hurt her, but that I'm struggling socially every day and I'm learning new social rules every day and that I'm willing to learn from my mistakes as I always aim to be the most kind-hearted person I can be. ",72,71,0.9

Well 2 days ago, I couldn't take the stress anymore. I know it's not about me, but it was just too much. We've known each other for barely a semester. I'm young. The relationship was fine; no huge problems, but it was second one in total. I just don't want to continue falling for someone who has a 20% chance to die in the next 5-years. I don't know if this is selfish, but the effect on my mental health was just too much. So I told her that I couldn't do this relationship anymore. It seemed to go amicable enough (she was obviously hurt), we both shed some tears, but in terms of how it ended, I wouldn't say it was the worst.

Well since, my phone has been blowing up. People are messaging me on facebook, twitter, texting, etc to say how huge of an asshole I am for leaving someone because they have cancer. I've since deactivated my social media and blocked everyone who tried to text me, but the barrage and cruelty of the messages still hurt.

Another friend brought some molly for a few of us, this was our first time trying it but we were with a couple people who had done it before. Molly makes you very happy and confident and makes you very affectionate towards people. Jacob, his girlfriend, me and 3 others all took some. We were all talking and it came up how we each lost our virginity. I told them that I was still a virgin and that I had never had a first kiss. Jacob's girlfriend offered to give me my first kiss and I said ""no I couldn't do that to Jacob"" (who was in this conversation). He said it was fine if I wanted to since it didn't mean anything, so we started making out. Jacob saw the whole thing and kind of congratulated me afterwards.

The next day I was talking to Jacob about the party and said it was funny how I kissed his girlfriend. He had clearly forgotten about it until now and got annoyed. He told me I shouldn't of kissed her and the only reason he said it was okay was because of the molly and alcohol. I said that me and his girlfriend were also on the same drugs as him so he couldn't really blame us if that was his excuse for allowing it.

The main character was called Mi Nuong, and neither of us knew how to pronounce it. Every time Emily tried to read it, she would laugh. Then she asked if she could just call her Mi instead (pronounced me). This made her laugh even more, because it sounded like she was saying things like “Me looked at..” or “Me liked...”. I just smiled back, because she I don’t think she was laughing maliciously; she just found it funny that she couldn’t pronounce it, and then because it sounded grammatically incorrect.

There’s this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  She eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that’s it.  None of us hang out with her outside of school.  Mostly because she’s very insulting, all the time.  It’s seriously like she doesn’t know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  She just says “I’m just being honest” a lot. The problem is that she can’t take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it’s about her.

Before people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. 

Not five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the ""customer is always"" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job. 

Am I the asshole here?

962,Not the A-hole,"I just found out my boyfriend of five years had an affair several years ago.  I am devastated and furious and trying to decide what I want to do.  I am pathetically in love with him, I wanted to build a life and have a family together. 

He and the other woman were good friends of several years.  Before the affair even happened they got a matching tattoo of some inside joke.  It is not very big, six or seven characters and only about two inches long.  However it is on a very visible part of his bicep and it is visible almost constantly. 

I hate that fucking tattoo.   Seeing it makes me want to throw up.  If I decide to try and make this relationship work, I want him to get rid of it.  He can laser it off or get it covered up, I don't care, but I never want to have to look st it ever again. 

I can't help but feel like I'm crazy for asking this of him.  

WIBTA?

EDIT: Thanks for all your kind words and advice.  This is still very, very fresh so I won't be making any decisions for a long while, but it's comforting to know that I'm not out of bounds asking for it gone.  I also appreciate the reminders about his body autonomy.  He can absolutely refuse to remove it and at the end of the day I can't force him to do anything, let alone something so expensive and painful.  All I can hope for is that he sees where I'm coming from and is receptive.

EDIT2:  I know that the tattoo is the least of my worries and I know that I should leave him.  I feel pathetic because I had always perceived myself as someone with strength and self-respect that would never let anyone get away with treating her badly.  I guess I was wrong!  It was easy for me to think that I would do the right thing when I was detached from the situation, but now that I'm in the thick of it I realize it is harder than I ever could have imagined.  I am trying my hardest.  I appreciate your compassion.",239,1303,0.97
963,Not the A-hole,"I am American, husband is not. We had our Legal Marriage (LM) in spring '17, and our Wedding Reception (WR) when we began living together in Fall '17.

I applied for his green card after our LM.

After the wedding it was revealed that he was completely broke, after having told me he was well off. My parents gave him over $10k during the wedding reception (traditionally how it's done) and the day after our WR he revealed he had $1,500 left out of the 10k and he had given the $1,500 to his mother who was at the wedding & did not need it. He asked to borrow 10k from me to support us until his work permit came in. 

&#x200B;

Husband insisted he didn't want me to work and we had a big fight about that. Once his work permit arrived, he got a job in another state and told me I should stay with my parents while he worked for at least 3 months so that he could pay off his debts. Debts he never told me about before. 

&#x200B;

When I finally got to the new state, we didn't talk much. He would go to work, come back, take a nap, wake up, eat dinner alone (if I made dinner, he would sometimes say, ""I feel like eating x"" and walk out without asking me if I wanted to go with him), then go back to sleep. On the weekends he spent half a day playing soccer, the other half napping it off, then would want to relax and be left alone. We barely spoke, no matter how often or how much I tried.

He got his green card in September and immediately went to visit his family back home, without me. When he came back, he was even worse. I set up a mediation with my dad and uncle, who flew to our home to speak to us. He got belligerent and said we should separate for two months.

I left 9 days later and sent him a text asking for us to set a date to meet again. He never responded to this text. My dad called his dad over the next two months to ask about when we would meet again & got a vague ""I'll talk to him and call you back"" but never heard back.

We got a family friend involved managed to talk to husband. Husband was furious and said ""How dare they act like they want to reconcile after they've talked to lawyers and my wife made me leave the house with no care about where I was staying for a whole week!""

We \*had\* talked to lawyers, because husband had completely stopped communicating with me or my family and we had no idea whether he was ever going to come back or not.

I, also, had not made him leave, he had been the one to insist on me leaving.

&#x200B;

If I send this letter, chances are high he will get deported. My moral dilemma is twofold:

&#x200B;

1. I have no idea whether he married me for a green card. It sure seems that way, but I'm not God and do not know what his intentions were.

&#x200B;

2. All I want is for his green card to be revoked because he got that through me. However, his green card being revoked is inseparable from him being deported, which seems overly mean because he came here on his own. ",294,1083,0.96

She is a nurse who has made significantly more money than I have In my career which is perfectly fine she’s literally saving people for a living. But she doesn’t seem to get how much money we are all putting into her wedding. 

Cut to the problem: I’ve spent over $1,000 on festivities and themed clothes for her wedding and just spent an extra unforseen $100 on my bridesmaids dress. I just received the rehearsal dinner invite (4/3) and the dinner is on April 25th and the attire is all white dress code.  I do not own anything white and neither does my boyfriend who is also invited. 

Sidebar: I have always worn all black almost weirdly and she has always made comments about how I need to branch out over the years. Recently I have worn different colors and for her bachelorette cruise I wore a tropical themed dress and sequin jacket that are both out of my comfort zone but on theme. 

So her asking to wear all white is not only shocking but annoying because I will have to buy something for it within 3 weeks and I’m so self conscious in it and she 100% knows it. We have joked about how I probably won’t wear white to my own wedding. So an outfit I will probably never wear again.

I come back after work tonight, and despite the mild weather she has the heating on because she's apparently cold and needs it on. She's walking around in a crop top and short shorts, so I tell her that of course she was cold given what she was wearing and that she should have put on more layers instead of putting on the heating because that's a waste of energy.  
She got mad and said I have no right to tell her what to wear.

&#x200B;

My parents are immigrants, and can barely speak the language here regardless of being in the country for 30+ years.

I was severely abused as a child (beaten to the point of hospitalization on a couple occasions). I took these beatings often times for myself and to protect my little sisters (all of us are girls). My dad is an alcoholic and my mom has joined him in drinking over the years. He's had multiple DUI's caused a lot of family issues, financial issues for us, my mom never was willing to leave him, I stuck around to protect my sister because my mom was always working. We are all adults in our mid-late 20's now, great jobs and making a decent amount of money enough to support our own lives.

My dad recently got out of jail, we used this time to get my mom back on her feet, she's working again now and seemed to be ""okay"". We've tried to put my dad in therapy, rehab, everything to waste money we didn't have and it's been a long hopeless road that we are not willing to die on.

I got a call while I was at work this morning, my dad was wasted, stole my moms car, drove himself to his probation officers office and was not able to understand what she was trying to explain to him. This is not a new thing for me as he has a serious language barrier, I pick up the call and the probation officer told me that he had denied the fact that he drank or that he drove himself there(he hasn't had a license in 10 years due to multiple DUI's) . I asked her to put the phone on speaker, and explained to him what she was trying to tell him about his therapy requirements and I hung up immediately after. He's been calling me to help him, I've been ignoring it, my mom's been calling me, which I'm sure is to leave work and go help him, but I really don't want to, I've wasted enough of my time on this BS. I'm happy, siblings are safe and happy, I'm not willing to deal with this.

The issue is that my mom is doing well, going to work properly and getting her mental health in check, if I choose not to help, my mom will fall back into drinking with him, stop going to work to drive him around to these appointments, and I'll end up with 2 alcoholic parents again.

AITA here if I continue to refuse to help?

I don't know what my options are..I'm just tired after having made soo many sacrifices for my wellness and my siblings wellness.

Backstory:

So, today my school visited Arlington national cemetery (USA) and  we volunteered to lay wreaths at the tomb of the unknown soldier, witch is a very prestigious ceremony. There are supposed to be 4 wreath bearers, but five of us volunteered. I decided to be the bigger man and let the others participate, as they all had family members either buried there and/or serving at the time, and I just wanted to honor fallen soldiers. Also, I have been in Boy Scouts for 5 years and am a full-time honor guard with professional training. 


The story: 

During the ceremony, I was annoyed that they had completely disregarded all of my tips on upright standing, when to salute, and how to walk at “attention” stature. 
I decided that I should talk to them about it after wards, and to try to soften the mood, I divided to start with a joke, so I plainly called it “sloppy,” and preceded to critique a large section of the ceremony using my knowledge of flag ceremonies and honor guard. 
Afterwards, these friends were pissed and would avoid me, and then told me that I should not critique there performance, and that just doing it alone was enough for them, and now I kinda feel like a really big asshole.

977,Everyone Sucks,"Posting from a throwaway since I most certainly broke the law, the question is am I an asshole for what I did?

I need to provide some quick background. I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. 

Warren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. 

Last night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After ""Then I got high"" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said ""oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry."" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. 

So at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. 

No fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?

Update: I started to feel bad about cutting the cord so I waitied until rhe lawyers secretary left and grabbed my old cord box and jumped the wall and into the door. I found a cord that was pretty close and plugged it in. However I’d didn’t check the polarization  and it fried the clock radio. I just left it and I’m sure stupid warren will think he fried his radio by leaving it on.",765,3898,0.98

979,Asshole,"So a little backstory: I know it’s really weird, so please don’t judge me, it’s not something I can control. But hearing and seeing people blow their nose makes me sick. Like physically vomit. I have no clue why. For reference, I can’t blow my nose since I got my tonsils out at 5 years old. 

So I was at a university lecture and the girl in front of me started blowing her nose. No big deal, usually for me I just ignore, take a drink of water and I’m fine. But she blew her nose for like 30 seconds. Then she blew it again. For another 30 seconds. My friend told me that my face was green and asked if I was ok. I said i was fine but then the girl started blowing her nose again and as I was on the verge of throwing up in the middle of a lecture in the middle of a full row with a room of 100 people so I politely tapped the girl on the shoulder and asked if she could stop blowing her nose. She did without saying anything but did it very huffy puffy like. She rolled her eyes and whispered something in her friends ear and then they both kind of did that judgey thing where they both turn around and stare at u like ‘how dare you be an asshole’

980,Not the A-hole,"My coworker, Annie, is a very nice person. However, this niceness is just on the surface- she does things that are just awful sometimes, that show her true colors. This is just one example, but I'm afraid I may have taken things too far.

Annie is about 250 pounds, I believe. She has a daughter in high school who, three months ago, weighed 115 lbs, and is 5'8"". Annie came into the office three months ago boasting about a new 'program' her daughter had started. As I listened, she divulged the full details.

Annie believed that her daughter was getting fat and lazy (the girl does track and field, and cheerleading, and ballet, and is an academic badass), so she forced the daughter to take all of her life savings (a couple thousand dollars that her daughter was going to put towards her college tuition, considering she's a senior this year) and give them to an organization. This organization will weigh her twice a week for 3 months, and she has to lose 10% of her body weight by the end of those three months. If she has, she gets her money back, minus a fee. If she hasn't, she loses all of her money. The only thing the program gives her is a diet she has to adhere to, that consists of very little nutrition, basically requiring that she starves herself.

I asked Annie if this was her daughter's idea or hers, and she proudly took the credit.

Over the last three months, Annie's daughter has come into the office, looking more and more sickly every time she comes in. The last few times, she has looked absolutely exhausted, and I was worried enough that I called CPS- they did a home visit, but it seems nothing came of it.

Annie's daughter succeeded with the diet, and now weighs less than 100 lbs. She is severely underweight, and is injuring herself, and seems sick all the time, but Annie is very happy with it. I am only a few years older than Annie's daughter, and the girl confided in me that her mother took her money that she would have gotten back from the organization, and now the girl is afraid she'll have to take out more loans than expected to afford to go to school. At this point, I was incredibly pissed off.

So the next time Annie started boasting about her daughter's weight loss at work, I asked Annie when she was going to start the program. She looked startled, so I continued, saying, ""It seems like this weight loss program really works. I'm sure you have the cash to do it, and if it can work for your daughter, surely it can work for you!"" I said nothing about her being overweight, but the implications were there. She laughed it off, and brushed it aside.

Since, she hasn't mentioned it once, nor has she spoken to me, and her daughter hasn't come back to the office. AITA for snapping and making that mean comment? I do regret it, but at the same time, I'm very angry that she would force her daughter to lose weight while making no changes in her own diet, when she's the one who needs to lose weight.

Edit: It may be prudent to mention that I am also an overweight woman, albeit only by about 20 pounds above average. I could stand to lose the weight, but as it was gained as a result of hormonal things, it's very difficult. So that may add to my frustrations here.

Edit: I wasn't sure if I should make a post as an update, so I'll just put it in an edit here. I contacted CPS again, and they thanked me for my call- I asked if they were going to follow up again, and they told me that my concerns would be taken under consideration, and ended the call. I also spoke directly to my superior at the office about my concerns, and I admitted what I had said to Annie. I am now suspended for the next two weeks without pay, given my comment, but my boss is talking with other coworkers who have expressed discomfort with Annie, and urging them to contact CPS to verify those concerns. I tried to contact the daughter's school, but the only people that I could get on the phone dismissed my concerns immediately.",253,1414,0.95

My boyfriend and I have been together 8 years this past Christmas, and have been living together for the past six. Of those six years, my boyfriend's best friend (FR) has also been living in the same house, for almost four years. We have gone on 2-3 weekend trips a year for the past four years with FR, sharing a hotel room. While its kinda awkward because its just two beds and a bathroom, we've done it to save money so we can do other entertainment things on our weekend trip.

This year, my boyfriend (i think to believe) is planning on proposing to me later in the year, towards winter I'd assume to save money. BF and i were wanting to on a trip alone just the two of us this year, and after a day of searching fun things to do on a weekend trip, i just asked if we can go to the beach for a couple days for a long weekend, just to relax together. He mentioned bringing FR to the beach since he works long hours and deserves a break, this way it would be cheaper and we can go the whole week to the beach instead of three nights. I agreed, under the circumstance that we get a hotel room with two seperate bedrooms. We found a decently priced condo on the beach, two levels. One bedroom had two queen beds and the other had one kind bed. Because we are dating and FR doesnt date anyone, naturally we took the king bedroom (also its the master bedroom and has beach views and its on the second level loft of the condo and I'M SO EXCITED, as a side note).

I told FR we found a condo, he'd have his own balconly overlooking the bay, his own bathroom and his own bedroom. He seemed annoyed that there were two beds.I should also mention that whenever we DO share a hotel room with FR, he snores. Not little snores, but its extremely loud to the point where BF and i cant get sleep.

Our two friends are also getting married in august. BF, FR, and i were invited...wedding is five hours away on a saturday, so I figured we can drive down together on friday and leave on sunday so we dont have to worry about rushing the day of

I mentioned to BF that the hotel that is blocked off has cheaper rates, so we can get our own room so FR has his own. I told FR that yes, it would be more expensive than just sharing a room with us, but this way he has his own bathroom and i can do my makeup and hair. He seemed ok with it, but still sligthtly annoyed that i didnt want to get a hotel room with him. At a romantic rustic cabin hotel. On the night of the wedding...while with my boyfriend of 8 years and while we include him on everything else, even if we are going out to supper as a date night andi see FR is alone at home, i'll see if he wants to go).

FR seemed kinda salty that we were getting our own hotel room, but also I do want sleep the night before and night of the wedding.

982,Not the A-hole,"So girlfriend split up with me a few days ago (I'm 26, she's 25). We will buy out the lease at the end of April but I went to my brothers for the time being until I find a new place. I'm still helping split April's rent and all the furniture and items in the apartment is mine or my families (couch, bed, table, TV, etc). She's definitely free to see other people, that's obvious, but I told her not to bring other guys back to this place because technically it was still my apartment as well and everything in there is mine. I'll more than likely be taking all this furniture come end of April. She accused me of calling her a slut right then and there because I said don't bring guys back but I laughed it off and told her I didn't mean it like that.

Well on Tuesday morning, I had to swing by to snag my roller hockey skates. I walked in and there she was, cuddled up with a guy on our couch only 4 days after breaking up. I wasn't mad, just hurt. I told the guy to leave and then took a few hours of PTO from work and moved basically all the crap I could out of the apartment (my 55 inch TV, speakers, computer, all my clothes, etc). I still left her my 42 inch TV and my firestick to watch Netflix and crap, along with all the furniture for the time being. She kept telling me she won't bring any other guys back and it isn't what I thought it was.

Well, now a few days later, heard from a mutual friend that she has a date with a new guy and she mentioned to my mutual friend that she's bringing the guy back to our place tonight for date #2, Netflix and chill. She told my friend that she doesn't know if they'll have sex yet but she wants too. (I have absolutely no idea why she would tell this to my mutual friend either because it's a girl I've known dating back to pre-k school). So my mutual friend, who was on my side in the beginning, told me this.

Now, sure, it hurts that she is seeing other people only a week after breaking up but she's a free agent. But would I be the asshole for going and moving everything out of that apartment? The thought of her taking it on the bed I will be using for the foreseeable future, in an apartment I'm paying half the rent for, and them using my 42 inch TV and firestick to Netflix it up, is kind of making me sick. 

So what gives. Tell me how it is so I can gain some perspective because I still love this girl and wanted to help her out this month instead of leaving her high and dry. The fact that I love her is obviously blinding my judgment a bit and probably making me a bit resentful to this. But at the same time, I don't want to be walked all over and disrespected.

Girlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.

Last night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption ""Miss you, do you miss this?"". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.

&#x200B;

I then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's ""seen"" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys!

As many of you have noticed by now, automod has been deployed in the war against retired acronyms. Allow us to explain.

Back when we introduced acronyms, we included SHP (Shitpost). We quickly realized this was a bad idea and retired the tag, asking people to instead report these posts. Despite that, and despite the fact the tag has been retired longer than it was ever in use, a great deal of you still use it. We have tried several different things to address this. The original META, FAQs that are posted in every single post here, discussing it with many of you in thread, countless modmail questions about it - all to no real avail. After months of trial and error, we have employed the nuclear approach.

Why? Well, at best, it's ineffective. There have been countless times when someone (presumably the OP feeling insulted) have reported comments that say ""SHP"" ***but none of the multiple people who fired off that comment bothered to report it.*** You hate a post enough to comment, but not enough to have it removed. Not to mention, you're giving true intentional shitposters exactly the attention they're aiming for and rewarding it. At worst, you have an OP who posted a true story in good faith that's not a good fit for this sub, but nevertheless not deserving of any harassment or dismissiveness. A flood of ""SHP"" comments feels like exactly that. Many of these people are going through a really tough time. This is not an advice or support sub, but it's also not /r/RoastMe. ***We expect you to conduct yourself with a basic degree of respect.*** We know it's annoying for many of you. The continued use of the phrase has been annoying and even hurtful for many others. In a sub based around playing moral philosopher and determining the most morally defensible position, we feel this is that position. 

So, report bad-fit posts. We hope that we can turn this off down the road to reduce the white noise, but that's not going to happen without your participation and a noticeable steep drop off in use of this tag.

986,Not the A-hole,"I like guns, and I have a near obsession with history. Going to the shooting range is a hobby of mine and I go ever so often to shoot the more ""historical"" guns that I have. 

Due to my obsession with history, I too obsess over the history of my guns. One of these guns is a Mosin Nagant, the first ""historical"" gun I purchased. This Russian gun was made in Tula sometime during WWII according to the insignia on it. Jokingly, I put a ""[This Machine Kills Fascists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_machine_kills_fascists)"" sticker on the stock because considering the context and history of the rifle (and the quote) it may or may not have partaken in such an action. I'd usually be against stuff like this on an antique, but its just a sticker that can be peeled off easily and I have another (completely unmodified) Mosin from the same era and the same factory. Also, Mosins are a dime a dozen (relatively speaking, compared to other guns). 

The other day my friends and I went to the shooting range and I brought it along. While we were there, someone came up to us and said the sticker is insensitive/offensive and trashy. I basically told him that the rifle indeed may have killed fascists a long time ago but now its just shoots paper and not people, in the same vein as many other historical firearms (especially from WWII). He told me that's true but the sticker almost implies that I'd use it to kill other people, and it's no different from putting ""This machine kills (Any other ideology/group/etc)."" I felt this was a really shitty comparison and told him that the phrase isn't some modern invention but goes back to WWII just like the rifle (it was actually coined by the same dude that wrote ""My Land is Your Land""). 

We agreed to disagree, and by that time we had already been packing up so we left. My friends sided with me on the whole discussion, but I can't help feel that maybe it *is* kinda trashy. I never meant the sticker to refer to the modern political climate, and in my head it's always referred to the actual Nazis/fascists in WWII just like the quote originally does. AITA?

990,No A-holes here,"So this will be the second time this month this occasion will have happened. A few weeks back, we celebrated another similar occasion but for the other side of the family (a side of the family, mind you, that they don't even care for). So it already felt particularly pointless because coming from my own family, if we don't get along, we don't try and act like we do, so we wouldn't have even gone. But alas, I trucked with them and spent my entire Sunday over an hour away just sitting there making small talk with people that hardly know me, or even want to for that matter.

This Sunday, we're doing the same thing for the other side of the family. What's more frustrating is that I just got done working a nearly 60 hour week and my weekends have become almost sacred to me. I won't get home until 7-8 on most nights, so I've had very little time to myself. 

While this side of the family likes each other and we're more conversational, they tend to spend the entire day with one another, often not leaving until well after sundown. I don't mind showing up and being conversational for a few hours, but they're the type to just exist in the same room together and it's expected that you be there, too, regardless of how much is going on. They'll be playing a card game together (that only 4 can play), while others will be talking about some gossip that I have absolutely no hand it, while some others will be lamenting about family drama. 

I understand that I'm marrying into this family, but their social practices go well past my patience or even involvement for that matter, because I don't feel involved. I don't know or care to gossip about their family. I can only catch up with what they've been doing for so long, and playing card games only entertains for a few rounds. I hardly want to spend that much time consecutively with *anyone,* let alone extended family of my fiancee. 

It's a classic case of the in-laws I suppose, but in the context of the previous work week, I told my fiancee I would go and participate, but would not be staying as long as everyone else, and would be leaving when I felt comfortable.

So anyway, she remarried and is getting a divorce. They had some problems, so it's not a surprise, but that's not really the point.

She has a decent paying job for our area, but she continues to make poor financial decisions. She bought a newer car, admittedly for a good price, but at a time she couldn't really afford it. So, you see the pattern. Anyway, she asked my husband for $1k for rent, and I told him I'm not comfortable with that. I think he's just enabling her, like he did during their marriage. She's gotten money from him before and it's always ""the last time"". She came to him before she went to her own family or even talked to the friend she's renting from.

She spent all of it in less than a year. She took the offer because she was bouncing around between multiple sexual partners during the divorce and was very unstable (alcohol, possible drug use) in front of the kids.

993,Not the A-hole,"## 

Off the top, It's important to note that I hate what bachelor & bachelorette parties are all about.

The idea of screwing around on your partner before your marry them turns my stomach.

I chose not to have a bachelor party before I got married as I saw no need to get drunk and get lap dances after having been in a monogamous relationship for seven years.

2 years after I got married my sister was engaged and asked my wife to be a bridesmaid. Leading up to her wedding, my sister rented a cottage her weekend bachelorette party. While having reservations, I made no attempt to stop my wife from going. The only thing I said to her was to have no physical contact and no dicks near her face (I knew a male stripper was being arranged).

When the girls returned my wife seemed as if something was bothering her. She eventually came clean and told me that she had gotten drunk (her inhibitions are obliterated when this happens) and made out with some random guy at a bar. Now I know for some people this may not be a big deal, but it crushed me. It is - to this day - one of the most challenging emotional traumas I have ever experienced.

This was very out of character for her. She was as as much in disbelief as I was and to say she felt horrible was a understatement.

After an initial fight, I didn't speak to her for 3 days. We eventually talked and slowly worked things out. But for weeks, the image in my mind of my drunk wife making out with some random guy really tore me up.

In exchange for my forgiveness, I asked her that she never again attend another bachelorette party, especially one that involved alcohol (yes, I realize how unlikely this is) or anything overnight. I did, however, make one exception...

My wife's sister was the maid of honor at our wedding, and now, she is engaged. Naturally, I expect my wife will be her maid of honor and consequently involved with everything that title entails. Currently, my sister-in-law is living with her fiancé in Ireland and there has been talk about having a bachelorette party somewhere in Europe.

I couldn't in good conscience tell my wife that she can't attend a local night out with her sister for her bachelorette party. But a week-long trip overseas is simply out of the question in my mind.

We now have 3 children (5, 2 and 4 months) and I would need to time time off work just so she could attend this trip. I could easily kibosh on the whole thing on this alone, but I'm looking for opinions from a moral standpoint.

We are in the process of trying to buy a new house and simply cannot justify the expense of a needless trip to Europe right now.

After my sister's bachelorette, my wife said she would never again drink to excess without me. But the sting of that weekend has subsided for both of us and I simply don't trust that she won't succumb to peer pressure during a week-long trip abroad.

What say you Reddit community?

&#x200B;

Edit:

&#x200B;

Thanks for all the responses. I just want to clarify a few things:

&#x200B;

1. I should have probably named the title 'AITA for wanting to ASK her not to attend' as I am not controlling and would never tell her that she can't do something.
2. She hasn't actually come to me and said she wants to go. I just know this trip is in the works and I'm just preparing myself for that conversation. She may even agree that it's out of the question for the same reasons I have.
3. The wedding itself will not be in Europe so any costs associated with that in particular are not relevant.
4. In hindsight, the comment about her succumbing to peer pressure might have been a bit harsh. She's not a loose cannon. We have an amazing marriage and that weekend was really the only time she hasn't been perfect.
5. Yes, we have three young kids (one of them a baby) but the trip wouldn't be until next year. Yes, the baby will still be a baby but not a 4 month old.
6. Her sister is NTA, I think she would be fine with her not going considering our young children.
7. I know all bachelor/bachelorette parties are not free-for-all sex parties. But things can happen.

994,Not the A-hole,"TL; DR at bottom.

A friend of mine started a fund campaign to raise money for her dog's surgery in January. It was legit, not a scam. Apparently there was a terribly painful injury to the dog that was getting worse and they wanted to raise $2,000 for the surgery ASAP because their pet insurance didn't cover all of it. There weren't a ton of details about what the injury was or what the surgery was for exactly, but whatever, I gave a little bit.

Here's the AITA part: I found out through a third party that the dog didn't end up making it to surgery and had to be put down. No surgery took place; it was determined the surgery would not make a difference and they opted for euthanasia. AITA for thinking they should give the money back they raised? I didn't say anything and **I'm not going to bug a grieving family over 25 bucks**, but I just found it tacky they just kept the money meant for something specific that didn't happen.

998,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! 

Long time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit! I'm currently in a bit of a pickle and seeking opinions.

To preface this, I am an insomniac and so it takes me a while to fall asleep. That initial moment of falling asleep is so crucial for me because if it gets interrupted, I end up staying up longer and there goes my productivity the following day. I should also mention, I share a room with my 3 sisters. 

The sister who this post is about, has a boyfriend who she's been with for a few months. They talk every day and every night. It's gotten to the point where they fall asleep on the phone together and if the call drops, he rings her back. You would think common sense would prevail and he would assume she is sleeping, but no. He rings and rings and rings.

Normally I just suck it up since I'm already awake and there's no way of me going back to sleep. But last night was the final straw for me. It was 1 am, I could feel myself drifting off to sleep, and he fucking called her!! She eventually picked up and was whisper-speaking to him. 

I've had it with the ringing. I want to approach her and ask that they enforce some boundaries for e.g. No calls past 9pm. WIBTA for asking her to create some boundaries when it comes to phone calls?

1002,Not the A-hole,"First of all, I’d admit that thanks to having an autoimmune that went undiagnosed for 27 years, I know I can be paranoid about catching diseases because I’ve always gotten the worst case scenarios health-wise. 

My parents recently became very mistrustful of medical information after they discovered the anti-vaxx movement. I caught rubella & mumps even after I got the MMR vaccine (compromised immune systems ftw!), so I seem to confirm their conspiracy theories. They don’t seem to believe I have an autoimmune either, so explaining that doesn’t work. 

Anyway, they just went on a big family trip to New Zealand, where they just had a measles outbreak. My mom is still there, while my dad just returned yesterday and we met up for dinner. I asked him which cities he traveled to because I only found out about the measles outbreak a few hours earlier when I mentioned to my friend I was having dinner with my dad, and she told me to be careful since I’m due to give birth in 7 days (high risk pregnancy so I know the exact date since they have to induce labour). 

When I asked my dad, he admitted they toured around the South island too, where the measles outbreak is. I asked him which cities specifically and he couldn’t remember. I asked him to check and he got annoyed and snapped, “Nowadays, they have medication if you get sick! It’s no big deal!”

I told him newborns can die from measles, but he just ignored me. 

My dad’s answer is making me even more paranoid and right now, I’m considering banning every family member who visited New Zealand from meeting me for 14 days after they’ve returned. That means they won’t be allowed to see the baby for at least a week after she’s born. 

Would that be an asshole move? She'll be my parents' first granddaughter, the first great-granddaughter from my dad's side and the first great-grandchild from my mom's side, so everyone wants to be there at her birth. 

____

**EDIT:** The family members in my generation are definitely vaccinated, but I'm not sure about my parents' or grandparents' generation. My parents grew up poor in Indonesia in the 60s, so it's highly unlikely they were vaccinated. One of my aunts also has an autoimmune (my parents blame it on her not following the traditional Chinese confinement rules after childbirth), so she may not have the immunity even if she's vaccinated.

She's actually taking it really seriously and I got a string of panicked text messages when I woke up. I'm asking her which cities they went to but my messages aren't going through yet. I'm not sure if she took the first flight out after I told her.

_____

**UPDATE:** My aunt who also has an autoimmune did fly  to Singapore (where her docs are) ASAP just in case, since they did travel to Christchurch and apparently one of the travellers who spread measles in Australia flew from Melbourne  to Christchurch. She’s familiar with the medical bad luck that comes with an autoimmune so she’s getting tested to see if she’s immunised against measles. Don’t think she can convince my dad or anyone else from the older generation though. 

To that racist dude who’s saying that I’m probably living in a diseased country that’s riskier than New Zealand, I’m living in Singapore and there’s been no cases of measles here since there’s mandatory vaccinations. ",264,1334,0.96

I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.

Sounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.

I order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it.

1006,Not the A-hole," I have only just made this account so I could post this but I've been a lurker for a while. 

So... this is a very complicated situation but I'm at a loss and been told I am both the asshole and not the asshole for doing this. 

Back story here; I currently have full custody of both my little sisters (ages 17 (we'll call her Amy) and 8 (Liza) while I am 29 and male) I fought extremely hard for months to get my sisters in my care too as I come from a long line of entitled people (the kindest way I can put it), I have multiple uncles/grandparents who felt they were entitled to... Amy's body and Liza's too once she was 10... 

I'd moved out of home 7 years ago and I was honestly really slack in keeping contact with my family as I moved far away for school and work. I came back to visit just under 6 years later and situation I came home to find my parents were allowing Amy to be physically abused (to put out a sliver of it out there, they would use her allergies to torture her into compliance) so I do what in necessary and get Amy and Liza put in my custody (if you want the whole story I might put it in Entitled parents but that part isn't what this sub is for)

Now, for the title of my post. A few weeks ago, my mum contacts me though facebook, asking to meet me and only me for a talk. I oblige and met with my mum. She explained she was divorcing my father and cutting ties with his family (the side of my family who was allowing this to happen.) She explains that after she got pregnant with me she felt forced to marry my father, how she never wanted that life for my sisters and how she wanted to mend her relationship with Amy who still has an array of issues from her treatment and I gave her a flat out no, she would never see Amy or Liza again and if she tried, I would get a restraining order as everything I've heard from Amy showed that my mum never even felt concerned for her health or wellbeing during the time I was away. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to keep her out of my sisters life?

Edit: Thank you for the platinum!  

Edit 2: This is coming up a lot but Amy is still in regular therapy and delicate when it comes to that time. It's still a daily thing she experiences. Liza was never hurt, she was being groomed into obedience but things would have changed when she turned 10, as they did for Amy. Liza was in therapy for a few months but it was decided she didn't need it long term like Amy.

1007,Asshole,"Upfront, my boyfriend has an awesome penis. Its not huge or anything, about seven inches (we measured) and fairly girthy- but it is really, really- even comically small when its flaccid (like 2 inches). In the privacy our relationship, I playfully make fun of it all the time and he doesn't mind because he knows that he pleases me in bed. However, he has complained in the past about how much he hates ""locker room moments"" when other dudes see it and assume he is hung like a grape even though he is not. 

So the other night we were having dinner with friends and played a game where we pull word cues out of a hat. One of the cues was something like, ""things that are short"" and I write down, ""my boyfriend's penis"". They were all read aloud and when its revealed that I wrote that particular answer the room explodes in laughter. My boyfriend tries to brush it off ""oh you got me! Ha ha"" and laughs with everyone else, then one of my boyfriend's male friends (who he goes to the gym with) slaps him on the back and tells him ""oh we've all seen it, we still love you, bro!"" more laughter.

After we get back to his place, my boyfriend tells me that it bothers him that his friends think of him as the small guy because all they had seen is his flaccid penis in the locker room. He said that they've made fun of him in the past and he has had to brush it off for years because he feels that denying it would make a bigger deal out of it than it is and has to silently take it. He said that by making that joke, all I have done was reinforce the perception and that it will just fuel the teasing. He wasn't mad, just disappointed.

1008,Not the A-hole,"I (21M) recently tried something different with my hair. I usually quiff it, but tried growing it out and seeing how it would like. It turns out my hair becomes very curly once it gets to a certain length.

I'm no model or anything, so I'm not claiming that, but I get WAY more attention from girls now, or at least, they approach me more? I've had a few girls approach me in nightclub settings/parties saying ''Wow I love your hair'' and then we escalate from there.

But I've also had some girls who just touch my hair without permission. This ONLY happens in nightclub/party settings, but it happened ONCE during daylight hours. 

Anyway, I was at a party recently socializing and having a good time and I went to pour myself another drink, and out of nowhere I feel someone touch my hair. I turn around and I see a girl smiling, so I just calmly look her in the eye and say ''Get the fuck off me, and do NOT do that again''. I looked very stern when I said that and she looked really scared now (also if it makes any difference, she was about 5''4 while I am 6''2 so I'm a bit bigger than her). 

One of my friends said this was a major asshole thing to say someone AITA?",40,26,0.88
1009,Not the A-hole,"
A little bit of context: 

I was living with my grandmother when my friend (25M) offers me (19M) a room so I can get away from my abusive family. I take it and agree to pay for half the rent and food, plus gas for rides back and forth to work. 

Eventually his finances became a bit unstable so I agreed to pay for all the rent and he pay for the food, which results in me paying more towards things than him and I don’t mind a bit. 

Eventually he’s become very controlling about finances. I can’t get anything that isn’t a basic necessity without him berating me about it, saying I have a shopping addiction or feel high of buying things. 
Keep in mind this is after paying for my due share or all of the rent and food or all of the food. To clarify when I say “all” I mean the amount needed for both of us. 

Last two weeks he’s been the worst due to his car breaking down and him needing to get a new car, if he were to fix his current one it would cost him more than if he were to buy a new one. I agree to help pay for his car and also pay for the rent and food so he can save a bit to get the car. 

All of a sudden he then wanted to know all of my financial transactions and bills and why I have them or why I do them and pre approve them thru him.

If anyone’s wondering why I didn’t just move out on my own, I had recently arrived from another country where I had lived with my parents who were extremely abusive and was just a bit confused on everything. 

Anyways, the AITA question.

I bought a measuring tape for my waist, which cost 1.99 online. After tax it was a bit over that but I don’t think that’s the big issue. 

I get the package and as I bring it in he asks what it is, I proceed to tell him how I got it and how much it cost. He then flips out over it, but doesn’t say much due to his Uber arriving for work. 

Later he rants at me thru text messages, telling me how irresponsible I am. How he can’t trust me, that we should split the bills evenly. I tell him that I didn’t think a 1.99 USD purchase is worth mentioning or even a big deal, it’s not like we were broke and our paychecks will come in a few days and I can help him get his car. I tell him sure we can split the bills and he can start paying his part. 

 Then goes on to say how his life sucks, how everyone is against him. How’s he’s just human clay for everyone? Talks about how everyone doesn’t give him a break, says I don’t care about him. Then says that, that has made him very angry, wanting to end it and how depressed he is. Also says he feels like he’s taking advantage of. 

After talking a bit he’s agreed to pay half of everything and wrote up a contract and so on. Currently in here feels very tense. 

AITA for this, I’m trying to think if there’s any way I could be, outsider opinions really welcomed...

I’d do a tl;dr but I feel it would miss too many details.

It was awful and she wasn't doing very well even though I reassured her everyday that she wasn't pregnant because I was absolutely sure there was no way it could have happened. It was just a late period. She refused to take a pregnancy test which could have solved things a lot earlier but I digress. Today her period finally came and everything is fine and she was so happy. She asked me what I would've done if she was pregnant and I said I didn't know. She kept pressing me and I just kept telling her I don't know because I truly don't. She asked if I would break up with her in a kind of joking manner and I assured her that would absolutely not happen but I don't know what beyond that. She even said ""then think of something quick"" and that kind of put me off so I reiterated that I truly don't know what I would do. We're 20 years old. I really truly have absolutely no idea what I would do if she ended up pregnant. For some reason this really pissed her off and she's been upset for the last hour. From my point of view, I feel like there was absolutely no reason to delve into such a serious hypothetical and that we should've just been happy and thankful for the weight being lifted off our shoulders. Am I the asshole here?

We all had to sign a form for her to move in which one of us did not since he did not want her moving here. The people who run the place let her move in anyways, however she does not inform them that she has a dog (having a pet requires an extra monthly fee).

Anyways I find out recently that her dog is left in a cage for 10 hours a day almost every day while she is at work. After some research I learn that her type of dog requires lots of time to run around and things to do otherwise it can develop destructive habits and psychological issues. On top of this I have also noticed that he has no sunlight in the room, and his water dish had no water (so I gave it some).

So this morning she sends me a text belittling me since the sink was full of dishes (I and my friend who lives here are the only ones who have ever done it and she has not done it once). Eventually I say ok, I will do it, but you need to give your dog something to do all day. I told her she should get a walker or something, and also offered to take it out during the day myself. She basically told me it was her dog and that she knew what was best for it and that I should mind my own business.

We end up informing the main office about her dog and how we were not comfortable with how she was treating it. They said that she was in violation of her lease by not telling them she had a dog and that she will be relocated. I know she’s tight on money and she may not be able to afford the fine that’s coming to her, but this may mean that she has to send her dog back to her parents or something and it won’t be suffering any more.

My coworkers have been inviting me fairly regularly to hang out with them outside of work. I'm very grateful to be asked, but I'm not particularly interested. We get along well at work and they're a good group of people, but I don't want to hang out with colleagues outside the job.

He seemed a bit taken aback but accepted my answer.

I told my partner later that night and she said I was being a jerk, and that I should give hanging out with them a chance. I honestly just..don't want to. It's not that I think I'm better than them or anything they did wrong, I'm just not into it. I don't really need work friendships to be happy, I have solid friends right now and don't really need anymore nor do I have the time to invest in building those relationships, I'm happier just keeping to myself.

1015,Not the A-hole,"I’m a female college student with two other female roommates, one of whom was away on a trip and the other asleep. 

I woke up to pee and had trouble falling back asleep at around 2:00AM I went into the kitchen for a snack. I saw a man looking in my window. 

Not, like, looking in from the street—totally pressed up against the window. I didn’t turn the light on so as not to wake up my roommate, so was waiting to realize it was just a coat hanger or odd reflection. But then we made eye contact and he said “Let me in.” It was one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced. I went full panic mode. I was unsure if the window was even locked or if there were other men with him who might be trying other windows or the back door. 

I screamed as loud as I could and ran back into my room, locked myself in the closet, called 911, and texted my roommate to stay locked in, in case the scream woke her up. 

Police came and they said they found the guy and he had a friend in a nearby unit that was expecting him and was supposed to leave the door unlocked and he got confused because the doors look similar.

Classmates have been calling me “Break in Barbie” because I assumed he was trying to break in. I did not even get a good look at him because it was dark, I couldn’t describe him at all to police, but I would’ve called no matter what color he was because I was so scared. 

People I barely know are asking “Why couldn’t you have just asked him what he wanted before calling 911?” “Why didn’t you just talk to him like a human being?” “Why didn’t you wait a few minutes to see if he went away?” And accusing me of being racist and also saying things like “If it were a white man you wouldn’t have called the police I bet.” “Do you call 911 every time you see a black person?” And asking things like “Did you really think knocking on your window was reason enough to try and kill this guy? Because calling 911 on a black man is basically putting a gun in his mouth.” And the most common one “How did you know he didn’t need help and was trying to find a Good Samaritan?” 

To try and see things from the other side — I do know people of color, especially black people, are in danger interacting with the police in a way their white counterparts are not. He didn’t brandish a weapon, he didn’t threaten to harm me, and he wasn’t inside my house. I can see how going right to calling the police could be an overreaction in hindsight. 

The name calling and aggressive accusations hurt and are affecting my life socially. I’m hoping it’ll blow over. Even close friends who I’ve vented about this to have said “Yah but what you’re experiencing is nothing compared to what black people go through every day.” I recognize that unquestioningly and never drew that comparison, ever. But if people are interpreting it as such then I could see how to them I’d be a giant asshole and more. 

So I guess AITA for calling 911, but also, AITA for being upset over the backlash?

Her culture is a little behind the times, equality-of-sexes wise, and it is traditional here for men to pay for everything for a girlfriend/wife- to the point where the guy hands over their full paycheck to the GF/wife in some cases and just gets a daily stipend from them.

&#x200B;

I understand why this works in some cases, but for our situation it doesn't seem to make any sense to me. She makes way more than I do, and has a lot of money in the bank. Whereas I still struggle to support myself, getting out from under student loans and monthly expenses, even though I've been progressively making more at my job.

&#x200B;

But she still wants me to pay for everything, single-handedly, in our relationship. 100% rent, 100% food, 100% for the cat's stuff, 100% travel expenses, 100% everything else. Meanwhile, she will just continue to save her money 'for a rainy day' or to buy a house under her name only.

It seems really one sided, and I've gone for some things- like paying full rent and food. But I refuse to budge on other things. AITA since I'm living in her culture (though eventually we plan to move to the U.S.), or is this taking advantage of me?

Some time into our first few months dating, before we were living together, we went together to the grocery store to get some food for my place. As we're checking out she saw some flip flops and mentioned needing a pair, so I told her to toss it in with the stuff I was buying. I hadn't been in a relationship with anyone from this culture before, so just kind of assumed it was understood she'd pay for it later.

Next morning, I ask her for the $10 or whatever it was and she gets upset, and we have the worst fight to this point. She says I'm not generous and I should take care of this for her without even thinking about it. I tell her that (at that point) $10 is an important amount of money to me since I'm living on a shoestring budget in a foreign country. But I tell her if it's a serious problem, forget the paying me back.

We finally calm down and she insists to pay the $10, but she still brings it up as an example of my lack of generosity/support. Hopefully that gives a better image.",39,33,0.9

1020,Not the A-hole,"My husband has a 4 yo whom I’ve been the adoptive mother to for over 3 years and we plan on having children once we work out our differences.

To cut it short, he says that I am “too controlling”, whereas I think he is “too flexible” (he gets sensitive when I call it “irresponsible”); as we are raising his child together, we have come across a lot of conflicts on how he should be raised. We have tried both ways and had conflicts. I have discussed and attempted to make compromises with him, but he gets upset and only wants it 100% his way. 

The main issues:

- I believe that most toddlers function better with a set schedule, as they will know what to expect as the day progresses and will less likely act out. He, on the other hand, thinks that with a schedule, especially one made by me, makes for the days to be nothing like he wants.

- We have the most issues when it comes to his child’s eating. Since his kid has a small appetite, I try to get his daily calories/nutrients in 5 small meals (3 meals, 2 snacks) a day, and he eats relatively well with me. I encourage him to eat by conversing with him and teaching him new things as he eats. My SO, on the other hand, feels that if his child is hungry then he will ask for food, and if he doesn’t want to eat then it is okay; no encouragement necessary, and no need for “making up for it” throughout the day. This has made him underweight before. I would be okay if the skipping was not so frequent or if it were because of a family excursion, but otherwise it is not ideal.

- Since I try to feed his child frequently, he poos around 3 times a day. This would tire my husband out as he would have to wash him sometimes, and this is one of the reasons why he wanted his child to eat less. As much as I understand that it can be tiring, I don’t think it is justifiable to make your child eat only a few bites every meal or skip meals because of that.

- My SO works from home while I work as a dentist with a 9-5 schedule, and it gets tiring when I have to make up for the things his child has missed while having to also cook and do chores. This wouldn’t be an issue for me if his child was raised with a proper schedule, but because it is improvised when he’s with my husband, it gets stressful for me (and because he sees that I am stressed, he would say that if I had just went with his plan, I wouldn’t be stressed and everything will “eventually align”). 

- When his child didn’t want to eat vegetables, I would encourage him while having a bit of fun trying out a variety of vegetables together. My husband didn’t like the idea of that, and instead wanted to do it in a way where if we just gave his child only vegetables for a meal, he would eventually get too hungry and will then eat it. I did not think that this would resolve his child’s attitude towards vegetables, as he is only eating them out of desperation and not out of being open to them. 

Edit: To those who said that I am the asshole for referring to the little one as “his child” for much of this post, the reason why I say “his child” a lot in this post is because I am unsure if it would cause a stir if I referred to him as “our child”, since many people have strong opinions about stepmothers. I have been shamed quite a few times in real life for calling him my son, and although I still do, it stings when people tell me that I can’t call him my son if I didn’t give birth to him and that I will never replace his biological mother.

While she got over her anorexia however I started eating more and more, I wouldn't say it's an eating disorder more unhealthy eating habits. Anyways what prompted me to do something was that I learned that I'm technically obese now (!!!! I used to be so fit wtf happened) so I signed up for a gym and restricted my diet... to literally nothing.

About a decade ago I screwed around with a married woman who was still active with her husband.  She got pregnant but didn't want to find out (and sincerely) didn't care who the father was/is.  I broke contact because she played games and manipulated my emotions.

I had health issues in the past she was aware of, blood clots.  Was tested for a genetic disorder my father was diagnosed with and his father likely had.  Test was negative.

Fast forward several years.  I had a series of micro strokes that caused a pretty big stroke event.  Retested for the blood disorder and I have it.  I debated get in touch with her to give a heads up but absolutely do not want the drama and insanity she tends to carry with her back into my life.

WIBTA if I didn't attempt to contact her and let her know I do have it and if her son is mine he potentially has it too?


Edit:  The disorder in question is not necessarily life threatening in and of itself.  The reason the first test was negative is because there are two tests.  One more in depth and almost never checked that deeply until the person actually has a stroke.  This is only possibly going to affect him later in life (as in 30s/40s or older). 
It is called Factor V leiden.


Edit 2:  To be perfectly clear.  She 100 % already knew about the fact that I have a family history that includes the blood disorder.  I even explained to her precisely what it is because I am aware of carrier genes especially when it comes to mutations (which Factor V is in medical terms).

I'm obviously happy for them and hope they achieve everything they want together, but recently I got caught in a dilemma. During a dinner I was invited to, big sis told me that she wants to start a family, and asked me to donate sperm so they could get pregnant (I'm just gonna emphasise here, the sperm would be going into my sister in-law, NOT my sister). To her this was the best idea, since this way their baby would have both their genes, just a roundabout way of ensuring that they're both biologically related to the kid. She went on about how this'll be perfect and how she'd be so grateful if I helped her, I think in her mind, I of course would say yes.. but I'm really, uncomfortable with the whole idea. I thought about it intensely overnight, and I hate it. 

It's not that I don't want her to have kids or think she shouldn't. She'd be a great mom, but, I also have a huge desire to have kids one day. I really wanna be a dad, and the thought of being the father of a child that is being raised by another couple, while I'm just left with the status of uncle.. really hurts. If I'm gonna father a child, I wanna be 100% involved in the kids life, I wanna experience fatherhood, in all its ups and downs, that's my dream. I know it sounds silly and also counters the whole gay thing, trust me I had huge issues with accepting my sexuality because of that, but that's how I feel. And I know I could donate sperm now and still have children of my own later on, I'd probably say yes to her request if I already had a kid, but I don't. I might never have the chance to be a dad in my life, since adoption is a strict, lengthly and expensive process, and surrogacy isn't legal in my country (but ivf for lesbian couples is). Its probably a bunch of stupid reaaons, but to me, never having children hurts less than having a child that I won't be a dad to. 

So, I said no to her, and it pretty much blew up in my face. She's calling me selfish and unreasonable. I explained how I feel but she's accusing me of being jealous of her, of internalised homophobia, and pretty much denying her a family. She's really upset with me and I hate making her cry like that. I'm sure she didn't mean a lot of what she said, but I guess the parts about me being selfish and unreasonable are kinda true, since, I have an infinite supply of sperm and can still have kids and she only needs a sample. Maybe I am just being an unreasonable dick for rejecting her in her time of need and after all she's done for me. Logically I think I should put my feelings aside..

1032,Not the A-hole,"My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.

I didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. 

I did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.

As far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close. I would think it was weird if one of my step siblings asked me to be a bridesmaid, or if my mom walked one of them down the aisle. AITA?",22,33,0.92

In junior year, I met a guy who I would later find out to be autistic, the very first thing he says is “do you know where your sister was last night?” I respond with no, and he says “with me in bed”. My sister was, at the time, 13. And I was pretty protective, so I was prepared to deck him in the face. He also sexually harassed one of my close friends and a bunch of other girls, and he tried to fight just about everyone in the locker room (he was banned from it over this) eventually he had to be monitored by the school cop, which he hated. He jumped from the top of the bleachers once just to escape. I found out he was almost arrested for beating a small kid into a brick wall. I found out in my senior year he was expelled and arrested for trying to kill his mom and sister.

I understand that no one asks to be born, and no one ever asks to be mentally disabled, but the things he’s done can’t be over looked. I was never a good person, but I never did anything close to what he did. I’m graduating this May, and my sis will be in high school in September. I’m worried he’s gonna come back and target her. If he does, I’m gonna raise hell.

We’ve been binging House M.D. and of course there’s a pregnancy complication episode where a dad is asked to choose between the baby and the mother (the mother was going to die either way it was just a little quicker). My wife said that she’d want me to choose the baby if it came to that. I told her there was no fucking way I would do that, we could have another baby but I could never have another her. She got all mad and questioned my commitment to being a father and I said I’m committed to being a father but I’m more committed to being a husband. This argument went on forever.  I told her that if she was brain dead or was going to die either way I would choose the baby but otherwise it’s her She said basically said what she wants over and over and I said I’m not spending another 50 or years without her. This is all because I love her more than anything else in the world. We’re still in disagreement over this completely hypothetical situation.

1038,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago, I caught my sister’s husband in bed with another girl, both naked. It was during a Christmas party at our mutual friend’s house. My sister was spending the holiday with my parents. Due to our works, my brother-in-law and I would only join them on New Year’s Eve.

I confronted him about it and he told me he had no idea what had really happened that night since he was so drunk. He also told me that the girl I had caught him in bed with had been obsessed with him since high school and ‘will do anything to win his heart’. But he has never had feelings for her let alone slept with her. He loves my sister and their son so much. He believes, based on this obsession, she had slipped something in his drinks. At least that’s what he told me. I couldn't tell if he was lying or telling the truth.

I told him that whatever might have happened that night, he still gotta tell my sister because that’s what a married couple should do. And I believed my sister will be able to tell if he’s telling the truth or not. He promised he would when the time is right.

The following weeks, I found out he had not told my sister about it though. So I decided to do what I thought was the right thing to do. My sister flew off the handle when I told her and proceeded to file for a divorce. I encouraged her to sit down and talk about it with him. What if it was not his fault? What if the girl had indeed drugged him so she could force herself on him? But my sister told me that it was not the first time that he had cheated on her. He had once been involved with a sex worker during the 2nd year of their marriage.

He called me afterwards and confronted me and blamed me for ruining his marriage. He also told me that he had indeed cheated on her years ago but she forgave him. This time though, it was not something he had wanted to happen, but she refused to believe him now. To make me feel even worse, I recently found out that the girl he was caught in bed with, is indeed mentally unstable and obsessive and has had history of drug abuse. But no matter what I say to my sister, she will not change her mind. Now I think I believe my brother in law that he did not cheat on my sister the second time with that girl. Am I The Asshole here?

&#x200B;

UPDATE :

Thank You everyone for the feedback. We went to the police to file a report of drugging and sexual assault today. The reason why BIL did not tell my sister about it was because he was very much disconcerted as to how to handle the situation better. He knew he was innocent but due to his past cheating on my sister, he was afraid that she wasn't going to believe him. He wanted to confront the girl first but after that night, it was as if she had disappeared or something. 

Not to mention the humiliation since men being victim of rape is not something that everyone hears about very often, at least not in our city. And he was worried nobody's gonna believe him and mock him instead. 

Some of BIL's friends will testify against the girl in court because they're aware of her terrorizing him since college. I sat down with BIL after we returned from the police today and he told me what had really happened that night. He had no idea the girl was going to be at the party, she was invited to join by another mutual friend of ours. He was going to leave after he saw her, but she told him that she was going to move to Europe for a job and would like to set things right between them. He had not seen her for years and he wanted to believe that she had changed. I was outside all night since we were not allowed to smoke inside so I really did not see what was happening leading up to finding them in bed together. The friend who had invited her will also testify in court because she was there when the girl approached him.

I talked with my sister on the phone and she did not want to hear any more of her husband. She is deeply hurt and only cares for her son's well-being for now.",71,167,0.93
1039,Not the A-hole,"So we kinda got into an argument the other day about the whole pro life and pro choice. She told me that I'm the asshole because I'm trying to dictate who gets to live and who gets to die. Saying that I'm a horrible person because I want people to kill babies. She even knows about my life and where I come from as a foster child that was never adopted from birth to the day I became eighteen. 

I've been homeless and lived in the streets for months before because the foster system was so broken. I would be shipped from houses to houses only to get hit and abused by foster parents. In hindsight I could've easily told on them, but when they're threatening your life you don't really think about it. Anywho, in my point of view I tried explaining that going through life, especially at the teenage years (I'm 28 now) , I was not able to find any stability and heck, multiple times I thought about alternative solutions.

I explained that if a parent was unfit to raise a child I would much rather not let that child grow up in a toxic environment. My view was molded by my real life experience and I wouldn't wish a child a life like my own, growing up knowing that they're unwanted by anyone. I told her that if a child isn't adopted, they're thrown into the foster system. Call me insensitive or whatever you want but I just want every child growing up in a loving environment. 

I told her, ""I respect your decision and agree with you that I do not have the rights to decided on who gets to live and who gets to die. You are right that nobody has that right to take away life from anyone, however, I also have a strong view in upraising our future generations of leaders and want them to grow up in an environment to thrive and become successful in. I'll draw it here and say that I'll agree to disagree."" I didn't want to fight anymore with her on this topic, but then she starts flailing other topics at me saying, ""You're just defending the girls that goes out and sleeps with multiple men. You're enabling their lifestyle and it makes me sick. You're the worst kind of people out there. You're making the excuse of raising children to cover up for those types of girls."" 

However much I tried to defend myself from what she was trying to pin against me she would talk over me and not let me explain my point. At this point my temper wasn't at it's greatest either and so I calmly but shakily said, ""That's fine if you think I'm that kind of person."" I left the apartment and have been ghosting her for about a week now. I didn't think this fight would last this long. I'm crashing at a friends place in the meantime. 

So, AITA for trying to explain to my GF why I'm pro choice? Am I just conceited or just oblivious to my some kind of thing that I'm missing? I'm not trying to paint myself as some angel and her as some demon, I have my hard views on things as well, but I just want to know if I'm approaching this at a wrong way.

She gets tired really easily, has joint pains and gets fevers and headaches a lot.

She only recently became part of my friend group when she started dating my best friend, she is great and everyone really likes her. Whenever we do anything with her she isn't expected to pay, either her boyfriend pays or the rest of us just split the cost. I don't really agree with it since she has a job and lives rent/utilities free, but I go along with it since it's usually just like splitting her meal between 4 or 5 of us or something. We are planning a trip around Europe for 5 of us, including this girl. Her boyfriend wants us to split the cost for her to come, including flights, accomodation, food, etc. I don't see why we have to pay for her. She must have plenty money to spend since she lives with her parents and I don't think she really needs us to pay. I haven't spoken to anyone about this and am worried I am being an asshole because of her condition.

She has also told me that I am free to read it after it's done in case I want to object to how I'm portrayed.

The thing is that I really don't want to read it. I'm not ashamed of how things ended, and I don't feel like there's embarrassing dirty laundry that she might air.... I just can't really imagine myself sitting down and going through her accounting of that era for a few hundred pages. 

As I figure it, the publishing market is so competitive that there's almost no way her book will be published anyway (and that's not a knock on her, because she's an excellent writer). However, in the off chance that the book gets published, I will have passed on an opportunity to have some say in it before it sees the light of day.

Now i am a frequent member of r/childfree. I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.

So suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.
——————————————————————

My brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, 

It is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.

Now they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.

So him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.

When i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.

1055,Not the A-hole,"I work at Walgreens and we have a corporate policy that if two younger adults want to buy cigarettes, we have to I.D. both of them.  These two girls come in and I recognize one of them from my school.  I ask her how's she's doing and we chat for a bit.

She comes up to the counter and says that she wants to buy some cigarettes with the other girl standing right next to her.  They both look about eighteen.  I ask to see both of their I.D.s in accordance to our policy.  She says that the cigarettes are just for her and that her little sister isn't going to use them.  Since I knew her, I told her that I wasn't really supposed to sell them to her but I'll make an exception this one time.  I told her to ""leave her sister in the car"" next time because I don't want to get in trouble and most other employees wouldn't sell it to her.  

She seemed irritated with the situation but finished paying and told me to have a good night.  I had completely forgot about the interaction until about an hour later, when she walks in with her dad.  Her dad makes a beeline towards me and starts yelling at me.  He tells me to call up my boss.  My boss doesn't work most nights so I called up my shift lead.  He starts to yell at her about me.  He tells her that whoever is paying for the cigarettes is the one who gets carded and that I should be fired.  

I'm pretty upset at this point so I tell him that it's corporate policy and if they don't like it, they can buy their cigarettes somewhere else.  He tells me to keep my mouth shut and that he's the customer.  He then says that ""I had the audacity to tell his daughter to wait in the car.""  I tried to interject but the shift lead cut me off.  The man said I shouldn't treat woman that way.  I felt like saying that I would've said the same thing whether it was a boy or girl but I kept my mouth shut.

He finally left and my shift lead told me just to ignore him.  She wasn't upset with me and even let me go to the break room to calm down for a sec.  In my mind, the only thing I did wrong was violate the policy to help a girl that I knew.  I think I could've maybe worded it differently when I told the sister to stay in the car but when I was saying it, I was trying to be helpful.

1057,Not the A-hole,"So my sister and I both have the same condition where our uterus scars really easily and so it’s harder for us to fall pregnant (it’s kind of hard to explain, but that’s basically it) but I went on medication a lot earlier than her so my uterus is a lot less scarred than hers. She’s been told that she will not be able to have kids and not being able to have ivf etc. bc there would be nowhere on her uterus lining to place the egg. She’s obviously devastated and has told me before that surrogacy is her last chance and I’d be the only person she would ask. So she asked me to be a surrogate and so we went to a doctors appointment just to see if I qualify and see what the procedure would be like. The doctor told me that since I have the same condition, but less scarring being a surrogate would lessen MY chances of being able to fall pregnant or have ivf etc. I’m not ready to have kids yet but I know I want kids and am not really willing to lower my chances of being able to fall pregnant when ive already seen the struggle my sister has been through. The doctor said if I do go through with it then they will obviously place the egg on the best place in my uterus. This may sound extremely selfish but I want that ‘best spot’ for me and my future husbands child and am not quite ready to give it up yet. If I was done having children or knew I never wanted children it would be a completely different story I would say yes. But I’m choosing to be selfish and keep my chances of falling pregnant without risking it and my sister is calling me an asshole for this reason. So AITA ?

Edit: I told her my reasons for not wanting to do it about a day after the doctors appointment (I basically said I want to be selfish and I’m so sorry but I want to keep my higher chances of falling pregnant for my future family) and she called me an asshole for being so selfish about it and that the less assholish thing to do would be just tell her no plain and simple rather than say I want a family and being ur surrogate would ruin it.

1058,Not the A-hole,"I have an eclectic set of hobbies and monetize them to support myself when applicable. One of my hobbies is party/event/wedding planning. Mostly done by word-of-mouth and it's people who know people, rarely close friends at this point. I have a structure to the agreement process, including a contract that outlines my objectives, responsibilities and most importantly, my compensation.
One day a colleague at my day-job was asking me about prices for wedding planners as she was recently engaged. She asked about prices for anon planners and then added that she would feel more comfortable with someone who knew her personally. She then proceeded to ask me if I would plan her wedding. She is a very last minute person and likes making choices but not coming up with options. She outlined a price and I agreed since we were friends. 
This was my first mistake. I was lazy about getting the contract to her since I knew she was fine with it; after all, she set the price. No sticker-shock possible. 
I started setting up meetings with different professionals; baker, photographer, dj, etc. Even going to the venues and helping her ask practical questions and such. 
At about 1 month in I got the contract to her and she said she would need to review it. Fine. 
About a week later she lets me know that her mother thinks the price is ridiculous and that a planner is pointless. 
The bride being in her early 30s apparently not making her own decisions yet agreed with her mother and decided that she didn’t want my help.
I was angry to say the least. Before I could inform each of the professionals that I would no longer be handling the wedding my wife had contacted most of them. Professionals each asked if I wanted them to back out, I told them not to as there was no reason they should lose out on a payday. Most telling me that they were no longer giving her my contract price but returning them to standard pricing.
I avoid all conversation about the wedding with the colleague and if she tries to bring it up I change the subject or dismiss myself.
Where the Asshole comes in is that the wedding is less than 2 months out now, and the Baker asked me if the wedding was still on. I told her it was and then the Baker informed me that the bride had not submitted the order for the cakes/cupcakes yet and that she's nearing a point where it's too close to the wedding to place a large order.
I wondered if the bride had gone a different direction but today she brought up the Baker and the wedding cake and was mentioning the dessert but clearly did not have a clue she is nearing the deadline.
AITA for not telling her nothing has been ordered and that she's probably not going to have a wedding cake at her reception?

TL;DR She hasn't ordered her wedding cake yet and is almost too late to do so and I know this, she does not.

Edit: per urging I simply asked if she ordered it yet.
Nope and she's claiming she's overwhelmed. Made me happy

Edit2: We are currently 19 days out from the wedding. She has not ordered her cake, she thinks it's ""fine"" because all she needs to do is confirm what she wants. Not correct. 
Also for fun, the Barm Venue which was doing its debut event with her wedding is nowhere near completion. As in: the whole second floor has not been completed, there is no outside deck wrapping the facility, there are no bathrooms installed. She bought into the dream of a dreamer and both are falling to pieces.

Edit 3: Two weeks out. They're trying to find another venue. She is under the impression she can have the cake, though has yet to order it. The Baker has booked another event. I am excited.

Final edit: The wedding was today. They changed everything to a different barn about 10 miles away from the first. Maybe 65 people showed up of the ""Over 300 that are coming."" They had red plastic cups for keg drinks, that ran out almost immediately asking people to ""please keep using your same cup."" All normal alcohol was gone within 75 minutes of the reception starting; leaving only hard liquor. The  only pre-dinner snacks was 1 small tub of pretzels. It was 3 hours of ""mingling"" before they started serving dinner. And there were about 100 store bought cupcakes. For as much as could have crashed and burned--it was just a poorly managed wedding: not up in flames. No lesson learned.
Also the mother of the bride approached a small group of us (the bride's colleagues) and asked our names, said ""oh I've heard of you"" after I said who I was. Yes, I'm the one you shafted out of pay.",288,756,0.97
1059,No A-holes here,"Husband [32M] and I [30M] are a same sex couple, children have always been on the planning and we have both agreed early on that if we decided to have children we'd choose to adopt, more specifically adopt a slightly older kid.

My husband's sister (Emma, fake name) and her boyfriend are very problematic and will be losing custody to their 7 year old son. The reasons why are too personal to get into and not relevant now. 

To avoid their son going in care and being separated from his family there have been a lot of discussions going on about who will be suitable to be the boy's legal guardian. His side of the family nominated us and my husband thinks it's a wonderful, beautiful idea. The boy is lovely but a handful and that's an understatement. He has autism and it is suspected that he has ADHD too. 

* Our marriage is not the most stable currently. 

* We work long hours, especially my husband works a very stressful job, fitting a child into that will be difficult and unfair. * The boy's school is very far away. 
* I suffer from depression and take medications for that and right now I don't feel I have the motivation or ability to take care of another person, let alone myself. 

I also feel the child deserves someone far more equipped and with more parental knowledge. I don't deal well with stress. 

The other alternative is his other sister Lauren who has a psychology background, however she lives far away too and in a one bedroom shared flat.

I don't think my husband and I are suitable to take on this role for the reasons above and I have said to him.  He flat out asked me if it's because of the autism, I confirmed that and he said I'm an ""heartless asshole"". I disagree but what like different opinions on this.

Since she wouldn’t be getting a check until the 15th and had been dipping into her savings to cover other living expenses I said that she should not pay her half of the rent on the first of the month (the day she started her job) and instead just pay me back at the end of our current lease (about a year away).

Now that that time has come, I feel weird asking her to pay me that half a month’s rent from a year ago.

1065,No A-holes here,"Let me start this by saying I love my wife whatsoever and other than this, we have no issues whatsoever.

My wife frequently gets home later than I do, simply because I start work before she does. However over the past year there have been many times where she won't come home until well past dinner time, and usually won't let me know that she'll be late until well after I would expect her to come home.

I started asking her several months ago to tell me in the morning what time I could expect her home, and that if she would be late then all she has to do is let me know at some point during the day that she would be late. This hasn't worked out very well, though. She is pretty bad at estimating when she will be able to leave work - often times she will text me saying that she will be able to leave in 15 minutes, but then not leave for another hour. Sometimes it's because she is working on a project that has to be completed that day, but oftentimes it's because a co-worker or student comes to her office to talk to her (about work related things).

She has responded to this by instead not giving me an estimate for when she'll be home, since she's so bad at doing so (even she admits this). But I would much prefer that she just ... give me an estimate, and stick to it. She has told me that it seems controlling of me to do this, but honestly I just want to be able to plan my day and not knowing when she will be home makes it very difficult to do so - and my argument is that she is not respecting my time. On top of this, we will often be late for engagements because of this behavior.

&#x200B;

A month ago my unlicensed (DUI) boyfriend insisted he go to the store to buy me bottle of wine to celebrate our 9 months of dating. I initially rejected the idea and he pressed it in an attempt to do a good deed, I eventually gave in. About 40 minutes later I get a frantic call from him, he had been in a car accident. When I got to the scene the car was a wreck, it was confirmed by both the police and the other driver involved that my boyfriend was NOT at fault.

Well I got my insurance payout and I still owe $1200 on my loan. My boyfriend bought himself a car that I can ""use"" until he gets his license and I can't afford to get a new car and still need to pay off my loan. My boyfriend also offered to pay my loan and then I can pay him back. Problem is I feel like he should pay off my loan or buy me a new car since he put my in this shitty situation but he feels like since he wasn't at fault and I had a shitty car that he did me a favor.

Should I ask my boyfriend to financially contribute?

Edit:

He did receive a hefty fine ($350) and may have delayed the process on getting his license back which he was eligible to get when he wrecked, just never got around to it.

1068,Asshole,"Our 2 year relationship was great, but recently we drifted apart and realised we wanted different things. Neither of us can afford to move out at the moment so we decided to just be respectful and try to get through the next month or so as easily as possible. 

At first it was weird, we would still go out to eat together, sleep in the same bed, etc. It was as if nothing had changed other than our relationship status. It almost seemed that the distance that had grown between us over the last few months was no longer there. I was reinvesting myself to the idea that this might still be salvageable. We talked about it and she thought this too. 

So we got back together. 

Now, months later, it's happening again for the 3rd time and I recognize the pattern. It's not healthy for either of us to keep dragging ourselves emotionally through the mud like this, so I've told her this time I'd like to go no contact. I'll sleep on the couch, make my own meals, lead a single life essentially. I made this decision several days ago and since then she has been crying nonstop. She's asked for hugs the first couple of days and I only shake my head and walk away. Now she just cries harder everytime we're in the same room.

1069,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her’s.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  

Pretty much since my son was born I’ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I’ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I’m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I’ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

My girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we’ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn’t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

We are a great team usually.  It’s almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She’s fighting dirty too, she’s been making it out as if I don’t really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That’s not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn’t even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she’d never admit it. 

I honestly don’t even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there’s just a big “NO” feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. 

I also feel like it’s really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don’t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money.

1070,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months and we are about to graduate from college. A month or so ago, he mentioned that his parents want to take their family a European cruise after graduation, and would like me to join them (along with his sister’s long term boyfriend). He said that “they really want to spend some time with me” (because I haven’t seen them since the summer, unlike my parents, who have taken us out to dinner every time they visit). 

However, when he had first brought this up, I had just returned from my spring break cruise with my friends. This was my parents’ “graduation present” to me. We aren’t struggling by any means, but we don’t have too much money just lying around for unexpected trips, especially after I just took one. On the other hand, my boyfriend’s family is very well-off, and a $3000 estimated trip cost would not set them back at all, which it would us. 

When I started crunching the numbers and bringing it up to my parents, I just knew that we didn’t have the numbers to make it work. When I told my boyfriend that, he was really disappointed, since he really wanted me to come. The whole thing has been very embarrassing and tough for me since he still kept talking about the things he wanted to do on the trip with me, and of course I really wanted to go. 

I feel awkward because they invited me along knowing that I had just taken a nice trip and I don’t have the resources that his family has. He’s made no mention of thinking to try to help me out, and my friends have said that I’m not alone in thinking that that’s not a crazy thing to expect. He keeps saying how it won’t be the same without me, and sometimes I just want to come out and say that it doesn’t have to be that way!! He has stopped talking about it, but I just can’t shake this feeling like I’m disappointing him, but maybe that’s just on me.

1071,Not the A-hole,"As per most reddit posts, this one has years of backstory but I'll do my damndest to keep under the character limit. My parents are both 35, I'm 18 (female, graduating with honors from HS in a little over a month). They obviously had me as teenagers, decided to stay together to very mixed results over the years. My dad decided he wasn't letting being a young parent ruin his aspirations so he struggled with full time work and getting all the way to his phd and his been a professor of anthropology for about 5 years now. My mom has been a very mixed bag and at times has been the most amazing mom on the planet, other times she gets morbidly obese, miserable, angry and hates the world (me included). She was especially nasty to my dad during these time periods. 

Last year about this time, my dad met and started hooking up with a grad student about 10 years younger than he is. This coincided with my mom being admitted to a mental institution for severe depression among other things (the affair didn't cause this, my dad just ""took advantage"" of her being away). When my mom got out, her meds were ok and she went into a pretty long period where she seemed like she was going to be ok. My dad broke it off with the grad student and tried to stay committed to my mom (I wasn't aware of any of this while it was going on, my dad told me everything about right after the divorce was announced). I guess my mom snooped on his phone, found the girls Instagram page (doesn't help that she's an actual IG model as well as a super smart grad student) and shit absolutely hit the fan. Nasty, nasty divorce has ensued ever since. 

I know my dad fucked up, my dad knows he fucked up and he has essentially offered everything possible to my mom to get her to just sign the papers. My mom is of course really messed up and she seems to want to just torture my dad. For example she begged him to come over and talk to her to try to ""work it out"" then she had the sheriffs deputies waiting for him because she claimed he threated to kill her. She videoed my dad in handcuffs (though he wasn't arrested) and sent it to my dad's department head. That was the worst but the list of minor ways she's harassed and tried to ruin my dad could go on for pages. 


My dad has explicitly told me to be respectful to my mom and to try to go easy on her. My mom on the other hand has demanded that I take her side and has given me handwritten nasty letters I'm supposed to deliver to him, she'll tell me ""tell your father that he ruined all three of our lives when you see him"" and stuff like that. 

With that, it's so easy to see why my dad cheated and why he's so eager to be done with her even if it costs him everything he's ever worked for. I can't help but take his side.

Enter Pam.

&#x200B;

She's a 50 year old woman who is very technological illiterate. Since the installation of these new policies Pam has been a pain to deal with. For the past 3 months on an almost daily basis we have gotten tickets from her for the most mundane of things. The point of the remote viewing software is so that when stuff comes up we can deal with it remotely but Pam refuses to cooperate with us. She demands that someone (most of the time me) come and deal with it directly. This takes up to an hour of my day as I have to deal with her and her constant ""problems"".

&#x200B;

These problems consist of her not being able to watch netflix because it's blocked under the new rules or things like she does not want to have to enter her employee id in when connecting to the printer. This isn't even the worst part. Every time Pam calls one of us down, it always ends with her insisting that we're doing our jobs ""wrong"" and we need to change what ever is bothering her.

&#x200B;

Over the past week though, my boss noticed the amount of tickets coming from her department and the amount of time spent down there. I explained to them the issue without naming anyone. She told me that she needs us doing our jobs and not wasting time down there so they will most likely change the policy so we only answer tickets that are ""important"". From what is sounded like, she mean only things that need to dealt with NOW.

&#x200B;

On Monday it was all but confirmed that this change will go into effect. Well, that same day I had to go help Pam again after she sent in 3 tickets claiming she couldn't work due to an issue. This issue was she wanted me to unblock facebook. I already was already having kind of a bad day so me telling her no broke down into a small argument in which she told me that I was incompetent and that the policies ""I"" put in place were stupid. I proceeded to walk out with out saying a word and made an announcement to her department.

&#x200B;

I told them of the policy change being put into effect. That if they had problems we would not be able to deal with them immediately anymore due to ""the blatant abuse"" by some employees. Most of these people people are older and need help from time to time from us so this did not go over well and most knew it was Pam's fault.

1073,Asshole,"I get that he loves me. I get that I *chose* to adopt him. But I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I can't move 2 feet without him wanting to be right there next to me - and it's starting to drive me out of my mind. 

So I point to his kennel, and he goes and lays down and pouts (heavy sigh, staring at me with those sad eyes). 

Honestly, it's either this or I give him up - which I think neither of us wants. 

So tell me - am I the asshole?


Notes:

Dog goes to the dog park daily, and is walked at least twice a day besides that.

We have cuddle time daily.

Me: 47yo

Dog: 4yo lapdog 

We live alone together in an 800 sq ft condo. 

His kennel - kept open except at night when he sleeps with it closed to prevent him marking territory. And then he goes out first thing in the morning. 


--------------------------------------------
EDIT for more information:

1) The dog isn't going anywhere. My comment above ""it's either this or I give him up - which I think neither of us wants"" was meant to illustrate that **at the time of my post** I couldn't see any more than those 2 options. And since neither of us wants him to be given up - I felt stuck. 

2) Someone mentioned the window to look out of - well, I had covered it a while back because his kennel is right up against it, and I didn't want him getting cold during the recent snowstorm.  So it's uncovered now.

3) I see that because a lot of experienced dog owners are cool with having their dogs follow them around **CONSTANTLY**, maybe part of my problem is that I'm not experienced enough - yet. So hopefully over time I'll just get used to this. 

4) If anything, people telling me to give up my dog has taught me an important lesson - don't ask for public criticism if you aren't prepared to hear from a bunch of angry psychopaths. So you all can keep telling me to give him up, but it aint happening. Frustrated or not, we're going to work this thing out together.

That's all for now. Thank you to those people who can empathize with my need for a little space. And thank you to those who called me TA, and told me to give up my dog. Without you there wouldn't have been a debate. ",162,119,0.82

1075,Not the A-hole,"So, I guess I'll start off with background information. I am 21, and transmasculine, or female to male if that term works for you. I have known since I was 15, though was unable to act on it until I moved several hours away, about three years ago. A couple months after I moved, I started medically transitioning, but had some mental health issues, so I stopped for about a year, and have since been medically transitioning again for a year. Now, I've been fully socially transitioned in my life for almost a year at this point, which is pretty easy with my family so far away. I'm what we have termed ""stealth"". I'm seen fully as male, and nobody knows I'm trans other than my closest friends who have been around me for over a year. It's a very small part of me I like to keep to myself. 

My parents, well, I don't have a great relationship with them. I really do love my mom, she raised me on her own after she seperated from my alcoholic father. She gave me as much as she could when I was younger. But she can be a bit... Narcissistic. She has those tendencies. She takes everything positive, and turns it negative. But she does genuinely love me, and since I live so far away now, our relationship is better, since she cannot control my life as much as she used to.

And she does deserve to know these things about her child. But I'm so terrified of her reaction. Even after all these changes, and meeting several trans people, she still doesn't see it. She still talks about how weird trans people are. My stepdad has said some questionably homophobic things to me as well, assuming I'm a lesbian. They're not great with this, and I genuinely don't know if this would get better with me helping them forward. It feels like I'm coming close to having to seperate myself even more from them, especially after I tell them. 

To the point of the question: there's a fairly large chance I could get top surgery within a year. This is something that is very important to me, and my physical health. I've been wearing what's called a binder, and they are... Somewhat dangerous. They're basically a compression top that goes over your chest. I've been wearing it for 6 years at this point, 7 days a week, for about 8 to 16 hours a day, and it's caught up to me. Back issues, serious shoulder pain. I can't exercise with it on, as that's dangerous, but at the same time, I can't leave the house without it on, for obvious reasons and my own personal mental health. 

I personally think I would absolutely be the asshole, but I don't know if that's my mom talking inside of me. My friends have told me I should just go and do it without telling my family, and I don't know if that's right. I didn't want to post this on a trans forum, because I'd be getting trans related experiences. I already know their answers. I can absolutely give more information if this is not enough. I just am seeking an outside opinion on the matte
r.

Edit: The concencus seems to be that I am NTA. I am a legal adult, and I can make my own decisions, though it could absolutely ruin my relationship with them. Thanks for your responses everyone

Edit 2: I also would like to explicitly state that I do bind safely. The only incorrect thing I do is bind for too long some times (most times really). My nurses are aware of this, and even if anything was seriously starting to hurt, I would stop, wear a looser binder (one size up), and for short periods and allow it to heal. I am not an idiot. I am not suicidal. I am not purposely bringing pain to my body. There's going to be back pain involved in binding for 6 years straight, even if you bind for less than 8 hours a day, but it is as safe as it can be. I take breaks when it's too much, make sure I can breathe, and get plenty of exercise that doesn't require wearing no binder (aka walking). Most of my week is me sitting over a computer doing school work, so wearing it for longer periods of time is generally alright, as long as there's no physical aspect. A user in the comments is claiming this is self harm, and I'd like to clear any air of that. My shoulder issue is from another injury, and my back troubles specifically from when I work 20 hours over three days, which would happen anyway. Self harm is a serious, dangerous issue. I speak to a counselor bi weekly and see a nurse weekly. If I was a danger to myself, they would know. ",59,79,0.85

1080,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, but I lurk here. I posted about this in r/justnomil, but I wanted to post here to get some different opinions.

I’m (30F) getting married to my fiancé (30M) in the fall. We’re both very independent people and are paying for this wedding on our own. I already have my dress, and we have the venue, colors, and other major details planned out. 

My mother passed away a few years ago. My dad recently got remarried and my new stepmom has personally reached out to me to offer her help and will be helping with certain tasks. My other family members have also volunteered to do things.

We are not close to my fiancé’s side of the family. We rarely talk to his mother and don’t spend much time with her because she’s a very difficult person to be around.

My fiancé saw his mom earlier this week and she had a full on crying fit about the wedding. She’s hurt because she thought she would be going dress shopping with me and would do mother of the bride (MOB) stuff because my mom isn't around. She is threatening to not go because she feels so left out. 

She hasn’t reached out to me to ask me any questions about planning at all. We also don’t talk. Also, traditionally, mothers of the groom (MOG) don’t do much. I don’t know why she expected to take on a central role in wedding planning when she isn’t a big part of either of our lives and she has made no effort to contact me.

She’s saying I should be the one the reach out to her and make her feel welcomed. I disagree. I don’t think the couple getting married should need to reach out to people, and that people that want to help should (and have) made that known. She also seems fixed on MOB tasks and doesn't seem interested in doing MOG stuff.

We’ve also decided that we can’t trust her any important tasks if she’s already threatening to not come. But I still feel bad that she’s apparently gutted over this.

So, AI/AWTA for not involving my fiancé’s mom in wedding planning?",33,30,0.84
1081,Not the A-hole,"I (29F) and my boyfriend (32M) have been together for almost three years. When we met, I had a travel credit card that I did a lot of research for and get pretty good rewards. I try to put everything I can on this card and I always pay it off at the end of the month. I'm careful about keeping track of spending and I have never paid any interest on it and it was the only credit card I used regularly. 

I tried to get my boyfriend to get a rewards credit card, but he is not interested. He's not the greatest about paying things off on-time/in-full and is ok with paying interest occasionally (which defeats the purpose of a rewards card). No judgement here, it's just not for him.

As a result, I usually pay for everything, to get as many points as possible, and then I send him Venmo (payment app) requests every few weeks. We usually split everything 50/50.

Recently, there was a great promotion for an airline credit card for an airline that I use a lot. And it came at a perfect time because we were planning a big move and would easily meet the spending requirements for the rewards - 40,000 airline points and a companion pass where he can fly with me for free each time I fly! - I travel a bit more than him for work. So I opened the card and paid for everything just like I usually would. We met the spending requirement pretty easily and got the companion pass (he is, of course, my companion for the year). Well yesterday he said that he should get half of the airline points too. I'm a little torn about this one. I feel like this is my reward for staying on top of everything with my card (paying for everything upfront, keeping track of spending, keeping track of and requesting money from my boyfriend, etc.). I asked if he thought he should get half of my cash back on the original card that I have, and he said yes.

He says things like ""it's free money!"" But I don't feel the same. I work for those rewards and am very diligent about spending and paying things off. It's also a pain sometimes to request the money from him and remind him when he isn't on top of sending the money over to me. If he were to get a credit card with points, I would be happy to split purchases with him so he could get rewards too, but it isn't worth the hassle to him.

1086,Asshole,"Back story, we are moving house on Friday, this happened tonight. 

As our lawns have been going insane we decided I should go straight home to mow, rake and whipper snipper for the handover. The wife will pick up the three kids (2, 5, 9) after she finished work so I can do the needful. Neither of us cbf cooking. 

Kids end up with pasta bake and the wife suggest Thai. She explains that we can buy two mains and eat them for lunch the next day (as we wouldn't eat a whole one each).

The wife always gets fish cakes and I wasn't feeling like it so asked if we could have chicken satay skewers instead , entree

Wife makes the order, we all head down the road and I pick it up.

Take away order:

- Chicken satay skewers (x4) (mine)
- Fish cakes (x4) (wife's)
- Yellow chicken curry. (wife's)
- Red duck curry with lychees. (mine)
- Large coconut rice. (wife's)

(I'm keto/paleo so I don't eat rice)

I didn't really care what the restaurant lady was telling me I just wanted my food now as I was insatiable.

Get in the car and didn't realise the wife had ordered fish cakes so asked if that was right. Wife tells me she doesn't like chicken skewers, that she will eat them but doesn't like them so she got fish cakes. 

Walk in the door, give the kids their pasta bake and the wife is dealing with fussy kids. 

I unload the entries and smash one of my chicken skewers. I'm in heaven. I don't care what's happening around me right now, the house could be fire IDC.

The wife comes over and asks to try one of the skewers  so I shit stirred her saying she didn't even like them. She eats 1/3 of one of the skewers and walks away saying it's good, prefers when the sauce is on the side. 

This is where things get grey around food etiquette between a wife and a husband.

I've always been under the impression that if the SO consumes a part of your meal (e.g. one of four skewers) even if it's a bite or half or three quarters they have taken ownership of that food. It's officially off limits.

AITA time...

Thinking we are sharing entrees I open the white styrofoam box containing the fish cakes (yes these are absolutely not keto, idgaf) and smash one in seconds.

The wife looks at me in disgust... ""Did you just eat a whole one?"" ""I told you I wanted two tonight and two tomorrow for lunch"".

I'm just stunned... I tell her that I had three skewers (including hers) left and that I thought we were sharing. I don't recall her saying it was for lunch but I'm a grade A selective listener.

She proceeds to storm off to the bedroom leaving her entire meal in their containers, and the kids with me. Lots of pissy remarks ensued (e.g. stuffing your face, selfish)

AITA?

Edit: I meant if someone takes a bite of that particular food it's not something I really want to eat now, it's dead to me, it's theirs. I considered it as a fully consumed product (not a 1/3 consumed part). She has been sick recently so didn't want to catch the lurgey either. In hindsight, I should have asked and not just become a mindless zombie consuming at will. The pasta was cooked before we left, it was literally a two second zap and done.

1087,Not the A-hole,"I work/run a pub in a small town. I was working a Saturday night when four guys in their 20’s came in and ordered 4 pints of red stripe. They went out for a cigarette then I saw them walking to the train station, which is opposite the pub with their glasses. Usually I might not have bothered because it was busy, but we only had 8 of the branded glasses which my regulars love. So I headed over with plastic(compostable) glasses for them to put their pints in. However as I was asking them, nicely, they hopped on the train and proceed to taunt me. I asked more sternly and one of them necked their drink and handed me the glass but another one threw their pint on me. This pissed me off quite a bit so I held the door open, preventing the train from leaving and called the conductor over to ask for help. He told me to stop holding the train up and let them stay on the train while they all continued to give me the finger. 

I think the conductor was a spineless person that easily could have kicked them off the train as I’m certain they didn’t have tickets. But was I the asshole?

It was a London bound train, so quite busy

Sorry for insulting the conductor, but if he was actually doing his job properly he shouldn’t have let them on the train for, drinking their own alcohol on board and assaulting someone on the platform(I know that sounds like an excessive word, but in terms of criminal charges it’s correct)

On other side of my space is the empty turning circle in our very small car park. She thinks I should leave her room as she's too ill to manoeuvre her car properly and just doesn't like driving ....and take up space in this turning circle. 

I wouldn't completely block it if I did. 

But I'm being called petty for starting a dreaded ""parking war"". I've been polite all the time.

1089,Asshole,"Me and my girlfriend are moderately overweight. We have been noticing that we were getting fatter still, so I pushed us to try and lose some weight. We now go on walks everyday, we cut the sugar and generally try to eat better and in reasonable quantities. This is being tougher on her because she really enjoys eating until she's full. I'm mainly the one trying to keep us on track and very often I have to call her out when she's sliding back into our old eating habits.

So this last weekend we went to a wedding together as guests. We were sitting next to each other, together with family members from both our families, all in the same table. Every table had its own food so everyone could just serve themselves. So what happened next was I had to watch as my girlfriend filled her plate up with all kinds of delicious food. I kinda gave her a look like that, but she just shrugged it off as if to say ""yeah I know, but we're at a wedding"". I was slightly annoyed with her behavior but sort of forgot about it and tried to just enjoy everyone's companies. Some time after that, when she was finished, she was out for more. She asked me to pass her this big plate of shrimp rice so that she could try some of that. That really struck me, but I didn't want to argue right there and then, so what I did was get the srino rice and proceed to fill her plate up until it was literally overflowing a little bit.

She just kind of stared at it, then got up and went outside alone. Everyone was staring at me at this point and I thought it was better I just went outside too to talk to her. She told me she was humiliated and that I stepped out of line and they I came off as a controlling jerk.

1090,Not the A-hole,"Some context: my boyfriend and I both live with our parents, but sleep over at each other's houses regularly. We're both students at the same uni, but don't have the same classes. My place is over an hour and a half from the uni, his is 20min away.

The issue: when he stays at my place, I get myself up in time to get ready and pack my lunch, as well as his. I also either get him breakfast at home or make sure we are at uni early enough to get the free breakfast provided before class.

When I stay at his place, he never provides me any breakfast, or offers me anything to take for lunch. I get coffee in the morning only if I make it myself. I hate buying food at uni because it's so expensive, as well as unhealthy, which he knows.

AITA for expecting that he makes me lunch or at least breakfast, when I do the same for him?


EDIT: I've spoken to him about it on multiple occasions, he just gets really annoyed and nothing changes. 

EDIT2: He doesn't make himself breakfast or lunch, I've only seen him take lunch once when his mum packed it (he thanked her profusely and didn't provide me anything). I also want to emphasize that I don't expect him to cook me an entire meal, just making a sandwich or offering me the cereal or leaving 10 minutes earlier so I could get free breakfast on campus would be just as good.

EDIT3: He does often complain about how much money he's wasting on lunch and how he should save more (even to the point of telling me off for buying a coffee because it was a waste of money). He also does get hungry I'm the morning, he usually buys breakfast if he has the time, or complains about not having time to get breakfast. So although unasked for, I don't think he completely doesn't like having a packed lunch.

EDIT4: Lads, I've worked it out. I don't care if he makes my lunch (the not having lunch is a problem but I'm gonna solve that for myself), I care about his complete lack of motivation to do anything for himself, but willingness to accept someone else doing it for him.

1092,Not the A-hole,"Bit of background. My family has been extremely abusive and neglecting of me and my siblings which I was blind to until recently.  Our family is in bad relationship with all of our relatives so I had no point of reference.

We were flat out denied to learn simple human skills like cooking because “you don’t need that with us” and “you are too useless to be independent anyway”.

Now on the story. I started going to university but wasn’t allowed to move to campus so I spend four and half hours every day simply to get back and forth to uni. 

I made friends who all opened my eyes that this is abnormal and I as an adult (20f) should be able to make my own decisions and my sleep deprivation caused by travel is affecting my performance.

I found that one of my friends is in search of a roommate and I immediately agreed because I will have off rent and groceries if I agree to practice cooking (I can make food to live off despite everything) because she is busy with her job.

Now on one hand I would like to inform my parents in advance but on the other hand I know they will do everything to keep me from leaving and I am not immune to it especially if they include my siblings. But I will also feel bad putting them on the spot.

One of my roommates got a girl pregnant about 8 months ago and very much kept it on the down-low. He didn't want a relationship with this girl, or even with his son. It's a difficult situation but I guess you can't force someone to be a parent if they're not ready. So they lived separate lives. 

She became homeless. Kind of intentionally? She left her shared apartment and claiming she had nowhere to go came to live with us. The arrangement was that she would live with us until she got a council house. Obviously in London it's not that straight forward. Her baby is due in 3 days, and her housing interview isn't until the beginning of next month.

I don't want her living with us. I'm a student and I have exams in a month when she has a newborn. And to top if off cherry on the cake I'm also 18 weeks pregnant! I kind of just want to enjoy the next few months without a baby around before mine arrives.

1095,Not the A-hole,"So a few years ago I was visiting my parents from university (where, admittedly, I’d gone soft and was quite offended by a lot of things). We were about to watch a movie and my dad went to the kitchen to get some snacks. He brought back some liquorice candies that are somewhat shaped like humans and asked if I wanted a “nigger baby”. 

Naturally I was quite shocked by a white guy using a historically brutal word in such a casual way, so I said something along the lines of, “Good god, could you please not use that word?” 

My parents found this really amusing and explained that this is the name they called the candies when they were children and it wasn’t a big deal. I tried to explain my point, but they laughed it off and kept calling the candies by the name they prefer. 

Over the years they still refer to the candies by that term and I’ve taken to ignoring them since they just want a rise out of me, but recently I had a great idea. I’ve spent a lot of time around Aussies and have become really desensitized to the word “cunt”. (We’re North American so this is the holy grail of curse words.) 

So when I was visiting my parents this time and my dad asked me if I wanted some n-word babies I said, “Yeah, I’d like some of those tasty cunts.” 

My stepmom’s jaw dropped and my dad quickly admonished me, saying he didn’t raise his daughter to use that language. I said it was just a word, hoping they’d notice the parallels to their use of a word I don’t like, but man were they rattled. We watched a movie and I tried to make awkward small-talk before bed without much luck.

1099,Not the A-hole,"To fully understand whats going on I will summarize the background of this whole situation with timestamps.  
English is not my first language and I am fucking confused ATM so please excuse any spelling or grammatical errors.   
TLDR at the bottom.

  


In february 2018 I (M23)  had FWB-relation with a girl (F21), lets call her Kim.

The whole thing lasted until march.

In april 2018 I came back together with my current GF (F22), gonna call her Jess. 

In november 2018 I was told by some distant friends from my area that Kim is pregnant and is due the very next day after I was told she was pregnant. So I had no clue at all that there was the possibilty, that I was going to become a father.  
A paterity test prooved that I was the father of the newborn girl. During this period my GF has been highly supportive.

Short-Cut to today.

Jess is not handling it very well any more. My life became a constant balancing act beetween work, studies, Jess and trying to be a somewhat father figure for the child. I always try to involve Jess as much as I can in everything regarding the child. I even send her screenshots of every message so she doesn't feel left out or that there are things happening behind her back. I truly love my GF and I hate that I have put her in that kind of situation.   
So as of today I tried to make an appointment at the bank to set up an account for my daughter where all money like child support go on to. In order to do that Kim has to go to the bank with me. I reached out to her to make an appointment but she canceled via text message because her grandmother has passed away.   
From here on everything went downwards. I expressed my sincere condolences and told her that I will rearrange the whole thing. As usual Jess gets screenshots of this whole scenario.   
I didn't expect a response to that at all but Jess suddenly lost her composure. She told me that it pisses her off that I expressed my ""sincere"" condolences and not only ""my condolonces"". From there on it all spiraled down. She told my to not be so gentle towards her and that she wishes us good luck with our little family. There are much more things she said but honestly I am not in the mood to write it all down. Of all things that were said, the thing with the condolences annoys me the most because it makes me wonder if she is that emotionally cold and angry that she ignores the fact that Kim lost a beloved family member and pressuring me into treating Kim more badly. Jess even told me, that it feels like we are breaking up/drifting apart  at the moment. She then blocked me and since then I am sitting at work, not able to get my head around it.   
So am I the asshole for beeing friendly to the mother of my daugther who is a former FWB.  


**TL;DR: Expressed sincere condolences to the mother of my daughter after she lost her grandmother. Now my GF blocked me and accuses me of beeing too friendly and nice towards her.**

1101,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: Decided to drop it with our campus’s ID service office and he finally agreed to pick it up there on his own time. Thanks for all the advice! 

Some context: 

I’m a freshman girl in college and I went to a frat party on Saturday. Guy in question goes to the same school as me, is a sophomore who lives off campus. 

Went to a frat party with some friends this past weekend and found a guy’s driver’s license. I found him on Instagram and he says it’s his, and he wants me to come to his apartment building (20 min walk from my dorm and in a pretty sketchy part of the city) and drop it off in the lobby with the doorman, because he’s out of town at the moment. Problem is, I have nobody to come with me and I really don’t feel all that comfortable spending 40 minutes walking through Los Angeles alone to meet somebody I don’t know. I asked him if he would want to meet me on campus since we both go to the same school, and he’s pretty pissed that I won’t bring it to him. Am I the asshole for not feeling comfortable walking alone through the city to give him his lost ID back? ",71,226,0.95
1102,Not the A-hole,"AITA... So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.

We ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn’t want sex, like really didn’t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn’t want sex, right? 

He woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying “do you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely”, so I told him I just wasn’t ready, he reaaallly didn’t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? 

Like seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I’m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn’t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he’s fumingggg. 

Either way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!

*EDIT* I told him before hand that I was nervous about dating and wanted to take the whole process slow, he was fine with this and told me we can go as slow as needs be ",587,2115,0.94
1103,Asshole,"A few friends and I went to Vegas for a weekend trip, and hit up a strip club on Saturday night. I'm not as well-off financially as my friends. My friends were planning on having a good time with strippers, but I decided I wasn't going to pay for any potential services, and instead just enjoy hanging out with my buddies. I tried to make that pretty clear to the strippers who approached me. Though I enjoyed chatting with them, and they seemed to enjoy chatting with me too, even after I told them I wasn't going to pay for anything (I ended up having a few 15 minute long conversations). But then there was this interaction:

A stripper approaches me, and asks what I'm looking for.

I respond, ""I don't know, how much are your services?""

""It depends on what you want...how about about a few thousand?""

""That's a bit steep for me, I'm more of a hundreds kind of guy""

""That's fine, we can work something out...""

At this point, I was wavering in my commitment to not spend any money. She takes me for a walk around the club. We've interacted for no more than 2-3 minutes total at this point.

She asks again what I want to do. I've changed my mind again, and decide that I don't want anything after all. I tell her this.

She calls me out, saying that I had just said a few minutes prior that I'd pay her for \*something\*. I realize I'm being unfair and leading her on, so I'm direct tell her that I'm sorry for changing my mind, and that I'm not feeling it anymore.

She is now incredulous: ""Why did you come to a strip club if you weren't planning on spending money?!?"" (fair question...but I came mostly to spend more time with my friends in a new environment) and ""how dare you touch me?"" (I was holding her arm prior to this point, but had not touched any other part of her body)

I apologize again, and she immediately follows up by demanding that I tip her. She didn't specify an amount she wanted, but kept reiterating that I wasted her time. I only had a $20 and $50 bill in my wallet, and didn't think that either justified the opportunity cost of her time (around 5 minutes total at this point), so I told her that I couldn't tip her and I'm again sorry.

I realize I cost her time that she could've spent with another potential ""client,"" but I find it a bit absurd that she demanded me to tip her just for 5 minutes of conversation (especially since I had spent significantly longer talking to some of her fellow strippers, who didn't make any demand of tipping)? I imagine she spends a nontrivial amount of time each night not interacting with any clients at all (e.g. walking around, drinking, etc.), and that it's also not uncommon for potential clients to turn her down.

AITA for not paying a hard working individual?

tl;dr Unexpectedly shafted a stripper. I spent 5 minutes talking to her, and refuse her services. She demands that I tip her for her time. I don't have an appropriate amount to tip her, so I refuse. AITA?",34,35,0.83

1106,Not the A-hole,"Hello guys, this is a little weird, I don't know much about autism so I don't know if what I did was wrong or not, everyone seems to think I was an asshole, you tell me what you think.

I'm currently on my second year of college and I happen to have a class with a professor that I know has Asperger Syndrome. He seems like a regular guy, he's a good professor and overall chill dude, but he tends to give his opinion about \*\*everything\*\*, he makes weird harmless comments like ''Wow your glasses are too big for your face'', ''You walk weird'', ''Your hair looks messy'', etc. In my case he just told me in a regular basis that I dressed ''weird'' because I always wear a jean jacket, I didn't pay him much attention and usually just laughed or ignored him, and pretty much all of my class did the same and didn't complain even if they felt bothered.

Well, a few weeks ago, we were in class and I needed help with something and he suddenly said ''Wow you have a moustache'', I'm a girl so I felt a little embarrassed that he said that to me, but as usual I just laughed and shrugged it off, but then I think he noticed it bothered me because he started telling me the same thing everytime he saw me, even in front of the whole class he referred to me as ''the girl with the moustache'', day by day I literally shaved my not even visible moustache because I didn't want people in my class to laugh at me or my professor to comment on it, but nope, it didn't work.

Last week, when he commented on it again I decided to call him out on it, it went something like this, P for Professor, Me for me.

P: Wow you still have your moustache.

Me: Yeah, so do you, everyone does, I also have eyes and arms.

P: Yeah, but it's weird when women have moustaches.

Me: It's not weird, it's natural.

After that he kinda just laughed and left, and I thought it'd be the end of it but NOPE, every single class he commented on it, and even people from other classes knew about it. Today while at class I overheard him tell people some other things, I heard him tell a girl that she had a zit and a friend of mine that he was fat, he shrugged it off but he seemed a little upset about it, so when the time came for him to make fun of my ''moustache'', I told him that I was disappointed in him, when he asked why and I told him that I was disappointed that he was making people feel bad because of their physical attributes, he remained silent for a moment and then he said that he had Asperger and that he can't control what he says and just walked away.

All my friends told me that I was an asshole for telling him that and that I should've let him say those things because he has Asperger, the cherry on top is that apparently today is World Autism Awareness Day, I swear I didn't know but I still think that he perfectly knew what he was doing and he knew he was making people upset, so AITA?",277,1017,0.96
1107,No A-holes here,"I just recently upgraded from apartment living to a three bedroom duplex with my two children, wife and I. We have lived in apartments our entire adult lives.  Top floor, bottom floor, u name it, and we are used to and understanding of the noise. 

Moving to a duplex was a large step up for us. Each kid has their own room now! We have a garage! A backyard! We can grill! Also, it costs way more in rent then we have ever spent. But it seemed worth it, better school district and all that. 

Then real life set in and it hit hard. It’s almost like clock work, every night around 8-8:30ish the pounding and screaming starts. And it continued every night past 10:00 for quite awhile. 

About two weeks in it became ridiculous. My children were having a hard time falling asleep and it would go late enough that even my wife and I would have trouble going to sleep. One night it was exceptionally bad and my wife and I had had it! I knocked politely and the dad answered. 

I calmly explained to him that the noise was really loud, and that I wanted to have open communication with him because I’m sure they hear my kids at times too. He responded by saying, no, they never hear us and admitted it was all them. Then stated that one of their four children had autism and then nonchalantly jotted down my phone number and texted me for future use. 

Since then we haven’t heard anything past 10pm, (quiet hours are 10pm-8am) but every night there is pounding and screaming, every god damn night! And every god damn night my children have difficulty falling asleep! 

Since then we have filed multiple complaints with our rental agency, showing videos of even, of how loud it is and they don’t seem to care. They have done absolutely nothing. It’s so bad we are wanting to break our lease a month and a half in so we can, once again, have peace. 

Tonight it was a bit worse than usual and I texted the dad to ask if he would consider moving the loud child to a room that doesnt share a wall. I havnt heard back and I don’t expect to. 

But I can’t stop wondering.....

Am I the asshole?

1112,Asshole,"So my best friend is getting married, her sister and my sister are best friends also, so its the 4 of us. We've been bf's for years, we aren't really close with other girls, so its always been just us.  

Her now-fiance asked my sister and I to help set up the proposal and of course we were ecstatic to help out, shes the younger sister same as me, so it was such exciting news and the whole day turned out amazing. We were the only friends there, the rest were family, so of course we're like family to each other. 

&#x200B;

Me, my sister and the bride-to-be's sister had all thought of the idea to have a surprise hens and go to Bali. We would split the cost 3 ways and make it our last holiday together, a last harrah before she leaves us for married life. We knew everything would add up in terms of money wise, but it was for our best friend, a once in a lifetime occasion, money isn't an issue. We had our eyes on the lingerie we were going to get her, the kitchen tea presents, engagement and of course the wedding present. 

&#x200B;

The four of us went our for dinner just recently, and the bride-to-be says she has to tell us something really sad. We had no idea what was coming...""I'm not having a bridal party"". She said of course she would of had myself and my sister but they cant afford to have a bridal party, her sister is going to be Maid of Honour and thats all. I dont know if its just me, but the bridal party is the funnest part pre-reception right? The sleepovers before the big day, everyone getting their makeup and hair done, the limo ride, the photos, the endless supply of liquor.

&#x200B;

My sister and I were absolutely shattered and has now got us thinking, why should we be spending so much of our money if she isnt willing to splurge a little for a us? Not even, we said dont worry we'll pay for ourselves! Its your big day, its us, we want to be apart of it!! She said she wouldnt want that, even if we were happy to do it, because her fiance wouldn't ask that of his friends. The part that really got me though, was her saying she ""still wants us to be apart of it all"" to me this sounds like use and abuse? We can throw a bridal shower, a kitchen tea, the best hens night, but why should we go above and beyond now? Obviously I know I can't compare wedding costs to a few ""gifts"" but whats a bridesmaid? a dress? hair? makeup? Like I said, I was more than happy to pay for all of that just to be able to share this day with her, rather than sit on the sidelines with everyone else.

&#x200B;

So am I an asshole? Is it selfish of me to think of it that way considering its her wedding and big day? Or do my sister and I have reason to be hurt and angry and not want to put in our all anymore? ",109,206,0.84
1113,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We get along great, support each other, and love each other. Our relationship is perfect in every aspect but sexual. 

I did not know I was asexual when we started dating, I just thought I was a late bloomer. My boyfriend was patiently waiting for me to make the first move sexually and I was completely oblivious. We didn’t discuss the issue until well over a year or two into the relationship and it soon became incredibly frustrating for both of us. We almost broke up multiple times, but by that time we both loved each other and couldn’t go through with it. 

Now I’ve finally figured out my sexual identity (or lack thereof) for the most part and we compromise and things are better. My boyfriend has a very high libido and I have the opposite. I’m not interested in doing anything sexual and it’s all a little nasty to me. However, I frequently give in and we do sexual things (the whole gamut, I wont specify) as a compromise. However, neither of us can ever really be satisfied by this situation because it’s more than I want and less than he wants. (I do want to clarify that I consent to everything we do though.)

He’s incredibly patient and understanding with me but it’s obvious that he’s unhappy with the sexual aspect of our relationship. He is also very against the idea of an open relationship. Am I an asshole for holding him back when he could find someone potentially better suited? Am I being selfish for wanting to stay with a good guy even though I can never fully satisfy his needs? If things keep going the way they are we could realistically get married in a few more years, and I can’t help but wonder if that would be a bad idea for both parties involved.

It was something I was passionate about and enjoyed doing, and it would take quite a while to create big, elaborate dinners for my family of 6.

That being said, the only thing that would have caused me to hesitate on his proposal is how irresponsible he is with money. Every month, it's like pulling teeth to get just his half of our shared bills, which I always end up covering to some extent. So, I told him days later that if he can't get his act together, I would need to take sole control of our budget or I can’t marry him.

He makes less than I do, but he still says he makes $35k+/year (plus benefits) so there shouldn’t be a reason, including student loan payments, for him to not be able to pay his half.

I made an Excel sheet in *September* to help him budget better. *Last month*, I got frustrated that I couldn't manage my own savings because I was constantly overestimating how much he could give me. So, I told him that I would cover our shared expenses and just stretch my dollar, if he can make it his job to stash the majority of each check for the wedding. *Two weeks ago*, I found out that *he hadn't opened the budget spreadsheet since I made it.* I was asking him to fill it in since the numbers he was giving me seemed oddly low. When I asked about it, he got incredibly defensive, giving me excuses like ‘he didn’t make enough to even warrant filling put something like this’ and made me feel like I was being cruel for not believing he doesn’t have the money.

I don’t know how, but every time I talk to him, he manages to make me feel like I'm a bully or like I'm just refusing to see how the numbers are falling, except he won't show me! And I'm starting to feel like I'm crazy! BUT everyone I’ve gone to for advice thinks he has a gambling addiction. They can't find any other explanation that makes sense, and while I HAVE had a couple run-ins with him and gambling, it just didn't add up for me. He never struck me as the compulsive type-

When I asked, ""what money,"" he started backpedaling HARD, saying ""oh. I just assumed there might be a grand prize, it just made sense"" but dodged my questions about the cost. The only way you get a prize in sports betting is if you put money down, right? Please correct me if I'm making a false assumption!

Another volunteer with the youth group sat me down and basically told me that I had to do a better job of staying in the closet or stop volunteering at the church. I chose the latter. 

&#x200B;

Well the rest of the church found out I was gay because I stopped being so in the closet and now every time I’m there I get weird looks, no one will talk to me, and people I considered my family won’t hug me or shake my hand anymore. I’ve kinda distanced myself from the whole thing because I’m just uncomfortable every time I’m there.

&#x200B;

My mom still works with the high school youth and is extremely involved at the church, but she also has a very demanding full time job and is really busy a lot of the time. She frequently will ask me to pick stuff up for her or drop stuff off at the church or be a driver for her kids when they do outings and such. She really needs the help because she has to depend on parents helping a lot but it’s not always enough so I feel like I’m leaving her without any options if I back out. But the thing is, I was really passionate about being involved with the middle school kids because they are an age group I really like dealing with, they have so many unique problems and it’s an age where they have so many questions and I liked being the person that could guide them through that and feel like I was told that I’m not allowed to do that anymore. I was never heavily involved with the high schoolers and would only help my mom every once in a while.

&#x200B;

Every time I help her with something, I’m reminded that I was basically kicked out of doing the thing that I really care about. And also I’m not any less gay, so if it was an issue with the middle school parents, that’s still gonna be a problem for the high school parents as well and I just don’t want to have to deal with it at all. I haven’t even been to church in like 6 mo because I just feel so shitty there so I definitely don’t want to have to put any extra time/effort/money into an organization that made it very clear I’m unwelcome.

&#x200B;

The issue is that I really don’t want my mom to feel like she has to chose between me and her entire friend group.

1129,Asshole,"So my girlfriend and I were talking about something psychology related, and she told me about an experiment she learned about in one of her psych classes (she’s a psych major). The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like “that’s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been”

We continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn’t like that I’d used the word “obviously” because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn’t know it was obvious. 

The conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. 

She said again that she didn’t know it was that obvious, and it hadn’t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word “obviously” can be offensive, but I don’t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. 

She kept trying to explain to me why using the word “obviously” was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said “I don’t care.” She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don’t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.

She’s waiting for me to apologize, but I don’t think I should have to. I just don’t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn’t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I “tried to invalidate her feelings,” which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. 

I told her I need her to not get offended about such little things.

He’s a very traditional type of guy, and so he was very angry to see that they (random strangers) were eating with their hats on.

1134,Not the A-hole,"My GF [22F] and I [24M] have been dating for about 6 months now. I’ve known that she has trust and abandonment issues from her past relationships. She dislikes one of my best friends [25F], whom I’ve known for about a year longer than GF. Let’s call her “Jane.” There has never been anything (sexual or romantic) between her and I. I tend to befriend more girls than guys, so it’s normal for me.

GF cites a couple reasons for not liking Jane. 
1. They met was at my Halloween party. Jane came with a larger group of friends and they were all drunk already. From the moment Jane got there, all she talked about was how excited she was to meet GF. When GF got there, they briefly introduced each other and GF went to hang out with her friends that she invited. Jane kept asking me when she’d be able to really meet GF. In her drunken state, Jane tried to discreetly whisper this to me. Aware that it could cause a misunderstanding, I make sure to keep a reasonable distance and never make any physical contact; I even tried to bring Jane to where GF was but GF didn’t seem interested in talking to Jane. Afterwards, GF was mad and didn’t allow me to explain anything because that would be “defending” Jane.
2. GF said she would give Jane “a second chance” when I invited GF to come to a bday party at Jane’s apartment. I was already in a bad mood bc of my then-roommate who is an asshole (we were still “best friends” then but that’s a different story). At one point, I got very hungry, ordered delivery, and ate it in the lobby away from people to not be rude. GF came out eventually and said she’d go to the bathroom and be right back. After a few minutes, Jane comes out and asks why I’m eating outside. Jane says to just go eat in her room and that there’s a lot of people hanging out there. Knowing how bad this was going to look, I insist on staying and that I’m waiting for GF to come back. Jane tells me that GF is in the balcony smoking weed with my roommate, then grabs my food, and tells me to just text GF that I’ll be eating upstairs. I’m even more anxious at this point and quickly text GF to come back and shows up before we went upstairs. Jane takes us to her room, where there were indeed other people. We had an argument, couldn’t explain; same thing.

Because of personal reasons, GF moved back home indefinitely and we’ve been in a LDR for 3 months. GF says that because we are doing distance and Jane makes her uncomfortable, I should avoid anything related to Jane, such as: liking pics on facebook and instagram, talking to her, and being anywhere Jane might also be at. GF says she’d even expect me to leave a place or party if Jane is also there, at least for as long as we’re in a LDR. Because I transferred schools, I rarely see my friends anyway and this just makes it even harder because Jane may be where they are.

So, am I being “disrespectful” to our relationship by refusing to avoid my friend?",57,67,0.91
1135,No A-holes here,"I am 31F, SO is 30M, together 2 years, living together 1, planning engagement and family in next year or so. We split chores roughly evenly. I have no complaints here—we both do our fair share overall. Part of our split is that food is mainly my chore, since I enjoy cooking and he’s always been up-front that he doesn’t know how.

I always try to use fresh, from-scratch ingredients. My cooking style is very simple. Dinner always includes a protein, a carb, and a veggie, and usually a fruit-based dessert. I only cook complicated stuff for special occasions, guests, etc. I try to cook mindfully of our general health, balanced nutrition, fresh food, etc., but I’m not being a “foodie” or expecting anything exotic or difficult.

If, for some reason, I don’t have time or energy to cook, SO’s idea of handling dinner is picking up fast food for both of us. He’ll pay for both our meals and if I say I’m not in the mood for fast food, he’ll suggest a different (nicer) restaurant. He’s not exactly being cheap or unfair because he will let me pick the restaurant and he’ll always offer to pay (though we usually split). And he never gives me a hard time about occasionally not cooking even though we agreed that would be primarily my chore. But I hate that if I don’t cook, it'll always be more expensive and less healthy, because SO can’t be bothered to learn anything.

I’ve tried engaging him while I cook, to show him some basics, but he’s just not interested. It’s a mindset issue, like he just doesn’t think cooking is a thing that applies to him because he can always get fast food. I’ve asked him if he could just learn a couple of basic meals, for the odd occasion that I’m sick, working late, etc., but he doesn’t see the point because he can just grab takeout and “if you want to be healthy just get a salad!”

It kinda stresses me out because we’re talking about having kids in the next year or two. Things are going to get a lot more hectic and I might not have time/energy to cook every night. Or I could get injured or die and he’d be in charge of feeding the kids. (Unlikely, but it could happen.) He thinks me asking him to learn some basic skills is unnecessary because he can always just pay for takeout and “they have salads if you’re trying to be healthy”. He supports his argument by reminding me that he before we met, he only ever ate fast food (literally), and he’s never been overweight or had a health issue. I mean, he’s not wrong, but I still think: Just because you CAN in your teens and 20s, doesn’t mean you SHOULD forever—and I think you definitely shouldn’t raise kids on a 100% fast food diet. I’m bothered by his refusal to cook, but to his credit, if I don’t cook he is always willing to let me pick the restaurant and he always offers to pay. And we did decide that cooking would be mainly my chore. AITA?",46,26,0.9

1143,Not the A-hole,"First time poster here with a moral dilemma. 

*Backstory: I own a pet hedgehog named Loki.He needed to have an eye surgically removed recently and has finally recovered, but needless to say has been through a lot of stress. (Surgery, anesthetics, vet visits, antibiotics, etc.)*

My vet posted his story to Facebook, with my permission, because hedgehogs are fairly unusual as pets and she was proud of saving his life. This is all fine, personally I don’t use Facebook but apparently the post got a lot of traction within our community. 

Apparently, our neighbors saw the post as well and showed the pictures of my little companion to their 5 year old son. 

*Side note: I’m not close to my neighbors, just the occasional hello.*

Just today, the father rang the doorbell and asked about Loki, referring to the post. It was kind of them to check up on him and I told them that he was doing well, to which he asked if they could see him. More specifically, if his son could see him. 

I understand that he is a rare pet and am aware of how exciting he must be to a kid, so I agreed. 

I asked them to come back later in the evening, since Loki is nocturnal and I avoid waking him up during the daytime (this was around 2PM, in Loki-time that’s like being shaken awake at 2AM)

He agreed and came back around 4:30ish (PM), with their son. He was really excited about seeing my hedgehog, so I let them in and brushed over the fact that they ignored my request. Loki wouldn’t be happy about me waking him up this early, but it would be fine. Plus, I don’t know the kids schedule, so maybe anything later wouldn’t have worked. 

I led everyone to my room and gently lifted the fleece blanket off my grumpy hedgie. After a while, he calms down.

The kid *looses his shit*. I mean excited squealing, jumping up and down, etc. This startled Loki and he curled up into a hissing ball (they’re easy to startle), to which I picked him up to calm him down. 

The parents then ask if their son can hold him as well. He gets even more excited. 

Here’s where I want to know if I was the asshole: Hedgehog spikes can hurt when they’re defensive, and I wouldn’t trust a kid that young not to drop him out of fright. My hedgehog doesn’t know his scent and the kid was very fidgety prior to this, so I was concerned that this would scare Loki and lead to him being held improperly or dropped. And most importantly, I didn’t want to risk any further stress after his surgery story. 

I was polite, but firm when I said no.

The kid was upset, but ultimately understood and thanked me gloomily for showing him my pet. Despite being unhappy about not being allowed to hold him, but took it very gracefully. (Especially for a kid that young!)

Here’s the thing: When we were at the door, the mom pulled me aside and told me that it was unnecessary of me to refuse her sons wish and that I had made him upset. She still thanked me, but shook her head as she left. 

Am I the asshole? Could I have handled it better?

1146,Not the A-hole,"So I have been dating my current girlfriend for close to 4 years and things have come to a head recently. When we met for the first time, I was immediately attracted to her since we had a lot in common. I asked her out after a short courtship of 3 months and she was really into me I felt.

The only problem was that she was not very keen about the physicality of the relationship. When we hit the sack, initially she was into the foreplay but she won't allow me to remove certain articles of clothing (those being her pants and then eventually her undies). The other problem was that whenever I would try kissing her (going french) she would act awkward or start laughing. I took this in my stride since she hadn't been with anyone before and I assumed she would get used to it eventually.

Fast forward 4 years and we are still more or less where we started. She still has a problem with kissing, even after infinite number of tries, and recently, she finally agreed to removing her undies after I told her it was getting really frustrating for me (it's really hard to get a girl off over her undies, trust me). I have never forced her to have sex with me and never will, since I respect her boundaries, but even getting her to have a casual make out session is really hard. 

I have recently started thinking maybe she just isn't into me physically. I asked her about this and she kept telling me she is but I don't know what to believe anymore. Things have gotten so bad that I feel weird even talking to her about it because I don't want to force her into anything. 

I have had a number of relationships before and I have never faced anything like this. I was quite serious about my current GF and the prospects of marriage have come up, however she initially told me she doesn't believe in the ""institution of marriage"" to which I told her to not waste my time then. After a lot of cajoling she eventually decided she will think about it, but nothing is set in stone.

In the end I don't want to waste my time since I'm not getting any younger. I have stayed true to her these four years but I am not sure if it can work out anymore. I have had a conversation with her about this and she is asking me to believe her that she is attracted to me physically but I am not so sure.

1147,Asshole,"UPDATE;  Some of the comments have made me step back and rethink, why I was going to get this tattoo in the first place.  It was never because of my family as a whole or My lineage, etc. That, I thought of adding after to “flesh out” the idea.  

It was because of becoming a father, something I’ve wanted to be for a long, long time.  Getting the input and feedback when I was already second guessing the idea has reinforced that this tattoo should be solely about the origination for the idea, my daughter.


The idea behind the tattoo is that it would show my lineage.  My Parents > Me> My Daughter in Roman numerals stacked oldest to youngest, bottom to top.  

For some reason my wife thought that her DOB would be included in this tattoo and was shocked and upset her DOB was not included.  To make the situation worse, my mother (who has no tattoos) sided with my wife under the idea that our daughter was a product of both my wife and I.    I don’t know if they are confusing the idea with family tree despite me saying I was using it to show my lineage or direct descendants.

I have substantial balances to pay off on a personal credit card and a veterinary care card. Both of my cards will not accrue interest for a few months. I created a budget and plan to pay these off in a timely manner so I can get back to saving money/spending money on nice things for us and myself. 

A part of this plan included minimization of fast food, which we had been eating way too much of. That said, I still make exceptions on spending frugally. I’m fine with the occasional get-togethers with friends, the pizza nights, restaurants or drinking with friends at home, etc. She still frequently (though less so recently) asks for fast food or other frivolous purchases. She gets the same thing at most fast food joints. I’ve asked that she just put a substitute like frozen nuggets and fries on our grocery list, so she can have that as a cheaper option. But sometimes if I don't cave in on her request for “real” fast food, she'll insist that she can just get it for herself. However, she has multiple times previously agreed to put what’s left (after her own expenses) of her small income from her part-time job towards expenses or paying off our vet card. Despite buying the requested frozen fries and nuggets, she'll occasionally still insist she wants the actual fast food. I’ll often still refuse, and she’ll insist I’m making too big of a deal out of it. To be clear, we both cook (unlike that other guy with the professional cook/chef girlfriend). 

I also really dislike having to say no to her requests. I wish I were in a financial situation where I could just say yes. I'd prefer she respect our financial situation and not put me in a position of feeling a need to say no. 

Succinctly: every dollar counts, we should be substituting and finding cheaper options wherever possible. I would really appreciate it if she could adopt this mentality for her money and mine. I can't force her, but it also feels very unreasonable of her to continue pushing the issue on these various fronts, especially when substitutes are so readily available for literally 1/5 the cost.

1151,No A-holes here,"Super short background: So I am 6 months pregnant with me and my husbands first child. I work but he is definitely the primary bread winner and we are reliant on his income not mine.

Me and my husband were sitting in traffic on a 2 lane highway. The lane going our direction was all the way backed up and at a standstill. The lane in the other directions was empty flowing freely. The driver 2 cars ahead of us tries to flip around and go the other way to get out of the traffic. But as she is doing that a car comes around the corner and she t-bones him off the road. He goes slightly down the embankment and crashes into a tree and gets knocked unconscious. The car almost immediately catches fire under the hood and my husband jumps out and runs to the car. The passenger door is blocked by the tree and the drivers door handle is broken from being hit. My husband breaks the window with his elbow and peels the glass back with his hands (the glass is that beaded safety glass stuff) so he can pry the door open. 

He did this got the guy out and shortly after the whole vehicle goes up in flames. So he definitely saved the guys life and is definitely a hero. Because of that his elbow and hands are all cut up and can't work for a few weeks but that is the absolutely best news. He could have got himself killed.

I haven't said anything to him because I probably shouldn't feel that way but he has a wife and child that depend on him and I feel like he should think about that and not put his life on the line.

1152,Not the A-hole,"So. Throwaway acct. but here it goes.

My spouse and I currently live on our own in our house and we’re 26 years old and expecting our first child this week.

My sibling (16) is still living with our mutual parent. I have never gotten along with our mutual parent as I personally feel they’re a hypocritical pile of shit and a terrible excuse for a parent. Always on their phone, does what they want at all times with no real thought for the kid, and basically shows no attention to the kid regardless of what the kid wants. Nothing has changed since my sibling has been there

My sibling has some mental problems (bipolar disorder, depression, and a learning disability) that mean realistically sibling should have been given more attention than a normal kid, let alone, the attention they were given

So basically, sibling got caught liking a person of the same sex a state away and my parent freaked out. Calling sibling a demonic spirit and going extremely over the top with their conservative views under attack. Parent threatening to put sibling in a group home. And sibling therefore has spiraled into a bad spot.

Sibling wants to live with me and realistically I know it would be in their best interest because of the situation their in. But frankly, I hate the parent, and the sibling is frankly not very well equipped to handle a job or really any legitimate task due to being taken out of school. But I really don’t want that responsibility of taking care of a child that’s not mine and everything that comes with it, on top of having my own child otw. 

So I feel like garbage, because I’m sure I’m being selfish, but I also feel like it’s not my responsibility in the first place. I was hoping parent 2 would step up (parents are divorced) but I think they are in the same boat I am in (which I think is bullshit because it’s their kid).

So AITA for not wanting to put myself and my wife through taking care of my sibling on top of my own child despite the fact that my siblings mental well being would be in a much better place if I did.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


Am I the asshole?

1155,Not the A-hole,"Just attended her bachelorette party last weekend and realized how much the other girls are struggling financially. Should I say something to the bride?? 


Most of the bridesmaids couldn't pay up front for the $150 dress and had to set up layaway plans. Half haven't booked accommodation for her summer destination wedding (I found a cabin for $700 back in January). At the bachelorette party, one girl was upset by $6 club sodas, and splitting the check after dinner was an entire ordeal.


Now she's asking us to buy matching heels. Is it my place to say something? Is it worth speaking up? The shoes will be ~$50, which is miniscule compared to the other expenses.",48,122,0.96
1156,Not the A-hole,"Update:
They broke up tonight, or rather he broke up with her...
After general teenage arguing and several hours of silent treatment from her (he had a game today and they obviously can not have their phones and she knows this) she tells him that she's having a bad day and to just leave her alone for awhile. He asks if he's done something to upset her, what's wrong. After a few snippy texts from her, he asks her if she's taken a test yet and she told him she took one at a friend's house after school and it was negative. He asked how she was feeling about that and she said she didn't know. 
They end up arguing about I don't know what tbh.
She threatened to break up he said that wasn't a bad idea. That he had wanted to break up last week and then she brought up the possible pregnancy. And he didn't want to be a jerk. He told her he'd like to still be friends with her. 
She is still blowing up his phone so we'll see. 

I did remind him to not be an asshole and that he is capable of simply not responding.



Quick disclaimer, my son is 17, the girlfriend just turned 16. There is no possible way the baby could be his as they have not physically been in touch since last summer. 
It's a newer relationship of not even 2 months. 

My son, we'll call him 'Sam' came to me a few nights ago positively sick needing to talk. He told me that his girlfriend, we'll call her 'Jess' thinks that she's pregnant. She refuses to talk to her parents (I get that it is scary) but also will not take a test. At this point she has missed at least 3 periods. 

We have talked for hours every day about this.... when I say that he's physically sick, I mean he is vomiting every time he eats, has had a migraine for two days, and slept more than a normal teenage boy (and they tend to sleep a LOT) He has even gotten a cold sore. This child is a mess. 

He is going back and forth over breaking up. But he does like her and knows that most likely she is going to trash him if he does. 

He is a junior in high school, on track for a full scholarship for baseball (his first game of the season is later today) 
They both have their lives ahead of them. 

They are currently kind of in a fight because he told her if she didn't find out by the end of the week, he's going to talk to her mom himself...
(Side note this summer my son was behaving like an asshole to her and she screenshot the messages and sent them to me. I dealt with it) 

Honestly, it's a bit of a trainwreck anyway as they have different goals, values, morals, etc. 
This is apparently not her first scare, until they were in a relationship she had several fwb partners. And Sam is still a virgin by choice because he doesn't want an unplanned pregnancy in his immediate future.

So, WIBTA if after the end of the week she hasn't taken a test, I contact her parent? 

Edit to add T to wibta

Edit INFO 
In the issue of last summer and her sending me screenshots, the conversation with her went ""Okay thanks, I'll ask him to stop.""
With him it was more, ""wow, you are being an asshole, maybe stop. Just block her and move on.""
 
Edit INFO 
No, my son's friends also do not drive or have access to a vehicle. (In fact I would love for him to get his license.) The only time he is away from home hours at a time are at school and practice. His phone (actually all of our phones) have a tracker that can be checked at any time. 
He is ridiculously open with me. There have been several very uncomfortable conversations between us, however I would much rather have them with him and know that he feels safe and secure in coming to me. 

Yes, there is a part of him that would like me or his dad to tell him to break up. And told him that isn't really the way to handle things. Yes, he is still a child. However, although I will always be here to listen and support his decisions, they need to be His decisions.

1157,Not the A-hole,"Dated for 3 years, and during our second year, she took at 14.99% APR loan on a car. She has been paying more than minimum, and should have had it paid off in 3 years rather than 5. However, one month after our marriage, I paid the whole thing off for her without consulting (about $7K).

She is upset because I have taken away her responsibility and feels like I constantly get involved and take over financial maters.

Not sure what to do...

Sorry that this isn't as nicely worded or as juicy of a story as most of the top posts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

INFO EDIT:, since people are asking: 

1) I brought 150K liquid cash into the marriage, along with a 300K home, while she brought about 5K liquid cash. 

2) No she was not doing this to build credit. She just needed a car and the dealership was the only one willing to give her a loan.

3) No she did not have a ""x"" amount of time to pay it off, she was just doing it as the money flowed in. She did have a goal. 3 years as originally stated. She was also perfectly on track for said goal.

4) There has not been ""underlying finance issues in our marriage"" as some people have spoken of, as we have only 
been married a month. This would be the first.

5) Her credit score is very good. But her accounts are too new so she couldn't get a decent loan.

6) Yes we have a joint bank account that we created the day after our marriage

7) After asking her if she would have let me pay off the loan if I asked first, she said no, she wanted to hold onto the loan and pay it off herself in her own time

8) We are both in our mid 20s

9) Having the loan in her name could potentially hurt me when looking to mortgage a new home, yes

FINAL UPDATE:

Thank you all for the responses. I have talked it over with her and she is still upset I made this decision without her but after making me promise never to make large financial decisions without her ever again, she cooled off after about a day.",132,186,0.94

1160,Not the A-hole,"Hello all. This is a throwaway and also my first time posting on this sub so bear with me.

I moved out of my mums home a few months ago and into a new apartment with my best friend and the family dog in tow as my mum can no longer look after him on her own. She was understandably upset so we assured her that she is more than welcome to come and visit him any time she likes.

Last week I came home after class to kill some time before work to find my mum, aunt and friend chatting in the kitchen which was a nice surprise. I was a bit worried though since my dog didn't come to greet me at the door like he usually does. Turns out he was in the living room with my cousin chasing a laser pen around, so I left them to it. After a while I heard my dog bark which immediately set off alarm bells in my head because he only ever barks when someone is being aggressive or when the intercom buzzes. I went to see what was going on and my dog was sitting in the corner of the room whimpering and my cousin was sitting on the floor smiling to himself which creeped me out a little. I asked him what happened, no answer. I told him it's probably best if he went and sat with his mum, he left without a word and my dog came up to me with his tail wagging. I was confused to say the least.

Yesterday my cousin came to me after he finished school because his mum had to work. He started asking me if he could walk the dog by himself, after I told him no he started getting insistent, bordering on a tantrum. I told him that if he stops, he can play on the PS4 and come with me to take the dog out after dinner. That shuts him up for a while. Then I hear him running around. He was literally running around with my dog in his arms which really pissed me off because my dog was fast asleep not 5 minutes ago and doesn't like being picked up (he's been told this multiple times). Plus the fact my dog is old, 13 going on 14 now. I raised my voice at him a little, telling him that if he carries on like this I won't allow him to see my dog any more. He drops my dog and he hits the ground hard and runs to my room. My cousin has a tantrum, tries to run to my room and I have to grab his arm to stop him.

When his mum comes to pick him up he leaves without a word. Well, this morning I got a call from my aunt telling me that I was out of order, he doesn't understand because he's autistic etc... and I told her that I can't have him here if he's going to continue with that kind of behaviour. She called me rude and selfish and hung up.

Am I being an asshole???

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Just thought I'd add that I have my dog booked in for a check up at the vets tomorrow just in case there was any harm done when he was dropped. He seems fine but better safe than sorry. I have also made a sure decision that I won't be allowing my cousin anywhere near my dog from now on. If that means he and my aunt want to fall out with me over it, I'm more than fine with that.",116,477,0.96
1161,Asshole,"Now I want to start this off by saying that my lawn wraps around the side of my house. Our entire property is about 3/4 of an acre placed on an otherwise normal suburban street. The lawn goes all the way back and all the way around the back to the other side of the house, and the driveway is touching the entire lawn as well as my neighbor's house.

So this morning I had my alarms set for 9:15, 9:30 and 9:45 a.m. The first two go off, I'm five minutes back to sleep before my next alarm when I hear the doorbell ring. Then I went to look at my doorbell camera and this guy is standing there, doing nothing. Two minutes later he rings again, twice this time. Again we did nothing and he did nothing, this guy seems sketchy the way he apparently needs to talk to us. So he realizes we're not there or just not gonna come answer. So on the camera I watch him walk down the sidewalk about half way towards my driveway, stop, and then look down my lawn like he's trying to see what's behind my house. Then he walks down to my driveway where the view of the camera ends. So I get up to look out the window and lo and behold he walked halfway down my driveway, backed up into my lawn and started taking pictures of the neighbor's house. My mother is afraid of this man and whatever his intentions are.

So here I lost my cool. I banged on the window and started yelling at him, telling him ""get the fuck off my lawn"" and ""who the fuck are you?"" He thought my gestures telling him to get off the lawn meant, ""come back to the door and let's talk about this."" I had to leave for school and I'm not usually very confrontational but I had no choice except to confront him.

I opened the door and the first thing he did was reach out to shake my hand. I guess he knew I was too polite to refuse that. So I shook his hand and I said, ""who the hell are you? You ring my doorbell three times, no one answers so you go down my driveway and start taking pictures of the neighbor's house?"" Still a snarky tone because A. I'm confused as hell, and B. I'm just waking up. He explains everything. He says he's power washing the neighbor's house (I can see his company truck parked in front of their house) and he was simply coming to tell me that my car in the driveway would most likely get misted. Now that I think of it, he made no mention to whether or not he was going to tell me that he'd be on my property at any point. Anyway, my mood is easily manipulated by kindness. I immediately apologized and felt like a huge ass hole. He kept explaining til I got to my car and then I told him that he has a job to do so whatever is necessary just do it.

I don't think he had ill intentions but I still think he handled it wrong. I think I handled it wrong too. What is my fate? AITA?",21,26,0.8

1163,Not the A-hole," 

I begin my tale with the death of my mother. She passed away in June 2018 from a very long battle with MS and other complications. She had been sick for over 10 years and handicap for most of that time. During that time my father took care of her all the way to the end. They would have been married 40 years at the end of 2018.

About a month later he began dating a woman who was a friend of the family, who has lied to my wife, me, and my brother repeatedly about things. So we were not the biggest fans of her. 

Fast forward to now, they got engaged, in which my dad broke down my mothers ring (after 40 years of marriage and my pleading with him not too). She came to all of the family holidays (the first ones without mom and that we had asked if she would abstain from coming because it was already hard enough). And now they are married (literally 6 months after mom had died and we buried her). And Dad literally got rid of all of mom's things, even Christmas ornaments that had him, my brother, and I on them still, because it had moms name on it.

Since the step-mom is from a big family, they decided to break 30 year family traditions  without consulting anyone, and said that they are renting a house in the middle of nowhere and they are requiring everyone to be there kids, spouses, and grand-kids (15 people) , so that we can stay indoors all weekend with each other and play games together. Not one of the kids wants to go to this forced mash up of yule-tide-awkwardness. The whole reason behind this gift is because my father is a control freak and because he didn't get his way last Christmas (my brother and I left earlier than we usually would because we didn't want to play games with him and his fiance, like we used to do with mom).

My wife and I literally scheduled a vacation around the scheduled time they told us so we wouldn't have to go. My dad said that I ""had to be there"" and that they would reschedule to January.

1165,Asshole,"Im the manager and owner of fairly large  bar and grill and i have 12 employees. One of my employees (Dale) is pretty racist against Asians and Hispanics. Our staff is entirely black and white and he doesn't have an issue with those people (he's black) but for whatever reason really hates asians and hispanics. Other coworkers have complained about his comments such as ""hey hurry up, this chink ordered a burger"" or ""I'm tired of these people speaking mexican in here"" among other similarly racist comments. I've told him to stop countless times and he hasn't. He rants about how immigrants are ruining this country and asians and hispanics are stealing our jobs and look weird and so on. He usually keeps this rhetoric to the staff but a few times he's gotten into altercations with customers who've then complained to me. He almost got into a fight with a hispanic customer after saying wetbacks should be deported and sent back to mexico or something like that. I had to intervene to stop the fight from happening. I've usually settled these incidents  by giving them free drink and told dale to stfu or I'm firing him. At this point though i've told dale to stop or i would fire him but he hasn't. Yesterday he told an old vietnamese man that he should stop blocking the doorway or he'd pour some agent orange in his next cocktail instead of politely asking him to move. The obvious solution is to just fire him because eventually an disgruntled employee or customer will film him and make it go viral giving the restaurant bad publicity  or right some really bad reviews on yelp, trip advisor or whatever. Im fed up with dale but he's a single father who has 3 children to take care of and he's taking care of his sick mother who's financially dependent on him which is why i feel i can't fire him. He's obviously a very morally  bad person but if i fire him it'll screw over the other people who depend on him. My other employees are constantly demanding i fire him but i've insisted that i can't because i don't want is kids to be screwed over.

1169,Not the A-hole,"My in-laws do not like me, and because of that they do things that make my daughter feel like crap. If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. 

My daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.

Last year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.

SIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.

My daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.

Eventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?

EDIT: i feel like I should clear this up since it keeps coming up. My daughter has never asked for my inlaws not to come. This is the first year she hasnt even had the hope for a good party which is why this is the first year I'm considering not inviting them. I'm sure if I asked her flat out of she wanted them at her party she'd look at me like I'm crazy and say yes. I know it doesn't look like it in this post but my in-laws are not total assholes to my daughter. They do not need to be entirely cut out of my daughters life, they just need to learn that her birthday is for her and not an excuse to complain about me or praise their other grand kid or refuse to eat anything I cook. Its not major life altering stuff they pull, but it's enough that my daughter feels like its just another day to them. I just want her to have a birthday without worrying about family drama.  Please don't think I'm saying it's okay that they do stupid crap every other day. Many arguments have been had about that. I just want one day that's just about my girl.",114,390,0.98
1170,Not the A-hole,"Before you start pointing fingers because of the title, I need to clarify some things first.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for almost two years now. From the start of our relationship, we agreed that either of us can have sex with someone else as long as we’re informed about it beforehand. We both agree that there is a distinct difference between a romantic relationship and a sexual one, and so long as we together are the only ones in a romantic relationship, we don’t care what the opposite person does with their body.

Fast forward to a couple days ago where my boyfriend tells me “I think I cheated on you”, and when I asked why he thought that, he said “You know Jake? Yeah, so he and I had sex last week” (not his real name, obviously).

I honestly thought how he worded that was really funny, and I told him I wasn’t mad as long as he told me beforehand next time. He agreed, and we’re completely fine.

Today, I went to my coworker ‘Nikki’ to tell her about the funny encounter (we tell each other a lot of things like this, so it’s not exactly weird). She was confused until I reminded her that we’re in an open relationship, and then agreed that it was pretty amusing.

My assistant manager, who we’ll call ‘Anna’, was not so amused after overhearing this conversation. She told me to break up with my boyfriend, and when I said that it was okay and explained the open relationship, she told me that he was an asshole for cheating and that I was an asshole for thinking that it was funny.

Obviously, I know I’m not an asshole for finding the encounter humorous, but I’m starting to feel like an asshole for bringing it up in the first place. I feel so bad for making anyone think that my boyfriend was a bad person.


Tl;dr Am I the asshole for painting my boyfriend out as a cheater to my coworker, and should I have kept it to myself?

Edit 1: This in no way justifies my case, and I know talking about sex isn’t the most appropriate thing to do at work, but I work away from any sort of customer or client, and you have to be over 18 in my department. Because of this, conversations between coworkers get a little risqué, and even my previous and current managers will talk about inappropriate topics. Even Anna (and especially Nikki) don’t bite their tongues when talking about sex. I know it doesn’t make what I said morally acceptable, but I wanted to share some light as to the environment I work in.",30,26,0.74
1171,Asshole,"When we first got divorced our son was 4. He was perfectly healthy and she got primary custody. I asked for a received every other weekend. The court ordered me to pay a set amount of child support a month. I pay it. She carries health insurance and pays for day care. I just pay the court ordered amount that lines up with my income. 

About a year ago he started having seizures. Some of them lasted a long time which led to some hospitalizations. That led to a host of appts at specialist and she took a leave from work to deal with it all. 

I work erratic hours and go to college so although I visited him at the hospital a few times.  I couldn’t make it to the appts. 

The medical bills came rolling in and she asked me to help. I don’t have any more money so I told her no. She asked me to watch him sometimes so she could go back to work and make up some hours so she could pay the bills. I told her to get a babysitter. She said she couldn’t afford one. I can’t see him during the week because of my school schedule and work schedule so I told her no. The court order says nothing about medical bills and me having to pay half. 

Now she wants to enroll him in some kind of summer camp for kids with epilepsy because she said sending him to a regular daycare is hard since they often don’t know how to deal with his seizures. She asked if I could at least help pay for some of it. Even a small portion. Again, I’ve no money so I said no. 

Now she wants to be in a medical trial for the seizures but the doctor won’t let her in unless he can meet with me but he can only meet with me during the week. They are claiming it is because there are overnights involved. I am busy then. I also think the study isn’t necessary. Medicine is controlling them mostly. 

I am poor college student. I just don’t have the money. She says I am an asshole for only paying the bare minimum and never helping out more. My argument is that I pay child support as ordered and I take my every other weekend. I do my part. I do what is required. I am not her partner anymore and I don’t think it is my job to help her out.

1174,Not the A-hole,"So I am currently on an overseas holiday. My parents installed a data plan with roaming on their phones and my sisters, but not mine. They didn’t tell me they didn’t on mine however, so I naturally assumed they had. When we arrived, I used my 4G for a little while, before turning off my mobile data. After that, I made about 1 call and used my 4G for probably less than two minutes. This equated to 0.35 Gs of data used, which in my plan costed 350 dollars.

Keep in mind my sister was using her data for pretty much the entire trip so far, texting and making calls too, and her cost is nowhere near as much as mine.

Now my parents are mad at me for costing so much money, but in my defence I didn’t know I had such a dumb plan as NOBODY told me they just didn’t bother installing roaming on my phone, and I only used 0.35 G which in my mind was barely anything.

1175,Not the A-hole,"Without going into too much detail I lent a friend of mine some money to help them out when they moved to my city when I got them a job. My friend at first was very open about paying me back and said whenever they got their first full paycheck they would pay me back. Well that full paycheck came and went and first it was sorry not this month, then it was “well how about I pay for your groceries for the month” only for them to back out and not even apologize, then it just turned to completely silence on their part, like it never happened. They’re always struggling with money and I didn’t say anything because I thought I would be pushing things and at first I kept getting reassurances at first until it finally stopped.

What really made me reconsider things is that this person decided to put down money for not one, but two tattoos. These tattoos are not exactly expensive but aren’t cheap either. They were telling me that the cost was somewhere around $300. It made me realize that’s part of what they own me, and despite them saying they don’t have any money, somehow they now have money for tattoos. On top of that they want to take a trip during the summer, which will easily run five to six hundred dollars. They’re more focused on these things than they are paying me back, if they even intend to still do that. 

I asked for advice from some of my not mutual friends that don’t know my friend if I should confront this person. One friend said though, if you confront them you’re going to look like the bad guy cause you’re taking away their money to do things like tattoos and going on vacation. Another said this person had no intentions of paying me back and is just using me, so why deal with it. One thing they all have in common is they think I should drop this friend as soon as I get the chance, one even saying I should try to get them fired as payback. 

I’m worried about confronting this person since because they have a very hot/cold attitude that turns very fast when they get angry. I have seen people be on the receiving end of it and have been on the receiving end as well. It’s not good and is only compounded more because they know I’m not someone who argues. I’ve learned the hard way though not to let people borrow money from me anymore. It was a hard way to learn it but now I know. 

TL:DR- Am I the asshole for wanting to get paid back since this person has made everything else but paying me back priority? ",26,26,0.88
1176,Asshole,"My girlfriend has been a stay at home mom to our baby for the past 8 months so she was handling most of the cooking/ cleaning/ shopping/ other household stuff. Now she’s going back to work so she asked me to take over some things. That’s fine, but I’ve never really done stuff like that so I don’t know how. I asked her to teach me how to do any things she wants me to do. She says she’s “not my mother” but I kind of feel like her options here are show me or do it herself? So, AITA for needing a little help? 

EDIT:
Thanks for the feedback everyone. I can see how it was unfair of me to ask her to add another thing to her already busy schedule. I told her I would try to learn things on my own and just consult her if I have a specific question about how she usually does things. ",1011,2073,0.94

1178,,"I have a small self-run business that I started when I was 12, and I've purchased some fairly expensive items to keep it running. My mom and dad supported my business because my mom didnt want me to leave home to work, and so helped pay for electricity and a couple other things. 
I'm now getting close to finishing high school, and am thinking about selling some of the things I bought for my business, since they will be of no use to me when I leave, and I could use the money. I mentioned to my mom that I MIGHT be selling one of the more expensive items for a couple hundred, but that I wasnt sure yet. She then said she might buy it, because she would be able to use it. I then did some research, and found out that most of the same item were actually selling used for over $600, without the accessories that I would include. I then told her that I did not think I would be able to sell the item to her, because I did some research, and would like to try and get $500 for it. The item I have is appropriately sized for a business, and she could easily get a smaller new one for under $200. I didn't think this would be an issue, but she then refused to speak to me for the rest of the day and glared at me any time I went near her. Then today she told me that she was shocked I had not offered to give her the item as a gift, because she had always supported my business and had helped pay for some things for it. She was also incensed that I had raised the price when I had agreed to sell it to her. I was a bit confused, as I did not recall ever agreeing to sell it to her, and as to why I would give her the item that I paid over $900 for. She then claimed I knew how much it meant to her, and that I was putting a price on my love for her (what??), and that she would have given the item to her parents as a gift. I told her she could get a smaller version for cheaper that would work just as well, but she just left the room.

1180,Not the A-hole,"okay so I’ve (28/M) been with my GF (25/F) for nearly 4 years. We’re currently on holiday and last night we went out for a couple drinks and she was quite drunk. We had a conversation of what it’s gonna be like when we get married ( we both know it’s not for a good few years yet), it was nice discussing what we both wanted and for the most part I just agreed with her wishes and dream. It was sweet but all hypothetical. Anyway, at one point she said she wants me to give up smoking before we get married, I agreed because I want to too and said I’d make a deal with her that I will give up this year after my birthday in May and if I didn’t I had to buy her some Jimmy Chu’s and if I did I have to spend and extra £1k on the engagement ring.

Now I want to point out that she’s not normally so money driven. Like most girls her age she likes expensive designer things but is definitely not with me for money as I have none. We split bills all the time and tbh as she doesn’t have to pay rent she treats me to small things more often than I treat her. 

When I’ve personally thought about weddings I just think it’s a colossal waste of money. If it were entirely up to me it would be a very small affair with only close family and friends in a modest back garden setting with modest wedding stuff. With all the money saved I’d rather spend more on a lovely honeymoon for my bride and I instead of paying for an expensive meal for random family members and friends I barely know. Obviously, it’s not all up to me and I would want her to be happy and get what she wants.. within reason. 

When I said I would only spend 1.5k on a ring she got very huffy and told me she’d say No if she didn’t get the ring she wanted. I think marriage should be about love and it shouldn’t matter what ring you get, she should either be happy that I’m asking to spend my life with her or not want to be with me anyway. She stopped talking to me last night and this morning she’s saying it was drunken argument and we should forget it but she stands by everything she said last night.

I feel quite hurt by it and it’s not something that can be swept under the rug as it’s our future. It’s changed my opinion of her and I can’t just stop thinking about it. I love her to death and never felt this way about anyone, we’ve had four lovely years but I’m sure this argument will keep tearing its ugly head. Am I being an arsehole? 

Edit: really sorry I haven’t been able to get back to anyone as I’m still on holiday with her this is the first chance I’ve had to get back on reddit. So we spoke again and she apologised and knows she’s in the wrong. She still lives with her affluent parents so doesn’t have a proper concept of what it’s like to have to pay bills, rent, food, saving ..etc and therefore she’s prone to turn a bit bratty when it comes to me being financially sensible. The last thing she said about it is she knows she lives in a dream world and when I bring her back to reality it dents her ego and she lashes out (especially with alcohol involved). She’s completely taken back what she said and had apologised profusely (even sneaking off and buying me 3 scoops of gelato and some beer). We agreed that when the time comes we will agree a budget that is suitable for me and if she wants something extra special that she would contribute the rest. 

Thank you all so much for all your reassurance and good advice, most of you said exactly what I’ve been thinking. I’m sorry again I haven’t had time to reply to you all individually but I think it’s safe to say (even the GF agrees) that on this occasion I was not the a-hole. ",222,317,0.94

Long story short, my step-dad of 25 years cheated on and left my mom last year. It was UNEXPECTED .... totally blindsided everyone. I have admired and gotten along with him my whole life, so that was really hard for me. 

My mom is doing ok, she is a strong woman. She doesn't mind me still having a relationship with him. She has a boyfriend now and has moved on. 

My husband on the other hand does mind. We both loved my step-dad and he was very involved in our lives. But my husband basically excommunicated him the moment he found out. That's his choice and I respect it. He does not like the fact that I still talk to my step-dad though. He views it as insensitive to my mom. Cheating is the worst thing you can do in his mind, and me still talking to him makes it ok. 

It's not like I have 100% forgiven him, and I am still royally pissed and our relationship is strained .... But I don't see why I have to loose my father for him ending a relationship with my mom. Idk

AITA?

Edit for clarification: my husband is not stopping me for doing anything, we just have talked about it several times because he is really uncomfortable with the situation. It just always ends with him thinking I am asshole-ish and agreeing to disagree. I think part of it is that his parents have always been together, and between all my parents and step-parents I have been through 5 divorces. Fucked up, I know, but am kinda use to it by now.

He is highly protective of my mom. I think he sees her as more his mom than his actual mom.

1188,Not the A-hole,"So it was my girlfriends birthday, and her friends planned a dinner at a pretty cheap restaurant, like $6-15 dollars per meal. We made a group chat that included my girlfriend but also another that was without her so we could discuse gifts etc.

There were 8 people total who were gonna go, but 1 of them is extraordinarily cheap. She is in a bad financial situation at the moment, which we all as a group completely understand so we attempt to do cheap restaurants or other activities because she’s really really focused on the cost when we go out.

For example, in the group chat without my girlfriend, the convo went like this:

Friend 1: Let’s split a small gift like $4 each, what do you guys think?

Friend 2: Yeah I’m down.

Cheap friend: No 😪

Friend 1: yeah she’s so cheap sorry.

Friend 2: Anyone else?

Me: I’ll buy the gift you can pitch for a balloon cause she likes that.

Cheap friend: CHEAP BALLOON.

Friend 2: okay I’ll make sure it’s cheap.

Me: I can pay for your part (cheap friend) it’s no problem.

(End of Convo)

She then didn’t reply, but I paid for that which she let me, she ordered the smallest cheapest thing which was $5 and then said I’m not gonna eat dessert because it’s expensive, and we all said oh okay, because I was gonna pay for it all anyway.

I didn’t tell her that though, I just let her believe she was gonna pay her part so I didn’t tell her further that she could eat the dessert even though I offered originally.

My girlfriend was very upset because she does a lot of errands for her, and feels it’s like a waste of gas and time now since she isn’t worth $4 for a gift. I told her which I feel bad about but I think she should know if a close friend is being kinda mean in my opinion.

I understand she’s in a bad financial place, but I believe you can still be chill and like explain sorry guys I wish I could but I can’t. Because I offer to pay which I understand she feels bad for but we want her to come.

1189,Asshole,"Some background...

I met my(28F) ex-FWB(36M) about 2 years ago when I was in an open relationship and well lets be honest, he was stepping out on his own relationship. Long story short we fell in love and I thought we were going to have a relationship. We did not. I got over it and met my current SO who I could not be more happier with.

Even though we didn't work out, we still stayed friends ( he consider's me one of his closest if not best friend). However what he considers ""friends"" and what I consider ""friends"" are two different things. For him our ""friendship"" includes heavy flirting, reminiscing about past sexual experiences we had in graphic detail and hinting, covertly and overtly, about picking up where we ended. Most of our talk is me steering him away from these  topics and trying to have a normal conversation that isn't NSFW or something I'd be ashamed to have my current SO listen in on. But he still continues and uses his charisma and charm to breeze past my boundaries.

&#x200B;

Current times...

My former ex-FWB is , with his GF, coming back to CA  to visit his GF family ( he moved to SC about 6 mos ago) and is heavily insinuating that he wants to have sex with me when he gets some free time and  while my SO is at work. I  oscillate between  jokingly laughing off this talk or  saying no, not happening but he keeps pushing the issue, saying it will happen since he ""knows the effect he has on me"". I finally get super fed up and vehemently tell him I am under no circumstances cheating on my SO and at best I will have lunch with him. To which we have the following conversation 

""Well, I guess I'll just have to take it then.""

""What do you mean? Take it?""

""Well, it's obvious you are putting up a fight because you don't want to feel guilty, so I'll just take it. This way you can just say you had no choice, thereby feeling less guilty.""

""You mean you are going force me to have sex with you??""

""Not really since we both know it won't be force once we get into it but just a way to get things started. This way you can live with the secret so to speak.""

We had more conversation after that but I can't remember most of it clearly but the gist was he's not above using force to get over my fake resistance.

&#x200B;

I told my best friend about the convo and she immediately said block him and practically did it for me. However, I'm feeling like maybe I should have let him know why instead of just ghosting/blocking him, especially since he considers me a close friend.

&#x200B;

AITA for blocking him after that phone conversation and not telling him? 

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: Ex-FWB wants to have sex with me when he gets to town and is willing to ""force me"" to get it, blocked him after what he said without telling him why. AITA?

Edit: So I should mention that all of our conversations took place on the phone. He’s not one for texting. Also yes I admit I was the asshole for continuing to take his phone calls when he ignored my boundaries. As for telling his GF, I don’t know if I should. I don’t have proof he threatened to “force” me since it was over the phone. Besides I just want to fully cut off all contact and let her find out on her own.",38,60,0.87

I am very proud of him and I've been nothing but supportive, but honestly I just feel like the worst girlfriend for being attracted to him less. I've always liked chubbier men, I like the whole ""dad bod"" thing lol, but my boyfriend wasn't happy with himself so I encouraged him to maybe lose some weight if that would help him. It honestly is helping, he seems much more content with himself and life, the only issue is I just don't want to have sex every single day like I used to. I know I'm a massive dickhead and a bit weird for being like this, but I can't help it.

1191,No A-holes here,"Throwaway, I’m on mobile, so sorry for formatting. I’m writing this from the airplane, seeing as this just happened a few minutes ago. 

My boyfriend and I are on a flight direct from California to Europe. It’s 10 hours... we left at 6pm Monday and are arriving at 12pm Tuesday in Europe. So a lot of our fellow passengers are taking advantage of this to catch some sleep. 

Bf and I are in window and middle seats, respectively. In the aisle there is (or was) a guy, probably in his 30’s. Pretty nice guy, was chatting with us before takeoff, etc. 

The entire flight, bf and I have been using the built-in entertainment systems provided by the airline to watch movies, track the flight, etc. since we aren’t tired and are terribly bored. Most other people have their screens off and are sleeping, but a few others are doing the same as us. 

About an hour ago, I noticed the guy next to me (aisle guy) was shifting, trying to find comfortable sleeping positions, alternative between putting a blanket over his head and taking it off. I didn’t think much of it, because I’ve done that too, and it’s never been because of light disturbance. I figured he was just trying to find a comfy sleeping position. 

So finally, about 5.5 hrs into the 10hr flight (12am California time, 8am Europe time) he gets up, finds a flight attendant, and moves. He wasn’t rude about it - when he came to get his stuff he said “no offense, I’m just switching seats because of the screens”. Apparently our screens were bothering him and he couldn’t sleep. 

The fact that that might have been an issue honestly never even crossed my mind, which makes me feel a bit asshole-ish. But at the same time I feel like it would have been unreasonable for us to not use our screens when we aren’t tired and can’t sleep and have nothing else to do. He didn’t ask us to turn them off, but I still feel like a dick for not even noticing and thus forcing him to move.

1193,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because a few people know this story so I’d like to keep it away from my main.

This happened a few years ago but I still feel bad about it and get mixed responses when I bring it up, so here goes.

My parents split when I was 3 so I was raised by a single mother most of my life. When I was a teenager, she came out to me as a lesbian (nbd, as soon as I learnt what a “stereotypical lesbian” looked like as a kid, I remember thinking, “huh, like my mum.” so I kinda guessed).

She never really dated though, just a few people here and then. When I was 23, she got into her first long term relationship since my father. The woman was really nice and they got on really well, no issue with her whatsoever.

One night they came home drunk at about 1am from a date. Now, my mother rarely gets drunk. I’ve seen her drunk about twice in my life and we go out drinking together quite a bit. But she was very drunk, very loud and I could hear her laughter 3 floors up.

I had to get up at 6am for work, so I rolled over hoping they’d shut up and go to bed soon. They did. I’m almost falling back to sleep when I hear moaning. Loud moaning. My mum and her girlfriend have very different voices so I can just instinctively tell that it’s her and not the girlfriend. I try to put a pillow over my head and ignore it, I try to hum to myself, I can’t wear earplugs because I’ll miss my alarms. It’s not so loud it would be keeping me awake but it’s the nature of the sound that’s reverberating through my skull and preventing me from sleeping.

It’s about 2am now and it’s not stopping. I really need sleep and I feel kind of insane from listening to this for nearly an hour. I decide I have to stop it, so I call the house phone which is next to her bed. I hear silence for a few seconds while it rings, then she answers very quietly with “Hello?” and I just say, “Sorry, I really need to sleep, I have work in the morning.” She says sorry and I hang up. Dead silence. I fall asleep.

I don’t see the girlfriend again. At all. My mother and I never mention it. Two months later, they break up. A year or so passes and we’re talking about the girlfriend and my mum makes a comment about how “she was always embarrassed to come over again after that night” and I feel awful.

I just wanted to sleep without hearing my mother’s sex noises. I tried to think of the least invasive way to do it, hoping she could’ve made an excuse or something instead of telling her it was me hearing them, but I guess she didn’t. And she hasn’t had a long term relationship since.

I came back from work and she told me what happened... I said ""I will talk to him about it."" but when I went to his room I just told him ""Don't worry about it.""

1201,Not the A-hole,"Backstory first: I met a group of 5 or 6 people a couple years ago. multiple serious relationships in this group.  
As I got to know them better, I eventually found interest in one of the girls in a relationship. I did nothing about it. The chemistry between us was great though, better than anyone else's in the group. The closer I got to her, the less i cared about the fact that she had a boyfriend. Him and I were not close at all, barely talked to each other. He was concerned with how close me and her were, friends informed me.

  
Fast forward a couple months after meeting them, I can start to tell that her boyfriend is kinda a shithead. I bring it up to multiple people in the group. They all tell me to just be cool, ""he isn't all that bad"". The more that I find out about their relationship, usually through friends in the group, the more inclined I am to tell this girl how I feel. So eventually one night, I do. She feels the same way. We talk about her leaving him and trying us, but that ended up going nowhere. I drop it all, knowing this could cause harm to our friend group.

A month passes, and she was giving me a ride home from a party at a friends house. Once we get to my house, she tells me she wants me. She says shes been thinking about ""it"" all weekend. I tell her i'm not doing anything with her if she is still with her boyfriend. She explains that its not that easy, and we talk for close to an hour. This ends up with us talking in circles, she leaves and i figure that's the end of the night. A hour or two later, i hear my doorbell. Its her. She tells me she did it, she broke up with him. So I let her in.

Laying in bed afterwards she confesses she lied. That she didn't break it off. At that point i'm surprised, but not mad at her. We talk it through, how i wont tell anyone what happened and neither will she.  


Today, months after we hooked up, the group is in a uproar. They found out that her boyfriend cheated on her. Now everyone thinks hes an asshole, they kick him out of the group. They all start ripping him apart, and pretty much shit on his life. All the meanwhile i'm sitting there knowing what she did first. 

AITA for pursing anything with her to begin with? Is she the asshole for playing innocent? Should i keep what her and I did a secret? Are they assholes for jumping ship on him, after defending him to my criticisms?

1202,Not the A-hole,"Alright I know everyone is going to be like “you can’t do that! Blah blah blah it’s illegal to ask if it’s a real service dog or not and blah blah blah you don’t know if they have a disability or not how awful of you blah blah blah”  I know the rules but I also know real service dogs when I see them and I strongly believe this one isn’t. 

   A short back story, I live in an apartment complex on a military base. I recently got a puppy and since I don’t have a yard I take him out of the building to do his business. There’s other dogs in the building and most of them do the same thing so all the pet owners talk to each other while our dogs go potty. 
 One lady I talked to was new and had a large dog she would take outside and I would talk to her to make her feel welcome. Our apartment complex only allows pets on the first or second floor. She asked which floor I lived on and I said the second and she said she lived on the fourth.   


 I told her dogs weren’t allowed on the fourth floor   (I have no idea why she wouldn’t know this since you have to sign a contract about it and know all the rules since the base is really strict about stuff like this. She also got him after they moved in to the building) She said she didn’t know that and thanked me. I didn’t think too much about it,I could care less honestly so I let it be. A few weeks later the same lady and her dog are walking around and I noticed he has a vest on. A service dog vest. I was like “maybe she got him trained because he was a handful before” I walked by her to get into the building with my puppy and the dog lunged, growled, and  barked at me and my puppy. It scared me because service dogs aren’t supposed to be like that. The same incident happened on the stair way when I was trying to go down and she was trying to go up. Her dog went bonkers and dragged her to my dog and tried to jump on me when I picked up my puppy. 



  Idk if he’s aggressive or just really playful but he’s a little concerning to the other dog owners or people with kids because he’s so unpredictable. I don’t want to be “that guy” or anything but that’s not cool that she’s most likely lying about it being a service dog and putting everyone else at risk. My puppy is now scared of other dogs because of these incidents. I’m fine with just minding my own business about it but at the same time she’s making other real service dogs look bad as well. I understand she probably did it to keep her dog but there’s other ways, the base is understanding and would most likely move her to a house or she could live off base if she wanted to.

1205,Asshole,"Hello guys, new account because I never had a reason to make an account or post anything until now.

So Kylie is my best friend. She's 24, I'm 23. She's been with Avery for 2 years now. They moved SUPER fast. They met on Tinder, talked for about a month before meeting in person, went on 5 dates over 5 days. By the 6th day, they were a couple. They exchanged ""I love you"" in less than a month. They met each other's families by the 2nd week and their families met each other by their 2nd month. They moved in with each other after only a year.

They both make decent money, don't get me wrong. She is an interior designer and he is a pharmacy owner. That's not why I'm concerned. I think he has been taking advantage of her. Here is why:

\- They have been looking at houses together for a while. Kylie is going to design and furnish the house. Avery does not seem to be involved in the design process and it does not seem like he is going to pay Kylie or pay for the furniture.

\- When they moved in together, Avery started using Kylie's car to get to work a lot. This meant Kylie had to work from home. He has his own car. Kylie's is newer, so I think he just likes using hers because it was newer and fancier than his. 

\-  She bought a new iMac and Macbook to use for work at home and when travelling. He borrows her Macbook when he goes to work and she stays home. But he has the money to buy his own laptop. He just loves to use her stuff and not have to buy his own.

\- Kylie cleans way more than Avery. He will leave dishes in the sink overnight, she will wash them right away. He is just using her so he does not have to do chores.

Anyway, Kylie and Avery went on a trip recently. They were gone for 10 days. About 4 days in, she sent me a photo of a ring on her finger. I didn't reply because I knew if I did it wouldn't be nice. They got back earlier today. Kylie came into my work waving her hand at me to show me the ring. She asked if I saw her texts and why I didn't reply to her. I said I didn't know what to say. She pestered me until it lead to me saying that I think she moved way too fast with Avery. He is using her and she is blind to it. I told her that I always bit my tongue throughout their relationship because I expected them to break up eventually, but the fact that they're engaged is a huge red flag.

We got in a huge fight. She said she couldn't believe how unsupportive I was being, but I told her she's the one who asked to know what I thought. As much as I love her I can't go to the eventual wedding because I don't want to support her unhealthy relationship. She texted me saying that if I really believed everything I said, I was ""showing my true colors"" and she didn't want me at the wedding anyway. She thinks I'm in the wrong. I feel bad for fighting with her, but I think it was the right thing to tell her I don't support her relationship.

1207,Not the A-hole,"So I run a pretty successful tech company, and am planning on retiring soon. My younger sister [44F], let's call her Julie, has been hinting for a while she wants to be CEO. But quite honestly, I don't think it's a good idea. 

So, the thing I always make a distinction between is the role of an entrepreneur vs the role of a businessman. My sister and I, if I do say so myself, are good entrepreneurs. We're good at spotting innovations, we're good programmers, and we're good at working with a small team to grow the company as far as you can. 

Problem is, Julie is stuck in the entrepreneurial stage. Once your business is decently large, a lot of things change: it becomes less about tech and innovation (at least, hands-on tech and innovation that you personally take part in by cranking out code) and more about management and people skills. The larger it gets, the better of an organizer you need to be. You get the idea. And Julie, although I'll admit is a veritable tech genius, has no organizational or people skills. I've adapted to the businessman role better than she has, but admittedly even I haven't done the best job. Because we both are entrepreneurs at heart, not businessmen. And I'm retiring now, and I need someone to take over the company. Julie obviously wants it, but I mentioned her obvious problems she'll face in the role.

Enter my son, Norman. Norman is basically the closest thing to a natural-born businessman I've met. He's a natural leader, has a natural knack for organizing and dividing work that neither of us do. Plus, since he's gotten into stock trading, I've realized he knows the psychology of people: what innovations are well-recieved, why? What aren't, why? And plus, he's pretty charismatic and disciplined to boot. And although he's not that interested in programming and tech in and of itself, he knows Python and Java and is technically literate. All of these traits are what I'm looking for in a businessman to lead the company. 

But when I told Julie that (after a few years experience), I'm installing him as CEO. She got angry at this and said I was ungrateful for her help. While I can see where she's coming from, I think I'm plenty greatful: she's CTO, she holds the most stock options besides me, etc. And that aside, I think she's being kind of selfish here: she knows she hates managing people and yet still wants to be CEO, even though she knows that's a vital part of management.

1208,Not the A-hole,"Mobile post, formatting, blah blah blah.

Backstory: I’m currently student teaching high school English and have had issues with my mentor teacher all semester. She sits in the back of the class and texts or distracts kids whenever I try to teach, which undermines me and makes me look like the bad guy when I attempt to get on task. I’ve talked to her and it got better for awhile. She’s awesome at building relationships with students, but it often crosses the boundary of “friendly vs. friend” and disrupts my class. 

Now to the situation.

Early in the day, my mentor had the idea to play a prank on our last class of the day by pretending they had an essay due. I told her that I didn’t want to, but that she could. I hate April Fool’s day, but I’m not about to rain on anyone’s parade. She decided to do it. 

Last period comes and her prank is funny and easygoing, the kids laugh, I’m finishing some work while it happens, all is well.

I’m then attempting to start the lesson when two girls - who have a long history of fighting - start shouting and squaring up in the back of my class. My teacher runs out saying she’s getting admin, and I try to keep everyone’s attention off the girls. 

She re-enters with a male teacher and they take one of the girls outside. Again, I attempt to start my lesson and the class follows.

As we’re getting into our reading, my mentor bursts through the door and starts screaming at my class, “SHE IS OUT THERE BAWLING. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? I NEED ANSWERS, NOW. KATIE (the other girl), WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?”

I felt completely embarrassed for my mentor, as I felt like this outburst was completely unprofessional. I finally snap and say, “If you need to have that conversation, take her outside. You need to get out. We’re trying to work.” and my mentor takes her outside.

We again try to get on task.

My mentor then comes in with the girls about ten minutes later and the girls say “It was a prank.”

Me: “Okay”

I keep teaching.

The girls: “That’s it?”

Me: “We’ve already wasted over half our class on pranks. I’m not interested in wasting anymore.”

My mentor comes up to me in the English office after class, laughing, and I say “Did you help them plan that?”

Mentor: “No, but I was told to play along.”

Me: “Yeah, well, you’re the teacher. You’re the adult. You should’ve shut it down. I’m so angry that I’m ready to walk out. That was completely disruptive and disrespectful. How was I supposed to know what that was?” 

My mentor got sheepish and apologized, saying that it wasn’t her attention to disrupt things and make me uncomfortable. I can’t help but feel like a giant asshole, but I felt completely helpless. So Reddit, AITA for being so sensitive? ",20,84,0.94
1209,Not enough info,"So, my husband thinks I'm an asshole, because he's the guy's supervisor. I reported the guy to management because my husband wasn't going to say anything. 

We work in a warehouse. Employee parking is on either side of the warehouse, both blocked off by rolling gates that you need a badge to open. I was going in, and this woman came in behind me. I used to do the same thing before I worked here, bringing my husband lunch every day. Security knew me before I got hired. 

The woman had kids in her car, I figured she was dropping lunch off for her husband and would leave. But then she got the kids out of the car to sit at our picnic area. 

This is where the problem comes in: we RARELY have small children on any part of the property, but NEVER in the employee parking areas, if only because it's not safe.  First, no one is looking for small children in the parking lot, and the guys were leaving for lunch. We still have tractor trailers coming and going through the parking lot at odd times, and occasionally the guys come out in forklifts. It is not safe for children. The liability issue is huge. 

So, I reported it to management. There are a lot of safety concerns where we work, we have accidents almost weekly, common sense would be to not have kids in work areas. I consider the parking lot a work area because we still have work access even in the parking lot. But again, my husband says I'm an asshole for reporting it. Am I?

Edit: I spoke to management. The guy isn't getting into trouble. Like many of you, he said we've had employees bring kids into the warehouse before, not just the parking lot. He said there's no policy against it, and it's fine. Which, if he says it's been okayed, I can't have a problem with it. 

I do still think it's a safety issue, but if it's been condoned by the company, I can't protest. 

I think it's pretty split between whether I am or am not an asshole. I guess it depends on your perspective. I didn't want the employee to get in trouble, but I didn't want to tell him not to do something, considering it's a gray area. My company isn't one to up and fire an employee for any reason, so he was in no danger, maybe just a conversation with his manager about what to do. I don't think what I did was wrong because I have no interest in seeing a kid get injured, and I'd rather be safe than sorry. 

For context, the picnic area is in the parking lot, cars are parked right next to it, it's not a permanent structure. ",68,54,0.85

1211,Not the A-hole,"Today, I had a random man show up at my apartment asking for money after mistakenly opening the door thinking it was the matienance man. He looked inside the apartment and comment on our nice decorations. I gave him some change and sent him on his way. 

I'm a young woman and my roommate is often off working 90% of the day, working 3 jobs. She sometimes works until 2am in the morning at one of her jobs. She's my only roommate, so needless to say, after opening the door to a random man begging for money, I felt a bit sketched out. 

While it could be that he needed money, I feel like it's a bit strange that he would knock on random doors asking for money. I want to trust people, but being alone in the apartment most of the day I feel like I need to be cautious of people's intentions. 

Anyways, my roommate got home at 8 while I was hanging out in the living room when I realized I'd forgotten to unbolt the deadbolt. I dashed to the door to unlatch it before she finished unlocking the door, but I was too late and she tried to open the door before I could unlatch it. 

I quickly unlatched it and she began berating me about how she hates the deadbolt and that I should never use it because what if I wasn't home or I fell asleep, etc etc. (Which the first one makes 0 sense because you can't lock the deadbolt from the outside???)

 I explained the situation to her and she got even more angry, telling me that I was overreacting and that nothing was going to happen. I just dropped it after that because I didn't have the energy to argue and had a lot of work to finish, but I'm still somewhat annoyed

I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The ""safe word"" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.

I told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot.

1213,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at the end.

GF and are currently renting out an apartment with my dog from my aunt. She's grad student and works part-time and I work full-time usually from home. The apartment is actually an extension of aunt's house but we have our own bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. It's an excellent spot for each of us - a short drive to downtown as well as a short bike ride to campus and GF's place of work (GF doesn't drive so she bikes or takes the bus). My aunt’s been very generous and let's us rent out the place at a fraction of the cost that she regularly would. I also have a Great Dane. She is a bit smaller than the average Great Dane, but still big as dogs go and pretty energetic. She's very attached to me as Great Danes are, and enjoys our current living place - there is a large yard for her to run around.

My aunt decided she wants the dog out and said that we get rid of the dog in 30 days or find another place. Aunt didn't mind the dog at first, but she's started to get annoyed with them since she doesn't like having it around the house. I've already decided I'm not giving up this dog. I've had her for 5 years and she's honestly helped me get through a lot of shit. Not to mention the dog is very attached to me and I'm afraid what will happen to her if I were to just leave her. I've been looking into other living arrangements, but rent would triple in price compared to what we pay now. It wouldn't be unlivable, but we definitely wouldn't be able to save as money as we have been, and we'll be on a tighter budget. GF cannot understand why I would give up this place, doesn't think it's worth it and pretty pissed at me. Apparently, her sister offered to take the dog in, but her sister lives on a ranch almost 3 hours away so it wouldn't be very convenient for us to visit. GF’s only option is to choose another place with me and splitting rent.

I tried to explain it won’t be like we'd be out on the street; we'd just have less money to do fun things and less in savings. I'd even drive her around to her work and classes whenever she needed. said I was wrong for choosing the dog over what's best for us, that we could really need the money we're saving now in the future and sending the dog to her sister's is the best deal. I maintained that the dog is important to me and I can't just get rid of it like that. She said I was an asshole for not taking her compromise.

So AITA for choosing to live with my dog over continuing to rent this very affordable and convenient location for my girlfriend?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I are renting a very convenient and cheap place from my aunt. Aunt suddenly decides she wants my dog out but I'm unwilling to let the dog go so we'll have to move somewhere less convenient and much more expensive putting us on a tighter budget. GF says it's a terrible idea and thinks I'm an asshole for considering my dog over our future. AITA?",53,44,0.88
1214,Asshole,"Here is some background:

My (18f) best friend (18f) was born in Korea but was adopted by white parents as an infant. She does not speak Korean or know anything about the culture/traditions. (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that or that it makes her any less Korean.) She makes an obvious effort to separate herself from other Asian people in our school and constantly makes fun of stereotypically Asian things (eg. anime, k-pop, eating rice, getting good grades, etc.). If anyone calls her out on this she gets defensive and says she ""can't be racist towards her own race"". HOWEVER, her ""jokes"" are never about/toward herself (self-deprecating) but instead aimed at others (borderline bullying). She acts like she is above other Asian people because she has white parents.

I want to make it clear that I do not think my friend is truly racist or a bad person. I have always chalked this behavior up as her being deeply insecure about her race/adoption. I have never confronted her about this (maybe I should, but I feel as though she would just get defensive), but whenever she makes rude comments I try to counteract them without being belligerent (eg. ""Her eyes are so squinty"" ""I think her eyes are really pretty"").

Now, onto the topic in the title. My friend recently told me that she applied for scholarship/grant money intended for students from Asian backgrounds. I feel like it's shitty to reject and ridicule a culture only to later use it for your benefit--even if that culture happens to be your own. I tried expressing this to her in the nicest way possible, but she called me racist and said that I had no right to tell her what she could or could not do in regards to her race. Is she right?

1217,Asshole,"Ok so I am Indian. One of my close friends, Jenn (we met in college) is getting married. She was born in India but was adopted when she was 2 years old to a white family. She wasn't really raised in Indian culture and (according to her) didn't grow up around a lot of Indians and has only been to India once since being adopted. She was raised Christian but is not really religious. Apparently growing up her parents tried to give her her Indian food and celebrated a few Indian/Hindu holidays to try and connect her with Indian culture but theY were all very surface level and from a white perspective. .

&#x200B;

The guy she is getting married to is not Indian. He is half black half white. They are both kind of creative, artsy, quirky types. Jenn has decided that she wants to incorporate many Indian Hindu style elements to her wedding. Now Jenn is a sweet girl but she honestly doesn't know much about Indian culture. Everything she is doing is based on research off the internet and since I am her closest Indian friends she keeps on asking me questions about Indian weddings and traditions, where to get the best Indian clothing, etc. It's honestly rubbed me the wrong way. She is literally picking out parts on Indian/Hindu culture that she likes and incorporating it into the wedding and then if she thinks something is weird she doesn't include it. She is also including all these spiritual Hindu aspects that she doesn't really understand because She thinks they are ""cool"" . It's like a big quirky art project to her.

&#x200B;

So I decided to tell her that I honestly don't think she shouldn't have an Indian wedding because she doesn't understand it. I was just being honest because it came across as tacky to me. The wedding is still in the planning stages anyway beside the venue and date  so I thought it was best to tell her earlier. However, she then broke down and started to play the victim and said I didn't know what it was like to be adopted and she wanted to feel connection to Indian culture. She then said she didn't want be to be her bridesmaid anymore and is now ignoring my texts.

&#x200B;

AITA here? Honestly I just thought the whole thing was messy. If it was just wearing a Lehenga (dress) and sari it would be fine but she is incorporating so many Indian elements to the wedding that she doesn't understand at all that I felt I had to say something.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok I do think I'll try and talk to her to help educate her more- but I do want people to know an indian wedding isn't just wearing a red dress and sari, henna, having bright colors and playing indian music. If she just wanted to do that I would have no issue. Indian Hindu weddings have many, many components that all have symbolic and spiritual reasoning behind them. Most indian weddings are like a week long! She is doing research and then asking me to further explain all of the components since since the internet doesn't actually provide great information on all of this and then she's picking and choosing which parts to include based on what fits some ""aesthetic"" she has in her head.

1218,Asshole,"Hiya, assholes -- I'm having a conundrum and would appreciate a reality check re: whether I'm in the wrong here. Tl;dr at the bottom.

So: my twin brother [21M], David, has been using Grindr to hook up with guys, for about a year. He's unfortunately had bad experiences -- not anything concerning, more stuff that bruised his pride. This changed six months ago when he told me about his new guy, Greg. Greg, according to David, is great! Greg lives close by and takes David out on real dates! And...Greg is also a 40-year-old. Who is married.

This, of course, begat a lot of questions, namely: do Greg and his wife have an open relationship? (David said he wasn't sure, which I took to mean ""no, Greg's wife has no idea."") Are you planning on continuing to see Greg? (Yes, ""although we both know it's not going to last forever."") And my brother asked me not to tell either of our parents, especially not our dad.

The thing is, David and Greg's ""I swear this isn't long-term""...is becoming long-term. I've felt this is not a good idea, bc a) it is shady when a 40-year-old man wants to date a man half his age, and b) I'm morally opposed to cheating. The last conversation I had with David was 2 weeks ago. I asked if he was still seeing Greg and if he had romantic feelings for Greg, and when David replied yes to both, I couldn't take it anymore. I told David that I thought this was a bad idea, that he was hurting someone (Greg's wife), that it was shady, and so on. David insisted that ""age is just a number"" (no, really), and that he and Greg will keep seeing each other. He was also very condescending about how he 100% knew what he was doing.

I got to my dad's house, pissed, and my dad asked why. I told him everything above, partly bc I was pissed and bc I needed advice. My dad took it calmly (basically ""this is a bad choice David is making, but he's an adult"") until I told him that David had once let Greg into dad's house. Dad flipped out. He calls David and tears him one for ""violating the privacy of *my* house w/o telling me"". David apologized and was genuinely remorseful. Next day, David asked me how much I told our dad. I lied and said I only mentioned David had brought a hookup by once. In reality, I had given dad all of the info, including the fact that Greg lives in our dad's development. And recently, dad told me he's learned what house Greg lives in (he saw my brother's car parked in a different spot than normal, and when asked, David made up some weak excuse). Dad has also informed me that he's decided it shouldn't go on; he plans to tape a notice to Greg's door saying  ""Married people shouldn't cheat on their spouses."" In dad's mind, either Greg's wife will find out or Greg will get paranoid and stop seeing David. 

Tl;dr: brother is seeing a married man twice his age, told me not to tell our dad, but I did, and now my dad is scheming to get them to stop seeing each other. AITA for lying to my brother, and WIBTA for letting my dad do this?",89,38,0.87

Rewind about 2 months ago, I had to use the washroom, but she had beat me to it (we have 1 washroom in our office),   she was in there for about a half hour.  By the time I got to go in there, I was pretty desperate.  so I close the door, and sit down, see a spec in my peripherals.   THERE IS A BLOB OF POO ON THE WALL!  After thinking about it,  a small timid girl or a small town construction worker coming out of there, who would anyone believe?  I sucked it up and went to get TP to clean it off the wall, surprise, no TP on the holder, so i get a new roll, use half of it to clean it up.  I then go to wash my hands and throw out the paper towel, what do you know! Crap covered paper towel at the top of the pile!

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago now.  she stays late usually on fridays, I go to use the bathroom first thing on monday morning.  Keep in mind she is the only woman in the office.  So there are driplets of blood on the seat, floor, and streaks of blood down the front of the bowl, and top of the wide open garbage can, is an open bloody pad!  No cleaning it this time, apparently for anyone the past week as it is stillll there!

&#x200B;

Today, was the final straw, I go in to see if its clean, not only is it not, as she just comes out of there.  There is Pee all over the toilet seat!  I yelled profanities in there and pushed the door open, and slammed it as I left.  Yelled at her that you learn basic Hygene at 2 years old! and how rude it was, told her the dirtiest of construction workers know how to use the toilet properly, how come you can't????!!!  I left the office, and won't go back for the day.

1223,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone. Throwaway for privacy, and my husband will be reading these responses as well. 

Our son Jake has been best friends with Sam for four years. They are both 15 years old. About three years ago Sam's parents asked us if we would be alright with Jake going to church with them on Sunday so that our boys could have sleepovers there on Saturdays and we readily agreed. House to ourselves every other weekend? Yes please! On the other weekends, Sam sleeps over with us on Fridays. This is a decently consistent schedule during the school year. 

Please note that Jake fully supported this and wanted to learn about religion as his father and I are non-believers. We have nothing against religion and we were initially excited to see him wanting to explore his beliefs.

About a year ago Jake began making comments that we were not fond of. Example: ""If you do X, you'll go to hell."" He would say this in response to us ""gossiping"" (talking about an actor), saying words like ""asshole"" (which, fair, I'll give him that one), and punishing him for bad behavior/grades (taking away his playstation). This escalated to him judging how we live and conduct ourselves, because we do not adhere to ""normal"" church behaviors. Example: My husband does the laundry, which my son said is not a man's duty.

At that point, we sat him down and had a long discussion on sexism, gender roles, etc. The whole nine yards. My husband and I also had a conversation with Sam's parents which we thought went over well. 

Except his behavior hasn't changed, only became less targeted. He quoted the bible at us last week when I wouldn't let him practice driving. He quoted it again when my husband opened a beer. And again when my sister and I mentioned a current hot button topic.

I'm done. We're done. We told him that if he was going to use his religious beliefs/knowledge in such a way, then he could no longer attend church. We spoke with Sam's parents about having sleepovers be only on Fridays at either house, but now they're mad because they think we're judging them for their beliefs/way of life and are putting us on blast all over Facebook. But it's only because our son apparently isn't mature enough at 15 (I *know* this is ridiculous) to handle religion, I swear. We've lost two mutual friends over this situation and Sam isn't allowed at our house anymore (their decision) so at this point I'm doubting our decision to pull him from church because this is a lot of shit to deal with. Jake, of course, says he hates us.

I don't know. So are we the asshole? I honestly didn't think we were until this blew up.",242,631,0.97
1224,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of background, im living in a house with 3 other boys and I've been friends with them since the first year of university and this is the first time we've shared a house together. It's amazing, we all get on, do the same substances and we never have arguments and im planning to live with one next year when we do a master's. 

He (Steve) met his gf (Jess) last year when we were all on placement year and have been going out ever since, when he told me about her and I was excited to meet her as this was his second serious relationship and I wanted to meet her. My first impression of her was that she was polite and quiet (due to nerves I assume)

Then she came around a week later (she comes over every weekend without fail and has booked train tickers for the foreseeable future) this was when things started to go wrong. A friend of ours who lives in another house invited us over for a smoke sesh (weed) and we brought her along (we made sure she was comfortable with us smoking and told her she doesn't have to if she doesn't want to) she sat down with headphones on, didn't speak to anyone or pay attention to us, ""fair enough"" I thought ""must be nerves"". Boy was I wrong

45 minutes in she stands up and began screaming at Steve saying ""I can't believe you aren't talking to me, this is so rude and inconsiderate"" and goes off on one, then storms off slamming doors and yelling in the hallway and causes a huge scene, this went on  for about an hour. Everyone was shocked and didn't know what to think/do so we ignored her. They leave together and she ignores him the whole walk home. When I asked him what happened, he told me Jess claimed it was a ""panic attack"". (I understand mental health is complicated but this didn't seem like a panic attack) She also makes him call her every hour or so and send photos of who's he's with and where he is when he leaves the house, constantly accusing him of cheating and not caring about her 

This has happened every weekend she's been coming over and has been constantly arguing with him, telling him that he's stupid, causing drama on nights out and has just been rude to all of us. I've told her ""im gonna respect your relationship but don't expect us to be friends"" and have told him many times that I don't think she should come around every weekend as it's not healthy. It's gotten to the point now that when I get drunk and she's there I tell her what i think about her (like she's not good for him and she's controlling) and it's not getting better as i can hear everything she says in his room so I can hear her talking shit about us 

I understand she's a human being with issues but there's a limit I can take and I think I might be taking it too far now and it's now straining my friendship with Steve but I honestly can't take it anymore. 

Am I being an asshole? Should I let them have their relationship and focus on being his friend when she's not around? 

Edit: I feel like I should add this to show Steve's side- after the freak out I asked him why he was with her (not in a rude way as it sounds, more like a ""what do you love about her?) And his reply was ""she makes me laugh sometimes"" ",19,27,0.94

1226,Not the A-hole,"A few weeks ago my roommate and I drove to Chicago for St. Patrick's Day. Usually for these trips, I would split the cost of gas with him, because he uses his car and it wouldn't be fair to ask him to front the cost of gas. We try to split everything and be as fair as possible. During the day, he told me that a friend of his was flying in from O'Hare Airport and wanted a ride from there back to our school, and if he gave her a ride then she would pay for gas.

So, his friend paid for the gas and tolls and we all drove back together. I thought that that meant the expense was taken care of, but he told me that I still need to pay for half the gas, even though his friend covered the entire thing herself. I told him that that didn't make sense cause neither of us put any money in so there was no cost to split, her friend covered the whole thing. He told me if it weren't for her then I would have had to pay so it's only fair if I still give my half. We changed the subject and I thought he forgot about the whole thing until today when in the middle of the day I saw he put in the cost of gas and tolls into the splitter app that we had.

I suspect that this is happening because he just ran out of all his spending money from his summer job, and he also currently owes me $40 total so he can't really pay me back. I've also been able to get gift cards from my parents that we used to buy things for our room, and I never tried to still charge him half the cost of these items, since I thought if we managed to get a deal on something then we both share the benefit of saved money. I have a job I work on campus for spending money so I also could really easily eat the cost of this, it's just the principle of it that bothers me. If he told me at the end of the school year that he couldn't afford to pay me back, I would happily forget about whatever he owes me, but this just feels like he's trying to rip me off.

He's always been a really honest and straightforward guy, so I'm just trying to see if I'm missing something or wrong about this. Am I the asshole if I explain again why I think this is unfair and refuse to pay half the cost of gas, or should I just drop it?

**tl;dr** Roommate and I usually split the cost of things. He got his friend to pay for gas for a trip but still wants me to pay ""my half"" of the cost of the gas. I don't think this is fair. Am I the asshole if I refuse to pay this?",68,139,0.97

 I'm 25 years old male and my gf is 26 years old and we have an open relationship, so there is no cheating involved in this case. Here's the the situation: I have a one-night stand with someone and I make it clear that this is purely a one-night stand with no purpose of seeing each other ever again and they want the same thing. Everybody just wants sex and everyone is on the same page here. BUT I'm not telling the other person that I'm in a relationship. Since it's just a one-time thing and everybody is getting what they want, I don't see the problem here. If I wanted a FWB thing or something more or if I led someone on then they obviously would have the right to know about my gf.

But some friends told me that in their opinion the other person ""always has the right to know"" about my girlfriend, even if it's a ONS. And it's assholish to not inform them. My GF always informs others about her open relationship even with a ONS, and that's perfectly fine. She also thinks it would be polite if I did the same, although she doesn't think I'm an asshole like her friends say. But AITA if I don't do the same?

I swear this isn't a validation post if someone thinks that, I'm seriously curious since I didn't see the problem and others called me an asshole.

EDIT: Yes I use condoms. Yes to STD tests. If they ask about my relationship, I'll tell them. I'm not lying but I'm not telling without asking. And I'm not a sex maniac banging new girls all the time. This thread is made for the rare cases of ONS.",95,73,0.86

She THEN said ""I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE, LEAVE ME ALONE"". I was staring at my phone and honestly my world was shook, I felt like my heart dropped until she said... ""APRIL FOOLS"". 

I just blocked her on snap and said ""you lost your privilege to talk to me on snap"", as a joke back. She really got mad and said I pushed her buttons. I told her she gave me a mid day panic attack. She demanded me to unblock her. I said I have things to do ttly.

So reddit AITA?

Update: I just called her and asked about her day in turn told her my day was long. I had alot of patients to take care of today and on top of that my girlfriend broke up with me as a small jab because she wasn't going to bring it up.  I explained that it caused alot of unnecessary emotional distress and idk why she would think that was funny. 

She apologized but I could tell she said it without meaning it and she admitted that she didn't and I that can't take a joke.

 Again I apologized for blocking her, explained to her how it made me feel, she gave another apology that sounded a little more sincere but she still replied with ""I can't take a joke"" and to unblock her. I refused and now she hung up on me.

1231,Not the A-hole,"My father likes to get off of work, and hang out at the bar for a few hours before he comes home. This has lead to some rocky behavior, and he’s come home drunk before, but this time, it’s a long drawn on mess.

I (20 F) attended the restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend (23 M) and we ordered some chicken wings (remember this for later). The entire experience wasn’t the best. Service was poor, bathrooms were filthy, and one of our wings was completely undercooked. 

Almost every chicken wing I’ve ever eaten has some cooked blood near the bone that appears as a dark brown or purple. No big deal there. However, as my boyfriend bit into one of the wings, the consistency was wrong, and it let out a decent amount of bright red blood. He said it tasted like iron as soon as he bit into it.

When brought the the attention of my dad’s favorite bartender, who was serving us, he told us “they’re supposed to be like that!” We asked for one order or wings to be removed from the bill. They removed it for us.

Immediately after, my boyfriend posts a negative review of the restaurant (one star), mentions the poor service and gross restrooms, and shares a photo of the wing.

Two weeks later, I get a phone call from my dad while he’s at the restaurant. He’s Incredibly upset at me because of a review I didn’t post. He went in a rant about how the guys at the bar are “his family” and that now he’s embarrassed to go back, as the bartender showed him the review. 

I tell my dad that the bartender should not have given him a hard time about the review, because he (my dad) was not the one who wrote it. I was told that I needed to get my boyfriend to delete the review.

I protested this. For one, I wasn’t the one who wrote it, so I didn’t feel I should be getting flack for it. I told my dad the following: 

“It isn’t my fault he wrote that. You have [S/O’s name’s] phone number, so you should talk to him directly about it instead of yelling at me. “ 

I went on to tell him that my s/o is entitled to his opinion, and went on to say “bad business practices deserve bad reviews so they can change and get better.” 

My dad still insists that I somehow make the review go away. I can’t do that on my own, as I’m not about to take my s/o’s phone and do it, but I’m certainly not going to tell my boyfriend what he can and can’t do. I continue to insist that the review isn’t my problem, but this has only lead to my boyfriend not being welcomed into my parents house any longer, and some strong words about my “piece of sh*** boyfriend thing” from my dad.

Am I really in the wrong? I don’t think I did anything unfavorable expect for stick up for my boyfriend 

Edit: “two days later” to “two weeks later.” It was a lot longer than two days

Backstory- First, I come from a place where engagements are fairly short, so about 5 months or less normally. Second, my brother, my sister, and I are all engaged. My brother is getting married at the end of April, and my sister is getting married the week following. I’m getting married in May.
After my sister gets married she is going to X country with her husband who’s doing summer sales.
 
When FH and I got engaged, we told our parents which day we were planning on. FILs said that was fine for them and are excited. My mom was willing to work around her schedule and travel across the world, and my dad and step-mom (SM) said, “if you’re sure, then we’ll plan for that day”.  
SM said that she and dad wanted to pay for the reception venue, part of the photos, decorations, flowers, and the reception food. I told them that I would be happy having the reception in our church, which would be free, and that FH and I could pay for other things and be thrifty to cut down on costs (I don’t want anything over the top; a wedding doesnt have to be expensive for it to be nice). SM said that they were doing it for the other kids, so they were going to do it for me too. She booked the venue. 
 
Fast forward 2 weeks to when I book the church for the ceremony. I texted everyone to tell them what time and day I had booked it for, which was the agreed upon day in May. I didn’t get much response from SM and Dad except for an “ok”. 9 hours after I had sent the first text, I get a text asking me if I could change our wedding day. 
SM told me she wasn’t sure Dad could get the days off (he had already said he would), so I texted him to confirm that he would be able to get our wedding day off. He said of course, I told SM who then said “you didn’t consult with us on the date, and we have two other weddings in April plus a grad in June. You should move the wedding back to June because it would be better for us. Since you didn’t consult with us, your sister can’t be at the wedding. If you move your wedding she’d be there.” I told SM that we had consulted with them, and that if they were going to struggle with the costs of the wedding, we would move to the FREE church, and we would pay for the decorations ourselves, and FILs were ok with paying for flowers and reception food. She refused. 
SM said that it was unfair to our extended family who HAVE /s to buy gifts for us because all our weddings are close together. Most of the things on our registry are around $20 or less with a few bigger things around $50. 
 
In the end we decided not to change our date, and that has caused tension between my parents and us. I’m curious as to whether IATA in this situation or not, because I think about it a lot. Thanks.

My dad and Stepmom approved our wedding date, but when I booked the ceremony venue I was told I needed to change it because of sister and other family issues. We decided not to change our date and I am now wondering AITA",22,53,0.94
1235,Not the A-hole,"Throw away account for certain reasons. But here we go.

I'm getting married this year, and my fiance and I are super excited. I got all the big ticket items paid for and ready to go, and all my girls have their dresses and will look phenomenal in them. Everything was going great until my one bridesmaid posted a picture of her newest tattoo...and now I am slightly mortified that it could end up in my wedding photos.

Now all my bridesmaids have multiple tattoos. I have nothing against theirs, or any tattoos for that matter. And honestly if I wasn't a chickenshit, I'd have a few myself (but needles freak me out so it's a hard no for me). So why am I thinking of singling out one bridesmaid for her one tattoo? Well. It looks like a giant..veiny..penis. My mother saw it, immediately called me and asked WTF it was, my MOH texted me asking why she got a dick tattooed and a few other bridesmaids contacted me asking what the hell was going on.

The idea that she was going for was adorable, especially because it signifies her kid's birthday. But it's not what it looks like at all. It looks like the side profile of a headless penis. And it's lightly outlined in pink and blues, so it looks like veins. And the trunk is detailed so it looks wrinkly and overall just a poor execution on what would have been a fantastic tattoo. Now if it didn't resemble male genitals I wouldn't care. But it's a big piece and in a highly visible spot that will be in almost every single photo. I just don't want a big penis in my final wedding photos.

So Reddit, would I be the asshole if I asked her to cover it up? And how could I tell her I want it covered because her tribute tattoo to her little beautiful baby looks like a dick?  


EDIT: Alright, here’s the photo ya'll wanted. It's not an April Fool's joke. It's real. It was posted on her social media yesterday.

EDIT 2: on mobile for this edit so apologies. as per u/FlyOnDreamWings recommendation i have removed the link in the previous edit because i didn’t realize it was basically the posts banner. there is still a link in the comments though. my photographer will pose her with the tattoo in mind, and edit out the tattoo on the final images that i will be hanging up, handing out and printing in the photo book. not every photo will have it edited out, especially because she’s spending her time, money and energy to be there for my big day, and she deserves to have those memories unaltered. until then, may the dumbo schlong live on.

In the past, I’ve politely asked if she could fix it when it happens, but she can never even own up to it, saying it wasn’t her. We are the only ones that use that bathroom.

I'm only a 6-8 min drive away that usually results in a ~$6 taxi but I did what I usually do and offered the driver $10 flat. I do this because most drivers resent such a short fare so I ensure that they know they'll be getting a good tip. Well, the driver puts out his hand and I (stupidly) think he's trying to give me a high five so I oblige him but then he demands I give him the $10 before we move which has never happened before.

I get passed around a few different customer service agents but one tells me that drivers are within their right to demand payment up front.

No answer and no explanation why for the first time in my 20 years of taxing taxis (never owned a car), I was suddenly subject to paying up front for a service yet to be rendered. I definitely felt like my complaint fell on deaf ears so it just seems to me like the traditional taxi services are not willing to adapt/innovate compared to Uber.

Huge red flag because my brother has been going through a really bad drug habit, off and on for the past few years. He’s supposed to be off drugs now as a condition for living in my apartment.

When I asked him what he was doing, he told me he wanted to see which games he could sell because he only plays free games like Apex, Fortnight, and Warframe. Then he asked me if we could sell the PS4 and split money 50/50 because “it’s just wasting our lives anyways.”

So the next day, while my brother was with his gf’s house, I packed up the PS4, the TV, and all the games and took them down to my storage locker. These are the only real valuables in my apartment, unless you count kitchen appliances.

1240,Not the A-hole,"I am currently in the process of looking for a new job and have begun very early conversations with a prospective employer. They are a smallish company (about a hundred employees or so), and are currently hiring for a role (this would be the first of its type in the company as they have only recently grown to a size where the business need has come up) that would be reporting directly to a manager who is looking to start a new team. 

&#x200B;

At the same time, I am planning to start trying for my first child this year. This would mean a timeline where I join the company for about half a year to a year or so, then be out of the office on maternity leave for 3-5 months afterwards. I do not intend to tell the company about my family plans. I understand that the company is not legally allowed to ask about this.

&#x200B;

My husband however believes that if he were me, he would not be comfortable with this decision and would prefer to let the company know of my plans once I get later into the hiring process. His reasoning is that while I have no legal obligation to let the company know in advance that I intend to get pregnant, going out of office for a few months less than half a year into a new job would be extremely disruptive to any team, and especially so given the size of the company and the fact that I am being hired as the first member of a new team.

On the other hand, I believe that if the company is interested in my skills and willing to hire me, they should also be accepting of the fact that I plan to take time off to pursue a personal goal that is very important to me.

1243,Asshole,"For context: I have a 12 year old male Akita, slightly overweight, and my father occasionally breeds and raises them. This Akita was to my knowledge the runt of the litter. His name is Titus.

Titus, like the other dogs we have, is essentially affixed to my mother. He follows her around constantly, seldom taking the time to leave her out of his sight and do his own thing.

The average lifespan of an Akita is 10-12 years. He is the equivalent of a 90 year old, by this metric.

Now the actual scenario: Due to his advanced age, Titus has been quite immobile and lethargic, usually laying down most of the time. He hasn’t been able to do much of anything recently, and his health has rapidly degraded. We moved to a new house a few days ago, which probably has him stressed out. He has been trying to constantly follow my mother around incessantly, however, he has been hurting trying to do so. He won’t ever lay down to rest, and I’m guessing is because he has a joint problem.

His health has been rapidly deteriorating. My parents want to put him down. I do not.

They think that, due to the misery he is in, he had a long and good life and is ready to die. They think it’s time for him to be put down so that he doesn’t have to live in misery anymore.

I think that he needs to go to the vet first, and to be firmly adjusted to the new environment of the new house. The symptoms he has been experiencing is, I believe, expected for the nature of the scenario. I think he needs to be more thoroughly examined by a vet and receive proper treatment to improve the quality of his life, instead of heading to the last resort. She ended up making a full recovery. I think that Titus can make it at least several months more with a proper treatment.

However, my parents think that this is just me being attached, and as a result, my desire for him to live means he has to live in misery. For some reason, they are totally opposed to getting him veterinary treatment. My father thinks that because he breeds Akitas, that he is familiar with their physiology and is adept in addressing health issues for them. He has been relatively successful up until this point. I think that this time he needs to relinquish his control over the issue to a vet.

Am I being selfish and prolonging the suffering of my dog for not wanting him to be put down?

Am I the asshole here?

EDIT: Money is not the primary concern. We are mostly willing to spend what is necessary to keep him in good health, unless it is a wholly exorbitant amount. Furthermore, Titus (before moving house) was able to get up and down. I think what may have caused some joint trauma was having to climb stairs. We are in a one story house now. Also, our tile floors are kind of slippery for him. He does lay down, but he prefers to follow my mother around. He is also not following orders and directions like he used to. I think a lot of this is stress. He probably doesn’t understand where he is. Titus lived his whole life in our previous house, and barely ever lived elsewhere. He is firmly imprinted on that old house. However, he is also very old. He has been kind of slipping. He has also shown some episodes of lost bladder control and gastrointestinal problems. I don’t know if he’s ready to go yet. He has been in good shape for the vast majority of his life, and it has been stressful and traumatizing to see him deteriorate like this.",47,32,0.92

1245,Not the A-hole,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

So, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I’m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...

My twin sister is the opposite of me. She’s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn’t and still don’t mind, it’s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn’t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don’t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn’t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn’t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I’m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don’t know how but I did. 

I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she’s been crying and solemn and sad. She’s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She’s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn’t been herself. I haven’t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn’t get in because she didn’t). 

Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it’s Cornell. I couldn’t in a million years imagine I’d get in. I’ve been researching obsessively about it and I can’t shake the desire that if I don’t go, I’ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it’s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. 

Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don’t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she’s worked compared to me...

TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn’t. She’s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?

UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. 

Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn’t I tell her earlier and she’s so proud of me

But seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn’t know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update 

So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:

> I’m sorry for how I reacted; please don’t be mad. I’m so happy for you and your accomplishments. It’s just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you’re going to be where I wanted to be and I’m just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I’m sorry I’m ranting I just need more time

I’m not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don’t. I don’t deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I’m really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don’t stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we’re going to drift apart which would suck because we’re best friends and I just don’t want to lose my sister :(

Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). 

Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.

I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.

I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.

Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",2521,26887,0.93
1246,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit, so one of my best friends is getting married soon. Instead of having a wedding at a typical venue, they're having it on a 7 day cruise to have both their honeymoon and wedding at the same time.

&#x200B;

They're doing this presumably to save money and while I understand that, I find it very selfish because it 1. forces guests to have to take an entire week off for a wedding (I'm lucky in that I work from home so this doesn't apply to me, but still) and 2. where the bride and groom are saving money, the costs get pushed down to the guests.

&#x200B;

Whereas I'd probably spend $400 or so between airfare, accommodations, and gifts if they had a normal wedding I'd now need to purchase a cruise ticket which will probably be about $500+. On top of that, there won't be an open bar which is some peoples saving grace for attending weddings. I generally don't care about that, but if I'm going on a week long cruise I'm sure there will be times that I'm bored and want a drink.

&#x200B;

So tack on more $ for drinks, excursions, etc. and you're easily looking at $1000-1200. On one hand I feel like the asshole because he's my friend and I want to be there for him and to celebrate, but on the other I feel like it's a real asshole move to expect that of their guests in an effort to save money on a wedding and honeymoon.

Edit: Some of you pointed out that they might have the wedding before the ship leaves, but they're having the ceremony at the first port. Meaning you'll have to be on the cruise to attend the wedding

1247,Asshole,"When I was around 13 (seven years ago) my parents told me that there was some uncertainty regarding my paternity. My mother was sexually assulted by another man around the same time that I was conceived. They never did a test and just agreed to raise me as my fathers' daughter. I'd honestly be lying if I said it didn't bother me not knowing the truth. 

So my cousin (dad's sister's son) did 23andMe already, and I want to do it as well to see my genetic makeup and all that, but I also kind of want to find out if we're related. I told my parents and they, mostly mom, freaked out. They said that it was their decision not to test in the first place and that they don't think it's fair of me to disrespect their decision. My dad asked me if I saw him as my father. I said ""yes, obviously, even if you maybe aren't biologically""

My mother won't speak to me, but my dad looked   real sad. So WIBTA if I went though with it?

Edit: Just thought it was important to state that I do intend to share the results with them. I am honestly terrible at keeping secrets and I know for a fact that even if I try to hide it, it will slip some day. So better to state from the beginning. My cousin will obviously also know and he can't keep secrets as well.

Edit 2: So apparently IWBTA, so:

I am going to do the test, however, it will only be in about 30-40 years when both my parents have passed away. I feel like it would be a win for everyone then, unless the world ends in some tragic way before I find out, or I die. I don't want to know because of some lost identity BS, I'm just curious is all. So if I find out now or later, I don't think it would make much of a difference. I see now that I was kind of selfish in my reasoning, thanks all. 

Last Edit: Not that it's important, but I see that I said I'm 20, I'm 23 lmao",320,1379,0.96
1248,Asshole,"Backstory: I had my son when I was 17. His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son ""Ben"" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.

As I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague ""Joe"" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.

Long story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).

A week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to ""what if you dated Matt"" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?",146,316,0.92
1249,Not the A-hole,"Some background: A few years ago I went to school with a girl who seemed to have a lot of drama with people (we’ll call her X). Everyone told me she was the worst but I tried to give her a chance anyways because I don’t like to judge people based off rumors. I tried to be nice at school but in the end she turned out to be exactly the person everyone told me she was (somewhat toxic, really narcissistic.) School finished and I never heard from her again. 

I got a job at my current location a few months ago, and X got hired where I work about a week ago. Since then she’s been causing a lot of problems. For example when the assistant manager called her out on charging too much and stealing products, X went straight to the manager and said she felt “attacked.” Most recently our manager created a “chore chart” for us. We don’t get paid to do these things. If it was stuff that I should be doing anyways like cleaning up after myself it would be fine but it’s things that take at least 1+ hour of time that I’m not getting paid to do. So when I was talking about it to another coworker of mine X overheard us and went straight to the manager and told her basically everything we said. Now we’ve all decided to stop talking to her completely because she obviously has no interest in being our friend anyways and we can’t trust her with information.

1250,Not the A-hole,"So on Saturday I got a call from cousin to comeover her place because she had a 5 month old mixed husky puppy someone was giving away.

I went over and I instantly wanted her. My cousin called the coach and let him know and he was okay with me bringing her home then and there. She spent the night with me and the next day my cousin called saying the coach wanted to sell me her previous cage. I told my cousin I would just order a new one.

Later that day my cousin texts me that the owner wanted her back because he found someone willing to pay. But apparently my cousin had told him off saying he already gave her away to someone and that its wrong to just take her back just to make some money off of her.

1251,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I are a lesbian couple and have talked about having children. I never really wanted a child but if it’s with my current girlfriend, I think I would be okay with just one. Of course having children is going to be way into the future as I’m not ready to have children yet. 

However, we were talking about this topic and we get to the point about Down Syndrome. I asked her, if the fetus had problems like Down Syndrome, what would you do?

At first she said she would abort it but then her view changed within 20 seconds and said she’d want to keep it. I told her that if the child cannot do anything by itself, lives in pain, and ultimately just doesn’t have good prospects for a suffering free life, I would like to abort it. 

I wouldn’t say this was a pro-choice/pro-life argument, but it seemed like she was super into pro-life as she said things like “who do you think you are to end a baby’s life” etc. 

I told her that’s fine if she wants to keep the baby, but I wouldn’t want my child to suffer if they were born with fatal diseases, no limbs, no mobility, etc. 

And before I get roasted, I completely understand and acknowledge that people who are born with disabilities can lead a promising and independent life, but not everyone is the same. I may sound selfish but other than not wanting my child to suffer, I also don’t want to be bound into taking care of a disabled child because I may grow to resent them. 

She got pissy even though I showed her facts and told her as a nurse she should understand that doctors advise people to abort, not because their monsters, but because they’re thinking for the best of the child and mother. But she wouldn’t have it and said that all the doctors she met was just trying to protect the hospital from lawsuits or whatever. 

She got mad and isn’t answering my messages or calls. I love her but I don’t know if it will work. I want to save this relationship because our opinions may change in the future. But we’ve only been dating for a little less than two years and I’m not ready to have babies. 

AITA?

EDIT: Idk if this changes anything but, this is ONLY of the doctor finds something wrong with the fetus BEFORE giving birth. If my child has ANY disability AFTER they are born I am 100% on board with taking care and loving my child.

1254,Not the A-hole,"Recent events have made me question my choice to give my girlfriend's mother an ultimatum regarding her future rights to see her as-of-yet unborn grandchildren. My girlfriend is currently saddled with over $15,000 in *her mother's debt* that was put in credit cards/student loans under my girlfriend's name, and she is intent to get a second job just to help pay off debt that isn't hers.

Apparently, my girlfriend started borrowing her mother money at 16 as things at the household were tight, but under the table payments in cash, which certainly isn't counted in that first total, eventually turned into credit cards after her mom maxed out her own and tanked her credit score.

My future MIL has consistently said that she would pay these back, and took out loans that she promised would be applied to the debt. However, she instead used these loans to pay for vehicles, a tummy-tuck, and trips. For one of these loans, my girlfriend took a lean out on *her own vehicle* as collateral for the loan.

I recently broke when two separate events compounded to give me the impression that this woman will never pay my girlfriend back. The first of these events took place back in December when, as legal guardian of my girlfriend's twin half-siblings, took money from their savings accounts to pay down debt. This money had been given to them by their father to set up college funds and they had no knowledge of the withdrawal. They are 13 years old and certainly do not track those accounts.

The second incident, and the tipping point, occurred last week. My girlfriend pays her family's general expenses for the month and is then repaid when her mom gets her paycheck. She lives at home (for the moment) and thinks this is fine as she has never had much of an issue in being repaid. Her mother has now missed 2 payments and this week came to her asking for an extra $600 to pay the water bill which is apparently overdue by multiple months.

She called asking me what to do and I said to refuse to pay it. She has her own expenses and it is too large of a financial strain to deal with. Her mother and her got in a shouting match that had a lot of, ""You live under my roof!"" from my understanding. The two are now at odds, and I am in the middle of it.

When I came over to go on a weekend getaway, I told her mother that if my girlfriend paid off a single one of her credit cards, she would never see her grandchildren. She then went on a tirade about how horrible that was, and that I was brainwashing her daughter into hating her family. She has since spread rumors to all of her children and other family members about how terrible and manipulative I have been. My girlfriend is entirely behind me and wants to GTFO of her house to avoid feeling obligated to assist her mother.

1255,Not the A-hole,"Background: my wife and I have been together for 25 years, since we were freshmen in High School.  Through the course of our relationship, she has not placed a high value on being on time - in other words, she is habitually late. On the other hand, I'm likely a little too obsessed with being on time.  We have a very distinct and clear understanding about being on time: she knows I really want to be on time, while I know it's not a huge priority for her. 

Recently, we've had a streak of being late to events with our friends, due to her not getting ready on time.  My reactions vary from minor annoyance to verbally complaining about her tardiness.  2 weekends ago, we were quite late to an event, and I expressed my frustration about it on the car ride there. 

This past weekend, we had an event on Saturday night, and on Saturay morning she asked me what time I wanted to leave.  My verbatim response was ""Can we not be late?""  She then stated that she felt like she was being attacked, and that I was too often critical of her.  She then suggested that I should not mention her tardiness, even indirectly, or else I was being an asshole. I argued that I was just trying to communicate my priorities.

1258,Not the A-hole," Repost because I didn't spell WIBTA properly in the original title.

&#x200B;

Since before my boyfriend and I met 3 years ago, he' been using the ""no 'poo"" technique of hair care. For those unfamiliar, this is when you only utilized shampoo/conditioner every few months. You still wet and hand scrub in the shower every few days. The idea is that you're allowing the scalp to self-regulate and find a balance with the amount of natural oils present on the head. His hair isn't gross, per-say. It just looks, feels, and smells a little greasy. It's not the sleazy-looking type of greasy; it just looks like he uses a lot of gel. He got the idea from a mutual friend who doesn't wash her hair often because she is constantly traveling. Her hair is INCREDIBLE and she can easily style it because the natural oil allows her hair to hold shape.

So my question is WIBTA if I requested he wash his hair for a little while to see how it looks. As I seriously value body autonomy and person choice, I would feel selfish asking him to do so. I'm conflicted. In the years we've been dating, hes washed it maybe a 12-20 times. I know that sounds disgusting but it's average for those who use no 'poo methods and it really isn't bad. I don't mind and I promise it's not as disgusting as it sounds. His person hygiene is great in general. These shampoo-ings, however, are not the deep conditioning that would be needed to remove the oils, however. So it feels softer but it's still not 100% clean.

I'm not sure if I am considering this purely out of curiosity or if there is a part of me that secretly thinks his hair is disgusting. Occasionally during sexy times he'll want me to grab his hair but I'm hesitant to because it's greasy. I don't think that's the reasoning but the unconscious mind is a complex thing.

Also, I always welcome personal experiences and information about no 'poo! And if INFO is needed, let me know. I know this is a bit of a ramble.

In judging this, please try to judge based on whether this would be an acceptable request given his right to bodily autonomy, not whether you think not washing your hair is a gross thing. As his girlfriend, am I allowed to make sure a request? Like I said, his hygiene otherwise is perfect.

TL;DR I'm considering asking my no 'poo boyfriend to wash his hair regularly for a short period of time to see what his natural hair is like. WIBTA?",103,130,0.96

• I was upset so I filled out a form and sent IKEA a complaint, saying I rescheduled but wasn't impressed they didn't even let me know and i had to call to reschedule after being stood up. Especially since I was paying for this delivery fee, and it wasn't delivered.

• 8:09 am on Sunday I woke up to a call saying they are on their way and will arrive at 8:40. I'm excited, might be able to pull of this surprise, assuming they realized they screwed me and am dropping off my stuff asap :) i get up shower quick and get ready.

• They never come. At first I thought I misheard him, maybe he said 9:40 and my half awake brain didn't process. Then figured maybe he called his entire list for that time window. So I wait.

• 1:15 pm and no follow up call or furniture. I call customer service for the delivery company. They're closed on Sunday. So I leave a message, explaining the situation and politely inquiring about my delivery and when it should arrive, leaving my order number, phone number and name

• 2 pm I call the phone number of the driver who woke me up that morning. ask for an estimate delivery time he says he will check and call me back.

• 2 15 IKEA emails me back saying glad I rescheduled and to call a specific number for compensation once it comes. 

• 230 Dude calls me back. checked with dispatch, calling me was a mistake he doesn't have my order on his truck. I ask if he knows who has it or when it should arrive and he says its scheduled for 5-9 pm

I rarely check Facebook, but from time to time I like to see what old friends are up to. So I logged on and saw a comment someone made on a post belonging to someone with my mom’s name. It turns out she has an alt account, and it’s full of pictures of my baby- taken directly from our photo stream, others I have never seen that she snapped with her phone. I checked her friend list (of course it was public and not secure at all) and saw a bunch of people that I don’t know, with one or two we share as friends (how I found the account). She made this account to share pictures of my baby with people not on my photo stream.

I was livid. I called her and told her to deactivate the account. She refused. We got into a heated argument and she said the account was her property, and by me putting photos on the shared stream, I was putting them out there for her to do whatever she wants with them. I was blown away by the lack of respect. she has an addiction- sharing photos of her grandkids, and gives no damns about respect toward me or my daughters privacy.

So, I kicked her off the photostream. It’s been two weeks, and we haven’t talked since. I cannot check her alt account to see if she’s still blasting pics of my kid- she since made it private (at least there is that).
I have looked back at my moms post history and she is a text-book over sharer. At one point she posted pictures of my niece and nephew’s bare asses...I called her out on it, I got the whole lecture about being a prude, but she eventually took it down. Various things like that made me set down the rules to being with.
It’s mostly my family that is siding with my mom, and their opinions matter. They think it’s cruel I am “withholding the opportunity” for my mom to see her granddaughter grow up.
It’s worth mentioning she lives 45 minutes away and can come visit anytime, but she hasn’t since our blow out.

So, am I the asshole?

Tl;dr: I won’t share photos of my baby with my mom because she went behind my back and put them on social media.

So she was not really paying attention to the movie that much but i liked it a lot, while i was watching she was asking me questions like ''what do you think of this person'' and ''what do you think of this teacher'' and I just said ''they're alright''. that's usually my go to answer for everything.

then she said what do i think of going off to college, i said the same, it'll be alright. Then she asked me ''what do you think of my tits?'', i thought that a strange question and didn't answer it, then she said ''look at me'' and while i looked her, she literally got her boobs out of her bra. i said ''they're alright'' because i didn't know what else to say, and was shocked.

Then she went to the toilet and didn't come out, she didn't come out for ages so i go to check on her and she says that her parents are coming home and that i should leave. I say okay, now her friends texted me calling me asshole because i destroyed her confidence AITA?",126,67,0.77

1263,Not the A-hole,"I'm about 37 weeks pregnant but I still haven't told any of my biological family. We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional ""are you alive"" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.

About 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.

My boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.

This has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?",111,316,0.95
1264,Asshole,"Long post but please hear me out :(

I have a chronic disease that often causes lots of pain. Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.

The morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn't wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn't end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family's house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family's house I didn't really talk much and didn't participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. 

After all of this we had to head to her grandmother's house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. 

This morning she told me that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don't care about her. She texted me ""one day...my fucking birthday...that's all I wanted.""

Now in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn't know what to say which just made her more upset with me.

Someone please give me their opinion on what is going on here. AITA?",52,53,0.9
1265,Not the A-hole,"Every year, on the last day of March, we gather as a family to celebrate my father-in-law’s life at a specific restaurant. He passed away many years ago, and that was his favorite place to eat. My mother-in-law foots the bill as part of the celebration and everyone in the family that can attend is always welcome. Sometimes people bring friends and it is never a big deal and we all celebrate a great man. This year, we had 3 of the 4 of my mother-in-law’s kids and their families come and had a wonderful time. My wife took a picture and posted it to social media to honor her dad. The unrepresented kid (I say kid loosely as she is over 50) took exception to this and flew off the handle because their family didn’t get an invitation and were purposely excluded. It is an open invitation, and she and all her children are adults with working phones. AITA for not reaching out to them and explicitly inviting them? Or should they know they are welcome  (since they have been every other year) and take the initiative to just come?

1267,Asshole,"So this guy, Daniel we'll call him, is a pretty chill dude in school. He and I are in the same sports club, and we talk a lot.

One day, while changing clothes in the locker room, I accidentally saw him opening his Tumblr account on his phone. Discreetly.

 I shouldn't have done it, but out of curiosity, I searched for his Tumblr username... and found out that he's a furry. He posts in these cringey asterisks, uses a lot of text emojis and shit, hell he even posted a lot of selfies of himself wearing those furry costumes. He covered half of his face in those photos, but I swear to God I could've recognized him even if he only showed his fucking eyebrow. Some photos were borderline NSFW, paired with very overt descriptions I wished I have never fucking read. I felt like my eyes were tainted. They were so bad, omg.

Now Daniel was a super normal guy on the outside, and showed absolutely no indication that he was a furry, at all. He's pretty charismatic, and we have tons of mutual friends. I wasn't even supposed to know these stuff but my stupid ass had to look them up. I can't look at him in the eye anymore, and my skin crawls when I think how different he is with his furry persona.

Obviously, he doesn't want people knowing about his secret, and I can't/don't want to confront him about it. I've read enough of his posts to know that he'll probably have a breakdown if he knows that I know. I just- I try to avoid him because I just can't accept it. I know that's what he likes, but I can't control my feelings. It's super awkward. He and the people around us are starting to notice my behavior towards him. I don't plan to out him, but I'm thinking if I should just ghost him instead and just let things between us fade.

Me and my dumbass curiousity. Am I the asshole here?

Edit: GOD NO I meant furry as in those cartoons with human-like features NOT BEASTIALITY 

Edit: People have tell me to suck it up and remain friends with Daniel, but aside from the furry stuff, I'm mainly unsettled by how different he is and how well he hides it - which one is the true him? Do I actually know him? I'm not confident that I can do that",183,346,0.89

1270,Asshole,"Backstory: I’ll try and make this as non-biased as possible.

This conversation came up very early in our relationship. I told her from the start that I want my children to have my surname and I didn’t want any hyphenation. It was a short lived talk but it seemed like she understood. We have rarely ever had arguments in our relationship (Could count them on 1 hand!) and we are solid ‘life partners’. This conversation came up again last night which became a little heated. She didn’t realise how strongly I felt about this and I didn’t realise the same with her.


She doesn’t want her family name to die (From her step father) as all his children are women and have not given the name to their children or kept it themselves. Ever since I wanted children I have always wanted them to take my surname, I’ve never seen it any other way. I understand this is selfish but I had made it clear from the get-go this was what I wanted.


In the end she ‘gave in’ and said I can take it but did say various comments about me being stubborn and never compromising. In my head this is one of the very few things that I am dead set on…. But now it’s got me questioning if I am just a stubborn piece of shit usually, I don’t feel it is though.


Am I the asshole? Do I need to compromise? I think if I did double barrel the surname I would start to despise the name/children and it wouldn’t be healthy for any of the relationships. I know this seems rather silly but it means a lot to me.

EDIT: I seem to have worded the last statement wrong and without context. I wouldn't despise the children, it would be the name because in that situation it would have been forced upon and not agreed beforehand",1770,3807,0.88

I'm not fond of kids at the best of times, but god help anyone that would bring a young child to our special day. I mostly have a problem with the parents as the kids cant really help it, but if you decide that you're too important for a babysitter and decide to bring a child that doesnt respect the sanctity of a wedding, then would I be the asshole if I requested that said person leave? The wedding would not be for years to come but theres nothing that fills me with more anger than a screaming brat breaking any sort of special moment my SO and I would be sharing and spoiling everyone elses time. I already tell that my mother will be wholeheartedly opposed to this, but its not her day. Would it be bad to put this on the invitations?

I dont know a lot about customs, so Im not sure if this would be something other people would do",192,206,0.89
1272,Not the A-hole,"Context: I'm an openly Bi guy, in the sense that if someone asks I'll tell and I don't hide it, but I never actively bring it up and I never shove it in people's faces.

**TL;DR: I feel that my friend is defining my entire personality and life by my sexuality, he constantly brings it up in unrelated conversations and uses it as a 'roast'. This has been happening pretty much since he learned I was bi. He thinks this is no big deal, that I'm overreacting and I need to 'chill' and he doesn't see what he's done wrong. AITA?**

Now my friend, who we'll call Jack, seems to have turned into a bit of an ass lately. The reason I say he's turned into a bit of an ass is that he doesn't seem to understand when a roast is or isn't called for. You'll see why I say that.

Tonight, we were talking about what we're doing tomorrow. I didn't understand something he said, so I asked and he came back with

>no wonder you got to [my uni] so slow to catch on (for added context, with my grades I could have gone to any uni in the country. I chose mine)

Anyway, the convo continued with him calling the bar at my uni shit (🤷‍♂️) and eventually getting to *'our bar is better because I saw someone who graduated years ago there'* and *""Your lonely ass wouldn't understand""*.

Now this did offend me because honestly since we went our separate ways he has no fuckin clue what I've been up to, and even at school I was one of the most socially active people in our grade. It'd be like me making a hiroshima joke to him; it's just wrong to begin with, plus he's not even Japanese so it doesn't even make any sense. I said to him 

>HAHA don't even at me about being lonely, you have no idea what I do

to which he came back with

>What sucking guys off

>you a gay stripper or someshit now

At this point I kind of went off. To fully understand why, you have to know that he's been doing this for months. In person and online, in DMs and group chats. If anyone brings up the topic of sexuality or relationships, I have to stop contributing immediately or it'll end up being about that. Even in completely and entirely unrelated conversations such as above, he still brings it up as a 'roast'. I've made it clear multiple times that it's not ok, and he keeps going.

I feel like he's defining my entire self by my sexuality, as if there's nothing else to my character. That's just one part of the problem though.

He's said now that he'll stop (sure, whatever) but he keeps calling what he's doing a 'joke' (""I'll stop making the joke"", ""dude it's just a joke"") and he keeps telling me to chill and that it's not a big deal and I'm overreacting, which makes me think he still doesn't realise what he's done wrong and how big of a deal this is to me. That's the bigger issue imo. I don't care that he's going to stop, or that he's apologised (he actually hasn't). I'm pissed that he thinks he's done nothing wrong and that this is no big deal.

Am I overreacting? AITA?",38,100,0.91
1273,,"As the title suggests, I wanted to save two seats for my wife and 17-year-old son. Let me set the stage so that your decision can be rendered with all the facts:

BWI to MHT, Sunday night (yesterday). Southwest flight... yes, I get the rules of boarding. For those that don't know, SW boards in groups only and you don't have assigned seating. You are simply assigned a group and then a number. Groups are A, B, and C and the numbers go from 1-65 (or so). If you are given A 25 you are typically the 25th person aboard the plane, give or take (but the exact numbers aren't important here).

Our meal was a little late prior to boarding so I went ahead and decided to board ahead of my family. As we have done countless times before, I'd just hold a couple of seats for them as I know they were right behind me. I had boarding letter/number A45. Southwest flies nothing but 737s with three variations. You either have 143 or 175 seats available. 

I sat down in an aisle seat and threw my jacket over the middle and window armrest. Two minutes later a young woman stopped at my seat, looked at me and said ""I want to sit there."" pointing at the window seat. I politely said ""Oh, sorry, I'm trying to save these for my son and wife who are not far behind you. Her reply - ""So?"" I said ""But, 60% of the plane is still empty. You literally have the entire back half of the plan to sit wherever you want?"" 

She moved her way in and that was that. Given the characteristics of the players involved, me uttering a single word would have lead to an international incident - that I am sure of. 

AITA for moving here? Should I have stood my ground? I get it - open seating. But the plan was, again literally, less than half full at this point. I have been flying for business for over 25 years. I'm quite sure that I have flown more than 85% or more of the general population. Not a fact I am proud of, just a little background to say that I know flying sucks, I know the rules and I also know that sometimes common courtesy supersedes some of the basic rules of boarding. 

I am also quite sure that this young lady feels that this was a major victory for the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, stupid old people... whatever battle she is waging (that nobody even knows she is involved in), but, seriously?

TL;DR - Tried to save two seats (middle and window) on a Southwest flight for my family. More than half the plane was empty when someone pushed their way into seats that I was saving and I decided to take the high ground and just move. AITA or should I have dug in?

1274,Asshole,"Update:
Thanks everyone for your comments. I really appreciate you weighing in. There’s a couple of comments I’ve seen a bunch of times that I’d like to provide more info on.

First I was feeling really bitter this morning and I haven’t expressed any of these feeling with my family yet or if ever. I wanted to crowdsource an opionion to make sure I didn’t do anything stupid. Judging by most of the sentiment, it’s a good thing I asked you all first. 

Second, I will most definitely respect their decision on what they want to give me. It’s not worth causing a rift in my family. 

Third, I am completely capable for paying for my 20k budget in its entirety without going into debt- that’s why I chose it. It would just be nice to not have to pay for it all and to have some more savings to rely on should something major and unexpected come up.

Next, I’m still paying for my own college tutition and worked part time to cover my living expenses. My parents do not contribute to my lifestyle. I am, in all sense of the word, currently “adulting”. My fiancé and I are very fortunate to have good stable jobs. 

And, I’m probably going to get hammered for this, but they support my brother a lot. He loves stuff and they support his habit. He makes enough that he could live on his own but he chooses to live with them rent free to to support all the big ticket items he has to pay for. 

Last, I’m only having one maid of honor and one best man. I’m expecting around 60-80 people to attend. I personally wanted to elope and skip all this nonsense, but we couldn’t agree on what that meant. With a core group of 25, it was too large for any restaurant in the area to accommodate without crazy fees to shut down the whole place. Believe me, I tried, so if we had to spend a lot, why not invite more people. And thus the budget and the guest list grew. I guess I wasn’t strong enough to find a path forward for anything other than what everyone said we should do/spend. So we’re here, now, having an actual wedding. And weddings are so expensive.  It’s nuts y’all. 

AITA, truly? Why is this so hard? 




Original post: 
I sound like the classic entitled millennial, but hear me out! My parents have agreed to contribute $5k towards my wedding (I'm the bride). I had suggested $10K and want to ask them again if they would contribute more.

If they didn't have the money it would be a totally different story, but they are choosing not spend money on this because they don't see the the value in it. For them, if it's not a tangible thing that they can buy, then it's not worth spending the money on. I, on the other hand value experiences over material possessions, so we've always disagreed there. And this is becoming one of those disagreements. For prospective in the last 3-4 years they've built a $40K garage, bought 2 $50k trucks, a $25K camper/rv and a $30k boat. Not to mention a $100k home remodel when they downsized and endless yard projects on their 5 acres in the country. They're both retired, but in this time they've barely been on any kind of vacation. Mostly just to come visit me in the city.

And it's not that they don't support this marriage either. They love my fiance! They just would prefer us to go to the courthouse because that would cost less and they wouldn't be forced to attend an event. They don't like celebrating anything (because it's not a thing) and they don't like large social gatherings.

My fiance and I have been together for 8 years and waited to get married to make sure this was really what we wanted. So it's not like they couldn't see this coming. We also aren't fans of big grandiose displays either. We're trying to keep this wedding conservative cost wise and keep it to $20k total. The Knot says the average wedding costs $34K, so I feel like I'm not being a bridezilla asking for more money to cover an elaborate wedding. I'm just asking for a little more help to pull off a nice event with good food, a few beers and good company. AITA here?

TLDR: AITA for feeling jilted and thinking that $5k is a paltry contribution to my wedding when I know my parents can afford more?",594,798,0.86
1275,Not the A-hole,"Okay so to start this off, I’m currently in recovery from multiple mental illnesses including anorexia. 
     So when I was first diagnosed I was pretty much immediately sent to a residential hospital for a few months and I EXPLICITLY told my mom that I didn’t want her telling people besides close family friends and relatives, and she agreed. Fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and I’m scrolling through my moms Facebook trying to find a specific family photo I was looking for when I see multiple posts along the lines of:
    Today we had to check our beautiful daughter into Veritas for treatment of her ED. Please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)
     This especially pissed me off because I’m not a religious person at all. Also, keep in mind that my mom is a complete social butterfly with over 500 Facebook friends, most of whom I’ve never met. All I could think about was random people I’ve never met immediately defining me as my mental illness and feeling pity, and the one thing I can’t stand is people pitying me. 
     My mom uses the same password for everything so I knew her Facebook login and immediately deleted the posts. She still hasn’t noticed. 

Update: damn I didn’t expect this to get that many responses! Just to clarify my mom definitely didn’t have any ill-intent.

I made a reddit account just for this. 

I was having a chat with my sister (14 years old) and she explained that she doesn't go to classes if she doesn't like the teacher, basically saying she skips classes. 
I tried telling her how that can affect your future and she rolled her eyes and went back on Instagram. 
from what I gathered she skipped English class and math class. 
I took issue to that, and thought I would tell my parents, the reaction shocked me.

Obligatory sorry for formatting issues on mobile and for then length but I’m a bit of a rambler. 
Basically friends and family organised a surprise bachelorette party for myself, my sister and my friend got into a bit of a heated argument during the organisation of it all and they couldn’t let it lie on the night. 

I wasn’t aware of any of the underlying issues until halfway through the night when they began arguing. I don’t want to go into the details of the argument but I know both are at fault. 

I spent the rest of my night on eggshells going between both parties and trying to spend time with both of them as well as the other groups who all came making sure everyone was having a good night.  It all became too much for me so I left early and broke down as soon as I got home to my fiancé. He spent the entire next day trying to comfort me and was completely angry on my behalf. 

I haven’t spoken to either of them and haven’t even heard from them since this all went down on Friday night, but I plan on contacting them myself and telling them that if they can’t be civil we won’t be having a wedding. My fiancé and I will just go to the courthouse and get married without the party afterwards.

Not inviting them isn’t an option because by dis-inviting either will cause a huge ripple effect from both circles of friends and family and just leave a huge cloud hanging over everyone on the day. My fiancé is in agreement with this because we would both rather lose the money we’ve spent than have a bad atmosphere at our wedding. So WIBTA if I gave them this ultimatum? 

EDIT: I can see why people would consider this a temper tantrum and it probably is; I’m angry and pissed that 2 people I love and thought loved me couldn’t be civil to one another and chose to have a massive argument in front of all my friends, family and my fiancé’s family.  At the time I typed this I honestly didn’t want to have my wedding reception anymore, and I don’t want to spend my night having to worry that they won’t keep away from one another. 

My family and group of friends had never met one another prior to the planning and actual bachelorette and this is because they have very different ideas of what a good night out entails, this was the reason I never planned on having  a bachelorette because I knew trying to please both groups would be near impossible and I didn’t want to have two. (This is what the initial argument between the two of them was about) 

I have spoken with some neutral friends who were there and have agreed to keep Sis and Bf away from each for the night. (I’m pissed that they would even have to do this) I’ve still to hear from either of them and due to work I’ve not had the proper time to have the discussion I need to have with them.  For those asking, we have no one coming from out of town for our wedding everything and everyone is local. Fiancé and myself were paying for everything so no one would be out of pocket.

My husband went to talk to her and ask her for the money, she told him she gave me the money for February and will have the mo ey for March tomorrow.  The friggin nerve of some people, she did not give me any money. So after viewing all of the comments and advice I am just going to tell her that due to the contract with the ISP we are unable to provide her with internet going forward.

Thank you all very much for the responses, I appreciate all of you!  

Hello fellow asshole enthusiasts. I live in a small apartment building. Above my husband and I lives a single mom. Earlier this year we had the internet installed and set up a second wifi connection for our neighbor on the condition that she pays us $40/month. She approached us with the offer and the amount and my husband and I agreed. 

At first everything was fine and dandy and she paid when she was supposed to, then she was a bit late then only paid "" half now half later"" and then just stopped paying altogether. It's not like she is hurting for money, we see her come home with bags of stuff from the store on at least a weekly basis, got a new car this year etc. When I see her outside she doesn't mention anything like "" oh yeah I owe you I forgot, I will get your money now"". I don't feel like I should have to chase her down to get the money she owes us. 

My husband and I make a decent amount of money and we easily can afford and have been paying the bill ourselves, we don't NEED the money ( it's not going to make or break us every month) but we are saving for a mortgage and have two children of our own. 

WIBTA if I changed her wifi password so she can not connect until she pays us what she owes ? ",193,509,0.96

1288,No A-holes here,"So, I'm from a SE Asia country where getting married is an extremely big deal. Like, from the moment a child is born the parents start saving for its wedding because it's really important in our culture.

Recently, my best friend got engaged. And she's really excited about her big day. Theres a hundred different functions with rituals and designer outfits and food and what not. She confided in me that her wedding budget is somewhere near $300,000. And their family can easily afford it. It's not like she's forcing someone to.lay for her wedding 

But the thing is, I come from a poor country. I see so much poverty around me. Homelessness. Kids on the street who are suffering from malnutrition. And I just can't help thinking how much help this money could have done to them but now it's been spent on a two day event. I don't want to feel like this because my friend is a sweetheart with nothing but joy and positivity to give to everyone but I have started resenting all this spending when there's so many money related problems in the world. 

AITA for feeling this way?",41,58,0.88
1289,Not the A-hole,"So I have been working in my parent's bar and grill/cafe for as long as I can remember. There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.

&#x200B;

I have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.

&#x200B;

We have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.

&#x200B;

I am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we are a grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.

&#x200B;

I end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment.

1292,No A-holes here,"My brother-in-law had a brief marriage before marrying my sister a few years later. They’ve now been married for 15+ years and have 4 kids together. He didn’t have any kids with his first wife and has had no communication or relationship with her since they divorced years ago. It was such a blip that it never has come up socially in the family. I had no idea that my sister and her husband had decided not to tell their kids about this. ..

I was chatting with my OTHER sister’s kids (ages 9 and 17) who were asking me questions about dating and relationships and I casually mentioned, “Yeah, sometimes divorce is normal and okay. Uncle X is a great guy who just didn’t find Aunt Y until after his first marriage.” I immediately realized by the looks on their faces that this was news to them. My whole family is very conservative and religious. I told them to please keep this private as I wasn’t sure it was common knowledge.

Thinking I was doing the right thing, I reached out to my sister (the one married to the divorced husband) and told her what had happened. She blew up at me, told me how sad she was that I would take that liberty, and  how confused her kids would be if they found out. I profusely apologized but also explained that I had no clue that they weren’t sharing that with their kids. That didn’t seem to make any difference to her. She really ripped into me and made me feel terrible. I called my husband in tears and he reacted saying that she was being unfair to lay that burden all on me. Regardless, she is hurt and feels betrayed by me and I feel terrible but also perplexed.

Honestly, I can’t believe they’ve decided not to tell their kids... seems much worse for her kids (ages 9-16) to find out so late in life than to just grow up aware of it? I KNOW I don’t get to decide that for her, but I also don’t feel like her anger is fair given she had NEVER  told anyone in the family that this was under wraps.  I told a close aunt and another sister what had happened, and they both reacted saying they had no idea it was under wraps and it could just have easily been one of them letting it slip. 

So basically, I now live in fear my niece and nephew are going to tell their cousins that their dad was previously married, that it will shock them, and that it will be a terrible and somewhat traumatic way to find out. It’s too much to ask of a 9 and 17 year old to keep something like that a secret from their cousins IMO and I wish my sister would just tell her kids in a controlled, peaceful setting so they would ‘t have to risk finding out from their cousins!

1294,Asshole,"So me and my girlfriend have a unique relationship in many ways that don't matter here. Starting a month or so after we got together, I brought up the fact that I'm uncomfortable with certain things she wears. These things include open bottom things like dresses and skirts, and lowcut tops (her breasts are above average and it makes me uncomfortable for them to be hanging out). She never had a problem with it for over a year, but we just had a fight over it. She feels that what I want is too 'old fashioned' and that she wants to wear whatever she wants and now she wants to take a break. I feel like I could be in the wrong but I don't know and even if I am in the wrong, I don't know what to do because I can't change how I feel about it.

EDIT: Some are asking for more info and questioning the 'unique' factor. My girlfriend and I have an old fashioned relationship to start, she's said before that she likes the old fashioned relationship dynamic. It's only recently that she seemed to reject the idea of this. Despite this, I read lots of your comments and I had a conversation with her last night and apologised and told her that I still felt uncomfortable with it, which as many pointed out is something that I am well within my right to be, but I would not be mad or bring it up anymore and I realise how shitty I was being. Some people tried to defend me because I didn't contain much context into how the fight was. Basically, I was really being an asshole and I was being controlling. I don't defend my actions. She decided to try again with me, which I'm grateful for, and I hope I don't fuck it up again. As for the fact that I was uncomfortable with this to start with, I might have to seek help as I have a few other insecurities that bother me from time to time.

1297,Not the A-hole,"So I  am not even sure where to begin with this shitstorm. But I am bringing this up because my mom and dad usually have my niece over during spring and summer breaks making them awkwardly always have to tell me to not come over and visit. I have also actively not attended Christmas for the past 5 years. This has caused my grandma a lot of distress because it's the one time of year my whole family gathers together. 

Getting down to the issue, 5 or so years back I was still living at my parents home (at 23) and my boyfriend(24) ended up moving in with me for a couple years so we could save up to get our own place. Winter break rolls around and my niece 11 at the time is spending a week with us. Normal week nothing weird. I was pretty much in charge of taking care of her. The thing that was bothering me though was she had gotten a kindle for Christmas and was going into chat sites. She showed me some chats she was having with guys admitting they were 20 or older and she was telling them she was 13. I got concerned and let my mom know so we changed the wifi password and pretended the internet was down the rest of her stay. 

Edit for info: yes we told her mother who said she didn't care about using parental control on her internet at home. In fact she thought we were accusing her of being a bad mother. Also maybe another thing I glossed over her mom is my half sibling. My mother is not my sister's mom.

Fast forward almost a year later to October my mom shows up at my work in the middle of my shift and tells my boss there is a family emergency and I need to leave work. She drives me to a coffee shop and basically says that my niece accused my boyfriend of molesting her to a counselor at her school. This caused him to be kicked out of the house with no warning,  I went with him we slept in our car for a week then at my grandma's for another luckily we found an apartment after that. I'm glossing over a lot of hardship and drama so we can get to the point. 

So a few years pass things are awkward I pretty much convinced my whole family minus my sister and her husband aka my niece's parents that my boyfriend was innocent and finally she even confessed to my mom just this past winter break that nothing happened now that she is 16 and a bit more mature. Basically she broke down crying and felt awful and just wanted to see us again. I'd also just got married to said boyfriend so I think this sparked the conversation. 

My mom is fully expecting me to have a chat with her and try to work things out so I can rejoin Christmas. I just feel like she ruined a huge part of my life. I'm still getting anxiety stress just typing this out. I  get that she was just a dumb kid with overactive fantasies.  Am I maybe angry at the wrong person? 

Edit for info: Yes we were questioned by CPS, no they did not issue any sort of arrest. Her parents still believe her which is technically good parent behavior. My brother in law has threatened to beat up my husband if he ever saw his face in person.

Tldr; neice accused my boyfriend(now husband)of molesting her, years later confessed it wasn't true. Mom wants me to reconcile with her so I can attend Christmas. ",54,62,0.93

1299,Asshole,"Last month was the best month of my life- after years of busting my ass, I finally got a likely letter from Columbia. As a black woman who went to a predominantly white school (PWI) and the first person in my family to go to college, this is a REALLY big deal for me. I’m still so excited I can’t stop smiling :).

The issue here is that I’m in a group chat with 5 other students at PWIs in my city (not gonna specify, but very large and well known), and a lot of us got into top 50 schools. We discussed having a black student only graduation event, and inviting other black students and their families (we think we can get around 20 graduates). We want to invite kids from the lower income inner city elementary schools so they can shoot for the stars.

Yesterday, I managed to secure a venue at one of the public schools in my city. I was extremyl excited, and rushed to tell my friend Kate. Kate is one of my best friends at my school, and she is usually on board when I talk about diversity initiatives. But this time, she said “you know (my name), I’ve been holding this in for a month, but I got into Brown yesterday and the fact that you’re excluding all the other people who achieved their dreams and having your own special ceremony disappoints me.”

I tried to explain to Kate that the event was mainly to inspire black kids, but she asked me why not inspire all kids to shoot for their dreams. I pointed out that black kids tend to go to shittier schools with less opportunities, and need role models who made it. However, Kate just told me that all kids need role models, and implied I was an asshole for even thinking about this event.

So reddit- am I the asshole?

tl;dr: Want to have a faux-graduation ceremony for black students to recognize their achievements and inspire at-risk youth. However, since my event does not include all races, my friend Kate called me out for being unfair. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to elaborate on why this event is so important to me. When I got into college, my 14 year old cousin became  VERY interested in talking to me about college, and the middle schoolers that I tutor as well. I only want to have an event like this because it's the best way to reach kids who might not even have college on their radar. The reality is that in those school districts, there aren't a lot of poor white kids. I think it's the best way to reach a group that's underrepresented and a group I see struggle on a day to day basis.

&#x200B;

Edit #2: Genuine question: what would be a fair alternative? I want to be inclusive, but the poor kids in my neighborhood, no matter their race, won't be ""inspired"" by rich white and asian kids in a ceremony because they can't relate to those people. I think the event is very important for promoting success and showing kids they CAN beat the odds against them, and I don't want to scrap the whole idea. So what would be the most fair, less asshole solution?",207,68,0.74

1301,Not the A-hole,"I’ll try to keep this short even though there are a lot of details. My dad, uncle I’m not really close to, and his 16 year old son are all attending a family wedding over the weekend. I’m 30, close to the groom and have already sunk a lot of time and money into the various out of state parties leading up to this, so I’m trying to do this as cheaply as possible. I agreed to split a hotel room with my dad, but after seeing the high prices of hotels in the area, suggested an Airbnb. After finding a particularly pricy one that was up to his standards, he mentioned that we should leave enough room for the uncle and cousin. I say okay, and think that’s even better because then my dad and uncle can split the bill between them as usual, and I’ll just give my dad half of his share. My dad calls my uncle to confirm, and upon hearing the uncle balk at the price, blurts out that we can split it three ways instead of two. I get pretty mad about this because we didn’t discuss this and now I’m paying way more than I planned to. Now, I know the 16 year old is in no way to be held financially responsible for the weekend. However, I don’t think it’s fair that my dad and I have to subsidize the uncle’s room share, when he and my cousin are taking up just as much of the house. It’s equivalent to my dad and I splitting a hotel as planned, then going next door and giving my uncle more money to keep things fair.

I make bagels on weekends, and I've always shared them with my neighbor and her kids. I text her when they're done, and the kids come over to my apartment, where I let them choose the ones they want. Sometimes they hang out and chat, other times they just leave with bagels in tow. Usually the mom doesn't come, and I remind the kids to take one for her. 

Last weekend I was already running late when I was taking them out of the oven, so I didn't text the neighbor. I just grabbed four and put them in a bag that I hung on their door knob. When I get back to my apartment, I see my neighbor has texted me asking if she can come by. She comes with her kids, holding the bag I'd left them. She takes out one of the bagels, and accuses me of purposely giving them the ugly ones. I am in awe. I ask her to give me the bag so I can take a look, and then I tell her to get out. Now she is in awe. Amazing.

The assholish part is that the bagels are mostly for the enjoyment of the kids. I know that they were not doing the complaining, as they like the ""ugly"" bagels because they have extra crispy ends. When they were standing by their mother, they looked extremely uncomfortable, and the girl looked like she was about to cry when I kicked them out. Although the kids are free to come by on future weekends, I don't plan to text my neighbor anymore, so they don't have a way of knowing that. They didn't come by this weekend and it made me a little sad :(

1308,UPDATE,"A few months ago, I posted [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if I was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. It blew up. It ended up on Twitter. People shared it to Facebook.

The general consensus was, yes, that I am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. A couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. More than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

Well.

After I posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. She started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. Everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

Then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""Do you seriously fucking think that I *actually like* eating at Olive Garden?""

Guys, she saw the post. She was *furious*. 

She doesn't like Olive Garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. I was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's Latino, do I ever see her make pasta? No. A meal isn't complete without rice. You don't know me at all.""

She yelled about Olive Garden for a solid twenty minutes. It wasn't just about Olive Garden, but it was a lot about Olive Garden.

Long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. She ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 So, yeah.

TL;DR: I ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. I didn't take her out on dates and I didn't pay enough attention. I would do anything to fix everything.

Edit: To clarify a few things

1. I didn't post on April First.

2. I say that she yelled about ""mostly Olive Garden"" because she did. She was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over Olive Garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. She did not call herself Latino. She calls herself Latinx, but I thought Latino would be less confusing. Guess it just made me look like a dick.",2768,22944,0.85

Full disclosure, I’m not in the best shape I’d like to be (I weigh around 170 pounds and am 5’5 ) so I could definitely stand to lose 10-20 pounds which I plan on doing anyways over the next two years before the wedding

The first thing my mom asked me after getting engaged is if I had an idea for dresses yet and if I was going to lose weight for the wedding. I said I was planning to drop about 10-20 lbs but instead they insisted I should lose at least 50-60 or else I would regret my wedding day forever. I’ve only been engaged for about a month but I’ve heard these comments enough times that if I had a dollar for each time, I’d have enough to pay for my wedding and then some

Now background story. My mom had me at 22 and decided she was not ready to raise a child so she left me at my grandparents when I was less than 1 and let them raise me. Throughout my upbringing she was not there and constantly missed parts of my life. The biggest one being that she used to promise to come to my birthdays, school/sports events but then never showed. She claimed me every year on her taxes but never gave the money to either myself or my grandparents. My mom also has never apologized for not being there and instead thinks I owe her so much and that she’s the reason I’m so successful (I’m not that successful, I just have a normal middle class job  working for a start up and save carefully as much as I can). 

Today after another slew of comments I decided to text my mom since I was simply at my breaking point. I sent “this is the last time I am saying this but if one more person in this family comments on my weight or that I’m too fat to get married then I will cancel the wedding and elope and that’s that. You are free to tell grandma if you like as well.”

My mom has now turned the whole situation on me and stated that she never said anything like that to me and that if my grandma was saying things like that then I should tell her instead. I was like ok well, maybe I’m being harsh so I then tried to explain to her how hurtful stuff like that is and that she absolutely does bring up my weight every time we speak and not to deny it.  I asked her to put herself in my shoes and imagine if she was engaged and her mom was bringing up her weight constantly. My mom is now saying that I’m just using her as a punching bag and that I’ve treated her like this my whole life which I don’t understand since we’ve barely had a relationship for a majority of my life.I’m so frustrated and been bawling me eyes out all night since I really am considering just eloping and cutting my family off completely.

Shortly before we were to move in together, she passed away. It was at this time that my boyfriend adopted a puppy.

We broke up for a month due to other issues, and while we were apart, I got a puppy. When we got back together, my boyfriend was so upset. He said it’s too hard with two untrained puppies, so he made my give my puppy to my parents for over a year (he said my puppy could move back in when it was older and better behaved). My puppy is a male chihuahua and is pretty territorial and aggressive, so I got him fixed.

My boyfriend says I have to give my dog back to my parents. I don’t want to. Plus my parents don’t want to take him back anyways, besides he’s my dog and I just want him with me so badly. I said this is not fair, he’s going back on his promise of me getting to keep my puppy. What do I do? Am I the asshole for getting the pup while we were broken up? I gave the puppy to my parents for well over a year and held up my side of the bargain. Now that it’s time for my dog to live here, my boyfriend refuses. Please help AITA?

EDIT— The lease is in both of our names and we split the rent and utilities and bills down the middle. The owner knows that we have my boyfriend’s dog here but I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if I told him I wanted my dog here too, especially if I gave him an additional pet deposit. 





**tl;dr** when my dog was 12 years old she sadly passed away, so I got a puppy a few months later to heal my sadness. My boyfriend made me give the puppy to my parents for a year because he says it’s too hard and that we can take him back once he’s older. The time has come, I got him fixed, and besides him growling and snipping sometimes (which has greatly improved since I got him fixed) he’s a pretty good dog. My boyfriend has no patience and wants me to give him back to my parents. I don’t want to do that and don’t think it’s fair. AITA for trying to convince him to let me keep my puppy? That was always the deal and now he’s changing it on me ",172,191,0.92
1317,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: Cockfighting is (unfortunately) still legal in Mexico. I am very against the sport, as I view it as barbaric and cruel. My grandparents own a condo in the country and invited me down for spring break. They wanted to show us the local culture in the town they are in, and took us to a ranch that raised fighting cocks. I initially did not want to go in, but I also did not want to disappoint my grandparents. They are almost 90, and we don't know how long they have left. I begrudgingly went in and pretended everything was fine. It started out innocently enough, with the rancher letting us hold the roosters. Then, I got more and more uncomfortable. He put the roosters in a cockfighting ring and had my brother and I stand on opposite sides and release the fighting cocks to simulate a match. I found out that usually, a cockfight results in both animals dying, but for this demonstration, the rancher put ""gloves"" on them so neither would get hurt (still barbaric in my opinion, though). After a couple minutes of watching them attack each other, he gathered them up and put them back in their cages. 

I was pretty disgusted by the spectacle but figured no harm was done and we left. Then, I found out that my mom and grandpa filmed me doing this. I found a video of me looking pretty uncomfortable holding a rooster obviously meant for cockfighting. When I got back to the condo, I quickly deleted anything that had me in it. When my mom and brother found out about this, they were pissed. Evidently, they are not as against the sport as I am. I had deleted the video of my brother participating because it had me in it as well. It was the only video that actually showed the roosters fighting. However, I did not delete the other pictures of him and my mom holding the animals, only the ones with me. They said that I should have asked before doing this, but I held firm that I didn't care if they allowed me to or not. I did not want a photo of myself doing something that I have a huge ethical issue with, even if it was legal and only done to make my grandparents happy. 


Was I in the wrong for deleting these without asking first? I don't regret it, as I don't want anyone getting the idea that cockfighting is something I support. Should I have kept the video if my brother wanted me to?


Also, how should I approach my grandparents about this? They have footage of me as well, which I would like them to delete, but I don't want to hurt their feelings or act less grateful for how inviting me.

1318,Asshole,"My sister and I are both vegan, though she has been for much longer. She recently made the assertion that it's fine to not ask if something has dairy/eggs/etc. if there isn't any other possible vegan option to eat when traveling. I thought that was irresponsible as a vegan, and that she was being lazy. Her response was that I was being too militant and enforcing my ideas on her. I'm not budging from my position of 100% veganism being the goal, and she is not budging from the position of not bothering to find out if something is vegan when she isn't sure.

EDIT: Thank you for the candid feedback. I thought some clarification might save my face and that of other vegans: I'm never this militant with anyone else other than my sister; I love when my meat-eating friends make small changes. I happen to see my sister as a ""vegan role model"" (and the fact that she is a self-declared vegan), and I was taken aback when I learned she wasn't perfect. Also, kinda thought being vegan was a strict, 100% no animal-products definition (where the gatekeeping arises), but I'm in the wrong, it seems.

1320,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my ex broke up with me nine months ago, and it emotionally crushed me. Once he found out he would not be going to the college we planned on going to together, he started to become very distant. He would only send a goodmorning text and not speak to me for the rest of the day.

It started to get worse and worse. I had an unhealthy dependence on his attention due to me being young, naive, and convinced he was the only one who would want to ever be with me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or even think. I felt terrible, emotionally and physically. I eventually called him and asked him if he was doing alright, because I thought maybe he was going through something he wasn't telling me about. He said everything was fine and I asked him if we could improve our communication and he said ""I'll try.""

Not even a week passes before it gets much worse. I called him again, and left him a message telling him exactly how I've been feeling and how I need communication to improve because I was so anxious and stressed out.

He called back and left a message saying that the distance was getting to him, that he hadn't loved me for the past month, and that he wanted to end things. I called him back, leaving a message saying that if he wanted to break up I would respect his decision, but I remember just being to torn up about it. We eventually were both able to get on a call and he just gave the sweet nothings of ""you mean the world to me but in a different way"" and ""there are so many better guys out there than me"". I was still devastated. I slowly forced myself to put away all the pictures of him in my closet.

Fast forward six months. I've improved myself in so many ways. I branched out and tried new things. I have a much healthier relationship with myself. I'm much happier with my capabilities, and I was accepted to my dream college. Basically, I'm thriving. I get an unexpected message from my ex. We talked for a bit, then he said ""Can I talk to you about something?""

He drops a bomb that in the past six months he never stopped thinking about me. Things at his college reminded him of me. He's unsure of himself, but he feels bad about the way things ended and wants me back. I'm taken aback, and I know I don't want to get back together with him. I've finally accepted that part of the unhealthy relationship I had with myself was because he was mentally abusive. He was manipulative and good at telling people what they wanted to hear. I’m also just not attracted to him anymore.

He says he's going to try to transfer to the college i'm going to next year, and that he can see a future with me. Eventually he says ""I want to be with you."" And I left him at that. I ghosted him. It's been three months since then, and I still haven't spoken to him. Am I the asshole for not giving him closure?

1321,No A-holes here,"This literally just happened 20 minutes ago and I've been sitting wondering if I just came across as an ass to this 13 year old neighbor. 

I was sitting on my couch when I heard a bang. Through the window, beside the front door, I saw a kid come onto our porch and retrieve a baseball. I didn't think much of it and figured it must've just been a bad throw. However two minutes later, it happened again. I initially got up to just tell the kid to be a bit more careful, but when I looked outside he was playing catch in our yard. And was having his friend/sibling/whatever throw to him. I honestly just felt like it was rude. I mean, he was probably a good 10-15 feet from my front door and in the past 5 minutes had managed to hit the ball against our house twice. What if I knocked out a window? So I made a comment of ""are you playing in our yard?"" with a rather annoyed tone of voice. To which he replied, ""oh... sorry..."" and walked back to his yard.

1322,Asshole,"My boyfriend claims he's Italian. He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.

His mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised ""the Italian way"", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. 

As things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.

But it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like ""I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian"". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.

Just because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?

1324,Not the A-hole,"Hello Reddit 

I’ll get right to it. My sister got a pet mouse last month for her birthday gift. While I am absolutely terrified of mice, since I did get bit by one as a kid, my sister would constantly bring the mouse to me, unannounced. (Such as when I was in my bedroom, or even when I ate dinner) 

Last Friday, it was in the morning. My sister decided to come into my room with the mouse, but I guess since I was still sleeping, she decided to wake me up and show me it. She placed the mouse on my pillow beside my face, and then woke me up. Once I was awake, I saw the mouse and almost had an heart attack. I picked up my pillow and threw it at away from me, which then hit the wall on the opposite side of my room. (My room is kinda small) With the mouse still on the pillow. The head of the mouse cracked/came opened, and he died.  My sister began crying saying that I was the one who killed her mouse. My parents got mad at me, and since Friday they literally haven’t talked to me. When I try and ask them something, they pretend I’m not even there.

And yeah, I do feel terrible for the mouse, since obviously it didn’t deserve death. But AITA?",85,150,0.91
1325,Not the A-hole,"Okay so I am a 22 year old woman living in an apartment with my best friend. Today is Sunday, she works and I don't. I ordered food from a company that could rhyme with Floor Crash. My driver arrived quickly and the food was right, however:

When he arrived and I opened my door, he smiled at me in a way that made me uncomfortable. I thanked him, quickly took my food, and closed and locked my door. Not even two minutes later I received a text message that said, verbatim, ""Hey u really pretty and I mean no disrespect but if you don't have a man can we hang out sometime [personal phone number]"".

I was immediately super uncomfortable, because as far as he knows I live alone and he has my address. I didn't answer him and immediately reported him. Almost all of my female friends I told, including my roommate, were equally shocked and agreed with me. My dad, partner, and brothers agreed with me. But a few of my other female friends and almost all of my male friends said I was an asshole, that I probably got him fired for it, and that it was him harmlessly shooting his shot. I'm conflicted, because the main reason I'm uncomfortable is that I'm at home. If I were in public I'd have politely declined and walked away, but I'm at home.

So, reddit, AITA?

Edit: so I've had a lot of people comment and message me saying I'm an asshole because I found him unattractive, and I encourage those people to practice reading comprehension. Nowhere did I state whether or not I found him attractive because I don't care. It doesn't matter either way.

1326,Not the A-hole,"I was on a 14 hour flight recently sitting in coach. I am a tall guy and my legs are long and generally flying on airplanes is an overall extremely uncomfortable experience. I try to book seats with extra leg room on long flights such as exit seats or front row seats but there were none available when I was booking the flight. I used to only book aisle seats so I could intermittently stretch my legs out into the row but have had my knee smashed into by a cart and no longer take that approach. I would have even considered splurging on business class for such a long flight but those were all booked too.

I'm sitting in my window seat and around two hours into the flight, the lady in front of me reclines her seat back around half way. This made me moderately more uncomfortable but I was OK with this as she paid for her ticket too and should be able to recline if she wants to. About 10 minutes later, she reclines her seat all of the way back essentially pinning my legs underneath her to the point where it was impossible to move them without hitting the back of her seat. Reclining my own seat back would not give me extra leg room based on how these seats were designed. I first attempt to readjust and slip my leg underneath to the space beneath her seat but this plane's seat configuration was so cramped that I was unable to do that. Now, the readjusting of my legs to try and find a comfortable position was hitting the back of her chair. She turns around to me and says ""Can you stop that?"" and before I have a chance to answer lies back down, puts on her headphones and eyemask and turns around to go back to sleep.

Well, I didn't stop trying to adjust my leg as I wasn't going to be able to tolerate being in significant pain and losing leg circulation for 12 hours. After a few more minutes of this, she gets up again, turns to me and says ""what are you doing? you need to stop kicking my chair"". I respond to her that the seat of her back is crushing my legs and I'm trying to adjust them into a comfortable position. She literally scoffs at me, then attempts to recline her back FURTHER despite it being at max recline, and goes back to sleep.

This significantly pissed me off so I began to move my leg more vigorously and this started to really rock the back of her chair. After about five minutes of this, she reclined her seat back up and went back to sleep. She did not recline it back for the rest of the flight.

AITA?

Edit: I think that I need to clarify a few things based on the responses I’ve read.

1. As I stated above, I generally try to book more comfortable seats for me way in advance. However nothing was available for the day I needed to fly out. Obviously, I would have picked any exit seat on any plane for that day but there were only a few flights for my location and nothing more comfortable was available. For anyone that thinks that I chose this seat “for my own convenience”, I don’t find 14 hours of torture a good time.  Furthermore, I’ve been on plenty of flights in non extra leg room seats and have never been in a situation where my legs were this severely pinned even with the person in front in full recline. Usually I can just slide my legs under the seat in front of me but this specific plane seat did not allow for that as the space underneath did not have enough room for my legs.

2. For everyone saying YTA because I decided to kick her seat to get my way, that is not what happened. She went into full recline and laid down on my legs. Realizing that I was unable to move my legs without brushing the back of her seat, I made as gentle of motions as possible to move my legs trying to not disturb her as much. There was no way that I could keep my legs completely still as it hurt and felt like I was losing blood supply and I was trying to find a position where that was not the case. After this dissatisfied her and she deliberately tried to crush me, I stopped caring about moving them gently and moved them freely to try to find a position. In no way was I purposely kicking her chair (though she may have deserved that after how she treated me) because that is clearly an asshole move and I wouldn’t be posting this question or using the term “more vigorously” instead of “kick”. 

3. In hindsight, I agree that I should have complained to the flight attendant after I was deliberately crushed. However, I kind of wanted to avoid further confrontation because it was a full plane and I felt that the chances of me being able to move to a better or different seat were low. I have in the past always been able to find a position for my legs that works. If I was not able to, I would have complained to the flight attendant but by that point the lady in front of me had already put her back up.

He also has ADHD, and his behaviour is absolutely atrocious.  We actually think his diagnosis should be Opposition Defiant Disorder but apparently not enough is known to diagnose that here.

1336,Asshole,"Finally edit: Thank you everyone for your input and advice! I'm about to log out of this throwaway account. I really appreciate how active and quick this community is. It helps me a lot to hear different viewpoints and get ideas for why the situation might have happened, and the YTA comments help me keep my temper in check. :) Thank you guys! I might come back later and update if I end up having a conversation with my friend.

\-

I have a young friend who has several tiny toddlers including an infant. Because I feel bad for her being stuck at home, whenever she tells me she wants to go clothes shopping or furniture shopping I occasionally babysit all of them, even though they're so little. I'm well enough compensated for it, and I enjoy children so I don't really mind it.

However I found out recently that even when she tells me she's going to a certain place, she's actually been going to her husband's work to make out/have sex with him there. When I ask her where all she went, because I'm curious about her shopping as a friend, she would outright lie to me like ""Ohhh there was a lot of traffic that's why it took so long"" or ""I actually spent a long time walking around in that store and looking at everything haha"".

I don't mind that she feels a need to spend time with her husband, and I've even babysat when they've gone out on dates late into the night.

However, I feel extremely insulted and grossly taken advantage of because she's been so dishonest especially ABOUT sexual stuff, so I told her I won't babysit again without telling her the reason. I feel like if she's using my time and energy of babysitting to be out and about, the least humanly decent thing would be to be honest if I ask how she spent that time. Or at least say ""I'd rather not let you know"" instead of full blown-out lies.

Should I not care so much? Would I be an asshole if I called her out on her actions directly?

Edit: GUYS, it's not that I want to ""know the details of her sex life"". A simple ""Oh haha I actually dropped by hubby's place and spent the time with him"" is plain and direct. All I would have asked for. Instead of the elaborate lies.

Edit #2: Thank you everyone for the honest replies and the advice! I'm not their ""babysitter""-- since we're all friends, I want to find a good way to let them know that I know about the deceit and it bothered me, because lying is never normal.

Update: Thank you for all the replies I appreciate it. The party was today and it went well. My sister in law, who is my niece’s step mother told me that I shouldn’t worry about her stepdaughter’s sister, she’s known to only want to hang out with her siblings if there is a party, otherwise they don’t really speak much.

1339,Asshole,"Hello, hope you're all well today.
A long while ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine, say 'Sarah', and I had a very tumultuous relationship. We were on and off, but eventually while together I found out she started cheating on me with a guy she lied about for years.

I believe she's otherwise a good person. We just weren't right for each other and she handled it very poorly. I had handled other aspects of our relationship poorly; I'm no saint. We've worked hard to re-forge a friendship and it's gone pretty well all things considered. She's made immense strides as a person and has earnestly apologized to me for the past.

Her birthday was this weekend and is incredibly important to her, so she came to visit me and we went out together to have some fun. Currently, her boyfriend, say 'Henry', is in jail right now for a victimless crime, so he's unavailable. Of course if Henry weren't in jail, they'd be spending the day together. That's fine and obvious.

What's bothering me is that he calls her from jail to ""thank"" me for taking her out on her birthday. She and I got into a very brief argument about this. She thinks this is a kind and thoughtful thing for him to say, and I think it's very insulting to both her and myself. My reasoning is as follows:

1) She's my friend, I don't need his permission or thanks to go have fun with her on her birthday, or any occasion for that matter.

2) Her and her birthday celebration is not a responsibility to just be handed off when he goes to jail. She is not an object. I took her out because I enjoy her company and recognize she loves her birthday, not because I was ""covering"" for him. I'm not his subordinate for when he's not around.

3) His ""thanks"" implies a statement that I'm a convenience for when he's not around. I don't like being treated as if I'm only worth hanging out with when he's not around. I think I'm worth more than that.

She disagrees with me and thinks I'm over-reading. It sounds like a trivial point, but I don't think it is.
So, AITH?

Thanks for your time for whoever responds.",30,73,0.93

1341,Not the A-hole,"My extremely narcissistic and abusive ex husband wants our son to be tested for a donor match because he has cancer in both kidneys and needs a donor kidney. I have several issues with this and I'm wondering if I'm being a bitch because if I don't agree to this he could die if he doesn't find a donor soon.

\#1 Ex wanted me to abort our son because a 5 month amniocentesis showed he MIGHT have birth defects. When I refused the abortion he left me. He didn't come back until after son was born with nothing more than mild hearing loss/mild learning disabilities.

\#2 Turns out he was cheating during the time he was gone and that he'd been having an affair with the woman (his first ex wife) for almost the entire duration of his marriage to me (at which time she was also married to someone else). When son was only 2 months old the ex packed up and left and has been with her ever since although he's never married her. He's actually told me our entire 13 year marriage was a mistake and that he wishes he'd never met me.

\#3 Son is now 16 years old and his father hasn't seen him since he was 4 - by his OWN choice. He's also way behind in child support - like $30,000. But could easily afford to pay it as he makes a high six figure salary.

\#4 Son is high functioning autistic and very emotionally vulnerable. He HATES his father for abandoning him, especially since his father seems to be quite happily parenting his ex-wife's kids from her second husband (although considering the duration of their affair - most of our marriage apparently - I suppose those kids could be his. They are much younger than my son).

\#5 I'm almost 100% sure that if I allow this to happen the ex will simply disappear from our son's life all over again once he finds out he's not a match or even if he does match and acts as the donor. Because being out of his only child's life for over 10 years is pretty much proof to me that he doesn't give a damn about him. And if he doesn't care about us, why the hell should we care about him?

\#6 Kidney cancer actually runs very strongly in my ex-husband's family. His father died of it, his grandfather died of it, and 2 of his father's sisters died of it. Which means it's entirely possible my son will end up getting it as well, which would mean if he only had one kidney left due to being a donor, he'll be in a worse position than his father currently is.

So am I right to want to protect my child from being used by a father who doesn't care about him, or am I a bitch for being willing to let him die by not letting his child be his organ donor? FYI I have not told my son about this request and if/when I do I have a feeling he won't agree to it at first but his father could probably manipulate him into it very easily if I allow his father to talk to him. And his father could easily use the court system to force me to let him spend time with our son.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Based on reading the comments I had a long talk with my son last night about the situation. His response was that his father had been dead to him for years so why should he care if he dies for real? Then literally went on to ask me if I thought he'd end up inheriting enough money to buy a high end gaming computer and a new car. So it's pretty obvious he doesn't give a damn. I must admit I was a little appalled by his callous reaction but considering his therapist thinks he's probably NPD like his father and his grandmother (can't be legally diagnosed until he's 18) I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.",147,588,0.96
1342,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone,

Growing up, I was obese.  Very obese.  Throughout my adolescent and high school years, I was 200 +lbs.  At 5'2, that's a lot of weight to carry and my peers definitely never let me forget it.  My mother, with whom I love very much, has always been very thin and I remember being seven years old and wanting to spend time with her - while in her room, she would try on clothes and ask me if I thought she looked fat.  She fat shamed people in front of me and would always point out how I was the biggest girl in the room.  She told me about the salad diet and fed me only salad for dinner many times.

After graduating college, she told me I would never find a job or a partner if I didn't lose weight.  EVERYTHING I ate was a constant reminder that I would be useless in every day life.

Three years ago, I made a complete lifestyle change and successfully shed nearly 80lbs from my frame.  Though I physically look well and healthy, I have a twisted and distorted way of viewing food.  I exercise nearly 90 minutes a day, eat the same foods over and over again day after day, and feel unbelievably guilty every time I eat one little cookie or cupcake.  I have no friends or romantic partners because I schedule life around eating and going to the gym.  I truly hate this.

Last night, my mother and I had a full on BLOW UP.  Now she told me I was too thin and was worried about me.  I ended up going absolutely crazy and told her she was the reason I am the way I am - afraid of eating - that my earliest memories are of her weighing herself in front of me and telling me how no one would ever love me if I wasn't ""skinny"". It was pretty fucking bad and my father had to separate us.

I cried myself to sleep.  This morning, my brother called me and demanded that I apologize to her.  While I admit I had a breakdown, this has been building up inside of me for years and came to a head when she made a comment about how I should now eat MORE than what was on my plate.

While I understand WE are responsible for the choices we make in life, I can't help but feel that she led me down a very dangerous road.  I want to get better .. I truly do .. and I want to live a healthy and happy life, but there's that voice in my head telling me I will never be good enough unless I'm thin.  She reinforced this on me every day growing up.

If I am an asshole for losing my shit, I am sorry .. but I needed to get it out.",30,178,0.97
1343,Not the A-hole,"Context:

I'm a female student who has a male friend, let's call him Ed. I also have a boyfriend who lives overseas  whom Ed has met and even got along with when my bf visited me for 2 weeks. During the time that my bf was in town, Ed did not bother me at all and acted civilly. 

Me and Ed have the same classes and sit next to one another and do homework together sometimes. 

However, some of Ed's behaviors really bother me:
- He touches my legs sometimes (I told him I don't like it)
- He looks at my phone or laptop and makes comments about whatever I'm doing (I also told him I find that intrusive). Or he'll laugh as if I'm looking up something stupid. 
- He looks for me around campus when I just wanna study alone without distraction. The last time he did it , he skipped class to find me . He then just towered above me without saying anything, and left. Then he came to my class to make up for the skipped one. 
- When I got new shoes, he asked if they're new. I said yes and that they're expensive and I had to save up. Then he grabbed my arm and started repeatedly stepping on them. 

I always forgave him but this past Friday all the frustration built up. After our class ended, he tried to snatch my lipstick from me after I was done applying it and I yelled at him ""What the fuck?"" And he just started mocking me by repeating what the fuck? What the fuck ?"" In front of everyone , even louder. I stormed out of class and ran to a bathroom to cry for almost an hour. 

After being consoled by my friend I told Ed that I was reporting him. I went to a school counselor and explained the situation. She reported Ed to the Dean of students and said that he will have a talk with Ed. 

Ed texted me saying I ruined his day and that it's unfair to him that this will affect his record. I assured him that this is not on the record unless the behavior repeats. He also excused his harassment in text:

 - ""I never harassed you when I helped you on a test""
-  ""I grew up isolated and never got accustomed to the same norms as you"" ( he grew up in an all male boarding school)
-  ""yes, there is always something new, but every time you told me you dislike it I stopped"". (Not true at all
- ""I didn't try to snatch your lipstick, I wanted to see if you changed your lip balm"" (gaslighting) 
- ""Stepping on your shoes was a mistake, I apologized already"" (gaslighting, it was not a mistake, but very deliberate) 

I responded by saying I am not ready to talk and that I dislike his stalking me. 

On Saturday (yesterday) he brought flowers and a note to my house saying "" we shouldn't be like this, let's talk when you're ready"" . I felt creeped out, especially considering I had told him that I'm not ready to talk and dislike stalking 

Reddit, am Am I the Asshole for reporting him? I feel like I overreacted.  

What should I do now? We take all classes together. 


EDIT: He already knew where I live because we sometimes would study at my place. I never let him in my bedroom and we would only hang out in the common area. I was courteous and made him food and tea, maybe that made him feel to comfortable. 

I also never flirted with him or touched him. 

Also, we are both college students , in our 20's.  Not high school. 

UPDATE: 

Ed continues to stalk me,  even changing his routine to stay in the same class after his section was over so that he can spend the same class with me.  When he follows me he does it insidiously as if he also has business being where I am.

I reported him to university  police who called him with a warning. I will pursue his removal. I don't think this kind of malice is acceptable. 

Update 2:

My University Title IX office believes none of that behavior is grounds for filing against him. Ed has also bad-mouthed about me to our professor (an old sexist male)  and got him on his side. I know because I  accidentally saw the email the professor printed out defending Ed to title IX office and saying I ""WAY overreacted"" and that ""his foreign student status would make title IX penalties way too harsh"" (he could get kicked out of the country for this).

1344,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I split over a year ago.  He had been cheating on me.  He wanted to and still wants to work through it, but that’s not even a possibility.  I have a son who will soon be 16.  The divorce was hard on him, especially because he didn’t understand why it was happening.  I just told him that his father and I couldn’t make it work anymore and that these things sometimes happen.  It’s never been a good enough reason for him.  

His father takes him every other weekend.  He’s been filling my son’s head with ideas of us some day getting back together.  Then I get to explain to my son that it’s not going to happen.  Of course at that point I get to deal with his anger at the situation.  The way he saw it was that I kicked his father out of the house, split up our marriage, and am now unwilling to even try to work through it with his poor victim of a father.  

Ive talked to my ex about him bringing our son into our issues before.  His response was that if his son is going to come to him to talk to him, he’s not going to lie about his feelings.  To which I responded, no, but you’ll sure leave a hell of a lot out of it to make me the bad guy.  Then it just turned into an argument before he left. 

My son was giving me attitude recently and I got to the bottom of it.  Apparently my ex is being evicted and my son wants me to let him sleep on the couch until he finds another place.  I said that’s not going to happen and he said that’s why he didn’t even ask.  Then went on about how this used to be his house too and I’m the one who divorced him and won’t try get back together.  It’s not fair that I treat him like shit over nothing. 

I had enough of this bullshit.  I told him it wasn’t over nothing, his father had been cheating on me and he got caught.  He’s the reason our marriage ended.  It was his choices that got us here and he can sleep on the street as far I care.  My son said that I was lying and stormed out.  After he calmed down he came back, but doesn’t want to talk about it.  I’ve been trying to give him some space to process everything.  

I do regret that it came out in anger instead of though out discussion, but my ex misleading him has been getting his hopes up for nothing and then damaging my relationship with him when I dash them.

i was so excited to not work weekends anymore, getting off at 5 everyday, earning a little more money to pay off my student loans, and having some pocket change for concerts

after about a week of training at my new job, i am told that we are having a mandatory conference in which we will have to stay the night at a hotel in the same city that i live in. their reasoning for making everyone stay even though some of the other offices were within 10 miles of the hotel was that since some people were coming from out of town and they wanted it to be fair for everyone. 

i thought it was stupid they were making us stay in a hotel because my house was less than 5 miles from the hotel and i could easily just go to all the training and the dinner while still being able to go home. however, i decided to get over it & try to get over my fears & anxiety about forced interaction with people who are aren’t like me (i’m a bit of a free spirit) 

upon my arrival to the conference, i overhear one of the girls saying that we are sleeping four to a room and TWO TO A BED. i start to panic and run to the bathroom with tears in my eyes trying to stop myself from having a full blown panic attack. i text in my group message with the girls in my specific office if they knew we would be cosleeping next to someone and they blew it off like it was normal. 

i make it through my 1sr class (i have a history of getting panic attacks so severe that i’m left hyperventilating for hours until i can calm myself down) & as soon as it was over i pulled my supervisor aside and ask her if she knew that we would be sleeping 2 to a bed. she said yes, & i told her that had i known that were the sleeping situation i would of never agreed to it and i would let her know way further ahead of time that i am NOT okay with sleeping in the same bed as someone. she tells me i am over reacting and that it is mandatory and that i’ll be the only girl not staying and it’s gonna make me look like i’m not a “team player”.  she told me that i would have to accept a write up as punishment for not staying. i told her that was fine, i would accept whatever punishment, i felt very disrespected and like i was being pushed to do something i was very uncomfortable with and she just stormed off

after the next class was over my supervisor came to me to tell me that they weren’t going to write me up, but they were officially uninviting me from the company dinner and the bonding exercises that were scheduled after.

So, I started working with my dad for a few days (6 to be exact) and was getting paid by the work day ($100/day), I was about to get my pay for the past 2 days of work when my mom asks me if I could get a $100 outdoor table set for the house since we just got a barbecue, I, being the decent son I am, agree and let her get my pay herself since it would be simpler (my boss IS her husband after all), so she drops me off at home, grabs the money and heads off to walmart. When she comes back, we set up the table and chairs, and head inside. She says nothing about the rest of my money, which is a little strange, but I pay it no mind.

The next day, I wake up and notice she’s not home, not a problem, I’ve been taking care of my little sister for a year now so we pass the time until she comes back, when she does come back I greet her, hug her and go back to my room. After a while, she calls me to the living room, and says “Thank you for the gift!” I’m sort of confused by that and say “Oh, the table? It’s alright.” she then says “No, no, I’m talking about this!” as she points to her wrist, at an Apple Watch, I asked her “did Dad give it to you?” she answers “Oh, no! I just thought that, since your money was with me already, there’s no problem if i buy something!

1349,No A-holes here,"I'm 29 years old. I dated my ex for 4 years and we've been broken up for another 4. Context is hugely important here.

&#x200B;

We had an incredible relationship. I've never felt more loved, happy, and fulfilled. 

I've always been into drugs (weed, coke, molly, etc) but my best friend/dealer managed to get his hands on heroin. I was an idiot who thought statistics didn't apply to me and I tried it. This was 7 years ago. I didn’t touch it again for almost a year until my birthday where I did it. That turned into using it on special occasions to using it weekly and to make a long story short, I became an addict.

&#x200B;

My ex was an angel at that time and *pleaded* with me to get help. I thought I could handle quitting on my own. I couldn't admit to myself I needed help. My personality started changing. I would get irritable and scream at her. I would gaslight her (tell her I only used once that week knowing very well I was high all day everyday). I stole from her (not to mention my parents and friends). I was never physically abusive, but I was a piece of shit and look back in shame of what I was.

&#x200B;

Finally, after two years, she couldn't take it anymore and broke up with me. I was a mess. I was using a LOT more, stealing more, etc. I eventually OD’d and hit rock bottom.

After my overdose, I knew that if I continued on this path, it WILL kill me. My withdrawal lasted for 10 days. It was hell on Earth, but I made it, and haven’t touched any drug since.

I decided to turn my entire life around. I started volunteering at local schools (I worked with administration for local schools and was able to share my experience as an addict to kids), learned new skills to fill my resume gap. I got a job as a statistician a few months later (I majored in statistics in school) and now make decent money. I started working on myself, eating right, lifting, meditation, yoga. During the first couple years, it’s like I traded one addiction (heroin) with another (improving myself). I was scared shitless of becoming the failure I was destined to be in that lifestyle. I gained quite a bit of weight (muscle), look better than I ever had. I repaid every dime I ever stole (wrote them letters and checks individually).

The whole point of this context is to emphasize: I really have changed. I know I made shitty choices and I regret the person I was every day. 

I want to know, would I be the asshole if I reached out to her? I miss her everyday. She was my everything, my world. I’ve never had anybody else I was so happy with. When getting clean, my whole thought process was to become the man she wished I was. And now that I’m here, I just don’t know. I know I caused her so much pain. But I love her, and I want to prove to her that I’m no longer the shitty addict I used to be.

1353,UPDATE,"Hello,

This is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

This last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

This spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

At the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact.

1354,Not the A-hole,"Back in May of 2017 I had a friend who met someone and started dating them within a couple weeks. One month after that they got engaged. Their wedding was set for September. But the Bride to be, the “friend”, wanted it moved to the weekend of August 19. It took place in Boise, Idaho. She had invited me, but I had my own plans. Plans that was 10 years in the making and came to fruition two days later (August 21, 2017). The day of the solar eclipse. 

I live in Florida; the friendship was through social media. In 2007 I learned about the 2017 eclipse and made the promise I would go see it on the path of totality. I even became a truck driver just to have that opportunity. The plan was to fly to Springfield, Missouri and drive to St. Joseph. Weather wasn’t looking good for St. Joseph when I checked the day before, so I changed plans and drove overnight via rental car all the way to Kentucky. All of that succeeded. 10 year promise fulfilled. 

Until the friend door slammed on me. She said I was invited to her wedding, and I was the one guest she wanted to come no matter what. She claimed to have moved the date so friends and family could see the eclipse on the same weekend as the wedding. I told her why I couldn’t come to Boise that weekend even if I wanted to: two months before the eclipse, airline flights, hotels, and rental cars were booked and unavailable in Boise, Salt Lake City, and Denver, not to mention any regional airport in the area. There was no possibility I could get there that weekend. This resulted in a HUGE fight since she thinks I was being selfish for choosing the eclipse over her wedding, saying “there will be more eclipses. I’m only getting married once!” So for months she would say to mutual friends I refused to attend her wedding because she didn’t mean anything to me, because I chose a selfish ambition instead of being there for a friend. Like if I’m not the one getting married, why does my presence mean so much? I sent her my blessings and well wishes, but i said she chose to have the wedding on the same weekend as the biggest celestial event in modern American history. She knew I had planned on seeing the eclipse for 10 years, 8 more years than how many I knew her. But apparently it was selfish of me to choose to see the eclipse from another state.

I told him he can be in the room, hold my hand, hear the baby's first cry, but I do NOT want him front and center staring up my crotch. He is incredibly offended by this. He says this is something he will never have the chance to do again, it's his kid and he deserves to see the moment he/she is brought into this world, etc. I understand his point of view but honestly I just don't want anybody except the doctors and nurses looking at me in such a vulnerable state. ESPECIALLY my husband. I mean, he still has to find me attractive after this, and I'm just afraid that he won't after seeing me rip from my V to my A, and a lot women defecate on the delivery table. It's a pride thing and it's also a shyness thing, I want this moment to be beautiful and joyous and I just don't think it will be that way if he is staring into my vagina while it's happening.

1358,Not the A-hole,"Background: my family has owned a pretty dismal piece of 5 acre property in the middle of the city for almost 100 years. First it was well out of town but as the city grew, it encroached around our property. It was in limbo for many years because of family squabbles and in the 60s three schools were built about equidistant from the property and it bacame a natural hang out spot. I myself hung out there in the 90s. It wasn't winout trouble as there were many fires, lots of drinking and drug use, a ton of trash and I can't even conceptualize how much teenage sex happened there. But also lots of good stuff, there were informal BMX courses, make shift club houses, kids occasionally joined together ro clean it up and it was a more or less safe space to just hang out. 

Maybe 5 years ago a huge name healthy super market went in down the street and the neighborhood was gentrified over night. My cousin also legally waived all his rights to the property and I became sole owner. I got an offer from a high end developer who wanted do build combo retail/living space. 

I knew the value to the community so I approached the city about either selling the land or even giving it to them but the wanted nothing to do with it at the time because of the  reputation. So I sat on. In that time there was another fire, a sack full of opiates found and a homeless man was beat up. I didn't want the liability anymore so I approached the developer, word got out I was selling and a massive bidding war with numbers that made my head spin took place. It's enough money that I could never work again and be comfortable (not extravgent by any means, just comfortable). The city also jumped in at the last minute and offered me a miniscule amount. Greed got the better of me and I took the biggest offer.

I thought I was cool with it but when they broke ground on what will be a very sterile office complex, I felt like I'd made a huge mistake. The ship has sailed but I've taken away a huge part of our community and the growing up experience. The nature of the neighborhood has already changed as I just don't see kids out anymore. 

The ship has sailed and I can't get the property back, but

A. Am I the asshole for selling it in the first place?

B. Am I the asshole for not taking the city's last minute Lower offer? 

C. Not an asshole and I did what most anyone woukd do? ",98,477,0.96
1359,Not the A-hole,"For context my sister and her bf are having issues getting a place to stay due to my sisters past criminal history (non violent). I live with my mom and stepdad in a tiny 3 bed, 2 bathroom house, and we split all rent and utilities 3 ways.

My mom decided to take it upon herself to invite my sister (pregnant with twins) and her boyfriend to move in with us because they can't find a place to stay right now. She never asked me if it was okay, and after confronting her this morning, she refuses to rescind the invitation. I even told her in no uncertain terms that the cops would take my side since my name is on the lease, and told her that they can stay 14 days at most (per the visitor lease agreement). After she refused to change her mind I sent a message to my sister telling her that we will not be able to accommodate both her and her boyfriend. But we would be happy to let just her come stay until they figured something out.

AITA for putting my foot down like that? AITA for turning away my sister and her boyfriend?

Extra considerations:

They would be taking over my tiny bathroom, and in general all the areas I live in most, which isn't a lot of space; and since the entire downstairs is the master bedroom and bathroom, my mom wouldn't be giving anything up living space wise.

1360,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I were with good friends the other night, having drinks and playing games. Later in to the night the party unconsciously divides itself between the men and the women. The women were sitting down at a table talking, and I was watching March Madness with the guys. We’re all talking and laughing when one of the girls walks up behind me, cackles, and says for the whole group of people to hear, “Your mom is the blow-job queen!”. I was so surprised and put-off I responded with, “...hehe...what are you talking about?” Another girl walks up behind her and follows with, “Ya your mom gives the best blow jobs, hahaha, she’s the queen.” Nothing more is said. At this point I’m so surprised two people have repeated that, so I shutdown. I’m not making a frown face, crying, or being aggressive or mean. I just decide to continue watching TV and not talking. 

My wife quickly tells everyone that she has to work early in the morning (which was true), so we will have to leave. After some awkward hugs goodbye (I’m sure our friends could sense something was up), we get in the car. Immediately I am pressed with how I humiliated my wife, how I made it awkward for everyone, and how I was being selfish and unreasonable. I’m so shocked at my wife saying this I get angry. I ask her how she would respond if someone talked about her mother that way. She responds with, “We we’re talking about a game at my bachelorette party and your mom won the game!”. This is the first time I’m getting context. She then proceeds to continue trying to tell me I am wrong because our friends intent wasn’t malicious. I then get upset because not once did she try to understand things from my perspective (zero context to the mom statements, no clarification from friends, etc). 

I felt like she wasn’t on my side and didn’t try to understand where I was coming from, or why I would be upset. I’m embarrassed for shutting down in public, and now I’m dealing with a marital argument. Am I the asshole?",18,37,0.93
1361,Asshole,"My now husband and I got married 1.5 months ago. We had 6 people on each side of the bridal party. This wedding took 3 full years to plan and prepare for. When I got engaged, most of the bridesmaids were very single, including Anna, the ""star"" of this story. Two of them were in long term relationships. I wanted to just give the two partnered bridesmaids plus ones. Anna seemed offended by this, because my wedding was then years off, and she was actually dating her now husband at the time (though it was casual).

I eventually got pushed by my mother to give all of them plus ones. Anna actually continued to date that guy, and married him four months before my wedding at two months pregnant. She brought her new husband as her plus one (who I never met prior) and convinced one of the other bridesmaids to take her friend as hers (when she KNEW we didn't like him). 

She was hugely pregnant, and didn't refrain from showing it off. We're both fairly young (25) and in my husband's culture, getting pregnant before late 20s/30s, married or not, is basically a teenage pregnancy and drew ATTENTION. She also has a vibrant personality and has a way of eclipsing everyone around her. Her husband is also very tall and incredibly attractive, which drew a lot of attention.

All anyone spoke about or of was Anna's pregnancy and her attractive husband. Even in the line, people were asking about that ""electric woman"" and of her pregnancy/marriage/life. When they got up to dance, all eyes were on them. Anna's friend ended up hooking up with my brother, outing him as gay and causing a huge scandal.

I ended up leaving midway through the reception in tears, and never attended the next morning's brunch. Anna and her entourage left early the next morning and also didn't attend. I can't even look at the pictures without crying and desperately want a do over.

I'm not a bridezilla, but this was beyond the pale. It felt like a celebration of Anna's marriage. I'm sorry, but I put so much planning, effort, and money into this while someone that got pregnant without a thought and married spur of the moment reaped the benefits. 

I honestly feel like Anna owes me a wedding and did all of this as revenge for me offending her years ago. Am I wrong?",1076,1229,0.86
1362,Not the A-hole,"I work for a smallish company that ships product all over the country. We have a few preferred trucking vendors that we give a lot of business to.

One company hired a new driver who has picked up 8-10 loads from my company. Two times he was late for his time slot so we started filling another truck and he had to wait. A few other times, we were finishing up his order so he had to wait as well. He has also had times where he shows up and his truck is loaded and he's out the door in 20 minutes. It's really a crap shoot. He gets compensated for wait times and it's not unusual in the industry to wait for your load.

A few days ago, I was checking my company's Google reviews and noticed a 1 star review from the week before. It was a truck driver saying that he always has to wait for his truck to be loaded and that people shouldn't do business with my company because we are unprofessional.

I immediately called my contact at the trucking company and asked them to take down the review. We are their customer and we give them a lot of business, and I didn't think it was appropriate for one of their employees to give us a bad review because they are unhappy with something that is standard in our industry.

My contact called me today to say they have removed the review and fired the truck driver. I didn't ask for the driver to be fired, but I think I would have done the same thing if one of my employees left a bad review on one of our customers sites.

I do feel bad that he was fired, though. I think maybe I should have talked to him directly instead of going to his boss?

She told me she thought my dorm mate was cute a while ago and I warned not to fool around with him multiple times.  That he’s a dickhead even to the people he sleeps with.  She chose not to take my advice.  

Now my dorm mate has a nickname for her that’s basically about her vagina.  She thought it was about her weight, like he was calling her fat.  She’s not fat and kept just laughing it off and saying she’s not fat and whatever.  

I’ve been conflicted about explaining to her what the nickname actually means.  On one hand everyone else knows what it really means and she should be aware so she can deal with it however she wants.   On the other, being called fat really didn’t bother her and sometimes ignorance is bliss.  I didn’t want to make her feel embarrassed.  

I ended up on the telling her side.  She laughed it off and said that it was gross.  I thought she was taking it pretty well and I was relieved.   Now though she’s straight up ghosting me.

1367,No A-holes here,"Maybe ""qualifying"" isn't the best word, more like specifically saying what I am apologizing for.

Either way, I don't have a problem apologizing when I've done something wrong, but a blanket ""I'm sorry"" doesn't really feel like it does anything to address what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future -- especially when it's more nuanced than ""i was wrong and you were right.""

For example, my girlfriend and I started arguing about something trivial the other day. Not to go into too much detail, she ended up accusing me of doing something behind her back that i know she asked me not to do. That wasn't the case, things started getting heated, and i raised my voice, essentially turning it into a full blown fight.

We worked it out later (ended up being mostly a miscommunication) and I said that I was ""sorry for escalating the situation."" I stand by what I said, but I fully acknowledge that I made the argument into a bigger deal than it needed to be and I was genuinely sorry for it.

I feel like that makes sense, but my girlfriend gets a little upset by it sometimes because she feels like I'm being insincere (or pointed) when I qualify apologies like that.

This isn't an ongoing argument or anything, and she and I truly have a great relationship. I guess I'm just looking for a reality check here: Am i being an asshole by doing this, or does this sound more like a ""no assholes"" situation and we just need to communicate more effectively?

1368,Not the A-hole,"I feel super conflicted about this, I can't tell if I'm justified or being a hormonal brat. 


I'm a soon to be first time mom, over 8 months along and going through a rough pregnancy. We drove a very long way to get to the shower hosted by my in laws.(not an easy or fun drive, 8 months pregnant with GD,swollen running on no sleep) The shower was lovely, small and cute and fun and I got lots of great gifts. I am very greatful that anyone cares about me enough to put in the effort to throw a party for us or get us gifts. But lets get to the point. 


One of the biggest gifts was a stroller carseat combo everyone pitched in to get for us. Before the shower my husband tried to make it a suprise but it eventualy slipped out that his mom (my MIL) got my stroller and carseat from my registry. The problem I'm having is it's not the one I had on my registry at all.  I spent weeks researching the right one for us, weeks looking at reviews and safety stuff and its ability to grow with my soon to be child for the long haul. At the party I hid my confusion and disappointment and thanked everyone profusely but the more I think about it the more it's bothering me.



I know nothing about the one I was given, except the carseats attachment fits with the stroller my MIL already baught for herself and it's a color I hate and had mentioned I hated to her before.  The carseat is a totally different clashing color and I know nothing about it either. 



I feel like I should just be happy with what I was gifted but I also feel like 'what was the point of the registry?'. Getting a stroller is a huge decision for a first time family and the choice was taken from me. I feel like I have so little control over any aspect of my life right now with this pregnancy being the way that it is and this stroller thing is really bugging me.My husband says I'm just being ungrateful but I spent so long on my registry and labored over every big choice on it, I feel like my choices were disregarded. I also feel like I can't return them to get the one I wanted because my MIL will hate me. 


 Am I being an ungrateful asshole? 


UPDATE: Finally got home and looked up the brand of stroller/system I was given. the stroller has Less than 2/5 stars on consumer affairs and the car-seat has less than one star, the brand I had on my registry was 4.5/5. I'm going to keep them in a closet or something to spare feelings and get the one I picked originally myself or through family on my side. thank you all for your help- you made me feel a lot more justified in my feelings about this and a lot less like a bad person.

I posted on the group chat the date and time of the movie and asked if anybody wanted to join me for a birthday movie. I said its completely optional if you want to join me. 

most of the group agreed and I was happy. 
That was until one of them said why don't we pick a different movie, I replied saying that it was my birthday and it's the movie I picked, we could see another movie on another day if you want, but I really want to see How to Train Your Dragon.

I then thought about it for a bit and realised that she dated my friend for a bit and was kind of annoying after they broke up. She would always call him when she was drunk (she broke up with him), texted him a lot. And anytime she was drunk she would send a different group chat each time letting everyone know. And most times she wasn’t that drunk. 

So when this girl replied for a brutal roast I said “the biggest attention whore I know” she responded with “ok” for the next 10 minutes I didn’t think anything of it then I get messages from her friends saying “how dare u call her a whore”  “you’re disgusting” “never call a girl a whore” and a whole lot of other stuff like that. 

I then felt like shit and apologised and said how she took it out of context, she just said “whatever”. Then her friend did a thing on her Snapchat story saying “reply back for a tbh (to be honest)” I replied and she said I was a dog and other bad stuff.

Let me clarify we are in no way, shape, or form broke. My mom earns a decent amount of money every week. Each time she has an excuse as to why she can’t get a bed for me. I know I might sound ungrateful but there’s many reasons why I NEED my own bed at least. 

For one she snores, so there’s nights i’m up til 4 am tossing and turning. 2, she likes to cuddle me and I do not like that. I’ve told her maybe a 10-15 minutes is fine but not no 2-3 hours. She’ll get angry at me and call me selfish for not wanting to hug/cuddle her. 

We’ve got a futon couch in the living room. But i can’t sleep there because she says it’ll ruin it... even though it’s made for sleeping. There’s been nights that I slept on the floor in order to get a good nights rest.

1378,Not the A-hole,"Background for reference: I'm a 44 year old married male with 3 kids. I have many male and female friendships developed in the usual ways - work colleagues, sport, social groups, kids parents etc. 

At one past employer, I got close to a female peer / colleague. We had a relatively close relationship insofar as we would often lunch together, grab a drink after work in our group, and generally hang out. 

I left the job to go elsewhere, as did she. We did however stay in touch - regular text/email, the odd lunch catch up - basically friends...we were very comfortable with each other and I really felt she was a good friend. We both shared a lot of personal information. 

She moved away (only a state / 1 hour flight away) with her partner, and had a child. Two years pass.

After a number of false starts (I was going to visit / work schedules not aligning) she finally plans a trip to her home city (her family is also here)

We schedule a lunch for a Friday. ( I'm actually pretty happy with that and schedule a half day off work) She bails and asks to move our catch up to Monday. Sure thing - family stuff will likely be required - I can juggle my schedule and move to Monday.

On the Sunday, I get a message from my friend asking ""how long our lunch will take"" on Monday as she is keen on setting up a date with an ex partner. Basically a booty call.  Her relationship has not been in a good place for some time.

The inference being that our catch up was holding her back from hooking up with an ex.
I get pretty offended. I make my excuses for the lunch, and avoid any chance to reschedule while she is in the city.

Her trip ends, and she returns interstate.

And is constantly self destructive and blames other people for it.

But then he started asking for favors that ranged from small to big/expensive. Some nights I'd spend trying to sleep and he'd ask for a favor really late at night, and I would agree everytime, because I began to feel like if I ever rejected helping him, he'd be closer to killing himself, I started thinking like this ever since I found him after the first time he attempted to. Sometimes I'd be hanging out with my girlfriend and he'd send me messages saying he wanted to go for a ride or needed a favor, and it caused serious problems with my girlfriend and caused big fights because I began to dedicate my time to help him a lot more than seeing her and she began to feel alone because of her anxiety, she supported me helping him at first, but she said shes starting to believe he's using me. I couldnt accept it at first, but I started to. These favors were only the tip of the iceberg, theres a lot more serious ones but that's too long to say.

At that time my brothers were in their late teens and weren't around a lot. After the move my mom became incredibly emotionally abusive and manipulative, especially towards me. Without getting into too much detail she tried to convince me that men are evil and would only ever be interested in me for sex, implied that my own dad shouldn't be trusted around me b/c 'he thought of me the same way he used to think about her', she repeatedly would talk shit about my dad to me and my brother's and encouraged us to join in, told us stories that painted him in a horrible light, would coax me to skip the weekends I was suppose to see him, ect. When I asked for money she would tell me to get a job but when I wanted to apply to one she wouldn't let me a because it would be too much of a burden on her and my brother's to drive me to work. As well, from the age of 12 onward I wanted to move in with my dad and when I told her she would tell me things like ""if you move in with him I won't get anymore money and I won't be able to afford the house"", or ""you'll have to go to court and tell everyone in court why you want to live with him and not with me"".

When I was 16 I was dating a guy for 6 months and wanted to go on birth control, we weren't having sex yet but I wanted to be safe. She REFUSED to take me to the doctor. I tried to talk to her, even asked my boyfriends mom to talk to her, and she wouldn't budge. She thought me going on birth control was an excuse to be a slut. So my boyfriends mom said she would take me after school without my mom knowing. The morning of I took a $20 from my mom's wallet thinking I could pay for the birth control. I knew my bf's mom would offer to pay, but I felt so not in control of the situation I just wanted to do one thing for myself, even if it was paying for it. (I know that doesn't justify it, and what I did was wrong, I just remember feeling so helpless.) My mom caught me and yelled at me and I panicked out and ran out of the house. I was genuinely afraid of her. That day I called my dad, told him everything and lived with him from that point on.

I've tried to give my mom another chance. And when we talk about what happened in the past she dismisses it and says she did nothing wrong.

At the time, this seemed ok because someone had to look after it temporarily, but now he's planning on keeping the dog. Here is the issue: my sister's daughter, now an orphan, wants the dog and I agree she should have it. I don't think my sister would have ever let him take the dog if he'd told her he was going to keep it and I'm certain she would want her daughter to have the dog. My niece did not initially take the dog because she lives several states away in an apartment but in a few months she will be living in a house. I think the best thing for both the dog and my niece is for my niece to have the dog when she gets a house. She is a responsible girl and the dog is one of her last things on this earth that she has to remember her mom by. My brother has been like some kind of Disney villain - taunting my niece and telling her he'll never give it back and it loves him the most now. He was not even very close or nice to our sister, even as she was dying of cancer and I now realize taking the dog in the first place wasn't any kind of generosity to help a dying woman - it was an opportunistic dog-napping. Frankly, I am disgusted by his heartlessness. Anyways, at the funeral, I was eulogizing my sister and complimenting our other family members on their kindness to each other and my sister but when it came to mentioning my brother I just looked at him and the only non-profane words I could muster to describe him were ""my brother, the dog thief."" Thankfully, everyone laughed and it brought a brief smile to my niece. I've talked to some friends and they are divided on who should get the dog so now I'm reflecting on the situation and wondering AITA for calling my brother a dog thief at my sisters funeral.

&#x200B;

Edit: To those offering their condolences: thank you, that is very appreciated (even if you also concluded I suck ha). My sister had a big personality and a flair for the dramatic. She would have loved to see the outpouring of support for her daughter and it wouldn't have been an event in her honor without a little bit of drama and some brotherly jabs. Her daughter and her dog were her whole world and she would've raised hell against our brother for this.  

To those suggesting we seek legal guidance: Thank you for your concern. Fortunately, the law is pretty clear in my niece's state. The dog is legally hers, so we're dealing with more of a practicality issue than legal one. 

To those requesting an update: the dog is currently still with my brother, and probably will be for at least another few weeks until my niece can reclaim it. I will try to update then. 

Please do not criticize her for being unable to take the dog right now. If she could, she absolutely would and she is making arrangements as quickly as possible. She's had a lot going on and there is no way she could have better prepared for this situation. 

To those doubting this is real or the full story: I just have to chuckle and be glad not everyone's family is polluted with toxic sadists. I obviously tried to include all the important details while preserving some privacy and brevity, but it's accurate. ",133,768,0.97
1385,Everyone Sucks,"So i need to keep this brief and on a throwaway account. People have been telling me that my gf flirts with other guys and my best friend told me she sees him eyeing his crotch and acts flirtatious around him. I decided to test this out for myself and I made a fake Facebook account, got a lot of friends and i told some people at my school to add him as a friend so it seems like somebody she would know, the mutual friends. He (brian) adds girlfriend as a contact and she accepts asking how she knows him. Brian explains he added the wrong person but should become friends because he's transferring to the university and lives in the area, share similar friends. They talk for a few weeks and my gf never told me about this. They talk about their interests and other stuff and to make sure that she's 100% the cheater i made sure that brian never started a sexual or romantic conversation or even about meeting up. That was all gf. Gf eventually asks him on a date and he asks if she has a bf and she says ""its complicated but not really"" and that was when i had it. I video called her and she was shocked to see who was on the other end of the line. She says i violated her trust and i was an asshole. She ranted about it on twitter and Facebook which clearly backfired. She claimed i led her on and that i am a scumbag. She pretty much proved she was a cheater yet all of the girls in our friend group and her mom harassed me online until i blocked them. I broke up with her, on Facebook via post when she ranted about it causing a massive flame war within our friend group. She went to the university counselor and now they want to speak to me about it and they're upset with me",130,329,0.89

Sam's not our in-house counsel, but we called him in recently because we're undergoing a merger and he's a mergers & acquisitions expert. Today was his wedding. Beforehand, I told him I'm still keeping him on-call because something important *might* happen, but it's unlikely and 99% I wouldn't be needing to call him. 

And like I said, it was 99% likely the day would go down with nothing important happening. But unfortunately, that 1% chance came through, and we had an emergency. I won't get too much into the actual legal aspects of it, except just to say it was a *really* big emergency. So I called Sam.

He was understandably pissed off at first. I still expected him to make some calls and talk to the other company we're merging with, but at first he refused. I told him I understood he was pissed off, but it is his job. He still refused, and I told him I'd let him go if he didn't get on the fucking phone with the other company right now. 

He was really angry, but did it and fixed the emergency. Later, I called him to tell him I was sorry for interrupting his wedding and that he did a great job, but when he picked up, he just called me a huge asshole.

I was super excited. I helped pay for this super expensive gift. I was gonna bring food. It was awesome. 

Well about a week ago the girl hosting the party texted me and said I wasn’t allowed to come anymore because of a fight we had in middle school and her mom “doesn’t want me to come”. 

The fight she’s talking about was in sixth grade and we are both sixteen now. 

I didn’t throw a fit about it, I just accepted it even though I was hurting. I didn’t want it to put a wedge in our group because we are all really close. 

I was fine with it for a little bit, but now everyone is posting about how much fun they’re having at the party. And it makes me feel really sad. 

And my best friend who is in the group and went to the party asked how I was doing, and I said 

“I’m okay. It just hurts my feelings that I’m the only one in the group that wasn’t allowed to go. I helped pay for the gift too and money is tight right now so it’s hard and makes me feel bad”

And the host saw that text and is now texting me saying I have no right to say those things.

Earlier today I was complaining about my apartment being a death hole of a mess and he offered to clean it. Very kind, yes. But I declined and told him that wouldn’t be cool at all. I don’t like people going through my things. But of course I thanked him for offering. 

Anyway, I went out for lunch with a friend for a few hours and we ended up picking up another friend. We walked into my apartment and Obama was there smiling and EVERYTHING was clean and organized. He used my spare key to get in. All my dirty laundry was organized and all my paperwork was moved. 

I’m a pretty messy person (I prefer organized chaos) and I feel exposed and embarrassed. 

I immediately felt sick to my stomach and all I could say was “what the hell” and “I really can’t believe you actually did that.” My anxiety went through the roof and I couldn’t even pretend to be okay with it. My face got hot and I felt like I was going to throw up. 

I told him I appreciate the gesture but it was way too much for me and I feel that my privacy has been violated. My friends said it was a sweet gesture and I’m overreacting.

1391,Not the A-hole," JW is kind of cult like and are known for their abuse so fuck them. I am aware the members may not be aware of this so I usually tolerate them and excuse myself. I haven't seen them around in a few years so I was surprised when I saw one in front of my house. I was going to ignore it but she literally said my name and that my car was here so I was a bit freaked. Turns out it was one that came and gave me her number after 5 minutes of JW jargon a few years back. She apparently wanted to tell me about it more, though I already told her I am not interested in religion. She came because she wanted to try again since I was probably ""too shy"" to call her.

Back then I was more patient but now I didn't have the time to listen to her so I told her I wasn't interested and to have a good day. This only made her want to explain more. I've had this debate too many times so I didn't even respond. She went off and I tuned her out until she asked to come in. Obviously I didn't want crazy in my house so that was a big no but I understand that she probably been in the house (my dad can't say no to these people) so she didn't think it would be a big deal.

She wanted an explanation, I already told her again that I was not interested in religion and she wanted to know why. She kept trying to guess what happened to me ( media, friends, abuse). She asked about  abuse to a literal stranger it! It is weird because JW is known for abuse then using religion to blame them. I kept saying it was just not my thing but she didn't accept that so I said ""In my opinion religion is evil, especially yours"". That...did not go very well. She wasn't angry just very sure that I was confused and something must have happen to me. I basically told her I had something to do and quickly close the door.

1394,Not the A-hole,"So, at the school I work at they have been doing lockdown drills by classroom in addition to doing it whole school. Every time it has been different.

The first time the resource officer came in to ""test"" my students and me, we were told to line up quickly because the ""shooter"" was on the third floor, and we had to evacuate. I stood at the front and walked backwards watching my students be very calm and quiet. We get outside, and it gets a little chaotic. I have a couple students who have autism, and one girl in particular had panicked and ran off to find the ESE teacher. When we got back, I talked to her about the importance of sticking with me. I told her it was just a drill and to not be too upset (she was in tears because she thought it was real).

The next time he did a lockdown it was the same class period. This time, he wanted my kids to line up against the walls when he came in. At this time, there were teachers or students hitting a steel drum to simulate gun fire and were banging on doors. The same girl that had previously panicked, crawled under a table and began crying. I talked to her real quick about how she needed to head to the other side of the room.  She runs over and literally dives into a pile of kids. After this ordeal, I had to talk to her again about how to react better. She apologized and has since gotten better.

This Friday is where I lost it. That morning the officer came by my room and told me he'd do a drill later that day. I told him that I had a child with autism that I have been working with, and if he could not visit that class period because I don't want her to miss out on state test prep because she's too scared, that would be great (it has begun to seem like he has been only picking this particular class period ever). He said he wasn't sure and that she needs to just deal with it. Later on, during this same friggin class (and during state test prep for a test on Tuesday), my door is unlocked by a master key by a teacher. In comes another teacher with an air horn that also blasts smoke, and she runs around the room. The student I had warned him about falls to the ground screaming in hysterics. I just glared at him while the teacher without the air horn comforted her. I was pissed. I was starting to feel like he was just picking on her. The teacher that was comforting the student saw how angry I was, and saw me walking toward the officer. She immediately got in front of me and told me to walk out and relax, and I did. I was nearly in tears because I was that frustrated.

Am I the asshole for being upset during this drill to the point I had to walk away?

Update: 
So, I finally got a chance to talk to my principal today. Yesterday was a hot mess due to other reasons that are unrelated. She seemed very surprised with this last drill, and she didn't seem to understand tge point.

 She is currently waiting on hearing from the other teachers who have had similar issues, but long story short: He is not coming back for the next school year.

1397,Not the A-hole,"21 F here getting married in June. My mom’s working on her 3rd divorce now but this is in reference to her first marriage and my first ex step dad.

When I was 8 my mom and I lived in CA in a 3 bedroom apartment, we shared a room/bunk bed, and she rented the other 2 rooms out to tenants found on Craigslist. 

Alan moved into one of the rooms when I was 7. She started sleeping in his room and eventually they got engaged. 

He had already abandoned 2 daughters from 2 previous marriages, he never put in any effort to get to know me, in fact he wouldn’t even acknowledge me when I was in the same room with him.

After they got married I got the same treatment as before, sometimes worse. The only times he acknowledged me were to criticize the way I did my chores or to say whatever I had said in that moment was stupid. 

He convinced my mom to move to UT so we left CA (separated from the only people who ever made me feel like a child, gave me the freedom to be a kid, my aunts and cousins).

They divorced when I was 13/14 (by this point my mom had 2 more kids) and he fled to live in Hawaii. During this time money was very tight so my mom and us 3 kids rented a 1 bedroom basement apartment.

My mom was working 2 jobs (day and night) so my schedule was as follows: 

M-F I would (try) to go to school, I would get home at 3, then my mom would leave and wouldn’t be home until the next morning when I had to leave for school again. 

Yes, you read that right, I would watch (essentially raised) 2 babies from after school until the next morning for when I had to go to school. This included maintaining the house (laundry, dishes, dinner, vacuuming, cleaning up all the baby toys, etc), waking up several times a night to change diapers, and bottle feed the babies. 

Sometimes I wouldn’t make it to school the next morning because I was so tired from the day/night prior. Eventually I got so behind I had to drop out. 

Now that I’m getting married my mom has realized she doesn’t want to be married to her current husband. She’s planning to break up with him 2 weeks before my wedding. She has arranged for the kids to go to Alan’s house for 2 weeks while shit hits the fan with her divorce.

I have already told her that I don’t want him there since if he wanted to be at my wedding, maybe he should have shown some interest in me as a child. He very obviously didn’t give a shit about me or my future. 

I know full well my mom only wants him there for the social aspect and photo ops.

She called me this morning and said that during that time, she doesn’t feel comfortable asking Alan to just drop the kids off at my wedding (since they’ll still be with him during this time) and that he HAS to come or else my siblings won’t be in attendance.

Switchblades, butterfly knives, he's pretty proud of all of them. Now, I have a small phobia of my own. My father was very abusive, and of the few memories I have of him, he was often threatening an infant me with a switchblade. As such, I'm very uncomfortable around them. My boyfriend will often point his in my direction, and when I get upset and tell him to stop he says I need to get over it. That I might need to use one some day. That I should know he'd never hurt me. I guess he feels like if he exposes me to it enough, I'll learn to trust that he won't stab me with it? But it's not like I think that to begin with, I'm just uncomfortable around them.

Well, he has a very intense phobia of a specific monster. I don't question it. For some reason, it's much more intense than my mild annoyance/breath stopping moment at the blades. He completely freaks out at even just a picture, shuts down, has nightmares for nights.

1402,Asshole,"So I (25M) have quite a large family. I have two brothers (14M, 17M) and three sisters (16F, 21F and 30F). And then my parents (55M and 55F). 

The situation here is that my dad gave some advice to my younger brother (16M) about girls. 

Now some further context. Me and my siblings have all done fine with relationships. My older sister is married, but when she was younger, she was athletic, popular, sociable and got good grades. I was the same at younger age, now I hold a decent job and am doing well for myself. I'm single as it stands but I've dated around a fair bit. Likewise, my younger sisters (21F) and (16F) have their own boyfriends too. 

Hell even my youngest brother (14M), is becoming quite the athlete and is starting to invite girls to the house (obviously, I don't think he's doing anything sexual at this age...but still, he's clearly getting confident with them and I can tell he's popular with them). 

But the ''middle'' brother (17M) so to speak, he is different. He's incredibly book smart, but he has very limited social skills. He's very shy, he stays in his room a lot and plays video games, he doesn't know how to dress, he's a bit grumpy when family guests come over too (doesn't even try to socialize with them). **Simply put, he's not like any of us.**

Hell, his own younger brother is doing better with the ladies than he is! Me and my dad started to become very concerned for him. Sometimes me and my dad joke that he's adopted. When we were his age, we had girlfriends then...we were being sociable, but he doesn't seem to be doing so, nor is he really asking for advice. He just really...sticks out

So while I was in the living room alone, my dad walked in and asked whether my younger bro is in, and I said I don't know, so he calls my younger brother (17M) down and says ''Me and throwawayorpk want to have a talk with you''.

I was a bit confused as to what was going on, but went along with it.

Basically, my dad told my younger bro that ''We noticed you have never been with any girls and we know you can get a girlfriend, you have it in you, so if you need advice, come to us''.

He says ''I'm fine thanks'' and tries to go back upstairs but my dad stops him, and says ''Son, you need to be more of a man. Be more masculine. Get things done. Don't just sit in your room all day and play video games''. Then I notice that my younger bro gets angry like never before, I've never seen this side of him, he just bursts out ''Fuck off you asshole!'' to my dad and my dad loses it. My dad screams at him and says ''I was trying to help you and this is how you talk to me! For all those video games I bought you and you dare talk to me like that, you little shit, you are grounded. You're so done now.'' and he took away his video games.

1408,Not the A-hole,"My husband (38m) and I (35f)have been together for 10+years, married for 7. We have 2 kids, 8yo & 4yo. 

In the marriage I have always been the breadwinner & financially supported the family. We’ve faced many challenges over the years including him cheating on me before we were married, and then me feeling as though he’s not doing enough to help me support our family. 

He’s been in and out of work & has been a weed smoker which he sees nothing wrong with but I’ve felt he’s used as a crutch not to face issues in our marriage. In response to my needing support from him he feels I am nagging him and being impatient & treating him poorly by not recognizing his contributions to the relationship. 

I had an emotional affair which ended but I have been unable to really shake the feeling of actually have someone who made me feel cared about even just emotionally because I I get so little of it in the marriage. My husband & I talked about it a lot and it usually ends on him yelling at me calling me a cheater. 

He has involved our families both of whom are religious and made it clear that they don’t want us to end the marriage. He threw me under the bus revealing to our parents that I had an affair after which my mother said a prayer to seek forgiveness for my sins. I revealed to my mom that there was an incident between my husband and I where he had sex with me while I was unconscious & drunk, which made me feel completely violated. 

It hasn’t changed her mind and the most hurtful thing she said to me is that she hopes my husband gets the kids because that’s what I deserve. She is furious with me that she feels I am not open to her advice about staying in the marriage but I am frustrated that nobody is listening to me & I am feeling attacked by everybody that is close to me, especially my husband who I feel is using my parents to guilt trip me into staying married while refusing to acknowledge any of his issues, only mine. 

We went to couples counseling & the therapist said we were beyond repair. He refused to go complaining about cost. I pay for his health insurance and he doesn’t go consistently. I have gone alone to therapy for about 6 months now to try and address my own issues. It’s helped but it’s still a difficult situation.

I have a lawyer & I’ve filed the initial divorce paperwork. He has been difficult and is threatening to demand alimony and custody of the kids. He is living in the house which I am paying for the mortgage and bills for in full. I am in a hotel at the moment while my kids are with my sister for spring break as I don’t want the conflict because I am just spent & tired. I am just tired. I often catch myself thinking, am I the crazy one? I’m hurting my children. My parents are so upset with me. Am I the asshole? ",73,154,0.93

1410,Not the A-hole,"Okay, the title makes me sounds really NTA, but there's more to it. Actually, it's a wall of text. But I felt like it was necessary to show my thoughts about the situation.


I go to this relatively upscale restaurant with my friend, who I'm paying for, I'm not very wealthy but I decided to splurge a bit for once.

Until I'm supposed to pay, we had a very good experience, the food is fast, very tasty, the waiter is quick, friendly, refills our drinks and even asks if we want her to get a bag so we could take the leftovers home... I was actually so impressed that I was going to give her a relatively big tip. (tipping in my country is not necessary, it's something you give if you are really happy with the service)
 and this makes me feel a bit bad for getting pissed off at her.

Anyways we had a coupon that gave us 2 desserts for the price of 1 so we ordered desserts. I order a slice of cake and my friend a small ice cream. No problem here either. But then when we are done I noticed the bill was unusually high (I had made a price estimate in my head, and this was much higher than that) and I ask to see the receipt before I paid and I noticed I had been charged for both desserts. I point this out to the waitress and she said the small ice cream was excluded from that coupon, and for it to be valid we'd have to buy a big ice cream. I ask her to show me where it said that it was excluded, well, she has nothing to prove that. The coupon had a small text that stated desserts with alcohol was excluded from that deal, but nothing about small ice creams. 

Then she just standed there for some 30 seconds thinking or something, then she told me we could compromise. She said she could be ''nice'' (said without sarcasm) and reduce our dessert bill from 11,90€ to 8,90€, but if we had the 2 for 1 deal as advertised it would cost us 7,10€. I told her this and that I was not going to pay a cent more than that, because I felt like I had been scammed. Then she answered ''you will just pay 1 euro and 10 cents more than you'd have to do with said deal'' in an annoyed voice. I replied, ''I'm bad at math, but even I know that it is actually 1,80 euro, but I don't want to pay extra for something I was never informed about'' .

Not because I can't afford the small difference, but I wanted to stand my ground against what I felt was bullshit. We had some back and forth, but I was never rude to her (except speaking in an annoyed voice towards the end) or called her names. Finally she agreed to let me pay the original 2 for 1 price and even brought me a calculator to show me that 89-71 is 18(???).

When I was there I felt like I was right the whole time, but on my way home I started to doubt, because before the scene she seemed genuinely friendly with good service. The restaurant was also very busy, so I did not want to waste her time.",48,169,0.98

1412,Not the A-hole,"Am I (23F) the asshole for telling my husband (27M) that if he could maintain his haircut, he ""would get laid a lot more""? 

He used to take very good care of himself and he was very attractive when we first met. As we've been married, had kids, and life has happened, he's stopped putting effort into himself. He has depression and bipolar, so he tends to not take care of his appearance very well or put any effort into how he looks. He will go months without a haircut or a shave. I've tried to coax him toward styling his hair or trimming his beard into different styles to help him feel better about himself and to help me feel more attracted to him. 

He always complains we don't have sex enough (maybe twice a week). It's not for lack of trying on my part. He vents his stress and anger at me rather than finding a good coping mechanism by being cranky and snapping at me over little things. It's miserable to come home to after working all day to support him and our two kids. I've told him this many times and he says he's working on it in therapy and to be patient. I am patient, I haven't left or given him an ultimatum, but it really makes sex with him unappealing to me. I try to be affectionate to help, but he is always ""busy"" with something. I've given up. 

Yesterday, though, he got his ears pierced, trimmed up his beard into a nice goatee, and today he got a nice haircut. I was attracted to him so much I couldn't stop staring at him at the grocery store. I told him when we got home if he could maintain the way he looked right now, that he ""would get laid a whole lot more"" than he does now. He got mad and said I shouldn't be having sex with him based on how he looks. 

I think my feelings toward it are that a husband would be more attracted to his wife if she's wearing lingerie or puts effort into her makeup and hair. I didn't feel it was out of line, but he's upset. So, AITA?

1414,Not the A-hole,"I live in a subdivision where you are not allowed to park in the street. Typically I do not mind when people do, except for this one vehicle parked in the same spot for over a month. It looks like it was in an accident and has out of state plates.

UPDATE- I called the tow company and only authorized people can report. I called our clubhouse they said that they don’t handle it and I have to reach out to the property manager who takes forever to get in contact with. 

UPDATE 3/31- I ended up just sending a message to a known board member explaining that it’s been parked for an extended period of time, kinda looked abandoned and on a bend. I didn’t mention having it towed just that I was concerned. The board member said he would speak to the residents at both houses and see what is going on. That was around 7am this morning. I got home from work around 3pm and the car was gone. I decided to be mildly nosy and see if it was moved to the clubhouse (some people will move their cars there) It wasn’t there. I’m not sure if it was towed or not. I’ve been debating on messaging the board member to find out but he doesn’t seem like the gossipy type unfortunately but maybe for a ‘concerned citizen’ such as myself he might.

This would not be a big deal except she wanted to treat everyone to lunch. I explained that I am unwilling to eat from there because I do not support the organizations they send large donations to.

She was taken aback and respectfully asked what those donations were. I explaned about Chick-fil-A support of anti-LGBTQ groups which led me to having to explain what LGBTQ meant. She continued to press and asked me to just ignore my conventions and eat with the family.

1417,Asshole,"Hello reddit. I’m looking for an impartial view because I want to do what’s best for my son.

My 8-year old son is my youngest of 3, and he has always been a bit of a trouble maker in school, especially when he was younger. He is the “class clown” and often disrupts class. I’ve gotten called by his school for his disruptions more times than I would have liked, and because of this, I’ve been taking him to a cognitive behavioral therapist. He is making progress, albeit slowly, but he IS getting better.

The issue is that a couple of weeks ago, he had his “biggest” disruption of all. His school uses those recorder things, and his music teacher was trying to teach the kids how to play it. He purposely played his own “song,” even when the teacher said no.

The teacher never dealt with my son before and was justifiably frustrated by his behavior. The principal wasn’t in school, so sent him to the school psychologist because she believed my son must have ADHD. The school psychologist called me, and said despite the fact his grades are fine, he likely does have ADHD and medication is the best route.

I thanked her for her time, and my husband suggested we get a second opinion. We took him to the closest psychiatrist in our area, and he prescribed him ritalin on the spot.

This was 5 days ago, and my husband asked how the medication was going. I admitted to him that I have not picked it up yet. We had a little spat (my husband is very pro-medication whereas I'm of the position where they should be used when 100% necessary. I'm not anti-vax or anything, I just don't like the idea of pumping everyone with drugs for every little thing).

I ~~workin the healthcare field~~ am a healthcare consultant and interact with doctors often, and I genuinely don’t believe my son has ADHD. I see how quickly psychiatrists write scripts just to shut worried parents up, and ADHD is grossly over diagnosed.

My son does annoying things, yes, but he's a kid, and his behavior IS improving without medication. Compared to my other kids, my son is only slightly more hyperactive and has what I think is the standard attention span of a 8-year old. His grades are slightly above average (not perfect). I think behavioral therapy can fix his disruptive nature over time. I don’t want him growing up reliant on pills. Just because he can be a troublemaker sometimes doesn’t mean we can just pump him with drugs so he shuts up- I rather address the problems at their core, so that he never has to rely on a drug to function.

So reddit, AITA?

TL;DR: My son may or may not have ADHD. His behavior is gradually improving with therapy. I don’t want to put him on meds. AITA?

Edit: The cognitive behavioral therapist thinks my son is making progress. The people who diagnosed her was a school psychologist and a psychiatry. Thought to clarify.

I don't think people understand my main concern, which is *I don't think he has ADHD*. Out of the three people who saw him, two of them saw him once, while the other one is a ADHD specialist who seems to think CBT is working for his behavioral problems and that he doesn't need medication. Additionally, that one sees him biweekly, is not fully convinced he actually has ADHD, and says he's making great improvement (as noted by multiple times by his teachers). I already stated I planned to see another doctor (a ADHD-specialist neurologist; not a random psychiatrist that has complaints online).

1418,Everyone Sucks,"We have been forced in a situation where our family, my wife, myself, daughters (6,3 and newborn) have to share a house with my brother in law.

First off, I KNOW it's not ideal. Truth be told, I fucking hate it but, we're stuck in this for now.

I admit to having gone total asshole in the past due to my not being able to accept him being around. I take full on blame and responsibility for my past behavior. But today, I lost my shit but I feel it to be justified this time.

Background and set up first:

We have the top floor.

Me and wife: master bedroom

Daughters of 6 and 3 share second bedroom

Newborn: nursery

He has the basement which includes bedroom, living room, bathroom, three closets and the entire fucking garage.

For a single guy, I find this to be a GENEROUS amount of space!

We share: kitchen area and cold storage room in basement which houses a chest freezer, bills are split fairly ( internet, utilities, food etc ).

There has always been friction with my wife and I as I have frequently voiced my opinion ( I admit it was a vulgar opinion on many occasions ) that it is unfair that he can walk upstairs in the kitchen as he needs to any time of the day or night but when we need to get anything from the cold storage room or the freezer we have to knock ( yeah, I don't want to walk in on him fapping or anything - perfectly logical ). My gripe has been that the privacy, the courtesy ""are you decent"" knock  is not reciprocated. Now to the the recent issue for which this post is all about ( and why I created this throwaway ):

Today, we had to call in a plumber for some issue with the toilet in the basement. While the plumber was downstairs, BIL comes upstairs, walks into the kitchen, hear him get a glass of water, without saying anything,  proceeds to go into the the girls' bedroom, closes the door and does not come out.

Let me make it clear: the room was empty. My older girls were not home as they were out with my sister for a day of fun.

After about 5 minutes, him still being in there, I got up to see what he was doing in there. He was fast asleep on one of the beds.

My viewpoint: a grown man does not have any fucking business in a 6 and 3 year old girls' bedroom. Even if it is to play with them, to spend time with them, there is a huge hallway available for this purpose ( 15ft by 15ft by 10ft high ). So unless you are my 6 year old, 3 year old or me or my wife, you do not have any GD business in their room PERIOD.

So, I am the asshole ?

I want honesty, as brutal as it comes.

I am a 36 and engaged to my girlfriend, 24, of 1 year. We have been engaged for 2 weeks now.

I am a widower. I was married to my first wife for 11 years, from age 23 to 34. She died almost exactly 2 years ago from a car accident. I was in a really bad place after her death. We also have 4 kids (currently aged 4 to 11) and I was overwhelmed trying to raise them as a single dad. 

My current fiancée used to be my eldest daughter's piano teacher. We started dating a year ago. I care for her deeply as she is a very loving and nurturing person who would make a great mother for my kids. The kids really like her as well and get along great.

So leading up to the wedding my fiancée is moving in with me. In the master bedroom, there is a walk-in closet which contains my wife's clothes and other personal items. She was a fashionable woman and owned a lot of nice things. I haven't gotten around to cleaning it out and I never really wanted to anyways. I told my fiancée she could store some of her own clothes in there if there was space.

Yesterday she was unpacking her things in the master bedroom and I walked in, finding her trying on a dress that belonged to my wife. Scattered around her were more clothes that belonged to my wife, like handbags and shoes. I asked my fiancée what she was doing, and she just said 'oh I was just trying on some clothes, no harm in it'. I told her to clean up the clothes immediately and in my anger, I said 'you're stretching out the dress'.

Then my fiancée started crying. I immediately regretted my words. I mean my wife was tall and a size 0 while my fiancée is not, which is NOT an issue, but I knew how it sounded. I apologized but my fiancée was obviously quite hurt, and nothing I said seemed to help. She said I was being an asshole and that I hurt her feelings by 'lashing out' at her.

That being said, I know I shouldn't have implied that she was fat, but AITA for being pissed at my fiancée for trying on my dead wife's clothes without my permission?",393,1219,0.92

The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this.

We were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it’s about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I’m so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn’t long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made.

He cannot speak nor can he do anything on his own basically.

My friend and I will smoke weed in his room occasionally. Sometimes we will smoke with his parents in the living room as well, with the child in the parents bedroom on the other side of the house. Of course we open the windows and all that. It has never really been an issue or anything for me, but the other day my friend asked if we could smoke with his parents again.

I of course said it was no problem, so we go to the living room and fire up the xbox to play Mortal Kombat as we wait for them.

Of course I think that he meant they were fooling around or something, and I say something to the effect of ""Ugh, gross, ive walked in on my parents fucking before, shit sucks.""

I thought about it for a minute. Part of me is like: well I should be nice and accommodate them. They live really far away, etc. But then my bitch side turned back on and I said no. Told my ex that he can tell them I’m sick, he can tell them whatever the hell he wants, I’m not coming. It’ll probably be another 3 months before I get 48 hours to myself and dammit, I need it. 

So, internet world, help me know if I get to squish that little voice in my head that says I’m being an asshole and enjoy my weekend. Or if I should back down and join the “party.” Party is in “ because obviously it’s just going to be the Ex-FIL congratulating himself in getting such a great gift. 

*if you’re wondering how my oldest feels about it, he doesn’t care. He’s excited to see his grandpa, already knows he’s getting the watch, and couldn’t care less if I was in the room when it occurs. He’s on the spectrum if that helps explain why he doesn’t have ‘feelings’ about it. ",20,71,0.94
1427,,"I started reading this subreddit very actively awhile back. It’s now my favorite subreddit to read. While I never comment, I always enjoy the debates. 

This subreddit has made me able to see when I am being an asshole myself, without outside judgement. When I’ve had an argument or fight with someone I think to myself “if this was posted to /r/amitheasshole what would the judgement be?” 

This makes me look at the situation from an outside perspective on my own and often I realize, I’m the asshole. I immediately make amends and try to fix things. 

I genuinely feel like this is just making me a better person.

1428,,"Reposted third time because the first version was removed, I didn't write the acronym for ""Am I the asshole"" in the title. Throwaway because my gf is on reddit. PLEASE DO NOT UPVOTE TOO MUCH, I DO NOT WANT HER TO SEE THIS. 

So recently, my gf and I went to visit my grandmother and great grandmother down South for our spring break. We are both 19 year old college students and we go to school in New England (USA). They really loved her. They spoiled her throughout the week, and she was so grateful, and so was I. We were both so happy that they took to her so nicely. I had definitely been nervous about it. We stayed in my great grandmother's home (she lives directly across the street from my grandma, they live very close to each other) for 7 days. It was a blast.

Now that we are back at school and continuing the semester, my gf keeps asking for my great grandmother's address. Both my great grandmother and my grandmother were English Lit teachers, and my gf keeps saying she wants to write a letter to each of them to thank them for everything they did for her during our stay.

Here's the thing: I get where she's coming from. I do. I just don't want to give her the address. She did not know it while we were staying there (purely because she never asked and never paid attention and I was driving everywhere in my grandma's car). I think it's kind of creepy and stalker-ish to do. I told her I could give her their phone numbers to text them, but she said that she thought they would really appreciate a hand-written letter, and she said she'd rather do that because it seems more personal. I told her I think it's creepy and that I think they'd find it creepy, and she got upset at me. She said that I blew it out of proportion and it's how people communicated earlier anyway, and she just thought it was a thoughtful thing to do. I am not budging on this, don't worry. I'm not gonna let her force me into it. But she is upset at me and hasn't spoken to me properly since our fight (last night). So I want to know: who is the asshole here?

There's more to it, though. My grandmother was married to a really vile man (my grandfather-- I don't talk to him) and he was abusive towards her physically and verbally. She left him and they divorced. For years after the divorce, he continued to stalk her and send her threatening letters. She and I are very close, and she confided in me that she still gets nervous opening letters from people she doesn't know. She had a restraining order against him, but it does not matter now, because he is in hospice care a few states away. I am worried that if my gf sends her and my great grandmother a letter, it will freak her out. AITA?",588,2633,0.74
1429,Asshole,"My Husband is a pretty skilled musician and plays numerous instruments and composes on the side. I never really cared for it, but I recognize how much he loves music so I don't try to mess with. He often spends hours practicing his instruments which I'm fine with.

However, he's been pushy since my daughter has been born. Instantly when she was born he made her listen to music. Maybe made is too harsh. He just played music for her, either on his phone or with his instruments. He said it's to give her ""perfect pitch"", apparently it's when you are trying to give the kid the ability to tell pitches just by hearing them. It's accomplished by letting them listen to music (husband says it's certain types of music, like Jazz or Bach) and they'll gain that ability. I'm fine with that and it's actually working which is cool.

My daughter is now just 4 and he wants to give her an instrument to play. He gave an introduction to lots of instruments and told her to pick a one she wants to learn. She wants to learn, but I'm against it. I say that it's strange to be forcing instruments down her throat at such an early age and that we should wait until later for her to choose by herself what she wants to do--whether that be sports, video games, or music. But she should decide. Not my husband. My husband insists that she should start early but I think it's just too much for her. What if she doesn't like it and my husband keeps forcing her to play the instrument? What if because she was forced she wouldn't like to play music? I'm hesitant, and he's still insisting that she start to play music.

AITA?

Edit: I'm worried that she only wants to learn because of my husband.",199,455,0.89

I play an online team game which is 99% male players. Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like ‘well done boiz’ and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like ‘well done team’ instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don’t see why as we treat her well.

Yesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said ‘Have fun lads and Jane’. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying ‘lads’ and made her feel ‘othered’.

The group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using ‘lads’ and ‘guys’ because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. 

The guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.

I ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.",127,43,0.69
1431,Not the A-hole,"Apologies if weed is a controversial topic. Throwaway account. 

Before me and my fiancé met, I was an intense stoner. Like smoke weed every day kind of stoner. 100% positive that I was psychologically dependent on it. When I met my fiancé, he told me he didn’t smoke weed, haven’t since high school, didn’t like it and didn’t want it in his life. Eventually it came to the question, well do you want to stay with me even though I smoke weed? And his answer was I don’t know. I decided to try to quit and it worked out for quite a while. Soon it became this “promise” between us. Like I quit weed for our relationship.

When I found out my mom smoked weed it sucked because it would have been cool to have smoked weed with her before I quit if I had known. She wished we had too and asked me to share a joint with her for “one and one time only” and I caved and shared one with her. Because it was my mom and I wanted the experience. Strike one. My fiancé was pissed and felt betrayed.

After some time passed (maybe a year) it was around Christmas when a lot of people in my circle were around and visiting. There was weed around and my fiancé made the decision that he wouldn’t be mad at me if I wanted to smoke every now and then, pretty much giving his consent ever since the situation with my mom and some conversations we had over the time span. I said alright and left it at that. I did end up smoking after that, but it still caused some turmoil regardless of him saying it would be okay, so after one argument I said he should never have said that and that I would just try to stop again. He said whatever. 

Fast forward to this year. My sister started smoking so whenever I come home, it’s here and everywhere. Intense triggers. In the beginning I was good. Could be around it and not do anything. But as time passed, the peer pressure got stronger and cravings too.

Now last night, I messed up. My mom was taking a bong hit and she couldn’t clear it so she handed to me in a ‘panic’ and without thinking I cleared it. I didn’t get ‘stoned’ but I felt instantly guilty. This morning, we were talking on the phone and my fiancé asked if I got high (a recurring habit when I’m visiting family without him) and I told him what happened. He hung up on me, and texted me to tell me he doesn’t trust me anymore. I finally admitted that I think I still kind of have the psychological craving/addiction and that I fucked up. And he said whatever, I don’t care what you say or believe what you say anymore.

I asked if it was okay to come home or if he wants space. His response was “Do what you want. It’s not like you care about what I want anyways” and hasn’t responded to my last text. 

AITA for smoking weed or is this an over the top reaction? 

TLDR; fiancé hates weed, so I quit, trip up and smoke, he gives me the go ahead, then gets mad when I do it, I say I’ll try to stop again, time goes by and then I smoked weed and now he no longer trusts me and doesn’t want to talk. ",71,33,0.9

We’ve been talking them up to each other for a little bit now and made plans for the four of us to meet up at a bar last night.  It was supposed to just be a casual hangout kind of thing, not a date. 

When we do meet up my girlfriend’s friend pretty much ignored any attempts he made to start of conversation with her.  She’d either say nothing or give one word answers before going back to talking to my girlfriend.  Then she was outright rude to him.  Her and my girlfriend were talking about coffee and still just trying to have a conversation with this girl my buddy said actually the darker coffee has less caffeine.  My girlfriend’s friend did like an exaggerated nerd type voice and mocked what he said.  Then my girlfriend and her busted out laughing right in front of him like it was the most hilarious thing ever.  It was awkward as fuck.  

At that point I just tried to have my own conversation with my friend.  Once we started talking my girlfriend and her friend actually got up and moved.  I thought they were just going to the bathroom or something, but they just went to a different part of the bar and stayed there the rest of the night.  My buddy took it well as far as I could tell, but I still felt bad for building up this meeting to him to have it turn out to be so shit.  

My girlfriend doesn’t get why I’m angry at her and her friend.  She said her friend wasn’t feeling it and shouldn’t be forced to fake it.  I mean she’s technically right, but it doesn’t make it any less fucking rude.  There are friends of her’s that I absolutely cannot stand and I would never treat them like that.  Well at least I wouldn’t before.  I mean I shouldn’t be forced to fake anything anymore.  



Edit- I talked to my girlfriend about it again.  She’s still pretty much standing her ground.  She says they shouldn’t have laughed at him in front of him, they were just drunk and being dumb.  She doesn’t think moving away was shitty though.  She said he kept butting into their conversations and not taking the hint that she didn’t like him.  I told her that he wasn’t butting in, the whole reason we all got together was so that they could talk.  Then my girlfriend said yeah and her friend didn’t want to talk to him anymore that’s why they moved.

1434,No A-holes here,"My family used to be large and close, until quite a few members died. Although we all try our best to stay close, naturally it became difficult. But my one aunt and uncle in particular have been horrible.

Without going into too much of a backstory, a huge fight broke out between my one aunt (C), my mom (M), and my other aunt and her husband (P & R) about a hefty loan that C gave P and R to start a business 10 years ago. P and R claim it was a gift, called us all greedy for thinking it should be paid back at all, paid it back, and proceeded to start a different shit storm about my dead grandparents estate. Then, they threatened to file a restraining order against some of the family for (pretty nicely and not too often) attempting to contact them to reconcile after some VERY horrible emails from P and R. We have all been pretty nice to them in spite of some horrible things they said about us regarding our relationships with our dead relatives. 

So we've cut off all contact. I grew up with P and R and their children, spent every holiday, vacations, and just hang out time with them. This sucks, but they refuse to attempt any kind of counseling or reconciliation, and have instead escalated this into a baseless legal battle. 

In their business, R BRAGGED about how he commits light tax fraud by writing off things that are not business related, uses other people's receipts he finds on the ground to write off, and even has written off entire vacations because he went into one store that related to his business and purchased an item. He paid me cash under the table when I worked for him from ages 14-16. He has never been quiet about these things.

My question, is WIBTA if I reported P and R to the IRS in hopes they get audited? It comes purely from a want for revenge for the shit storm they have caused and them wanting to attack us with the legal system, but it's not like what I'd be reporting isnt true. ",59,175,0.95

I didn't go to his car, he also have the same car as my brother. i was suspicious because if he was my brother he would have called me on the phone. Me and my friends at that time decided to check and when we went there, there was no car. We asked the girl how he looked like, she explained to us and he looks like my brother.

1436,Asshole,"Hello again AITA, you guys have previously weighed in on the long running battle between me and my sister so I figured I'd turn to you again to see if I really messed up. I'm always on my family's bad side so I appreciated the neutral input last time.

Somehow it's become a tradition in my family that one family member host a Friday night dinner once a month. Last night was my night. My oldest sister and I have not been speaking since our vacation (click on user name to see why if you're curious) and I was able to avoid her at the January and February dinner at other's houses. I really, really didn't want her in my apartment. So I decided since she hates spicy food and her kids are allegedly allergic to peanuts, I could side step the  issue and make this Thai peanut noodle dish that I love. I announced it well in advance in the group email what I was planning. 

Well since my sister is much more diabolical than I give her credit for, she had her husband drive the 2 hours to my place, feign that she didn't know I was making something that allowed her to say ""you know my family can't eat! Isn't the point of a family dinner so all the family can enjoy!"" While clutching her pearls (literally). Then my niece claimed she could feel the ""peanut residue in the air"" and it was affecting her ability to breathe. So my sister dramatically took her to the emergency room where all turned out to be fine.

But again, I lost. My sister played me like a fiddle and the entire family took her side. Dinner was ruined and I'm the bad guy. Again. I honestly just tried to side step the issue of having her around but making somthing she and her kids couldn't eat--and announcing it well in advance.

Now he comes over every day after school and spends the night frequently on weekends.  He only has his mother in his life and she’s not home a lot.  She’s a whole other story of entitlement.  The second time we met her she asked us for money.  

Back to my son’s friend though, he’s always bringing his issues and dramas with him to our house.  Often I feel like his therapist.  It would be different if I didn’t also have two young children in addition to my son, but I do and adding an troubled teen to the mix has just been frustrating and mentally tiring.  

It’s all come to a head though.  He smokes although he denies it.  There have been multiple times I’ve smelled cigarette smoke on him.  Earlier in the week one of their teachers caught them both smoking in the dugout at their school.

Bit of backstory, everyone HATES his wife because she treated my family like shit for over 20 years. A few weeks ago my mother came by the house because she wanted to take one of his TVs to her house and the widow threw a tantrum, openly disrespecting my mother and threatening to call the police if she didn't leave. My mother told her she didn't want any trouble she just wanted the TV which was rightfully hers and that would be it. A lawyer came and settled it and my mother took the TV and that was that.

Yesterday she sent my mother a cease and desist letter at her workplace as well as a restraining order preventing my mother from coming near the house. My mom used to be the only person in the family who actually liked her so this caused a rift. Now the wife is threatening me with a lawyer because i don't pay bills (I'm still a student so i don't work yet).My close family think she's doing all this because she wants the house for herself.

Brief Sidenote: I've always preferred more boyish-looking women, e.g tall, smaller breasts, short hair, etc. Now, onto the story.

My Ex-GF and I recently seperated, and I decided to try blind dating. I started chatting with this woman - she was great: funny, snarky, a bit sarcastic, and just overall a blast to talk to. We agreed to meet at this local Italian place about halfway between us. I turned up, and well, she was very ""womanly"" let's say.

Her: Are you calling me fat?

I tried to explain that no, I didn't mean that at all, I just prefer smaller breasts when she storms off, leaving me alone with the bill.

1447,No A-holes here,"So I'm just gonna jump into it. Me and my boyfriend live in an apartment, it's rented so it's nor mine or his, we share the costs. In a few months we'll be travelling for approx. 2 months. Around that time my friends girlfriend is going to be in town for a couple of months. My friend lives in an apartment with roommates, so shares the kitchen/bathroom and stuff and just has a room to himself. 

My boyfriend, friend and his girlfriend figured they could just live at our place in the two months that we aren't there. My boyfriend says it's a good idea and we could use the money. However, I don't really feel comfortable with it for a couple of reasons:
1. I know how my friend lives or at least used to live, not the tidiest person ever. I like to keep our place tidy and clean and don't want to come home to a mess.
2. I don't want to get in a fight over money in case something breaks. We don't have superexpensive stuff, but still. What if something breaks that costs 500 bucks new and they give us a 100 to cover the costs. I don't know what they're like with money, but people tend to fight about money-related issues. I don't want to risk our friendship over something stupid like that.
3. I think is kind of a hassle having to take all of our stuff (clothes, towels, shoes, coats, bathroom supplies etc.) to either our parents or somewhere else. We don't have a storage unit, but when someone else lives there you can't just keep your closets completely full. I think it's too much work for just those 2 months. 
4. I reaaaally don't feel comfortable letting another couple sleep and do god knows what in our bed and on the couch, I personally just think that's gross. 
5. Sure we could use the money, but we'll be fine without it as well, we certainly don't depend on it, since the rent isn't that high anyway. 
6. when we come home, obviously tired, I don't wanna come home to an empty home, meaning we have to go pick up our clothes and stuff from where we stored it. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm overthinking and making too big a deal out of it, but I feel like it's OUR home and if I don't feel good about it, that's my right. I don't think I owe them anything and the only plus is the money that we can do without. 

So long story short: am I the asshole for not wanting to rent out our house for just two months?

I angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?

1450,Not the A-hole,"Right now, I'm currently attending a dance show in which my sister is participating. The rest of the family bought tickets and we got a few seats in the front row, next to the stage.

Apparently, the front row was used to easily get from one end of the room to the other, as the other alternative was a few seconds longer, and hey everybody was doing it so it was fine right? Even when the show started, people kept going through that row, blocking the entire view. Some even stopped and just stood there.

I wouldn't have gotten mad if ir weren't for the fact that dozens of people kept going through that row and blocking my view. I decided to protest by putting my legs up front, using my intended leg room to the fullest. Now people had to ""jump over"", as in make a bigger step than usual. Some people even stood right there waiting to move my legs.

One woman commented that I should put my legs back and let people go. When I told her that, in a civilized society, people would just take a different route as to not disturb other attendees, she said that no one would take the longer one.

1452,Not the A-hole,"I have a friend i’ve known from childhood for maybe 13-14 years now. She’s from a family that isn’t neglectful but still doesn’t pay much attention to her. 

Her dad is black but her mother is white and her mother never tried to help her with her hair. She normally wears it back because people like to try to touch it without asking. 

She’s the type of person who loves to be touched and cared for by friends but her hair is off limits to touch to most people but she doesn’t mind when i play with it absently (the playing w/ hair is a teen girl thing i know) but her hair is kind of, well, unhealthy because she doesn’t know how to care for it. 


Like most people I get into a youtube rabbit hole and when I was doing that a month ago I saw some women with hair like hers doing styles and curls by washing and wrapping it. 

The styles don’t last more than a week so i was thinking of offering to style her hair because she’s been struggling with mental health and i know that when i struggle new hair gets me out of a funk. 

 In the moments i’m not amazed watching the videos i’m aware of this “it’s not for me” feeling. The women in the videos tend to jokingly poke fun at white people hair tutorials and styles. I thought about the fact that that i’m a white person and i don’t want to be presumptuous and come across like a racist asshole because i assumed that i knew what was best for her.

1453,Not the A-hole,"So a few months ago I got engaged to my very best friend and boyfriend of six years. We’re thrilled and are in the middle of planning. My two sisters are in my wedding party. One of my sisters really enjoys being the center of attention and has been that way since we were little, which I’m fine with. However, when I booked my very first dress consultation at David’s Bridal, she immediately asked if we could look at bridesmaid dresses during the same time-slot. Now, I’ve always been eager to please and do not want to become a bridezilla, but I kind of felt that the dress appointment was my time, especially since it was the very first one. I ended up telling her “no” and that I’d be happy to look at bridesmaid dresses another time. She seemed hurt when I said this and so I felt bad.

1455,Everyone Sucks,"My good friend struggles a bit more than me financially (though I’m by no means rich) and rarely gets to eat out or relax. So when she comes over I try to pamper her a little – I’ll get her favorite snacks & drinks, cook for her, and usually pick up the tab if we go to a restaurant. I’ve always thought I was being quite hospitable, sometimes to the point of me even being a bit resentful of how much I give. Our relationship has become more and more “come to my house when you need a break from your life, and I’ll make sure it’s like a little vacation for you.”

So earlier this week she came over and stayed for 2 days. The first day I made us omelets & toast for breakfast, and then we had lasagna for lunch and watched a movie. I made popcorn and offered her a cookie, which she declined. For dinner we went out (I paid, just as a note) and had pizza and salad. Next day, neither of us had much for breakfast. She had a cookie and I had a few bites of cold pasta salad. Then we went and played tennis & went to a late lunch at about 3 pm. Keep in mind we had barely eaten and had been active. So I scarfed down my soup and sandwich, while she ate less than half of hers. I made (what I thought was) a light-hearted comment, just saying how she wasn’t eating much and had to be hungry by now. She said she was “stuffed” and “felt sick at how full she was”, which I then laughed at because, again, it was way past lunch time and we had been quite active. I just thought it was a bit funny that a few bites of sandwich and half a bowl of soup had her “so stuffed”.

So then she starts going on about how I’m always eating, that people need less food than you think, that how much she ate is more than enough for a meal, that she thinks it’s gross when people eat too much, that it’s “way too much” to eat three full meals a day, etc. It basically came across as her calling me a glutton.

For reference, though I’m not teeny tiny, I’m a normal-sized woman with no weight issues (IMO I guess). I’m tall and about a size 8. She’s probably in the 10-12 range, not “big” by any means, but noticeably bigger than me, particularly around the middle. So I just said as much: “If I overeat then why am I a little smaller than you?” She just stared at me for a second and replied “I just think you have a faster metabolism.” I just said okay and moved on, but the whole exchange continues to bother me. I don’t know which one of us was rude or if we both were or if I \*am\* a glutton, if I’ve been wrong to “constantly” offer her food while she’s over… IDK here. I just know that I’ve somehow ended up feeling wrong for cooking so much for her and taking her out to eat. No one likes to be told they eat too much, especially a woman, and no woman wants to hear she’s the bigger one either (which is what I told my friend). And I know I technically ""started it"" by asking her how she could possibly be full.

1456,Not the A-hole,"Hi Reddit! So I’m 18f and I’m a senior in high school right now. I’ve applied to a bunch of colleges and gotten accepted to a few that I really like (re: a tiny little college I got to visit and fell in love with and is also relatively cheap to go to on scholarship), but I DIDN’T apply for our local public university. It’s a great school, but I’ve been waiting my whole life to leave the state (and telling everyone I meet that I’m gonna move away ASAP), and I really would rather not.

The university is only about 45 min from my house, and my mom wants me to go there so that I can go to school and live at home to save me some money. But things have always been really tense with my mom (she has a tendency to blow up small things and then ignore me until I apologize even if I wasn’t in the wrong), and I’ve been looking forward to the idea of not having to be around her as often anymore. In fact, the best week of my life was probably when I was at a week long stayaway camp where I didn’t have to see her (ironically on the campus of the university I didn’t apply to). 

And even though I have a pretty good scholarship to my tiny little college I’m in love with, she’s still talking about how much I should stay at home, to save money while I get my degree, and how taxing it’ll be for me to travel home for holidays and summers.

The kickers here are that:
1) My parents aren’t paying a single dime
for my college tuition, it’s all gonna be on me
2) My mom constantly belittles me for even wanting to go to college. I want to study Psychology and eventually get a PhD, but she’s always making underhanded (or usually, loudly on the phone with her friends) comments about how I “won’t make it in college” and how I “should look into being a plumber, they make bank annually” (no hate on plumbers, their jobs are important af, but that’s not my path)

So, Reddit, AITA for not wanting to stay with my mom anymore and for running to an out of state college ASAP?",24,42,0.98

Both my brother and his husband were addicts. They fueled each other’s addiction and even they said that neither of them would be able to get better with other around. 

Brother’s husband also constantly started fights with my family and alienated himself and my brother so there was a period of time where my brother didn’t talk to me when he was once my best friend. 
Brother’s husband was also arrested for domestic violence against my brother. My brother says that it isn’t what I think it was but I think he is just trying to protect him because the story he tells doesn’t line up. It was also obvious that brother’s husband was verbally abusive. 

Brother’s husband was not all bad, when he was sober he was an alright guy, and my brother did love him. 
Brother’s husband recently died due to overdose and the first thing I felt was relief because it meant brother would no longer suffer and maybe he could finally get clean. I feel really guilty for feeling this way. It broke my brother’s heart, but he has been sober since. I know that brother’s husband was somebody’s child, and he had nieces and nephews, and a sister, and like I said was obviously my brother’s husband and best friend.

Okay, we think, we’ve had this happen already what’s this guy have to say. As he’s talking, I just think something’s... off. He only talks about his interest in D&D and how anti social of a person he is, how glad he’s found someone like me, who looks so nice to talk to. This sets alarm bells off in my head and when he leaves (barely asking anything about me or my family despite coming up to talk to us) I tell my family how uncomfortable I feel. They brush it off, saying he might be autistic, and as an autistic person myself, I should understand and sympathize with his plight of talking to others.

So the night continues and I’m watching this guy from across the room. He’s grooming his mother and as I walk up to get food (which is coincidentally right near where he is sitting) I hear him say something along the line of “I made a girlfriend. (Points to me) There she is.” 

Significantly creeped out, I hurry back to my family, and the night goes on as normal until the guy from earlier comes up asking for my number so we can “keep in touch.” I panicked and tried to get out of it, but my parents were adamant I give my number to him, so I gave him one that sounded like mine but wasn’t.

I started to just separate the dishes and pots that I bought from the others and put them in a separate cabinet and put a sign up saying that if my roommates use them they need to wash and put them away immediately, I do not care what they do with their own dishes.

My mother and I recently have been a bit more argumentative since I turned 18. 

I got a job making $10/hr for 30+ hours every week back in August of last year while i was 17 but i was out of school so it worked. Since I've started working there i've helped with paying rent and letting my mom borrow money when she needed a little more to last. Roughly i pay about 300-400 every month to help her out. 

Once I turned 18 back in December I decided to start becoming a bit more independent. I got a pay raise. I started looking into my own Insurance plan starting up this month finally, looking at getting an apartment this summer with my friend, etc. etc.

I've started going out of town to see friends from school more and my mom took issue with it since I no longer ask to go, but instead tell her im going out of town for the weekend, going to do stuff without asking first in general. The car I drive is technically in her name still but I am the main carer for it, i get the gas, use it for work, and have put over $800 into it to fix issues its had over the last year. 

She also works full time so oftentimes, we don't have anything ready for dinner, on these nights we just make whatever we want to eat and call it a night. I usually go get something cheap to eat and will ask my younger brother if he wants anything and usually its just something small. My mom takes offense that I don't ask her, despite that we both no she refuses to let me get her anything in the first place.

I pop my headphones in and head down the main staircase to get to the exit. After the first flight down I hear what sounds like a group of girls talking, which in itself is not unusual at all.


I round the corner and 'lo-and-behold' there are 3 girls, standing in the complete middle of the stairway. I was in no type of mood (nor did I have a Pokeflute) for this bullshit so instead of asking them to move, I say fuck it and instead make the mistake of trying to squeeze in between the little amount of space between the rightmost one and the railing


""Umm, excuse me!?"" the Girl closest to where I was trying to pass thorough says to me before allowing me to get to close.


""Yeah?"" I replied, taking out one of my headphones ""What?"".


""What do you think you're doing?"" Same girl says, this time I notice her friends are giggling.


""I mean.. trying to go down the stairs? What does it look like?""  I admit, saying 'what does it look like' may have been a bit unwarranted...


""Look, can you move? It doesn't make much sense to talk in the middle of stairs why not go to the cafeteria or something?"" I say before giving her a chance to respond 


Snorlax is now silent and her friends aren't laughing anymore, instead all three turn to each other with a 'get a load of this guy' look on their faces until 1st girl says. 


""Whats your issue? Go down a different set of stairs"" says the girl.


I was shocked, flabbergasted. How the fuck don't they see how selfish and inconvient standing in the MIDDLE of a fucking staircase is?

""What??"" The girl says to her friends  ""Did you just call me a bitch?""


I begrudgingly respond ""Yeah, you're kind of being unreasonable, and rude so...""

On one occasion, I was at a coffee shop reading The Trial by Kafka, minding my own damn business when a guy sits down at the table with me. I ignore him. He starts praising Kafka and says he didn't know any girls who were interested in that sort of thing, how I must be ""different"". Um, excuse me, wtf? Kafka is an extremely well known author, I literally read Metamorphosis in high school. That's a huge pet peeve of mine, freaking people who act like the well known authors they stan for are actually niche and obscure that only misunderstood geniuses like them appreciate. Fuck offff with that. So without ever saying a word to him, I got up and left the shop. He followed me on to the street saying, ""wow, are you serious right now? What's your problem?"" Then he called me a turbo b!tch and went back into the shop. Who does that? Just sits down at a table where a person is reading and starts talking at them? Weird.

Then on an unrelated occasion, I was walking around downtown playing Pokemon Go. I was doing a raid at a park when a Male avatar enters the lobby. Eh. It was a level 2 I could have easily done on my own. Anyway, we win of course and this guy approaches me saying I should thank him for ""helping"" me. Excuse me, sir, but I'm a level 36 and he was lower than that, if anything, I helped him. Still, we each could have beat the raid solo. (Btw, I did almost twice as much damage, js) Anyway, he tries to engage me in conversation in the most pretentious way possible and does not get the hint I don't want to talk to him. He's literally following me at this point as I'm ignoring him and trying to play. When I see it, a city bus approaching.

This last year he got a new job which made him very conceited and would go out every weekend with his new workmates who are all...quite misogynistic. I definitely noticed changes in the way he would treat people and pulled away a bit. 

Three months ago he showed up at my place in tears saying he made a big mistake and his wife was leaving him because she found a thong under the bed that wasn’t hers and an email between him the workmates joking about hiring hookers. He swears up and down that he never cheated on her and never would and he was so devastated I had to believe him. His wife left him in the middle of the day without saying a word, just divorce papers and no one knows where she left to. 

He was so broken and spent a lot of time talking to us about it, I know he really loved her and was totally blindsided but the situation also looked so bad from her end. We did our best to comfort and be there for him. A few weeks after all this, he stopped hanging out with us as much and started hanging out with his work friends a lot more. His attitude did a total 180, he wasn’t sad and moping around anymore but cocky. He got on this kick about how she probably elaborately set him up to leave him for another guy and pin all the blame on him because he got his friend to watch her at her work and she was eating her lunch with a guy. He suddenly started dating this new girl - my wife and I were pretty surprised but trying to be supportive asked him about her and he said, verbatim ‘she’s a butterface but always down to bone’. The new girlfriend started posting about them on Instagram in his hot tub that ex wife got him as a wedding gift with a caption that said ‘my hot tub, my man, my house now’ with the laugh emoji. Of course this got back to ex wife and she went absolutely psycho on him, telling him things so terrible I can’t include them in the post, trying to screw him as much as possible in the divorce and selling the hot tub in the middle of the day while he was at work.

To give context, my parents, as they had done with my brother, made a bank account when I was born and put my savings into it. This included random money I got from family, and a monthly allowance the government gives parents for, well, being parents. Parents have no obligation to give this money to their children, but my parents do it because they want to. The account has me as the main holder and my mother as the legal representative. The spoken deal is that I'll be free to use the money from this account once I graduate from college. My parents are also divorced.



Recently, I turned 18. I have another bank account which I use daily, from the same branch. Yesterday, I had to go to the bank to sign some papers to get everything sorted. When getting account access, aside from getting access to my day to day account, I also got access to that savings account, since they're from the same bank. There, I noticed that there were a lot of movements, way more than the supposed monthly deposit. 



As it seemed to me, my mother was borrowing money from my account and then depositing it again. But on one of the movements, 2000€ were taken and they were never put back. I found that odd, but I didn't know how much money I had there before as records only went back 12 months. I still found it strange though, and consulted with my father.



Well as it seems, this wasn't normal at all, she never asked for my permission or even mentioned a thing to me or to my father. After confirming this wasn't normal, I decided to confront my mother.



When I got home, I showed my mother the bank transactions and asked her to explain what was going on. She started screaming at me, asking me how I got access to that, saying that I betrayed her and went to speak with my father before speaking with her, and that she didn't have the obligation to put the money in that account. I told her that I simply didn't like that she took the money without asking me, since I had no problem with borrowing the money. She was having none of it, she kept screaming at me and insisting I acted wrongly and should have spoken with her first. 

She also said that first thing on Monday she was getting a loan and giving me the 2000€ back, but that wasn't the issue for me and IMO she blew everything completely out of proportion. Also, she said that she didn't want me living with her anymore, and that my father did something similar with my brother's account. She told me to go live with my father, and asked me to pretend that she doesn't exist anymore. That includes meals.


I believe I handled everything maturely, I simply went to my father first because I didn't want to accuse my mother of anything unnecessarily. When I approached her I did so calmly but she instantly turned it around on me. I barely spoke, she just screamed at me the whole time and didn't want to hear me.

1475,Not the A-hole,"I sew as a hobby and make a lot of my own clothes. It's not a source of income for me, just a small hobby that I do because I like to make clothes that fit me. I've been doing it for a long time. My mom is the one who taught me. 

My sister approached me a few weeks ago and had some ideas. She wanted me to sew an Easter Sunday dress for her 9 year old daughter. She gave me a lot of examples. It was a generic fit and flare with elbow sleeves, lace overlay, high crew neck. 

I told her no, but tried to do it gently. I said that I was busy working on my own wardrobe, that I don't enjoy sewing for others, and then I also said that I do not like sewing one time use things. I explained I've been approached about wedding dresses by friends before, and my answer is always no. I didn't say this, but sewing for children is such a waste of time and effort. They don't care and can't appreciate the hard work that goes into it. They roll around in the dirt and have the time of their lives because they're kids. It's the mom who cares. All of that work is for one Facebook photo. Not worth it to me. 

She got really angry, called me very selfish, and told me that I am a bad sister, because if my kids needed anything, she would obviously do it. I suggested a few shops for them to try very nice Easter dresses, and she became angrier, saying that giving me those suggestions was meaningless and that she should be able to ask her own sister for something as simple as ""a few seams on some fabric."" At that point, I told her that if she wanted to have clothes like that, buy a sewing machine and learn to sew for herself.  I told her that our mom gave us the same opportunity to learn to sew and she instead wanted to play video games and read comic books and run around playing sports. She didn't want to learn. 

In the end she took it to the Court of Facebook, where she shaded me and said her Selfish Sister would make her beautiful niece the ""dress of her dreams"" for Easter and that I had shamed her for being a feminist tomboy. People jumped in saying that it was selfish, some people don't understand how hard it is to be a mother, family can be so cruel, her beautiful daughter deserves that dress, and then comments about who sews anymore anyway, etc. This all made me feel bad and second guess myself. 

Then she had the niece get on and cry in a video because Aunt Me wasn't going to make her a pretty dress because Aunt Me is too busy on her OWN wardrobe. And what about me, Aunt Me? It's just one dress!

So honestly, is it me? Am I the Asshole? Should I just make my niece a dress?",157,488,0.96
1476,Not the A-hole," So this starts back in 2017 when my parents split (they were never married but had been together for around 25ish years) shortly after my 16th birthday. My parents hadn't had the best relationship for a couple years prior but me being a kid I never really noticed until I look back on it now. My mom tells me that she's moving out and that they're not together anymore. Obviously this messed me up but I think deep down I knew it was coming. Anyways she moves out and I live part time with each of them. It comes to my attention that part of the reason they separated was because my mom was seeing a guy who lived in hawaii (I live on the East Coast US but my parents are both flight attendants) named David (not his actual name) and I was furious with my mom for this and I still don't fully forgive her for it. Couple months pass and during the summer my mom asks me to come to hawaii with her and my grandmother and I didn't really think much of it because we go on vacations every summer since we get free flights since they work for an airline. We have a really good trip until my mom wants me to meet David and his daughters and I lost my shit. I told her flat out that I never wanted to meet him and that she knew that and that I fucking hated this guy for being part of the reason my parents split up. She was very upset by this and my grandmother was too, and my grandmother tells me that the whole trip was just a reason for me to go meet him and I was livid. We've had arguments over it a couple times after this and I basically say I never want to meet him and she wants me to meet him because she is an important person in her life and she thinks I should be involved with that. Not much happens until late fall 2018 where she asks me to go to a wedding with her in California (I dont know the people getting married or anyone else going except my mother) and her boyfriend and his entire family would be there. She asks me for a while and I sort of lied and told her I couldn't go because I had a huge paper due that week that we were doing in school (which isn't untrue) and she was really upset by this. She kept asking me to go and I kept saying no and that I'm not ready for that. My dad found out and he was upset about it and said that she shouldn't be making me go if I didn't want to (My parents dont talk at all anymore). My mom starts crying and saying stuff like she doesn't understand why I don't wanna go and that its important to her and I told her I would meet them eventually (which for the record I really hope I don't have to). After the wedding she kept trying to guilt trip me by bringing me stuff back from California like some staff exclusive apple shirts (Davids brother works for apple) and she said if I would've went I would've been able to tour the apple HQ and got a free apple watch and that kind of stuff. I understand where shes coming from that she wants me to meet him but I think she should respect my reasoning",60,62,0.94
1477,Not the A-hole,"I'm using a new account due to the fact that my main account is all fandom-related bullshit. I am an accountant in the US and our tax season is almost done (FINALLY), but it's still stressful.

I have this client that I've been taking care of for a few years and he always got refunds every time he filed his return since he always made estimated tax payments. When he got married in 2017, his wife filed with him, which ended up that they both owed  a substantial amount of taxes on their joint return. I'd like to point out that they're both freelancers therefore their income fluctuates. My client is usually good at reporting to me when he receives a good amount of income, so that he can pay in his estimated taxes during the year. His wife, on the other hand, is completely MIA until I initiate. I reach out to her and give her tax projections, but it always falls through because she always says she ""doesn't have enough funds.""

Since it's tax season, my client calls me to ask me about  his taxes and expresses that he would not like to be screwed over this year. I told him, ""It depends on how much you made and how much taxes you've paid in for the year. I can't give a definite answer without knowing the big picture."" After 10 minutes of going back and forth over the phone with various scenarios, I finally say ""listen, if you're worried about owing a huge amount of taxes this year due to your wife, talk to your wife about filing separately therefore you won't be liable for the taxes that she will eventually owe for this year and she will have to pay the taxes that she owes on what she's made."" He gives me this MANIACAL laugh over the phone and says along the lines of ""so basically I just let her rot in jail for her unpaid taxes and I walk away scot-free?"" That's not how it works. I explain to him that it it's only a SUGGESTION and that she won't be ""thrown in jail"" just because she owes taxes. He says ""well, we're together as a married couple therefore we should be in this together."" I kept my mouth shut even though I can list a substantial amount of clients that are married and still file separately, but, hey, that's just me.

We end our conversation and I'm still waiting for their information so I can file their tax return...

Every time the line stopped they would sit down and bury their faces in their phones and be completely oblivious. 

This was not a single file line (Orlando, Soarin for those familiar). Shoulder to shoulder probably 5 adult men could stand side by side. 

This family would sit and look at their phones and eventually move when they managed to noticed.

I motioned a ""cut"" several times and finally got fed up and cut them. They left tons of empty space in front of them on top of not paying attention when the line moved. 

My wife insists I'm an asshole and should not have cut and the family was talking shit when finally did about how rude I am.

He makes comments about women, demeans his wife and daughters. They’re for making babies and keeping the home 🙄 I tolerate it because hey he’s old and for now he’s my husbands problem (we don’t have kids yet). 

Recently, my husband divulged that his dad is sending him porn (naked gifs of topless women, women undressing - porn in my eyes) through Facebook messenger. No words or explanations, just multiple gifs. 

To me it’s a huge red flag. It just screams perv and makes me worried for the children and special needs children he works with.  Edit: sorry should have explained better - worried because he likes to make inappropriate and sexual jokes around them. He’s gotten in trouble for doing it before. The kids don’t understand and they want to be friends with the coach and the issue kinda spirals. Not worried he’s going to molest or hurt them. Sorry!

1481,No A-holes here,"Despite the fact I tell my husband's brother and his wife that my kids don't need anything for Christmas and birthdays, they continue to buy them clothes for all of these occasions. It is very nice of them. But the problem is that they only buy them clothes that are camo. I for one hate camouflage. It belongs on hunters while hunting and that is it. My husband (an avid hunter) doesn't even wear camo when he isn't hunting. 

So they end up buying all these clothes that I literally don't put my children in ever. I have numerous onesies, shirts and pants in camouflage that get donated with the tags still on. 

While I wouldn't mind keeping the status quo and letting some lucky camo loving family find their kids a wardrobe at the ARC, BIL and SIL have trouble making ends meet without buying clothes for my kids. They're always talking about pawning stuff for bill money or calling us to borrow $20 to get gas to make it back home (which they always pay back). So it makes it even worse that they're wasting their money.

She recently messaged me asking if I wanted to have dinner for my birthday, but while we were discussing things she wanted to ask if I'd like to meet her fiance.

Ms. Deabler, the lifestyle ""writer"" and ""editor"" for Fox News did what every other young ""journalist"" (read: freshly minted journalism major working as a content slave) does and [wrote a ""news"" article on the post](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bride-allegedly-asks-guest-to-leave-wedding-for-wearing-military-uniform-and-medals).

I got the top comment (Yay me!).

She quoted that top comment for the article (without attribution), along with another of my comments.  

While we've been raided for content before by these ""journalists"", this one stuck in my craw for a few reasons:

1.

What?  I'm a fucking mod.  I have an obvious green flair thing by my name.  How can you not notice I'm the same guy?  I know you get beaten if you don't publish 4 articles a day, but pay attention. 

2. She improperly edited my quote.  If you quote somebody, the bits between the quotation marks must be verbatim.  If you leave something out, you note that with an ellipsis.  I didn't go to journalism school and even I know that.  

3. She fucking (Sic)ed me.  Yes, in my haste I wrote ""whose"" instead of ""who's"", *but if you are editing my goddamn quote anyways*, have the fucking decency to not gimme a (sic).

So I live in a different part of the country than my family.  They live pretty far away and I only see them a couple times per year.  A while back I was visiting during the Christmas holiday.  I’d taken a couple weeks off of work to spend some time with my family. 

I was chilling at my parents’ house and looking forward to a day of shopping, eating at my favorite restaurant and other fun relaxing things.  

This family member calls the house and asks somebody to watch her 3 year old for the day.  She had to work and her MIL had backed out.  They said no, they also had to work.  She asked them to ask me.  Didn’t ask me herself, had somebody else do it.  I said no, that I had plans, and went back to my coffee, thinking that would be the end of it.

Nope.  The next few hours I get messages like 

“Really.  REALLY?!  You can’t watch a 3 year old for a few hours?”

“She has a car seat.  You can literally take her anywhere you go.”

When I didn’t answer she started posting to Facebook.  Stuff like “I can’t believe how selfish people are.”  “I have to call in to work because some people can’t possibly take a minute from their busy schedules to watch [toddler], Hope I don’t get fired.” “Wow.  Just wow.” “You’d think family would be there for you.”  “Must be nice not to have any responsibilities.”  Just posting all day.  Instead of looking for alternate, more appropriate child care she blew up Facebook.  

It was never brought up again, but I do get the sense that she holds this against me.  She drops a lot of “must be nice” type comments.  And I haven’t talked to the rest of our family about it beyond “yeah I think those Facebook posts were about me.  Oh well.”  I’m pretty sure they think I’m selfish anyway so I guess what’s one more thing?  I dropped it because I don’t see my family often and I don’t want to spend that limited time arguing.  Nobody’s brought it up to me.  

Anyway, AITA? I honestly could have cancelled my plans and watched her kid.  I just didn’t want to.  I didn’t feel like I should have to, and besides that I don’t even live there.

My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) rent a house together in a nice town by the ocean. We have an great landlord that can sometimes be weird but otherwise he is a good guy. The other day I was home alone, smoking some weed and cleaning around the house. There was a knock and doorbell ring at the door, so obviously I go to answer it (and spray some febreze first lol). Random guy says “Hello I’m so and so from a local solar panel company and I was wondering if I could come in and take a look inside the house and the attic.” I glance behind him and I don’t see a car with any solar panel company logo. I say something along the lines of no, I wasn’t informed by my landlord that anyone would be stopping by so I’m sorry but have a good day. He insisted. He said something like please I’m supposed to do this, are you sure he isn’t here etc. etc. I again say no, told him to call my landlord then and proceeded to shut the door. That was that, stranger saunters off. 

 Later on that day, landlord stops by and is kind of annoyed with me. Landlord says“ that guy drove two hours to come here and you just sent him off like that. You should buy him a six pack or something to say sorry!” He kept going on about it. I told him next time someone is stopping by to inform me because I will never let a stranger in the house regardless if I am alone or not. 

 Also, I did not mention this is not the first time he has sent someone by without informing me and I have shut the door in their face. I don’t believe I am in the wrong here but I also am hyper aware of crimes/rapes/murders that have happened because of situations like this.

Before I knew this, I hadn’t talked to her about my service in the Marines, and I definitely wasn’t looking forward to discussing it. 

I deployed to Iraq with 3rd Marines in 2004 and fought in Fallujah. Eventually, a month or two ago, we got to talking about what I was doing at that point in my life, and not wanting to cause conflict but also wanting to be truthful, I told her that I served in the Marines but never deployed. She was a little upset that I didn’t tell her that before but it was all fine and good. Just recently, she comes to me crying and demanding why I wasn’t truthful with her. Somehow, she got her hands on a copy of my DD 214 and found out about my overseas service. I told her that I would have told her eventually but she gave me this spiel about how I should’ve been more truthful with her and that it was a really big deal. Apparently her sister told her that she “shouldn’t be in a relationship with a liar” so she broke up with me.

I walk over to the couch and sit down on this U-shaped cushion (kinda like [this one](https://secure.img1-fg.wfcdn.com/im/59675625/resize-h600-w600%5Ecompr-r85/4146/41464506/U+Shaped+Body+Pillow+Protector.jpg)) we've had forever and put some trash TV on. Of course I end up falling asleep lying on the couch.

Flash forward to a couple hours later and I wake up to Claire prodding me in the shoulder. I open my eyes and she is glaring straight at me, holding the egg right in my face. There is a tiny chink poked out of it ad the baby emu's beak is legit coming through. I scream and ask her why the fuck she is holding a hatching ANIMAL in my face. She tells me that she left the egg in the U-shaped cushion to ""incubate"" and that by sleeping on it for ages I had ""hatched"" it.

She said it was the egg's ""cooling period"" and by sitting on it I caused it to hatch premature. I told her she she should ""cool HER period"" and that she didn't know what she was talking about. I think she was just mad that I hatched the egg and not her.

Now she is talking about me LEAVING THE APARTMENT (the lease is in her name) over this.

I feel like it was an honest mistake and she shouldn't have stolen the egg and LEFT IT ON THE COUCH in the first place. So please, tell me, AITA here?!??",1030,8048,0.87

1498,Everyone Sucks,"Earlier in the week the mother of one of my son’s classmates came over to discuss a problem between our boys.  I guess my son has been telling her son that he stinks, is gross, and so on.  I told her I would talk to my son about it and we exchanged numbers in case there were any other problems.  

I talked to my son and he didn’t deny it.  He says the boy does smell really bad and is assigned to sit next to him in one of their classes. I told him to just try to ignore it and just stay away from him otherwise.  

Last night I got a call from the classmate’s mother saying that my son had picked on her’s again during lunch and that he was upset again.  I confronted my son about it and he said that her son has been purposely sitting across from him at lunch because he knows that it bothers my son.  

I called the classmate’s mother back and told her what my son had said.  I told her that it’s not ok that my son was rude, but to be fair no one wants to smell bad hygiene while they’re trying to eat.  And also if her son was going to go out of his way to put himself in that position then maybe he should toughen up a bit. 

She just hung up on me.  I don’t condone bullying and have talked to my son about it again, but at the same time I don’t feel my viewpoint on it is all that ridiculous. ",362,927,0.93
1499,META,"**EDIT3: Report any relationship posts as ""validation"" and we will take a look.**

Hey everyone. We've been noticing a significant presence of relationship-related posts lately. People have also complained about it - we hear you.

A lot of relationship posts are good, but posts surrounding these topics are so common: 

> ""AITA for breaking up with my significant other for X reason?"" 

> ""AITA for being upset / feeling bad about [action]?"" 

> ""AITA for not wanting to do [sexual act]?"" 

> ""AITA for reporting my abusive [significant other, family member, friend] to the authorities?"" 

> ""AITA for not putting up with my significant other for wanting to participate in a lifestyle that I strongly disagree with?"" 

> ""AITA for wishing my significant other would put more effort into our relationship?""

> ""AITA for not liking / returning a gift?""

> ""AITA for cutting [person] out of my life?"" 




Almost every time one of these posts are made, the responses follow a very common Reddit mindset: 

> People are not obligated to be in relationships if they don't want to, and no one should be forced to do anything. People should be allowed to express their feelings as long as they do not act out in a harmful way. People should not have to suffer through abuse, emotional abuse included. 

That mindset is great! But it's so damn common. Historically, we have not removed them for validation because people can get very confused in relationships, and we don't want to punish people for being confused. But at this point, with over **600K subscribers** and growing to be one of the most active discussion-based subreddits of all time, we need to be a little more strict on these. That doesn't mean relationship posts are automatically deleted, but we will be trying to remove more non-unique threads as we see them. 


-------



### **If you made a thread about one of these topics, please read below:** 

[We might have linked you to this announcement after removing your thread]. 

> This is a generic answer, but it really does fit a lot of situations. You are not an asshole if you want to break up with your significant other for having a certain personality trait, doing something horrible, cheating on you, insulting you, being racist, being sexist, etc. You are also not an asshole if your significant other has made a significant life-altering choice and you don't want to stay with them for it. We strongly suggest you post to a relationship or advice subreddit to work things out in a more focused discussion. Even if you are not the asshole, relationships take a lot of work and compromise and your issue is most likely more than just an asshole judgment situation.

> If you feel you are being abused, physically or mentally, you are not the asshole for wanting to leave. You are not the asshole for reporting an abusive person to the authorities (just be careful please). 

> Finally, you are not an asshole for refusing sex or specific sex acts (including oral). Also you're not an asshole for *wanting* sex or specific sex acts (as long as you do so respectfully and chivalrously). Either way, you may want to post in a relationship or advice subreddit because a strong relationship requires good communication on these topics and this sub wasn't made for relationship advice.

> If your situation doesn't apply to the message above, it may have removed because your thread topic is far too common. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and happy judging.

1503,Not the A-hole,"I (f 34) have been married to hubby (m 38) for 15 years. We have 4 kids, ages 7-17. We used to go out to the bar regularly when we were younger. For the past ten years Hubby has not wanted to go out socially and feels that its not appropriate for a married woman to go out with out her husband. Background- neither of have any issues with alcoholism. I don't expect to go out with friends every week or even once a month. I would just like to do something fun once in a while. He does take me on a dinner date once a week and wants to spend as much time with me, one on one or in a family setting, as he can.
His reasoning is that its not fair for him to sit home and be alone and that its not normal for a married woman to do these types of things. I am responsible and bring in 80% or more of the family income. If I did put my foot down and go, despite his protests, he might track me down and make me come home or cause a scene or keep me up all night discussing it when I get home.
He is not physically abusive but has a lot of control over me and can be very insistent that he's normal and he's just trying to protect me from people and situations that arent good for me. He also doesnt trust people and can be clingy to me. 
I dont come from a normal family and I honestly dont know sometimes whether he is right. He can be very convincing and we've been together since I was 16 so I have nothing to compare it to.
I just want to get some input from other people about what is normal in a marriage regarding socializing without the spouse. AITA for thinking its ok to go without him?

1504,Not the A-hole,"I don't think I've done this, but the offended party thinks that's the case. All names changed.

I hosted a game night with my husband, inviting four of our friends. It was semi regular, every other week or once a month at the same time due to some of the participants work schedules being tough to work around except for this one night every other week. Larry is my husband's best friend from childhood and earned the first invite. He brought along his girlfriend, Jessie, who has since become a good friend of mine, and also invited his co-worker, Rob. Our friend Ella also attended.

We had lots of fun! It kept up for a good year and a half of camaraderie. It's become one of the few things I enjoy during my week (I'm a newish mother of a 1 year old and struggle making new friends). I genuinely credit this game night with friends with part of my healing with my mental illness.

Then, Larry and Jessie broke up. It was nasty, with lots of hurt emotions, shouting, and the like. It had lasted almost three years by the time it was done. (For the record, they're better off broken up; things had gotten so toxic for both of them.)

Larry took things especially hard. He was clearly worried he was going to end up socially isolated, and myself, my husband, and Rob did our best to assure him he was our friend no matter what.

But then game night came around. I wanted to be fair, so I invited Rob and Ella and sent a separate message to Larry and Jessie, explaining they were both invited but if they wanted to come they had to commit to being civil with the other party. If they weren't comfortable doing that, we would hang out some other time.

Jessie said ""Yeah, I'm okay with seeing him, I can be polite."" Larry said, ""I don't want to see her,"" and I replied, ""okay, I'll make sure we grab lunch sometime this week to make up for it.""

Larry believed he should have been given some kind of preference because he's been my husband and my friend longer than Jessie. He complained about feeling abandoned. And even when Rob decided he would go over to hangout with Larry one on one after game night, Larry bitterly remarked that it was a 'pity visit'.

Jessie is disabled on multiple fronts and has very limited opportunities for socialization, plus I had genuinely become close friends with her - she's my daughters godmother. I couldn't just invited Larry and not her; it wasn't fair.

But part of me wonders if I wasn't fair to Larry by basically hanging out with his ex while he sat at home alone, even if he was the one who decided he didn't want to see Jessie.

It's been about four months since this went down, and not knowing if I did the right thing has eaten me up inside. I've stopped hosting game nights entirely because I feel so conflicted. Help me out so I can finally move past this and maybe get back to having fun with my friends...



*EDIT*: thanks for all the feedback guys. My takeaway: I'm going to check in with Larry to see how he's feeling now that it's been a few months. If he's ready, we'll give things another try. If not, I'm gonna restart game night while alternating invites between Larry and Jessie. I'm also going to encourage Larry to start his own game night and tell him I'd love to come for it.

Also, to clarify on the godmother bit: I had to choose somebody who practiced the same religion, and my husband and I are converts, so we don't have any family that qualified. Our congregation is quite small, only around 75 regular attendees, and Jessie and Larry are the ones that are our friends and our age. But just because I chose her because she was on a very short list of options doesn't mean I don't consider Jessie a very close friend. We really have bonded over the past few years separate from our significant others.",117,309,0.97
1505,Asshole,"My wife and I agreed from the beginning that we would be the only people in the room when she was going through labor/birth. Her mother and I also don’t get along very well, and neither of us wanted that stress the day of.

There was an issue and I was late getting to the hospital, not by a ton though. There was still 3+ hours of labor until the baby came. However, by the time I got there, my wife had called her mother and told her to come. It caused a lot of tension and made the process pretty uncomfortable for me, and thus made it harder to support my wife. We didn’t get that special one on one time with the baby either (we initially planned on having a full day of just us, but it ended up only being a few hours) and I’m really upset about it.

My fiancé comes from a super conservative and religious background but has thankfully grown way form that (otherwise I couldn't marry her!)

Her parents however are still super conservative and homophobic and delight in talking shit and all sorts of horrible tings about the LGBT community. Other members of her family are like this as well, some more violently vocal than others. 

Well, for our wedding we have decided that everyone we invite can bring a plus one (subject to our approval of course). 

I thought about it for a really long time about my older brother and his husband (they've been married 3 years) and I don't want his husband to attend with him. 

The drama if they attend together has the potential to get out of hand and that is something I don't want to have to deal with on my wedding day. My fiancé also agrees with me on this. 

We can't not invite her parents and we can't not invite my brother so we felt our only option was to not invite his husband.

Who knows what could be said or done if he attends and yeah, we're being selfish but it's our wedding. 

I'm really not sure how he'll react though. It took my brother a long time to accept himself and  I'm sure this won't feel good but at the same time maybe his husband won't want to attend anyways.

1508,Not the A-hole,"Hey people of Reddit, I'm nearing the big day of my wedding and certain aspects seem to be going to hell. 

To start off, my fiancée and I have been dating for 8 years and engaged the last 2. After all this time we finally decided last month ""Screw it, we're getting married in May"" and have been planning our wedding since then.

The wedding is going to be small and only consist of our closest friends an family, about 30-40 people total. Neither of us want a particularly large (or expensive) wedding. I have quite the large family so to keep the wedding small I only invited the family members that I actually talk to. That meant that out of my 5 siblings I only invited my older brother's family. My other siblings I never talk to and honestly can't trust most of them to behave at my wedding. My mother (Mom) was invited though and she was not happy about not inviting my other brothers and sister to the wedding. She constantly is pestering me to invite them, but I am standing firm on not doing so. 

Last week we finally sent out the invitations for the wedding and again Mom was not happy with me not including my siblings. More over she became furious when she also found out that I invited my grandmother and aunts from my father's side of the family (who we'll refer to collectively as FAM). My father passed away a couple years ago in case anyone was wondering why he is not involved in this. Mom and FAM hate eachother. Mom has hated them all her life and told me stories of how they are terrible people. I only ever heard my mother's side, and Mom is infamous for stretching the truth or exaggerating to be made the victim. Mom tried telling me not to invite FAM and invite my siblings instead, as she can't even stand being in the same room is them. Again I stood firm on this. I assured her that she and FAM will be sitting on opposite sides of the banquet hall and never need to interact. On top of that FAM promised to not even confront Mom at all during the weddinh.

Then the other day Mom gave me an ultimatum: either I kick out FAM and invite my siblings or she will not go to the wedding. So I told her ""fine, you aren't going"". Now she has until early May to change her mind and to act like an adult for just one day for her son. She didn't respond for a few hours and later gave me some BS that I put her in the hospital due to stress. I doubt that actually happened.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my mother and my other siblings not to come to my wedding? I know they are family, but at the end of the day this is **MY** wedding, and not hers. FAM may not like my mother, but they know how important a wedding is and will set their differences aside for me and my fiancée. Is it wrong to expect the same from my own mother?

TL;DR- My mom doesn't like who I invited to my wedding, so she tried force me to uninvite them for her benefit. I said no and told my mother not to come if she can't get over that.",25,45,0.93

1510,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about three months and her best friend forever (BFF) becomes the topic of discussion sometimes. Whether it be because she hangs out with her a lot or how my roommates hate her, her BFF always come up.   
This time I was on the phone with my girlfriend while a different friend was in the background. I don't remember how, but the conversation turned into why are you so obsessed with my BFF? do you like her? do you want to sleep with her? why do you think about her all the time? and not in the kind of way where you feel like they are asking genuinely but she was asking on the attack being pissed off thinking I actually do care about her BFF in some sort of sexual way. Her friend in the background chimed in agreeing, yeah maybe he likes her too which got me more flustered. I immediately responded with no I would never sleep with someone 300 pounds. I said this to her in confidence, I thought her BFF would never hear it, I said it to her to get to stop thinking I liked her friend.

1511,Not the A-hole,"I'm using a new account because this still hasn't leaked at work I was the one who did this and my reddit is known to my coworkers.

&#x200B;

So, This last week I got a coworker of mine fired for misconduct. I don't feel bad but my coworkers are now up in arms saying who ever did this is an asshole.

&#x200B;

So, my ex-coworker used to be a good friend of mine. I met her when I got a job here about 3 years ago and we hit it off. We were extremely close friends and I had misplaced trust in her. One thing she liked to do was take photos of us together and post them on snapchat and facebook. I never thought much of this and thought she was just sharing what we did like a normal person would do. I was wrong.

&#x200B;

About a month ago a man randomly reached out to me. He claimed he was my ""girlfriends"" brother and that he had finally tracked me down. Through a long back and forth it turns out that my coworker has been pretending to her family and friends back in her home town that I was her boyfriend. She had a second facebook with her original name on it and had constructed a weird narrative in which I was her boyfriend. She claimed I was ""old fashioned"" and didn't use social media to cover up her lie.

&#x200B;

This is fucking creepy, right? I documented and archived everything and corrected the record with her brother before reporting this all to HR. I didn't feel like confronting her (I honestly didn't feel like talking to her at all) and distanced myself immediately. She picked up on this quickly and started to post on her second facebook that I had broke up with her.

&#x200B;

HR immediately transferred me away from her and kept us apart at all times. I'm guessing they told her what was going on as her facebooks disappeared over night and she began avoiding me like the plague. It was to late though as this monday she was fired for inappropriate behavior. From what HR and others have told me she will never be working in the field again.

&#x200B;

HR has kept this as quite as possible and has not leaked any details to anyone. The only thing my other coworkers know is that another coworker reported her for misconduct out of work and she got fired. Most on them are angry about this. The current opinion is that who ever did this is a spineless asshole who just ruined a girls career for ""nothing"". I'm never going to come out about this and have asked HR to never mention me because of this.

&#x200B;

So, am I the asshole here? I feel what she did was wrong and she deserved it but am I wrong?

&#x200B;

Edit/More info:

Since this question has come up, i'll explain a little of my relationship to her. We were strictly friends. There was nothing romantic or sexual between us at least as far as I could tell. I am somewhat a bit naive sometimes ((like using :hit it off"" without realizing it's romantic connotation) but there was nothing there but friendship. We were good friends (from what I thought at least) and hung out quite a bit together. But like I said, there was nothing between us but friendship.

Also, some have asked why I wen't straight to HR and did not talk to her On her ""real"" facebook she had used my real name and identifying information about me, this is how her brother tracked me down. This fake relationship stretched back 2 years and had very personal information and facts I shared with her in confidence along with very weird constructed situations she had made. One example was a picture I had sent to her while at home sick  she then turned into a dramatic story about how I was in the hospital and she was caring for me. Another is how she took a story I told about my valentines date and replaced my then girlfriend with herself.

&#x200B;

This is why I went to HR.

1512,Not the A-hole,"I will preface by saying that I am an alcoholic, and I relapsed two and a half months ago after almost a year sober.  I'm slowly working up to a year again with help from my support system and the good people over at r/stopdrinking.

Yesterday was my brother's birthday, the big four-oh.  There was a party.  My brother has been one of my biggest supports in my sobriety, so I thought that since I was invited there would be no alcohol considering my relatively recent relapse.  I don't expect him to cater to me.  I just assumed due to his support.  Last minute he texted me that his wife had turned it into a BYOB party.  I said I would drop by, but probably wouldn't come inside.  True to my word, I went.  When I arrived I texted him I was outside.  He and his wife came out to greet me and I gave him a hug, told him happy birthday, and gave him his present.  We chatted for a few minutes.  He said he understood that I couldn't come in.  She said she was sorry for doing the BYOB.  She wasn't thinking.  I told her it was fine, because the party was for my brother.  Can't expect them to cater to my needs simply because I can't control myself around alcohol.  She asked if I wanted to come in for cake, and I told her it probably wasn't a good idea since everyone inside was drinking.  We made our goodbyes, and I came home.

This morning I woke up to a text from her saying that it was rude of me not to at least stay for cake and whatnot.  She said that my brother was ""extremely hurt"" by my not being there for his fortieth.  She said that as strong as I am, I should have been able to be around alcohol without losing control since we had had a St. Patrick's day lunch and she and my brother had been drinking then and it didn't get me then.  I explained that two people having a green beer across the dinner table is different from a house full of people drinking.  She said that she was upset with me for acting selfish.  I apologized for any unintended hurt I might have caused.  I have yet to talk to my brother about supposedly hurting him as he's sleeping off a hangover and hasn't answered my text.  I don't know where this whole thing came from, because they've both been super supportive of my sobriety.  Normally I would suspect drunkenness on her part, but she sent the text this morning.  It was what woke me up.  Regardless, I'm wondering if maybe I should have sucked it up and just gone to an AA meeting or something after hanging at the party for a bit.

So, Reddit...AITA for bailing on my brother's fortieth birthday to avoid the temptation of another relapse?

EDIT:  This post has been up fewer than twenty minutes, and you guys are already making me feel a lot better about my decision.  I appreciate all the judgments.  Of course, if you were calling me a huge asshole, I would accept that too.  : )

EDIT 2: I was finally able to talk to my brother.  He said that he had mentioned to her that he was down about the fact that I couldn't enjoy the party.  She mistook what he said.  She also texted me and apologized for blowing up at me.  Everything's good now.  I appreciate everyone for their judgments.",64,236,0.98

1514,Not the A-hole,"I stopped talking to my mom 4 years ago and recently stopped talking to my dad. I stopped talking to my mom because she would lie about me. For example, my mom and my dad separated and my mom called me trying to get me to extort my dad for money (for her). When I refused, she threatened to call the cops on me for fraud that I did not commit, so I told her to ""go ahead"", hung up and haven't spoken to her since. She has then gone around telling family that she has no clue why I'm not speaking to her and that she did nothing wrong to deserve my desertion. The truth is my mom has been threatening me as a method to control me since I was a child. In fact, she used to threaten to 'off herself' as a means to control me and when I was 12 she actually attempted in front of me.  

My dad has recently gotten back together with my mom and has started trying to manipulate me. He ""bought"" me a vehicle for $500 but I insured it and HE drove it (he couldn't insure a vehicle because he has too many fines). He got speeding and parking tickets with said vehicle (which was under my name) and did not pay for them. The vehicle broke down, my dad brought it back to my place where it stayed, broken down in my parking spot. My landlord told me to get rid of it if it's not working. I told my dad. Nothing. His fines went to collections and went on my credit report, ruining my credit score. I'm trying to save up to buy a house and keeping a good credit score is paramount. So I call an autowrecker, who pays me $500 to take the vehicle away, just enough to cover the fines. I pay the fines off.

Fast forward a few months and my dad shows up wanting the vehicle. I told him that I sold it to pay for the fines he got. He's angry but doesn't say anything and leaves. He and my mother then go and tell my entire family that I have sold his car out from under him and took the money.

Edit: I have stopped talking to them. My family thinks I am the asshole and is pressuring me to stop ""being a bitch to the people that raised and loved you"". Honestly... I don't feel like they love me. I feel like they are using and manipulating me. But perhaps I'm being selfish and narcissistic?

Also - my dad JUST messaged me again after months of not talking me - asking me to insure ANOTHER vehicle! I don't know what to do...

My fiancé and I are not the same sex. We are man and woman, but I am strongly pro-equality. I couldn’t see someone handling the most important day of my life knowing they don’t feel the same way about marriage as I do. So I went with a more expensive option and the officiant I hired has the same beliefs as my fiancé and I.

My sister says it was rude of me to skip the cheapest option since other people are footing most of our wedding bill and that it was more important to be considerate of them. She says, I’m not gay so why does it matter?

I feel strongly about this but my sister made me wonder if I should have swallowed my pride and just taken the cheaper route for the sake of those who are helping pay.",32,79,0.91
1517,Not the A-hole,"Wouldn't necessarily call myself an asshole, but I can see how I could be considered bitchy in this situation.

A little background: 

I met my bestfriend almost 2 years ago when we were freshman suitemates. She comes from a background that has led her to being a bit stingy with money. Now, I'm not judging her for that considering I also come from a semi-similar, just not as strict, background. 

The stituation: 

During the summer, she asked me if she could use my Netflix account. I said yes, of course, and had to increase the subscription to the 2 screens at a time, just in case we were watching it at the same time. She offered to venmo me half of the subscription every month, but she never did and I never asked because it was automatic billing and I never checked my account to see when the money was coming out of it. 

A few months after her, another friend (who she doesnt know that well) asked for my subscription and so I had to increase to the 2-4 screens tier. They actually paid me at the beginning of each month, but like I said, I never checked my account (they have the same bank as me) so the money would go in and I wouldn't notice.

Fast forward to last month, I lost my wallet and obviously cancelled my card. This apparently occurred before Netflix was due and they asked her to update the billing info when she signed on one day. She offered to add her card, since I hadn't gotten my new one yet.

Netflix recently increased their pricing, so instead of $13.99, the subscription that we have is now $15.99. Today, she texted me asking if we could downgrade to the $8.99 plan. I told her not really, since there were 3 people on the plan and it wouldn't make sense for us to essentially have to police each other's Netflix times. She then tried to argue that we most likely won't be watching Netflix at the same time, because she barely watches it. I already know this to be a lie, since she practically uses it everyday.

I told her that I would just switch it back to my card instead. She still insisted on switching it, even though she hasn't paid me a cent from the previous months, so it wouldn't be like she would pay me when I switched it back. So I told her I would just get my own account and keep it simple. I honestly only said that because I knew that she wouldn't protest because that would mean her having to pay $8.99 herself, if she still wanted the service. I knew it was manipulatory, but I was honestly annoyed that she was mincing over a $2.00  difference because it just happened to be on her card for a single month, but when I was paying the $13.99/month subscription, she didn't offer or even cared that I was paying that much.

1518,No A-holes here,"I made a friend recently, and I'm a "" never having kids "" kind of person.

So i typically don't engage or make friends with parents.

She is nice and we got along so I figured "" can' tbe that bad ""

I made it very clear early on, I dont make friends with parents, she was an exception and I do not want to talk about, or see her kid all the time, and if thats a dealbreaker for her, no worries and we'd move on, I value being open about such things so thats why I said it.

She said it was fine and didn't want to make the baby a focal point anyway and that she even semi regrets having her child so young, being that she was on the fence with an abortion. 

Fast forward a few months.

nothing but random baby pics and videos if we're not actively talking. we have non-baby related chat, but it pops up so unexpectedly and randomly. I just simply don't know what to say nor do I care or have an interest.

I just reply uninterested things like "" lol "" and "" oh no "" or whatever. and dont say anything else, hoping she'd get the hint.

But I think i would upset her if i said "" stop sending me your fucking child "". it's funny, despite being clear in the opening of our friendship. i am hesitant to say anything now.

For any context, we're both women. I can't have children and don't have interest in them despite that anyway. and we're countries apart, but i truly love everything else about her, shes great.

1521,Not the A-hole,"I'm at college in the UK, so my friendship group is made up of teens between ages of 16 and 19. I'm kinda friends with a girl, we'll call her M, as we have some mutual friends. She has some form of anxiety disorder to the point where she has a panic attack every 1/2 days. From very brief discussions I know that it was caused by some trauma from a while ago. As a coping mechanism she participates in 'little culture', basically that she kinda regresses to a child like state (5 ish) and acts like a child for a period of time. She'll skip around the room, giggle like a child, move things around to make people kind of annoyed with her (she likes to describe herself as a 'bratty little') and carry around a soft toy that she refers to as her 'stuffies'. On a couple occasions she has watched TV shows for small children (teletubbies, Peppa pig, etc) on her phone at full volume whilst sucking her thumb. She talks about how she wished she had a 'daddy' (someone who 'parents' a little) who could 'punish' her. Everyone in our group is aware that she gets off to it.
The thing is, I don't care what she does at home. M is an adult, she can do what she wishes when it comes to the bedroom and in private. But the fact that she does all of it in public is embarrassing for our group as it draws attention due to the 18 year old who is hugging a teddy bear watching Peppa pig at full volume. But when I've tried to talk to someone else they call me an arsehole since she's been through traumatic experiences and this is how she copes, which makes me feel guilty for my opinions.

1522,Not the A-hole,"I (17F) have had very bad food issues since I was 8 years old. I had binge eating disorder, which transitioned to anorexia, which has now transitioned to bulimia.  I've gone on the pill recently and the fact that puking after you've had it renders it useless has kept me from purging some of my meals, which is very helpful. 

My friend  (17F), has IBS. She can't eat many foods and the result of this is a very complicated relationship with food. Since last December she has been venting to me about her eating disorder, telling me very explicit details like the fact that she doesn't eat for 3 days and gets bad headaches and faints whenever she stands up. 

I've told her countless times that this is very triggering for me as eating disorders are highly competitive and it encourages me to fast and puke to keep up with her in a twisted way. Therefore I've told her that she isn't to talk to me about her eating disorder at all because it's inhibiting me from my own recovery, and that I do not want to hear about any of her food related issues.

I'm her only friend, and she has nobody else to vent to about her issues, but they trigger my eating disorder heavily. AITA?

Edit 1 because many people are saying I'm the asshole because IBS isn't an ED : She had IBS first, and the IBS triggered her ED. She compulsively exercises even though she's very underweight and doesn't eat at all to see how long she can go without eating. Her IBS Spiralled into an ED.

1523,Not the A-hole,"Junior in high school here. Not necessarily the most popular person out there. I honestly don't look very nice and I am quite awkward. Still working on my confidence because I got bullied a lot during middle school.
That said, I am fairly well known and respected at school.

I am good at studies, and I offer to tutor a lot of people for free whenever I get the time. 
One of the girls in our class recently joined the school and she was lagging behind, so her friend asked me to help her out. I accepted the offer.
Instantly fell for her when we had our first session. She was just really receptive, witty, kind and beautiful. But I obviously didn't want to ruin our relationship, so I stayed quiet and was strictly professional.


After a couple of months more of tutoring her, she got decent grades and I was happy for her. After I stopped teaching her, I asked her out on a date, and she was genuinely pissed. 


Told me I ruined our relationship and that she didn't expect me to be like that. She said we weren't compatible because she liked tough guys or people in the swim team, I wasn't her level at all. She told me to never talk to her again, and said that she had just started gaining popularity and any interaction with me would be detrimental to her popularity.(It was at this point I realized why she told me to teach her 15 minutes away from the school in a small park. The open air excuse was probably bullshit)


She hung out with the popular bunch anyway so I didn't really care a lot. I had gotten over her at this point.
So when she came and asked me to help her with her chem finals, I outright refused to, even after she pleaded since she didn't want to see me just a month ago anyway.

1524,Asshole,"I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem

She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. 

The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?

1526,No A-holes here,"Edit: New post with the correct amount of characters. 

I'm an aspiring writer, I've finished several short stories, one of which is being adapted for audio drama, and one novel manuscript which I've been sending to literary agencies for nearly a year now. I've mostly had rejections but I've recently had some luck with manuscript requests. The publishing industry is fucking difficult to break into, I'm under no illusion that I'll be published or even get an agent. It's a game of patience. I wouldn't dream of telling other people to not write because everyone should be allowed to explore and express their creativity, no matter what your language abilities are.

Basically, I have a friend who wants to be a professional writer. We've been friends since we were teenagers (we are in our late 20s) s but she's always been a bit manic. She gets these flights of fancies and grand ideas that she usually doesn't follow through. We're both Swedish, but I've spent most of my life living abroad in English speaking countries, did half my Education and my university degree in English, I've been working and living the UK for eight years. I've spoken English since I was four years old and am a native speaker. She isn't. Her spoken and written English is very basic.

She's been writing a book in English for a while and every now and again she sends it to me to read which I'm grateful for. The story itself is an okay premise but the plot doesn't always make sense and the quality of the language is really poor. I've been helping her edit, pointing out how to structure it a bit and with some grammar. She's never been good at taking feedback or constructive criticism and at school, she was difficult to work with. She sent the novel to one of her friends who read it and called her ""the next JK Rowling"". After this, she has been convinced that she's going to make it in publishing and has been wanting to send the unfinished manuscript to literary agencies in both Sweden and the UK/US. She had convinced herself that they were going to take the unfinished script and she would have a bestseller on her hand.

I tried telling her patiently that it takes time getting into publishing, that most authors don't get a bestseller with their first debut novel and she wouldn't listen. I then told her it's a bad idea to send out an unfinished novel, that hasn't been edited and that's written in a language that visibly isn't your mother-tongue and that it in all likelihood will not be picked up or even read by agencies. She didn't like this at all, told me I was being unsupportive and basically a bad friend.

It was December, and I had caught a pretty bad cough combined with mild pneumonia. Stayed at home for a good while, and ended up missing a lot of the performances she does around Christmas. Eventually, as I got better, she started to approach the subject of coming to a specific play of hers they had been preparing for a while. I was against it initially, since my cough had adamantly refused to go away, and my throat still hurt. Eventually I caved to the puppy-eyes routine. And on the day in question, dressed up like a conservative Eskimo and had a friend drive me to the station. Weather outside was awful, and as luck would have it the train stopped halfway due to ""technical difficulties"". I was going to be late. I called my gf to inform her of this, and she was livid. I had missed performances before, a lot of the time due to work or other shenanigans, and she would often accuse me of making up excuses to avoid having to go.

I was very firmly in the ""I'm doing this for you even though I'm sick, so stop giving me shit.""-Camp. She's having none of it. Eventually it turns into an argument and she hangs up in a huff. When I actually got there (Think it was about halfway into the play) the guy at the front is not letting me in. Invitation had been revoked.

&#x200B;

When the play finally ended, and I got a hold of her, we were now both mad. I was feeling much worse again and really wanted to go home and she was still upset that I had missed all of the play. Eventually, she makes a big thing of leaving with an actor friend of hers, and leaves me standing there. And I don't have money for a ticket back. Cue an hour of texting, ducking into stores to not stand outside, and eventually getting hold of a friend, who despite the apocalyptic weather, came and picked me up.

Me (26, f) and my fiancé (27, m) are getting married soon. We are having a relatively small bridal party of 5 bridesmaids/groomsmen each. For my bridesmaids, I chose two of my best friends, my two sisters, and fiancé’s sister, Sarah* (21, f). I only asked Sarah basically just to be nice, but also I felt it was expected, and when I asked her, my future MIL said “oh thank god, there would have been trouble if you didn’t!”. It was a joke but still felt weird. Over the 4 years of my relationship, me and Sarah have always been okay but very different - she’s very entitled, I am very gritty-working class; she can be very blunt and rude about things, I generally try to keep negative opinions to myself around his family. Recently, her mother and I argued (all better now, but basically MIL kept making jokes at my expense when they had company over and I was feeling a little bullied so confronted her about it) and Sarah has taken this very much to heart and has started being VERY rude. As in literally ignoring me when I directly talking to her and slamming doors in my face, I created a bridesmaids group chat (including one of the “groomsmen” who is a girl) and Sarah has never once replied to anything or posted in the chat.

1537,Not the A-hole,"I apologize in advance if formatting is funky because I’m on mobile. So the first week of February my fiancé got arrested for DUI on prescription meds that weren’t his, driving without insurance, and driving with expired registration. I got him out on bond the next day, and had a serious conversation with him about walking a straight line. Apparently he’d been getting high on pills the whole while we’ve been together (I guess I’m an idiot for not seeing it). I told him that he needed to man up and be responsible. There’s no reason why a 37 year old man with a good job wouldn’t have insurance or registration on his car. I told him I didn’t want to marry a man who is completely irresponsible, and that he needed to stop taking pills, especially if he’s on the road putting himself and other people in danger, and he needed to stay on top of keeping insurance and registration. 

He (supposedly) got some type of temporary drivers license that would be good up until his court date, and I let him use my car to go get insurance and registration on his car so he’d be able to get back and forth to work. 

I got a call at work tonight from his best friend. He told me that my fiancé told him not to tell me, but he’d been arrested earlier and was in the county jail. He called me because he felt bad keeping it from me, as he’s one of my friends too, and because he couldn’t afford to get my fiancé out on his own. I called the jail and found out that they got him for:
-Suspended Registration
-Use of License Plate with intent to Conceal
-No Insurance
-Driving while license suspended or revoked

He’s been lying to me this whole time about getting all of his ducks in a row and being good to drive his car. I’m hurt because I thought he wouldn’t lie to me again. At least he wasn’t fucked up on pills this time, but, god, how stupid can you be? He really is my best friend, but part of me feels like I just need to let him go because I’d be setting myself up for a lifetime of being his “mom.” I don’t want to leave him, but then again I feel like Id be a fool for letting him lie to me and rushing to bail him out again.

1539,Not the A-hole,"A little backstory, I go to college and me and my roommate share a room. Not very big, just enough to fit 2 beds, 2 dressers, 2 desks, and 2 closets.
This morning I got a text from him saying he wants to get the room so he and his girlfriend want the room to themselves from 8:30-10, promising to not go any longer than that. This happens often so although I’m not a fan of this happening, as sometimes he asks for the room until midnight, even on school nights, I agree. Keep in mind I have classes about an hour and a half before he does, so I can’t be awake all night like he does. 
Anyways, tonight I was in my friends room next door, killing time until I can go back, which again, would be 10pm at the latest. As soon as it turns to 10, I text him to make sure I can come back, as I normally do. No response. I give it 10 minutes for him to respond, but still nothing. At this point, I’m getting frustrated because I have work to do, which I can’t because my laptop and notes are all in my backpack, which is in my room. Finally after 15 minutes from the initial text I decide to walk in anyways, because sometimes he doesn’t answer his phone and isn’t in the room anymore. 
I open the door and am immediately greeted with him frantically telling me to close the door and to get out. I never looked up, so I didn’t see anything. Another thing about my roommate is he has never had sex before, so I assumed nothing would be going on. Anyways, I keep my head down, grab my bag while he is basically yelling at me to leave the room, and leave. I was only inside for 10 seconds at the most, not even seeing anything. 
After about an hour, I get a text from him saying he is finally out of the room, even though it is close to 11pm, and that what I did “wasn’t cool” because I should have knocked and respected his privacy. Although I understand where he is coming from, I still had work to do and couldn’t be up all night waiting for him to leave OUR room.

I did not know how old this guy was until recently when she sent me screenshots of her messages with him on Instagram and he blatantly asked her out because he “liked her for awhile” and “thinks she’s pretty.” She said she only ever thought of him as a friend but could see a possibility of being with him if he were closer to her age. He said that maybe she’d be lucky enough to get a kiss from him. I found it quite disturbing and since the age gap was mentioned in the messages, I asked her exactly how much older he was compared to her. 

Looking out for her, I told her that it seems a little immature of him to hit on someone five years younger than him and that it sparks a red flag, especially since they’re both at completely different stages in life. She told me to not ruin this high for her and that he’s “pretty” and that I should stay out of her business. 

I don’t want anything bad to happen to her cause I care for her as a friend and I’d feel awful if I didn’t take this seriously.

1542,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: My boss scheduled a mandatory meeting for all employees, that was an hour long. I tried explaining to her; that's bullshit.

&#x200B;

So I'm a manager at my office and my boss, Operations manager for the entire business, sent out an e-mail earlier in the week that all employee's (aprox 15) MUST attend a hands-on training class, instructed by her, in the afternoon Thursday. If we are not able to attend we MUST re-schedule with her ASAP.

&#x200B;

OK... It's my day off, but I'm punching in and getting paid for it, so oh well.

&#x200B;

The meeting was an hour an 20 min long.

&#x200B;

The 11 that showed up, because the other 4 were actively on duty, were pretty annoyed, some absolutely pissed and texting me the moment they left the building. After everyone left, my boss asked how the meeting went. I told her that the information was quality and this meeting was necessary given we've hired some new people and it's good to keep everyone on the same page. However, I live 45 min away. Some employees further. Scheduling a mandatory meeting on a day that works best for you, without asking about any ones availability, and knowing said meeting will take about an hour is offensive and inconsiderate of your employees lives outside this building.

&#x200B;

She was taken aback. Went immediately on the offensive with, ""You think this was a waist of time!?"", ""This matter NEEDED to be addressed."", ""What does it matter how long the meeting is, you're still getting paid!"", ""So all that matters is your paychecks, huh?""

&#x200B;

I did my best to keep calm and explain to her that if you are going to make your employees drive from home, or another office, or from school, or stop WHATEVER they were doing, that was not this job, to be here: It must be worth their time. Just being 'punched-in' is not enough. There's a balance to knowing that an employees time, outside of work, does not go by their hourly wage. By saying, ""It doesn't matter if the meeting was 10 min or 10 hours,"" shows that you do not value your employees time or their personal lives. And that is a very big problem.

&#x200B;

We argued a bit before I told her that I had to go. But am I the asshole for telling her all this? I'm asking because now the CC'd emails haven't stopped...

&#x200B;

EDIT: So as far I could look into it, Michigan does not require employers to pay a minimum hours worked if employee is dismissed early. So, in the case of California - where you get paid a minimum of 4 hours no matter how long the meeting is. Is not the case in Michigan. ",131,353,0.95

I know that it sounds terrible, and I'm not entirely sure I believe it myself, but it seems like he ruins everything our family tries to do. I'm 17, and the oldest of 3. My little brothers are 13 and 10. The 10 year old brother is autistic, more specifically he has Asperger's(high verbal, lacks any sense of empathy, sympathy, or caring about any human beings besides his 95 year old great grandmother). He seems to ruin everything we try and do as a family, threatens with violence (held a knife to his own throat because he was grounded from playing video games), and treats my parents like slaves.

I can't stand hearing him berate my mom with demands and horrible comments, but when I call him out on it, she gets on to me. I am in debate and theatre, and my parents have to miss my performances, award ceremonies, and even being recognized in front of hundreds of people for helping a Cub Scout Troop cross over into my Boy Scout troop with more achievements than this troop had ever seen before because they cannot leave him at home. He has tried to run away into the woods at church and wouldn't come back to the car until 30 minutes later when my dad carried him back while he was getting hit, kicked, and clawed by the demon.

My parents do everything in their power to try and help, and believe me, they are astonishing parents, but he spits everything back in their faces. Even on Christmas Day he yelled at me because I made a joke about a cat dying in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. I forgot to mention, the only thing he cares about besides electronics and his great grandmother is animals. They tried taking him to equine therapy, but he refused to go. Even behavioral therapists gave up on him.

I can't go in the living room, it's a warzone. Unless he retreats to our office where he plays Roblox for 5 hours straight despite being told to take a shower for 3 of those 5 hours until he is dragged out and the computer is unplugged, resulting in his daily meltdown. I stay in my room almost the entire time I'm at home, and I am afraid of having friends over at my house because he throws his fits so violently, and I have to deflect until it can result in me getting out of my house.

The cherry on top of this wonderful post is that over the past year or so I've developed severe depression, and I'll come in and out of depressive states depending on how stressed I am, and the only person that seems to notice is my girlfriend. I would talk to my parents about it, but they shovel so much money into the medications he needs to function at all I don't want to add any more strain to their lives. I just wish I had an actual family again, because this is far from a family. I'm a junior in high school, and I want to go to college as far away as possible, but I don't want to leave my 13 year old brother in the dust.

1546,Not the A-hole,"So im in an area where there's a lot of rednecks, latinos and blacks. The latinos and the blacks here don't really like each other and there's gang violence and usually the rednecks aren't too fond of them either but they mostly keep to them selves. Unfortunately this spills out into school and everyone hangs out with people of the same race. I'm actually white (Portuguese, Italian, French) but a lot of people think I'm latino cuz of my dark skin and i like to speak spanish. Anyways one day this group of black girls who i've never really liked walk up to me and say ""What the fuck are you doing here you bitch ass beaner? The taco shop is down the street"" and they all laugh and walk away. This girl got an athletic scholarship to a good university (she's very good at volleyball and she's got alright grades too) and she came from a poorer household. She was going to be the first person in her family to ever go to university. I remember she posted some drama online on a  instagram account my friend is following and doesn't have her name explicitly in it so she screenshots all of that and find a post 3 years ago on Facebook saying some racist stuff about latinos and white people. I screenshot that and send it to Penn state and my school's admin. She got suspended from our school and lost her shit and posted it all on social media. Her university at first was skeptical about my claims and evidence i sent them and apparently weren't even going to do anything until her reaction which then proved to the university that she did in fact say those racist things. Not only did she lose her scholarship to the university with the scholarship but she got rejected by all the other top colleges and is now going to community college.

1547,Not the A-hole,"Background info: I'll be referring to the friend as James (fake name), though in all honesty, he isn't really a friend. He's in my social circle but he's a lot closer to my other friends than me. James is a pretty cocky and arrogant guy. For this reason, he talks about sex a lot even when it's not relevant. Could be because he's taking a high dose of testosterone. He also puffs up around our other male friends with bro talk and shit. I suspect this is because he wants to be seen as ""one of the guys"". It's lowkey annoying because I'm a girl and he objectifies women a lot while trying to appear masculine.

The other day, I was talking about one of my depressive episodes and he interjected.

James: ""Yeah I get where you're coming from, whenever I think about not having a cis dick I feel like killing myself.""

Me: ""Yeah that sucks...""

James: ""I literally can't wait to get a phalloplasty so I can piss with all the other guys. Oh and the fun stuff obviously. I'm gonna make mine 8 inches.""

He continued in this vein and just completely derailed what I was talking about in the first place. It really pissed me off.

Later on James started talking about his girlfriend. At first it was normal relationship talk but then it degraded to how he likes her to ""choke on his dick"" and how he wished he could feel it (he wears a dildo basically) and how there's a possibility that he'll be able to cum in his gf's mouth after his phalloplasty (I don't know how, I wasn't paying attention really) and I just snapped. I told him to please stop talking about his dick for two fucking seconds. Anyway things got really cold between us after that and another friend told me I was being a transphobic asshole because James has bad gender dysphoria and talking about his future dick alleviates it. 

I do feel bad for James for constantly having to deal with a body he hates. I'm bisexual so I know what it's like for people who have no idea what you're going through to tell you to stop talking about your personal struggles.

1549,Not the A-hole,"I run a weekly group for people with, or have experienced, anxiety.

Two months ago a guy joined.  He seemed friendly enough but suspected he had a learning disability.

One of my regulars told me that he had been messaging her and that it was strange.  I saw the texts he sent her; kinda weird, not dirty or explicit, more like a very socially awkward attempt at flirting.  She didn’t seem very upset about it but was slightly uncomfortable.

Then I remembered he would always ask about where female members were if they didn’t attend but never the men. 

During next meeting I clearly reiterate the rules like keep it platonic, not dating group etc and thought he would get the message.  

So,  a new woman joined the group and was also present for this.   I don’t know much about her but I did hear her ask the guy to meet up some time near the end of the meeting.  

A couple of days later I get many messages from her saying the guy has been texting her a lot saying how attracted he is to her.  Also, when they did meet up she went into some shop, told him to wait outside, he walked off.  She seems pretty angry at him but that’s all I know and haven’t seen any messages he sent to her.

By now I had to make a decision, 2 women were complaining about his messages and feeling uncomfortable despite me reiterating the rules. I decided to ban him and message him why.

Next thing I know his family are texting me saying how horrible I am and should accept his behaviour as he is a good person and had Asperger’s.  Tell them I get it but I have others to consider others and he is aggravating their own issues.  Also, it’s a group for anxiety not specific learning difficulties.

His family kept trying to join the group so set up a secret new location and told members privately.  

Secret meeting goes ahead but somehow the guy shows up.  Don’t know how this happened but my guess is the second woman, who didn’t show up, told him.

  
 I ask him to leave, he is really apologetic and says he walked off from the meeting with the second woman because she was being weird with him.  

I feel bad but he knew the rules and broke them.  Unsure if it’s all his fault or not but I decided it’s best not to take the chance.  AITA?

1550,Not the A-hole,"Need some brutal honesty about what I consider to be a morally grey area. 

My boyfriend is really good friends with John (26m), and has been for years. They've been roommates for a long time, during which time John started dating Jane (25f). They became pretty serious and Jane moved in with them about two years ago. I also moved in about a year later and have lived there since. Long story short, the four of us all live in the same house and usually get along. 

I became friends with both John and Jane, but wouldn't consider us close. Jane likes to party a lot, loves attention, and always has her friends over -- this is her first time living away from her parents and it shows. John, on the other hand, is super mellow and easy-going. He’d rather spend all his free time smoking, playing Runescape and mostly keeping to himself, but he’s become pretty tight-knit with Jane’s group of friends lately. 

It’s a relationship, so obviously there’s more nuance than that and they work surprisingly well together. I honestly thought everything was fine up until last weekend. Jane and I end up in the bathroom together, drunkenly chatting about exes for some reason when she started randomly crying about how she cheated. I assumed she was referring to something that happened in the past – she apparently hooked up with an ex while she was seeing John. This was a couple years ago, and I was under the assumption that John had already forgiven her for it and that they moved on, but she started crying that “it’s not just in my past, but it’s my present, too”. I didn’t get any details because I didn’t want any, but she was so upset and begged me not to tell anyone, especially John, because she hadn’t figured things out yet.

I wish she didn’t tell me, and I don’t even know why she did. I ended up deciding to tell my bf because he and John are such good friends, but of course now that just puts my bf in the same shitty situation that I’m in. My bf wants to tell John, but we also know that John is so anti-confrontational, that a) he might not even believe us and b) even if he did, there’s a pretty massive chance that he would forgive Jane again. In either case, we look like the complete assholes and I guarantee that the living situation would crumble into something miserable for all of us. 

So, reddit: do we keep the peace and hope that the cheating makes itself known organically, or do we risk making the living situation hell by trying to be a good friend to John? I’m torn between minding my own damn business and letting them do them, or informing John before they get even more serious. 

For clarity, my boyfriend and I are both 27 and are saving up to move out, but that looks like it’s going to be a ways away.

1551,Not the A-hole,"Title is as TL;DR as possible. I apologize for the length, but there's a lot of history here.

&#x200B;

When I was 19, I got gastric bypass surgery. I didn't think it important to tell them immediately, but after a few months, I commented to my grandmother that I was proud of the weight I was losing due to the surgery. This angered my grandparents, and they were mad they weren't allowed to visit me when I was in the hospital. I apologized and told them I'd let them know next time I'm in the hospital. A year later, my mother finds out from my grandmother that my grandfather was in the hospital recovering from surgery. My mother asked why she wasn't informed, and my grandmother responds ""because you didn't tell me about gone-writing's surgery"". My mother, sister, and I made plans to go visit my grandfather, but things got complicated. 

&#x200B;

This sets my grandmother off. She calls my mother and berates her on the phone. I'm sitting nearby and I hear my grandmother tell my mother that she wanted all three of us to go to her apartment so she could tell us what terrible people we were, and that she wanted nothing to do with us. My mother, used to my grandmothers theatrics, hung up on her, and my grandmother called me. She told me to block her number and block her on Facebook and not contact her. I tell her ""okay, cool"" and hang up.

&#x200B;

For a year, everything was pretty quiet until I receive an email from my grandfather about how I was being terrible for not calling my grandmother. I tell my grandfather everything that happened and he essentially just says ""when people get old, they start to act childish. It's your responsibility to be the mature one."" That didn't sit right with me. I'm 21 years old. I have to be more mature than a 91 year old? Who lived through a World War? I explained that to my grandfather and he suddenly shoots back with dirt on my father. Specifically, he tells me that my mother couldn't be trusted because she was a known liar and my father cheated on her when I was 2 years old.

&#x200B;

Thing is, I know this story. My parents never hid their past from me, and I'm glad they didn't. Had this bomb been dropped on me now, at 21, how would I look at my father? How would it have hurt me? It angered me that he told me that, because if felt as though he was trying to turn me against my own parents. I deleted the email without responding, and my grandmother has been calling me nonstop ever since. I don't want to talk to them anymore because I feel like they've completely burned their bridges with me.

This happened a couple of months ago and I still haven’t made my peace with myself so I’m putting it out there to the general consensus...

My husband and I went to see a ballet we had wanted to see on the spur of the moment. we purchased the tickets quite late and so were seated at the back of the theatre. I’m 5’6” and I’ve never had an issue with seeing the stage in this particular theatre and he is taller so we didn't give it a second thought. this time around the few seats in front of us are (uncharacteristically!) empty too so GREAT!

We go to intermission and return to see the seats are filled. Apparently, the attendants had arrived late and had to wait for the intermission to be allowed in.

This is where things get a bit difficult to see. The woman sitting in the seat right in front of me has a really large Afro bun on the top of her head. So I basically don’t see anything at the center of the stage. I can see a bit on each side and if I lean on my husband I can see part of the center. husband suggests switching seats but the person sitting in front of him is also tall so I figure in that case we would BOTH miss the show as he is also not tall enough to see much from behind the hair either.

The second act of this particular show is full of solo performances which happen at centre stage so I am constantly leaning to see what’s happening. After about 15 minutes my neck started to hurt. I contemplated my options and finally leaned in, and in a hush tone said ""hiiiii"" (I was quite self-conscious about what I was about to say, hence the ultra friendly 'hiiiiiii'). I asked if it would be at all possible for her to lower her bun as I was completely blinded behind her. She just turned halfway around, looked at me as if I committed a sin and said “absolutely NOT”, looked at her friend and in a bit of a louder voice said “racist bitch”.

I was mortified! I asked my husband if we could leave and we leave with about 20 minutes left to the performance.

it’s been two months since but I still can’t resolve the issue with my own conscience. What would I have done differently if this was a blond woman with a large updo? I am now ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that I would have. and even then I DID look around; NOT ONE person around me had anything resembling the towering hair of my front-seat mate!

I have asked people to remove their hats in the theatre that obscured a view. But what about a tall person? I’m not quite sure if those two things are the same. To me the Afro bun was a choice the same as a hat or an updo. You can make a different one in consideration of others. Height is not.

So AITA here? Am I really the ‘racist bitch’?

&#x200B;

EDIT: this might be helpful to some: she had two friends with VERY SIMILAR hairs. Her friends had theirs in a bun too. the bun was at the BACK OF their heads not on top. She clearly had chosen a style.

EDIT 2: People are up in arms about the use of the term ""Afro Bun"" in the title. I used it consciously because not using it made the title dishonest and unjustifiably biased towards me. it would also have made it more of a banal issue which it is not. at least not for me. ",195,121,0.89

We ended up going on more dates and we decided to enter a relationship after a while. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we were cuddling watching a movie and both a bit tipsy. The topic of our first date came up. I made a joke about how I had blue balls for a while after. Then she mentioned that honestly she wanted to sleep with me but was trying to keep with her policy of not sleeping with someone on their first date. This is where I should mention that she had a male roommate at the time- who I had briefly met a couple times. I had my own place, and again made sort of a joking comment about how the joke was on her since at least I had the privacy to rub one out after. There was an awkward pause, and eventually she said that she had ended up sleeping with her roommate. So I guess the joke was on me really lol.

I was pretty upset and we ended up getting into an argument. She kept saying that we weren't even a thing yet and that it had nothing to do with me.

1564,Not the A-hole,"I'm 38 weeks and 4 days (full term) on baby #4. There's just barely 11 months between our last two kids and I'm freaking tired and sore.

My pregnancy has been rough the last 2 months. The baby was breech up to 37 weeks and when he finally flipped the unexpected pressure caused me to end up with several hemorrhoids that I had to have removed and left me nearly incapable of walking. He went breech again and this morning I was in the hospital to have him flipped again. They told me I was full term and good to go into labor at any time but being that I had three more days to 39 weeks they couldn't induce me because of insurance purposes. Given the baby has gone breech twice, which would mean I needed a c-section, I was not eager to have to wait it out and risk him flipping again. 

We came home after the successful flip, I went and layed down for a nap and woke up to contractions. Given I was having some decent contractions I wanted to go for a walk to hope to speed things up. Like I mentioned I'm very tired being pregnant. I also historically have had very long labors with my shortest one being 8 hours from the time of checking into hospital to birth and my longest being 74 hours from check-in to birth, my third being 36+. 

My husband got upset at me because I was trying to walk and speed things up and he wanted to go to his kids swimming class. I got upset because I didn't appreciate his kids swim class being more important than me possibly going into labor. I never asked him to stay home with me, although I do believe he should have and in the end I adamantly told him to go to the swim class because I was so angry he was trying to get me to go sit down and slow things down. AITA for walking to speed things up and not wanting to be pregnant anymore?",27,52,0.88
1565,Not the A-hole,"My son is on Reddit daily and will recognize my post immediately, so a throwaway would be pointless.  Will still try to keep identifying details out to maintain his privacy from his friends.

My son graduated HS in 2012.  He spent that first year working full time in a warehouse with a particularly demanding boss.  He learned a lot about the workforce and developed an amazing work ethic.  But he quickly realized that he wanted to obtain his college degree so he started community college part time.  About a year later he got an apartment with his then girlfriend.  He still was going to college and working.  After a year he wanted to come home so that he could go to school full time, work part time and finish school quicker.  This is where things go downhill. 
 
We were happy to have him come home and concentrate on school.  We told him that we'd pay his car insurance and phone but he would be responsible for his car payment.  We also stressed that he would have to help out around the house in lieu of rent/utilities.  He would be responsible for cleaning his bathroom every other week, helping with dishes, trash, and vacuum once a week.  Suffice to say, he barely did anything.  It caused a lot of tension in my marriage.  We had many sit down convos with him, it would get better for a week, then right back how it was.  

Fastforward to last summer...he's been dating a really great girl who we like and they made plans to go to a university out of state starting Jan 2019.  Her home situation was very stressful, she already put in 2 years at community college and 1 semester at a very hard local university, and she has a great work ethic also.  So we decide to offer for her to stay with us until they go.  Within 2 weeks of her moving in the plan changed from leaving in Jan to leaving in August!  Not what we signed up for.  We have a sit down convo and they want to save up more money before they go, she's going to work 2 jobs, they need more time to find and apt, etc.  So we all compromise and decide June 1st will be the move out date. 
 
Fastforward to Dec and I'm about to lose my mind.  Our son barely does anything at all.  He might clean the bathroom every 6wks, he might put dishes away every 2wks, virtually nothing.  She has cleaned the bathroom twice since Sept.  That's it.  
I was over it.  The day after Xmas, I sat him down and told him he had to pay me $100/mo cleaning fee and they had to be out by Apr 1st.  I told him I was starting to resent him for not helping, that I've taught him everything I can as a parent, that I'll always love him, but it's better for our relationship if he goes sooner rather than later.  He was livid.  He's barely spoken to me since.  

I feel like I made the right decision as a parent because it really felt like enabling at this point.  But I also feel horrible because maybe I'm being too hard and expecting too much?  I just know that I love him and my heart is breaking.

Tl,Dr: kicking my son out for acting entitled

Edit: Our son has been out of school since last May. It was at that time that he bumped up his hours at work to full time. Also, when I gave him the Apr 1st move out date, I specifically told him that if anything came up financially that we would help him...as long as it wasn't a repeating occurrence. IE, we would pay his insurance, but no cash would be given.

Thank you for all of the responses. The reason for my post was to get an honest assessment of the situation from a group of his peers. It's going to be an emotional couple of days and y'all have helped me sort out my feelings in a good way. ❤️

Edit 2: For those wondering about his mental health, I can't say for sure obviously, but I don't believe his dirtiness is because of depression/anxiety. He's always been messy. Before his GF moved in I could tell him to clean it up when it got to a certain point. (His door has always had to stay shut so guests couldn't see.) But now that she's living in there too, I'm over it. 

And of course he was raised with chores and held accountable. But he's also one of those people who doesn't care about the consequence. But I'm strong willed too. There were times that all he had in his room was a bed and his clothes, not even a door. I believe everything besides food, clothing, and shelter are privileges.  Privileges that can be lost. But nothing I ever did changed his behavior. He is who he is. He's charming, sarcastic, incredibly smart, compassionate and he's also a world class procrastinator, stubborn, he lies to us and he's lazy in his personal life. 

Hope this helps clear up some questions. I'm amazed at how many of you went through similar situations, but you all seem to have done so well. Thank you for sharing. It means more than you'll ever know.",679,6204,0.95
1566,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and his brother are 4 years apart and growing up his brother has always been  a role model to him. My boyfriend loves him dearly and is like his right hand man. 

But personally I never liked him. Can you guess why? He's really open about being a white supremacist and goes on ""left wings suck"",""every other race is lazy"" rants on facebook a few times every month. The one time I met him though he was actually chill, and didn't really seem to take my race into account. I'm black by the way.

My boyfriend himself almost never brings up my race and honestly has this kind of intolerance to talk about it. Everytime I'd say some playful stereotype like ""Black people do this ____"" he just turns into a brick and you can just tell he doesn't want to talk about it. 

It seems I'm the only one who's slightly conscious about race because before we got together - his fantasies surrounded white women and just out of paranoia/insecurities I would question if he's satisfied with dating me - to which he would reassure me.

His brother was arrested 5 days ago for attempted kidnapping, assault, and hate crime. From what we know - he was in the parking lot of a club where he got into an argument with a black man because he was smoking in front of his car (he's really defensive about his health because his immune system is shit). When the guy was walking away he continued yelling racial slurs at him, and swung on him from behind. He beat him and attempted to push him inside the trunk of his SUV before a security guard intervened. 

The first few nights my boyfriend was an indenial brick who refused to talk about it so I respected it and we carried on as normal. Just last night he came over and we were watching Happy Feet. The whole time I could see on his face that he was in deep deep thought, and just looked like he desperately wanted to say something. I asked if he was okay and it took him a minute before he said ""Yeah...I don't think Connor was wrong"" and that basically killed every mood. As our conversation progressed he revealed  that he's gonna side with his brother no matter what and this wasn't an exception. 

I'm asking if I'm the asshole because I feel like we've been together for 6 mos and race has never been an issue. He's not the bad guy, and it's really out of what transpired his brother did - and his choice to stand by him. I only want to end things with him because of this. Everything else is great.

Edit: Thank you all greatly for your feedback/opinions. It made me feel way better about dumping him because from what I've read it's extremly justifiable and saw several referances to ""Get Out"" (which was funny because we've watched that movie together and he thought it was stupid). What made it even worse was that 95% of the comments argeed that it's fine to leave him and it made me realize how kind of naive I was being. For me this was just whatever it's the way things were, it didn't seem like a big deal but you guys pointed of a lot of flags in Alex that I guess I was too naive to sit down and think about. A 3rd party's opinion from the outside is really what I needed. I'm gonna break up with Alex over text tonight. Thank you all..",91,35,0.8
1567,Not the A-hole,"To start this off I’m 19. My grandfather owns a full service gas station where we do tires and mechanic work. When I graduate my grandfather offered me the job of managing the place and I said yes. I’m good with working with my hands and enjoy working on cars but my grandfather wanted me to run the office and do all of the paperwork. When it got super busy I would go out and help with changing tires and oil. One of the workers just quit a few months before I got hired, so there was just one man (he is in his late 40s) beside me. This guy has worked here for 7 years and did all of the mechanic work while my grandfather did the office. The employee brags all the time about how he pretty much ran this place when the other worker quit. While I’m taking care of sending out bills and doing other paperwork the guy comes in and start cussing at me telling me to “get off my ass and do some real work for once”. This happens pretty much every day. After 3 months of it I got pissed off. 3 days ago he came in and said “I’ve got 2 cars out here that need tires on them, why don’t you get off your lazy ass and do some manly work.” I responded with “You always talk about how you ran this place by yourself so why can’t you do it now, I’m sending out the bills for this month.” He replied “Fuck the bills, come out here and change some tires.” This is where I got pissed off “First of all” I said “ you are not my boss, I’m the one running this place and I sign your paychecks so if anyone is going to tell someone what to do, it’s going to be me telling you.” “I’m not taking orders from a damn kid” he said. “ Look, I know it’s hard to take orders from someone that’s young and that is new here but you know what’s harder?”there was a pause and he said “What’s that?” “Feeding your family and paying the bills without a fucking  paycheck.” He just looked at me then when back outside and hasn’t said anything to be since. 

So AITA for getting mad at an employee for them disrespecting their boss?",148,469,0.97
1568,No A-holes here,"Some backstory to start with... we became really good friends my freshman year of college. We were inseparable and spent a lot of time together. Nick had been with his gf Krista for years at that point, high school sweethearts. I became great friends with both of them, and his gf’s friends. It was a really good first year of college. The next year of school we lived together in an apt. I winded up not getting a bid to his fraternity that year. It was a really big deal for many reasons, but its a long story. To sum things up, it really affected me personally and it changed our relationship. We started hanging out less, and I hated living in our apt which was basically an annex house for the fraternity... living there even though I wasn’t in it.

That year he graduated. We still kept in touch, and 2 years have passed since then. We talk intermittently, but to be quite honest with you I have put more effort in than he has. One weekend he said he was coming to visit, but then the alumni event for his fraternity got cancelled so he didn’t come. I asked him why he couldnt have came just to see me, no response. I texted him happy birthday a few months ago, no response. He didnt text me on my birthday either. I’ve asked him to come up multiple times since. No response. It sucks.

Still, I consider him to be one of my best friends even though we don’t see each other that much. Krista told me while we were in school that he’s never been as close with a friend like me... I was one of his few best friends he’s ever had. The wedding is this summer and I recently got an invitation. I went to the wedding website, and he has 10 groomsmen. None of them are me. He could have at the very least given me a heads up and let me know why that was the situation, but he didn’t. Most of the bridesmaids I was pretty good friends with. His groomsmen... for the most part... are all people I know for a fact he wasn’t that close with. His best man is his cousin and I know they weren’t SUPER close.

I think if I had gotten a bid to the fraternity the relationship would be different. It’s really sad. Its hard to put in perspective why it was a big deal on reddit, but it really was. I don’t think I can show up to the wedding by myself and not be involved. I would be extremely awkward, uncomfortable, and left out. Is it selfish of me to not attend? I just cant ignore how hurt and disappointed I am. 

If I did tell him how I felt, I wouldn’t lash out with anger. I’d just tell him I love you, I wish you and your wife the best, however this is how I feel and I’m not coming

TLDR; Best friend from college has failed to upkeep the friendship with me, but I have tried hard. He invites me to the wedding but doesn’t make me a groomsman even though it seems like it would be a given. Butthurt and disappointed, is it selfish of me to not go entirely?",55,46,0.9

1570,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

1571,Not the A-hole,"My friend’s wedding is coming up in July, and I’m a bridesmaid. The bride has decided along with matching dresses, shoes, bags, jewellery, flower crowns, and make up we all need to have the same hairstyle. 

Problem is, I’m the only member of the bridal party with short, naturally straight hair - they all have naturally curly or black hair. She’s strongly suggesting I grow my hair, whereas I said I’m happy to wear clip in hair to achieve the look she wants. My straight hair is the kind that never curls, I spent much of my adolescence in the 90’s desperately trying to curl, wave, or crimp my hair. But no matter how much product or heat I used, the style would fall out in a few minutes. So I’ve learnt to love my very straight hair for what it is, and enjoy that I can have a short haircut. 

I feel like I’m the Debbie downer of the bridal group, as with my skin allergies I can’t wear the costume jewellery she originally picked (I suggested I wear small gold studs or no earrings, but that doesn’t fit in with her ‘vision’), and I’m worried I’ll have an allergic reaction to the brands the makeup artist uses. I’ve offered to talk to the makeup artist to discuss my allergies, but I’m made to feel like I’m being super awkward and unhelpful. 

My friend was rational person before she got engaged, but the level of control over every aspect of this wedding is making my anxiety and body shame issues overwhelm me. Which it shouldn’t, because this day is supposed to be all about her and her partner and the next stage of their life together. 

We’ve been through a lot of shit together, and helped each other through some very stressful and awful times. But I don’t recognise this budding bridezilla and the bridal party of doom. Am I an asshole for not wanting to grow my hair?

I love this woman and intend to marry her, and was very afraid of losing her so I wanted to show her my appreciation. I then went out and got her a new car. She moved away from her home to come live with me and she’s hasn’t had a vehicle here. It just seemed like a suitable thing.

When I surprised her with it she called me an asshole and said that I had to get over my spoiled upbringing and learn to deal with things like an adult. That I couldn’t “buy her love” with an expensive car. She ended up taking it back to the dealership and I got the refund on my bank account.

1573,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I were married in January. We eloped with only the two of us, our officiant, and our photographer in attendance.   


Before I hired the photographer, I had a meeting with her and told her that there were certain parts of my body I was very insecure about, and being plus sized, I needed a photographer who could accommodate that. She quickly told me that since she is also plus-sized, she was great at angles and editing that would flatter or hide the areas I was insecure about. I was so relieved, because I loved her work. We hired her the same day.   


We paid our photographer for 6 hours which included get ready, first look, ceremony, traditional, and dinner pictures which just included a toast and cake cutting. Our contract stated that our package included 300 edited images. It also states that the photos will be delivered within two months, but she has up to 90 days to deliver.  Totally fine. My only request was for ONE image that wasn't watermarked so we could send out announcements. She happily agreed.   


When we booked her for our wedding, our package also included an engagement shoot. It was beautiful. The pics were delivered later than the stated time in the contract, but at this point they were so beautiful, I didn't care. I loved them so much, I booked her for our Christmas photos. She sent me a couple of photos with no watermark so I could send out Christmas cards, but I didn't get our album of 40 photos until February.  I was pretty upset about it, but at that point, I had already paid her in full for our whole wedding.   


The wedding came and went, and it was beautiful. I got a few watermarked sneak peaks, and I was super excited to get the rest. I few weeks later, I contacted her about the image without the watermark so I could send out announcements. She told me she would have to edit it. She never sent it. I left it alone, because at point, it had been 6ish weeks since the wedding, and I was supposed to have them within 60 days. The 60 day mark passed and I didn't hear from her, so I sent her a message asking for an update, and she told me that they weren't ready yet.   


I received my pictures today after two and a half months. The sneak peaks that were watermarked were not in the album.  I received a total of 152 photos. Several of which were the same photo, just one in color, and one in black in white. If you include the sneaks which I don't have yet, I've received about 160 photos. And they are not good AT ALL. They are horribly unflattering, crooked, off centered, and she didn't even edit out things like a pimple on my husband's face. Very basic things. Some of them are so unflattering, I don't even feel comfortable showing other people. They're so bad they brought me to tears. And it's even worse because I only have HALF of the pictures I was promised to pick from.

She told me yesterday however that she must’ve missed a birth control pill around that time and that she’s pregnant, about 5 weeks. 

We talked about kids before in the past and we both agreed that neither of us wanted kids and if somehow she got pregnant, she would get an abortion. 

Well now that she is actually pregnant she is telling me that she doesn’t think she can go through with an abortion. 

I got really upset and said that we made a decision together a long time ago that she would get an abortion if this happened and that she has to consider my opinion in this. 

She told me that it really isn’t my decision at all and that she is the one who is pregnant and she is the one who gets to decide. I said she was not being fair and I’m a part of this too but she isn’t listening to me and is planning to have the kid. I’m freaking out. 

She is being delusional if she thinks we are at all ready to have kids. Neither of us have finished university and neither of us have a lot of money.

1577,Not the A-hole,"I run my own company. I belong to a job where looking presentable is fairly important. Formal attire is definitely encouraged.

I myself believe that there should be a sense of discipline and order at the workplace. Dressing well is something which compliments this.
So while it's not emphasized too much, every person at my work place does dress up well. I myself always wear a suit to lead by example.
They honestly don't have any problem with this. We were a team of 9 men and one woman. (I only had men applying at first, hence the skewed ratio. It's more balanced now.)

We have a really friendly relationship. They get cakes and heartfelt gifts for me on my birthday and vice-versa. We are planning on watching avengers:endgame together. So it's great.

I did hire a woman about 3 months ago. She is pretty efficient and didn't need any help in particular. 

One thing that stopped me from liking her is what she was wearing, or the lack of it. I explicitly told her I expected professional attire and spoke about it's importance during her interview, and she eagerly agreed back then.

But during the first week or so, she wore track pants,loose t shirts, sheer clothes that showed her nipples, sleeveless blouses and yoga pants. 
I just politely asked her if she had a formal attire, and she said she would get it soon.
But then she came in these booty shorts. I gave her the address for my friend who is a designer and told her it was on me, since she seemed to be having difficulty getting a proper dress.

Turns out she didn't contact him at all. She kept wearing informal stuff for the whole week. When they finally got something remotely professional, it was honestly pretty revealing. Pencil skirt, like 8 inches long, not exaggerating. She wore track pants the next day, tank top.
I had a few other qualified applicants for her position, and her job required her to be fairly isolated from the group. 
I fired her saying I didn't think she fit in, but I wished her the best and was wrote a letter of recommendation for her.

I thought the whole thing had ended...I had someone else replace her. Had the fortune of getting 6 new ,really promising employees too.

 But the secretary showed me a Facebook post by her where she said that Working with me was a horrible experience and that I was a misogynistic asshole.

I honestly acted like I brushed it off, but it did hurt and it sat in my mind for a long time. I asked my other employees if they thought I was misogynistic, they said no. We are always frank with each other. If they think my poem is shitty, they tell me so, so I trust them

1578,Not the A-hole,"I do not post a lot so I am sorry if the format is wrong also on mobile. 

Backstory: In 2014 my wife (29F) and I (29M) got custody of her sisters 5 children. Shortly after that we found out we were going to have our first child. So we went from 0 to 6 kids in 9 months. Well part of getting custody was setting up child support. We both knew that neither parent would likely pay anything so we told the court to set the support at $550 a month for each parent. This is not a lot of child support for 5 kids and we hoped by setting it low we may be able to get something. We live in NC and the children’s parents live in TX.

In 2018 my parents were involved in a really bad accident and we lost my mom. I was in TX with my family and my wife made arrangements with her sister to stay with the children at our home in NC while she consoled me in TX. This lead to her sister trying to forcibly regain custody by saying I was abusive and that we abandoned the kids. Long story short everything she did failed, however she irreparably damaged our relationship with her. We wanted nothing to do with her anymore and decided to help get the kids set up and moved to their Dads house in TX.

That all ended around Aug. 2018 when the dad let my SIL see them and she never brought them back to him. After that things went quite from them. We contacted the child support office and informed them that we no longer had the kids so that they would stop trying to collect more child support. That stopped the child support that the parents owed from growing, but they still owe arrears. Fast forward to today when my wife is hysterical because she is getting texts from the kids dad because he finally got a job and is being told that he is going to have his paycheck garnished to pay arrears. AITA for wanting to get the child support that we are owed?

My best friend Kat and I have been friends since kindergarten so we’re practically sisters. Recently I was diagnosed with a very rare form of brain cancer and while we caught it early enough doctors believe I’m a high risk for relapse in the future. Essentially I have been given 15 years max to live. Recently I held a WIG party where my hardiresser and close friends brought in wigs and shaved my head. This is where the problem starts. Kat has been sucked into one of those essential oil MLM’s and has become somewhat of a soul sucking banshee but despite all that she’s been supportive of me in the past and she’s still my best friend. I’ve dealt with her saying her oils could do better for me than chemo and telling me I’m just killing myself faster by not using her oils so I’ve been close to my breaking point for awhile. I finally broke when Kat showed up without a wig or food but with a huge poster board of her MLM along with some of the products she sells. I of course started sobbing and all of our friends ripped Kat a new one. Kat has sent me some pretty nasty emails saying I’m not supportive and her mom has called my mom to scream about how ungrateful I am. I don’t know if it’s just my emotions being out of sorts or the anxiety of everything going on but I feel like a huge asshole. 




**EDIT** I’ve decided to have a sit down with Kat along with four of our mutual friends. I plan on telling her she’s out of line with her MLM stuff and that I’ve tried to be supportive of it but I can’t any longer. My friends and I are essentially planning an intervention. In the future if or when she apologizes I may consider recconecting but right now I’m too hurt to even look at her. My mother also lost a friend today (Kats mother) over the whole debacle and we’re both very very emotionally exhausted. Thank you for the kind responses and I’ll try to respond to each and everyone of you later today or tomorrow.",374,4205,0.95

1582,Everyone Sucks,"For context: we’ve been dating for 1.5 years. Also for context, we’re both pretty private with our phones, her more than me. Her notifications don’t go to the lock screen, and she has a complicated password I’d never guess (not that I’d normally care; I barely even noticed until now). 

This happened last night and I can’t shake through whether or not I’m justified. We were cuddling and a name called “Ken 😜” popped up on her phone on FaceTime. She tried to reject it really quickly but it seemed suspicious to me. I asked her who was that and she hesitated a moment before admitting it was her ex. This bothered me because we both don’t really say positive things about our exes, and I have no idea why he’d FaceTime (I don’t know if it’s just me, but video calling seems a lot more personal than phone calls or text messages). 

I asked her if she normally talks to her ex and she says no; they never talk, and doesn’t know why he called. I asked why was his name saved as that if she never talks to him, and she got annoyed and maintained that it was from when they were dating and she never deleted it. 

I asked her if she’d mind if I saw her text messages; not for everyone, just for that specific person. Or if I could look at her call logs. She looked at my like I had four eyes and was **PISSED**. She said that why do I want to go snooping on her phone? It’s a breach of privacy. I replied that I didn’t see it as snooping; it was just suspicious that a name she supposedly never talked to FaceTimed her, and it wouldn’t really take much to confirm her story. She restated that if I kept up acting crazy, I’d lose her, and I’m acting ridiculous. We fought, and as of now, we’re not speaking. 

I never really had a reason to not trust her, which is why I think I might be acting crazy. At the same time, it would’ve taken a quick 5 second glance to confirm her story. As it stands, it just sounds sketchy, and I can’t tell if she’s just that private, or is hiding something. I would normally NEVER go through my partner’s phone without probably cause, but an ex FaceTiming you and the sketchiness just seemed weird. 

AITA for wanting to go through her phone?

Edit: To add a little bit, we’ve established early in the relationship that we’re not really on speaking terms with our ex. So that’s why I was suspicious. Because, we don’t talk to our exes, I would think there wouldn’t be much of a text conversation to read. I didn’t want to snoop through her whole phone; just wanted to see if they were communicating regularly.

I see a bit of bickering in the comments soo to be clear, I **did** demand her. I told her she was ~~being~~ taking me for a naive idiot and that what she said was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. I told her that she needed to give me her phone now, and I opened up my hand expectantly. Hence the title.",416,488,0.95

That comment made her tip over, so she chucked the bag on top of where I put it at first. Keep in mind the bag had a switch, laptop, DS, and phone inside of it. At that point I snapped as well and yelled “MOM you can’t just throw my computer around like you own it” she whispered “Get in the f**king car, you may not have a chance to play that computer.” Her reasoning was because I yelled outside in our neighborhood.

When she got to the front of the line she found out they didn't have her size so she called me and asked if I wanted a pair. I said sure because I genuinely thought they were nice and wanted them (but also didn't want her to waste all her time). I got the shoes from her but didn’t pay yet and when I went home I found out she got them a size down.

I don't see why I should because they’re technically mine and even offered money for the trouble of lining up. Ended up having huge argument where she accused me of taking advantage of her and that if I give her money instead of the shoes we were done being friends. Was actually considering giving her the Yeeyzs back until she blew it up and gave me an ultimatum about our friendship over who resells a pair of fucking shoes.

1590,Not the A-hole,"I don't want to give out many personal details, and this drama has spanned so many years that a full retelling would take hours to type, so I'll try and summarize as best I can.

Suffice it to say, I'm the eldest of three siblings, and we have never been close. I haven't spoken to my sister since 2014 when she said she wanted nothing to do with my parents and cut all ties with us. I haven't seen my brother since a series of events that started with him convincing his entire high school class that my parents were abusing him, and ended with him in prison after literally robbing my parents on Christmas.

This left me as the only child around to help when my parents both had major surgery, when my dad's sister died. I essentially put my life on hold for a year while I did anything I could to ease the burden on my parents. I passed up a lot of opportunities trying to be the good son, and I'll admit I'm still kinda bitter about that fact.

Fast forward to January of this year. I've since moved across the country, and met my amazing boyfriend whom I'm trying to build a life with. I'd had no contact with either of my siblings, which suited me just fine. Now, out of the blue I get a call from my mom about how my sister is talking to her again, and how she's got this amazing fiancé and how wonderful it would be if I'd call and congratulate her on the engagement. 

So I act like a good son, and I text my sister. I say all the things my mom wants me to. I try to be civil. Which brings us to today, when I received an invitation to my sister's wedding in Hawaii. 

To be clear, I don't care if my parents have a relationship with my siblings. I understand why it's important to them in order to have a relationship with their grandchildren, and I'm happy that they have that opportunity. I just want no part of it. I'm not interested in having any sort of relationship with either of my siblings, nor in acting like everything is suddenly ok now after everything they put my parents through. And I especially don't want to inflict all this shit on my boyfriend. Not to mention the financial burden of flying to Hawaii in July. 

Am I being unreasonable for trying to distance myself from all this? Or should I just suck it up and go because it will make my parents happy?

Edit: To clarify, my sister's fiancé is in the Navy and stationed in Hawaii. So to her credit, it's not like she's going out of her way to have a destination wedding. She's just living in a place that's expensive to get to.",22,58,0.92
1591,Not the A-hole,"I'm Korean fully bilingual in English and Korean, but I look Japanese and I live in an area known for Japanese population.

I have been going to a neighborhood Korean grocery store every week for almost a year, and I am certain all the employees think I'm Japanese because they always speak English to me and never in Korean, which they will do if they assume the customer is Korean.

One particular female Korean cashier always shit-talks at customers by mumbling in Korean while checking out. But I let it pass thinking her job must be stressful and tedious. Nothing highly offensive but just complaining about customers being demanding or making her life hard.

Couple days ago whilst checking out, natto was on sale for $.99 each but it was registered as $1.49 each. I told her the price is wrong on the register, and so she had to cancel the whole transaction, fix the price, and re-run all the items.

Unsurprisingly she then mumbled ""Why are you fucking with me for 50 cents? Why not go back to Japan if you care so much about saving 50 cents. Always lurking around the store for sale items as if you're broke"". I stared at her dead-straight as she said it right in front of me, but she just avoided eye contact and checked out.

She does her job and seems friendly with others when she talks in Korean, but I'm now very much bothered to face her again. And the grocery store only has two registers and almost always I'll run into her or check out with her.

I just want to tell the manager to make her stop shit-talking in Korean but I don't want her to be in the risk of getting fired. I'm pretty sure all the employees are going to freak out that I've been Korean the whole time, especially her.

AITA if I report the manager about her?

This week I have had a guest over, Elisa. Elisa has been using the keys to come back home at night before the rest of us arrive (we all work late hours) and put them back there after every use. Starting yesterday, Emma is having a friend of hers (Robert) stay in her room to visit the city while she is away on a business trip. She told him about the keys so that he could use them too.

At 8:50 p.m., my guest called me saying the keys were not under the pot any more, there was no one at home and she couldn’t get in. I am at my office, which is a 1.5 hour commute away and I still wasn’t done with work. I message my housemates asking where the keys are. It turns out that the other guest has taken them with him and is now having dinner with Karen and some friends 40 minutes away from home. I tell Karen to tell him to go home and open the door for my guest, because otherwise my guest will have to wait for me to get back to go in (10:30+). She tells me he is having dinner. To that I replied that he could resume the dinner later.

They stopped replying to my messages and in the end my guest had to wait until I arrived at 10:30pm to go in. Robert turned up at 11:20.

1594,Not the A-hole,"A little bit of backstory and throwaway account to avoid the coworker seeing this.

I was raised alongside my best friend as our mothers grew up together. I trusted this man with my life and he always came through for me. He was the godfather of my three children and I'm the godmother of his two .Three years ago, he passed away in a car accident but before he did he left my daughter (then 11, now 14) an American girl doll that looked like her. She doesn't like dolls, hates them actually and was planning on giving it to her cousin but when she found out her godfather died, she kept it. It sits in it's box on a shelf in her room and anyone who comes into her room gets told not to touch multiple times. Even her brothers won't touch it when they're trying to piss her off because she will break down.

Now that the backstory is out of the way, here's the situation. 

My coworker (Myra) wanted a weekend to herself and asked if her daughter( 13, Stacy) could have a sleep over with my daughter, Grace(14), I agreed. My sons had to go to their grandmother's house along with our dog before Stacy could come over and Grace wasn't really wanting a sleepover but was convinced into doing it by one of her friends. Stacy got told the rules of Grace's room which included not touching her doll. Everything was hunky dory until Saturday night when Grace found Stacy playing with her doll after she went to the bathroom. An argument ensued that ended with Stacy throwing the doll on ground and storming out. 

Luckily, the floor was carpet and the doll was okay but Grace was bawling her eyes out. I called Myra and told her I'd be taking home Stacy early because of what happened and when I was dropping her off, Myra was pissed but said nothing about it. I thought she was upset her weekend was ruined but understood. 

Well when I came into work on Tuesday( I had Monday off), apparently Myra had told everyone in the office that I had kicked her daughter out for playing with a toy my daughter said she could play with. I was able to explain my side of the story but people still think we (Me and Grace) overreacted by kicking her out. Am I the Asshole here or just overreacting.

People have had small (maybe interesting) relationship troubles and have cut it off with their SO. While power to you to do whatever you want alot of the time these post garner lots of support from our community and it's been over weird things like this person really likes to beans in their pillow case or something weird like that and because of that they bug right out and people support it by saying that a person that wierd might not be a good partner down the line.

The issue is that not only I but fellow Redditors have brought up the fact that these are small but weird choices break a usually steady relationship and it's stupid. Instead of working it out people just run away because stuffing beans in a pillow case could mean they will put your head in a pillow case logic. In short no one is willing to work out the Quirkes of a relationship.

&#x200B;

The background of my relationship with this friend is that we've known each other since middle school, and we've always been pretty close. We're both goofballs and we naturally stuck together over the years. I love him to death, he's one of my best friends, but he's wearing me down. 

&#x200B;

Every time we talk, all we do is talk about his problems, and there's a lot. It's either about his ex, his lack of love life, his financial status, or his own mental issues. And I don't mind talking to him every now and then about this stuff, I love being there for my friends in that way, I know how much going through all of that sucks. I have a lot of issues with some pretty serious depression and anxiety to the point where it's hard for me to hold down a job, but that is beside the point. Any time I try to talk to him about my own stuff, it's for like five minutes before it's brought back to him. I'm expected to carry the whole of the emotional baggage, and we're not even dating, we're just good friends. If we talk it's either about his problems, or D&D. I don't mind talking about that stuff, but when it's all I'm good for, it really wears me down.

Recently I reached a breaking point with it, and had to stop talking to him. I called him crying and had to explain that I needed to take a break from him, and from talking to him, and went over.

1601,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Context:

My family grew up very racist, sexist and religious. My parents hold these traits and my siblings adopted it too. For context I'm 28 and my brother is 27. Growing up I had all these beliefs too but over the last few years I decided that I don't want this hatred to be who I am and decided to change.  Now my family casually throws around racist remarks like it's nothing. My brother has even gone so far as to drop the N bomb multiple times over voice chat in video games or whispers just to try to piss people off. For context he's say stuff like ""Fuck you N****, you fucking suck and I hope you kill yourself"" and so on.

At first I didn't really do anything about this because I always thought that's just the way they are. The more I changed however the more this bothered me. I'm no longer racist and to be honest the idea of being racist disgusts me these days, especially after reading about hate crimes like what's happened in new Zealand.

What happened:

Recently in discord my brother has been dropping the N bomb even more because I asked him to stop. He que'd his mic and just said the word over and over again for a full minute at least, since then I've asked him to stop at least another 5 times. 

Yesterday I posted in our discord of family and friends (it's a pretty big discord 200+?) that I won't deal with this type of racism anymore and if he doesn't stop I'll simply be leaving. He responded with ""I do what I want"", so I left. In the process of doing so I ended up feeling pretty well and decided to message him saying that I'm actually not just leaving the discord, I'm done with him until he grows out of this. I think it's too toxic a mindset to be around, let alone my kids being around it in any way.

Now my siblings are telling me I should stop being stupid because that's just the way he is and he's never going to change. I think I have a reasonable request though. Over the last years I have started believing that just because you're family it doesn't mean you are exempt from consequences or being removed from my life. We play a lot of games together and are pretty excited for WoW Classic. We have a fun little lan party planned at my place and my family is telling me that I'm going to ruin this for everyone because now they have to choose and split and it's my choice that's making them do this. 

TL:DR I told them that I shouldn't feel uncomfortable constantly just so he can drop the N bomb and it's a reasonable request to ask someone to stop regardless of who they are. He's made it clear he won't stop and is being much more frequent with it. My family says I should stop dividing us over it because he's not going to change and we're brothers. I'm kicking him out of my life with the option of him reaching out to me when he grows up.

My response was “probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.” This comment she didn’t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you’re only going to meet struggle.” I’m normally very indifferent and don’t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I’m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I’ve been dealt. But I told her “we don’t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you’re the one being close minded.” She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there’s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive.

1611,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway to avoid exposing info.

My boyfriend and I have discussed moving in together in the near-ish future. Let’s call him Jake. Jake’s parents were drug addicted and passed away when he was about 18 and he successfully obtained custody of his brother. He lives in a house about 30 min from me and I have a roommate and live in a fairly nice house. We are late 20s/early 30s. His brother is almost 19. After a natural disaster in his area, a few of his brother’s friends moved in to my boyfriend’s house, too. (With his permission). Those boys and Jake work in the city I’m in. Jake’s work is mere blocks from my home. 

Jake is constantly getting calls and texts by the boys, especially at night, being asked to be driven back to the house (since it’s a drive- it means he can’t always come back to my house if it’s late since I get up early). He has to shop for them on the weekends and I can’t really stay at his place due to the crowding, meaning he can only stay with me a couple nights a week. 

He is kind of like a dad to these boys and it is VERY sweet and kind, but I’m worried this is slowly becoming permanent. Jake’s brother doesn’t work or go to school, and while I like a couple of the boys, they definitely act like adolescent boys and have stopped looking into other housing options. I’ve seen messages from the boys asking if he’s with “thot”, making sexually suggestive remarks and complaining about him spending time with me/not always being available to give them rides. I know Jake’s brother is NOT happy about him having a girlfriend. 

I’m always understanding about the rides, as there is not public transportation late at night here and I don’t want the “kids” on the streets. However, as we build our future I certainly don’t want to be the girl putting anyone out- but I’m not prepared to live with these young guys, especially with what they call me. If there were any sign of these guys moving forward, I wouldn’t worry, but Jake doesn’t really push for that.

1612,Asshole,"Me and my fiancé have been trying for a child for a year and a half. Thing is, I’ve never wanted to give birth. The thought alone terrifies me. I really want a child at some point but I want to adopt, I’ve always knew that since I was a child. My fiancé, on the other hand, says he wants to raise his own child that looks like me and him. So I agreed but every month when I get my period, I feel relieved. 

A year ago I got severe bleeding that continued for two weeks. According to my gynaecologist, that was a potential pregnancy that my body rejected. She said that it’s different than miscarriage because there has been no pregnancy. It’s confusing but I didn’t ask more questions because the truth is, I didn’t care. I was actually relieved. My fiancé always talks about how he can’t wait for me to get pregnant but I hate the idea. I’ve told him I feel the same way but I’m lying. I told him a few times I wanted to adopt a child at some point and he refused. I myself am adopted and I don’t think my parents don’t love me, quite the contrary - they’ve always given me everything to the point I became quite spoiled. They are the most amazing parents I know so I don’t know how my fiancé can claim that adopted children aren’t ‘your own’ and ‘you can’t love them the same way as if they were your own’.

Since we’ve been trying for a child for quite some time and it’s not happening, he suggested we both go to a doctor and see what’s wrong. AITA for secretly hoping something really is wrong so I don’t have to bear a child? I feel so guilty and selfish but I did agree to carry his child. I just hope I’m physically unable to do it. 

EDIT: Thanks for the engagement! Yes, I’ve suggested surrogacy but he is strongly against it. And I haven’t been exactly lying to him - I’ve told him I don’t want to give birth at the beginning of our relationship but he brushed it off. He claimed I was too young to know what I want. If I get pregnant, I’ll carry the child and love it when it’s born. I would certainly not blame it, nor I’ll blame my fiancé since for the past year and a half I haven’t said anything except suggesting surrogacy once. I love kids, I work with them and they are my life but I don’t think he realises how much I’m afraid. I remember when we started dating I told him that I’d rather cut off my arm than give birth but probably he thought I wasn’t serious.

EDIT 2: I’ve been reading all the comments and I agree that maybe I wasn’t clear enough with him. The fear is not only of giving birth (because there is always the C-section option) but the pregnancy itself. I am afraid of carrying a baby for 9 months. It’s not just that I don’t want to destroy my body - the thought of a human growing inside me terrifies me more than anything. And I’m not too young, I mean I was when we started dating but I’m 25 and I seriously doubt that I’d change my mind someday.",256,627,0.93

1614,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for two months, over which we've been sleeping either at her place or mine.
Her parents have left on vacation for a couple of weeks so they left their cat with my GF, thus we have to spend the nights in her apartment. 
First night with the cat, we go to sleep but the cat is restless, jumping into the bed, walking over us. We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. 
Now, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).
I hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.

Fast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.

1616,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend and I are relatively new to sex. We also just moved to an European country for university. It's been almost two months since.

  


  


We had sex a couple of times here, unlike what I had planned. But we were in the mood and I was in high spirits.

  


  


Everything was going fine until something happened with the condom we were using that made me nervous (it slipped a little upwards and we pulled it back down and continued). After an instance of him doing so before, I asked him to not contest me on whether or not he should change a condom when I requested so I could relax during sex, but it happened again this time.

  


  


I began to worry, and decided to tell him what I wanted before having sex, and asked for a break from sex until we had them all:

  


1. To wait until we had stable living spaces (we will need to move soon) and knew the country better.

  


2. To wait to learn how to access better birth control in this country (Pills, the IUD, etc)

  


3. Learn the abortion laws in this country, plan out what to do for an abortion to a reasonable extent, and how to fund it/what it will take.

  


  


I really need these things to feel safe and comfortable having sex. My boyfriend doesn't think I'm wrong, but he also thinks that I'm being excessively paranoid and need to learn how to manage risk after freaking out over the condom. I wanted to take an emergency pill to be on the safe side, but he explained why he thought it would be a waste of money and we decided I wouldn't take one.

  


  


He also said that he didn't think I would find those measures I listed enough and would only be satisfied when he got a vasectomy.

  


  


I have a history of birth control worries. I've lost sleep over it. Messing up in this respect seriously terrifies me because the worst possible result is an entirely new human being unwanted by its parents which I wouldn't wish on any kid. I've tired my boyfriend out worrying out loud about it, and I had actually asked him for a break from sex for the same reasons before coming here to Europe. This is NOT to say he pressured me into having sex after getting here, I really wanted it too.

  


  


He says that the level of comfort I need borders on paranoia, and it could ruin our relationship. He doesn't seem to be very invested in planning for and finding out the things I want when I try to get us both to sit down and discuss it.

  


  


I would be a lot happier using our hands and mouths until I feel in a safe enough spot for sex. Am I the asshole by spoiling our sex life and relationship by letting anxiety get the better of me and asking too much from him or are my demands reasonable?",47,45,0.87

1619,Asshole,"Me (24m) and my gf (24f) have been in a great relationship for two years. Life with her is a bliss, except for one thing. Due to the cultures we grew up in, I care a lot about other people and want to be nice to everyone and go on in my life without being a problem to others. Meanwhile, my gf couldn't care less about other people and always does things that make her comfortable, even if it would make others uncomfortable.

For example, many times we have walked past a restaurant, and she slows down or stops to stare inside of the food people are eating. Usually people are sitting by the window and look little uncomfortable when she does that. I feel uncomfortable too, especially is she fully stops. I tell her that she shouldn't stare so much, other people might find it uncomfortable, but she says she does whatever she wants.

She also doesn't care about her surroundings. She walks on the bike lanes (not on purpose) and I always have to tell her to walk on the right side of the road or watch out if some bikes or big groups of people are coming. 

She might watch some videos or play music quite loud until late and around 9-10pm I have to tell her to turn it down because the neighbors might be sleeping. She might also want to start the laundry machine in the evening, and gets mad at me if I say we should do it tomorrow because it's quite loud for neighbors. She says she doesn't care.

The last thing was today when we were walking across a big street. There were no cars coming so we just crossed the lights even though they were red. However, my playful girlfriend thought it's fun to press all the buttons as we walk past them, causing the crossing's lights turn red for the drivers, and green for us. But we had already crossed the road. So now there were couple cars that had to stop at the lights even though no one was walking across the road. I told my girlfriend she shouldn't do that, because now the drivers have to wait for nothing. She got mad and said I don't like anything she does and always tell her what to do and not to do. 

I just care about other people and feel uncomfortable if they suffer or have to wait because of something I did. I might sound little blunt telling my girlfriend what to do or not, but I never force her to do anything. Most of the time I even try to sound not serious but happy and just slip in the conversation she probably shouldn't do something, but she still gets offended. On the other hand she says she feel uncomfortable with too many rules and if she can't do whatever she likes.

1620,Not the A-hole,"Okay I know I already sound like an asshole but I promise I didn’t want it to end this way.

Okay so my ex broke up with me this past weekend. It was out of the blue, completely unexpected, we haven’t argued in months and he just wanted to end it. We were dating for almost two years. I lived with him and his family at their house, his mother, sister, his sisters fiancé and then him and I lived there. 
This past Monday an old friend of mine contacted me saying she saw him on tinder. I was really taken aback because his main reason for breaking up with me was that he needed to be alone and single to “grow”and that he couldn’t grow with anyone else in his life. I was also very angry because he used pictures of him and my dog as bait “I love dogs, look how cute mine is” pictures on his profile (she was our dog but he said he didn’t want her so I took her with me.) I sent him the screenshots my friend had taken and asked why he had an account if he wanted to be alone. He grew very defensive saying that he had every right, which I agree with, but it doesn’t make sense with his reasoning for breaking up with me. He avoided all my questions about if he cheated on me or not and asking him to take the pictures of my dog off his profile. I was going to his house to pack my things this same day... After the tinder conversation, my ex randomly asked if I was bringing any of my family to help me pack my things later that day, and I replied I was because I had some heavy furniture I couldn’t carry myself. After hearing this he began sending me all sorts of “If you (my name) step foot on my property or if any of your family does, it will be considered trespassing and I won’t hesitate to call the cops.”. After he sent about 6 more texts asking if I understood that I wasn’t allowed on his property and that he would leave my things outside by the door ( it was raining that day too) I stopped replying. I instead contacted his mother, who owns the house, and after telling her about our breakup (he hadn’t told her yet apparently) and how her son was acting, she welcomed me and my family into the house to pack my things. While I was in the house, his mother was receiving constant calls from my ex saying to throw us out and that we weren’t allowed there to which she replied it was her house and her decision. He said I was being volatile and unnecessarily hostile toward him, was therefore a threat and that I was being an asshole for not just coming by myself to get my things. AITA??",128,250,0.94
1621,Everyone Sucks,"A coworker always talks about how she needs emotional support for anxiety and shit like that. She’s been through some trauma, her ex used to beat her. People I work with decided it would be great idea for her to get a dog. I was immediately annoyed and here’s the reason why. She works 11 hour days with 90 minute commute. Basically, that dog is going to be alone 14 hours a day five days a week minimum. 

So she gets the puppy, and can’t really train it because she’s never home. Insists on asking for advice on how to kennel train the dog. Now the poor thing is spending most of its time in a kennel, except to piss and shit before she leaves and when she gets home. 

Now she’s upset because the kennel smells like urine, and went around asking what she can do about the smell. I casually let out a sarcastic “Give the dog to an owner who can care for it”. And man did I get attacked. It’s a “therapy dog”, it’s a “getting her through a tough time”. My reply was “She should try Netflix, it won’t piss itself and die while she’s away”. 

Well, that got me reported to HR for harassment. By the girl in question. They made me feel like the villain until I explained what was happening. I’ve got her side against me and people with me. But somehow I’ve come out looking like an asshole for being the only to say something.

So for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. 

A few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.

I eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.

Fast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'. Now he is furious at me for sleeping with other people when we weren't together and refuses to even talk to me about it.

1623,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I had a pretty normal marriage. No kids, both employed and really happy together. For 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

She recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. The first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. Dinner went well, came home and went to bed. Wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. Long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after I had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

We talked, yelled, cried. I spent most of the night sick. Told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. I've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

Before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. Turns out we were wrong, as I was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. I got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. She was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. I told her I wished her all the best, I'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while I'd help financially from a distance, I wasn't physically going back.

They (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. My own friends are split 50/50. I don't want to go back. Before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. We had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. We were solid. She just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. She never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. While I certainly don't think anyone deserves this and I am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. I feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing I won't forgive her when it's over. It feels like prolonging the inevitable, and I feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. She has family and friends so she isn't alone. I care about the woman I thought I married, but I no longer love who she turned out to be, so I feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. I'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. AITA?

**Edit**: To the reddit detectives further down. When I said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. We talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. Secondly, I mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when I was told I didn't believe it, I figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment I left. I also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. As far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. And I figured this would be easy to figure out but I guess not, I knew her friend forced her to tell me because I demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. Finally, I know a lot of people post made up stories. I'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details I can't prove it. If I wanted karma I wouldn't be on a throwaway, I posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable I think it's time for neutral third party judgement and I was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided.

In addition, despite knowing how hard childcare is to get into, he was somehow surprised that I ended up having to stay at home. He made up an impossible budget and wouldn't give me access to a shared bank account so I had to use up my savings for basics like food and diapers.

 

 I finally got a job a some months ago. I'm hourly but work full-time, I commute 3 hours total a day, do all daycare drop offs and pickups, doctor's appointments, housework, shopping, etc. He barely comes home, let alone do anything around the house (when daughter looks at pictures on my phone, she doesn't even know who he is). If daughter is sick or her daycare is closed, he refuses to take off, so I use up my paid days quickly and usually end up not getting paid a couple days/month. His only contribution is paying for rent/utilities and some living expenses.

 

We agreed that I would save up to move out. I told him it might take a while because I had to replace some things around the house he refused to pay for, and I wanted to save up quite a bit. I will have full custody, and I have my doubts I will see CS from him. I also don't have much of a support network here so I want to save up as much money as possible as a buffer. I'm not sure when I will be able to move out but I'm hoping to be out in 6, maybe 8 months maximum. I also asked if he wanted me to pay some rent and he said no.

I replaced my broken computer last month (used, for quite cheap) and when he saw it, he snidely said he \*thought\* I was supposed to be saving (I was), but obviously I wasn't since I had money for a new computer. He said it was strange that a family with two working adults didn't split expenses and demanded I pay right there. I told him that families with two working adults also split household/childcare duties, and since that wasn't the case, I wasn't going to pay any until he stepped it up. He did not, so I have not paid any rent to him.

1628,Not the A-hole,"Little backstory: I married my wife roughly a year ago. We've dated for a couple of years before I proposed. While it was clear to me early on that she's more in love with the idea of having kids than I am, we both came to an agreement that we would wait a year or so after marriage to have our own.

Flash forward to a few months into marriage: I'm in medical school, working my ass off. On certain nights, my wife will start bringing up the topic of kids, asking me if I'm sure that I wanted to wait the year or so before trying to have kids. I stick with my answer and we have a small conversation about why I feel that way.

Some time later: I talk to her about how I'm worried that having a kid can make things harder for me in medical school. As a consequence, I told her that I would feel more comfortable waiting an extra 10 months or so on top of the year that we said we'd be waiting. She took it a little hard and we had an argument, but we agreed at the end of it.

Flash forward to now: every month or so, my wife would bring up the topic of kids again. I feel like she would act clueless and pretend that she didn't know our last agreement. Each time we talk about the topic, she would try to move that date closer and closer. I stick with my answer (1 year, 10 months total) every time, and because I won't budge on that timeline, she'd be mad and we would have a small argument. And every time we have an argument, she would use hypothetical situations to (in my opinion) fear monger me into moving the date closer (e.g. ""what if I'm infertile by then?""; bear in mind that we're in our mid-20s). 

My reasoning behind waiting is that the extra commitment might be too much for me, considering that I am already physically drained from my workload in medical school. On top of that, I would like to wait until we're more financially secure (i.e. I get close to graduating and finding a job as a physician). Medical school cost \~$250,000 dollars, and I don't want to fail out because of the extra commitment. My wife doesn't see that though. She wants to have kids before ""it's too late.""

1629,Not the A-hole," My  MIL has several chronic illnesses. She is about 70, and it's getting  harder for her to get around. I think she is  probably ""ok"" to live on her own for a few more months, but the other  shoe is going to drop, and it's going to drop soon. I know she is going  to ask to move in with us. I am dreading this, because I can't imagine  anything worse. Am I just a selfish asshole?

Back  Story: My MIL is single and lives alone because my husband's father was  a crazy jerk who abandoned his family. They are legally married, but  separated, and he squandered ALL their money. Now she has zero money to  her name, except her social security check.  As a result, she won't be able to pay for any sort of assisted living  or nursing home care when the time comes. She is going to need to apply  for a public nursing home, or live with one of her kids. I doubt her  kids will want her in a shitty home, so I think option 2 is going to  happen.

Whenever  she visits us, she comes for the weekend. Although she can absolutely  walk (though with some discomfort); when she visits, she sits in a  recliner for 12 hours a day and asks for all her food and stuff to be  brought to her. Plus she is starting to develop bad body  odor. On top of all of this physical stuff, she drives me crazy with her  constant talking; she tells the same stories over and over again, talks  way too loudly all the time, and does this little ""act"", where she  feigns stupidity about tons of stuff. She is a 70-year-old woman and she  acts like a Valley Girl half the time. If she was there all the time, I  think I would seriously lose my mind.

I  think she thinks she can live with us since we have a spare  bedroom/bathroom suite in our finished basement (that we use as a playroom for our kids) and we have  the biggest house of all her kids. But, we also have the most children--three kids  under the age of four. I am so incredibly  busy that I only get 6 hours of sleep each night. On weekends when she  visits, it's like adding another child to the mix. Also, I am in no way equipped to help with bathing or toileting, if it  comes to that. And I don't think she would want my husband to do it  either.

She has three other kids . All  of them are married. Two couples have 1 child each, and the third couple  are childless. The wives are all nurses, and would be much better  equipped to take care of her. However, they all have smaller houses that  she wouldn't want to stay in as much.

The  thing that makes me think I might be an asshole is that there isn't  anything overtly ""wrong"" with my MIL. I don't hate her (yet, lol), and  she isn't a bad person. She isn't even mean, she is just incredibly  needy and lacks the self-awareness to know when she is being obnoxious.

My mom married a guy I hate when I was 17. His family lived in Indiana, and it is about 9 hours of driving to get there. My mom and stepdad insisted we go down there for a visit during the summer I turned 20. I am now 25. I agreed to go simply because I hadn’t seen my “new uncles” in a year.  

Well one evening my mom and I were sitting outside talking about shaving our legs (not sure how we ended up there, honestly). We both agreed that we usually just do a light shave instead of shaving everything (upper legs, bikini area, etc) unless we are going to have sex. We were laughing about it and my “step grandma” came outside to smoke. 

Some info on this grandma. She was already mad at me for not calling her “gramma Karen” (no joke, that’s her name). I didn’t call her that because?? I was 17 when she became part of “my” family. I already had a grandma. She was mad enough to make it clear I wasn’t welcome to stay at her house with my mom and siblings. Instead I spent the week at a nearby motel. 

So anyways she hears my mom and I laughing and asks what we’re laughing about. My mom tells her we were talking about how lazy we are and don’t shave all the time. 

Karen immediately gets annoyed at not my mom, who is married to her son, but at me. She rounds on me, saying “don’t you have a boyfriend?”

At the time I’d been with a guy for three years and lived with him. So I told her yeah. 

She then asks me why I’m not shaving daily for him. I ask her why do I need to? She says I should be trying to look nice for him. I tell her that my boyfriend doesn’t care if my legs have hair on them, he’s aware that women grow hair there. 

She looks ridiculously disgusted by me. She’s giving me a nasty look and then says “do you at least make him dinner every night?” 

At this point I’m nearly laughing. It was 2013 and are you kidding me? Why would I make him dinner nightly? So I tell her no way. Sometimes I make dinner for both of us but no way in hell do I make him food every night. She asks me why not, and I tell her because he is perfectly capable of getting off his ass and making himself some food. 

She says, “Wow, I’m surprised he hasn’t left you yet.”

To which I responded “fuck off karen.”

I ended up catching a plane home the next day because I didn’t want to be around her. I haven’t seen her since. 

Recently my mom told me that Karen is still mad I never apologized to her. I don’t feel I owe her an apology. AITA?


Edit: I didn’t expect this post to get so much attention. I just want to clear a few things up. 

I genuinely believed this post would get me a lot of “ESH” and “YTA”. Some of you did say those things, one of you even called me a “bratty teen”, but I’m shocked by the number of NTA. 

I don’t feel I owe Karen an apology, because she was unbelievably rude to me, but I do have a little guilt for swearing at an elderly woman and then just taking off the next day when I knew I was already on thin ice with her. 

My family is really big into the “respect your elders” thing. It doesn’t matter if that elder is the worst person on the planet. We were punished if we didn’t respect those who were older than us, and therefore more important. So my telling her to fuck off was way beyond out of line. At least that’s what I was raised to believe. I don’t believe this now, but that’s the way it was. 

I asked this because I needed to know whether or not it was wrong of me to act the way I did to an elderly woman who I should have been treating with respect. 

So to those of you calling me a validation seeker, I hope this clears things up for you a little. I still appreciate your input, because it makes it clear that it’s so obviously NTA in your eyes, that you think I’m just full of it. ",329,2558,0.96

1634,Everyone Sucks,"We've been dating for a few years and she sleeps over at my place 4+ nights per week. We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me.

We've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria?

1636,Not the A-hole,"Earlier this week, I finished my run on the treadmill, and really pushed myself to finish my 5k walk/run faster than ever before. (Under 30 minutes this time around! I know not great, but it’s a personal record for me!) I was exhausted, but was still feeling motivated to do some weight training afterwards. 

I go to the gym every Monday-Friday and arrive at 5:30am to start my workout. It is always the same people at that hour, as we are all on a schedule to workout, shower, and go to work. 

This particular morning, I noticed a new face at the gym. He was a younger guy, around my age, mid 20’s. I sat on the bench to begin doing some bench presses but was also catching my breath quick and changing my playlist on my phone, so I sat for maybe 1-2 minutes before starting to lift. This guy comes up to me and stands directly in front of me. I take out my headphones and he asks “you gonna lift or no? I’m waiting to use this bench”... I reply back “yes, just catching my breath”... feeling rushed, I begin doing my bench presses. This guy does not leave. Continues to stand next to me impatiently waiting for me to finish on the bench. I cut my lifting short, wipe down the bench and the bar, and he didn’t say “thanks, sorry to rush you... “ or anything of that sort. Just stared me up and down trying to rush me. 

This event has bothered me the entire week, and I am wondering if I am the asshole for taking a minute or two on the bench before I started lifting.

1637,No A-holes here,"Husband and I have been together for ten years.  We have a beautiful daughter and I’m pregnant with our second due in May.  

My first pregnancy was unplanned and after several years of sobriety, my husband relapsed and got a DWI.  We have since built a respectable life with stable jobs, a house, live in a good area, and put our daughter first.  

My husband started drinking again after several more years of sobriety and I found out I was pregnant with our second.  I told him to stop drinking around our daughter and myself.  

He has continued to sneak around and drink.  He has shown little to no interest in my pregnancy or the baby.  All preparation has been left up to me.  Things are getting neglected around the house and I can’t keep up.  

I have been secretly documenting and seeking legal advice from an attorney on separating and gaining full physical custody of the kids after I have the baby.  I plan on telling him to leave the house and find a different living situation.  If that fails since we’re both on the mortgage, I will be taking the kids and leaving myself.  

There has been silence between the two of us for quite awhile but the other night - while drunk - my husband came to me and told me he needs help with his drinking.   He is not the man he wants to be and he doesn’t know what to do anymore.  He said he can’t stop drinking but he wants to. 

I was too angry to really respond and told him to get to an AA meeting when he gets sober.  I left the room.  

My close friend when I confided in her told me I was being an asshole for rebuffing him and not giving him a chance.  Apparently, my plans to secretly leave with the kids are unfair and I need to talk to him now about it because he’s their father.  

I don’t want to talk to him about it until after the baby is born and I’m too angry to want to help him.  Why does he get to be shitty and drunk and distant when it suits him and then ask me for help.  I’m so overwhelmed with just the preparation of another human life coming into this world and protecting our daughter from his bad choices, I’m just tired.  Selfishly I’m tired.  

AITA for not supporting him and going ahead with my secret plans to leave him and take the kids without upfront discussion?

Edit:  I think it’s important to say he is not abusive.  When he is sober, he is a fantastic present father.  When he drinks, he is prone to blacking out/passing out.  I cannot risk what would happen if he drinks around our newborn alone and passes out.  I believe we should share joint legal custody but at least while he is continuing to drink, I do not think it’s safe for him to have joint physical custody.  

I know I sound cloak and dagger but I just cannot risk him drinking around our newborn.  I don’t believe he is in a good place to see this risk and will fight for his kids - I think any father should fight like hell - but I CAN see the dangers and will do everything I can to protect them.

1640,Not the A-hole,"I'd like to say first of all that I do get along with my MIL most of the time when we disagree on something we can always talk it out.

Except this one.

&#x200B;

I have a daughter and she is 20 months old ever since I got pregnant my MIL wanted to buy her baby perfume.

She loves perfume herself and even bought a few for me.

I myself have been raised in a household with little to no perfume because my mother and one of my sisters suffer from very strong asthma. Any chemicals that has a sent, cigarette smells, flowers can create a bad reaction.

&#x200B;

My MIL is aware of that fact because I had to tell her not to put on perfume when she met my mother for the first time (she did listen to me then).

&#x200B;

When my MIL brought the subject of buying a perfume for my (then) unborn daughter I gently told her I didn't want my daughter to have any perfume before being much older.

I was afraid that because of my family's medical history she could also badly react to perfume and I didn't want to take the risk.

&#x200B;

My MIL told me that she understood and that she would only buy quality perfume.

I tied explaining to her that the quality didn't change the risk factor but she didn't really seem to listen.

I talked it over with my BF who told his mother a little bit harsher not to buy perfume for our daughter.

&#x200B;

We didn't talk about it again so I thought it was settled.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this weekend, we were spending the weekend at my MIL and FIL's house just like we do once a month and  I had my daughter on my lap.

I had given her a bath the night before with my MIL's baby products that she buys so that we don't have to bring everything over when we come. I smelled my daughter's hair and I thought to myself to check the baby shampoo because I thought the smell was really strong.

My MIL sees me and the conversation went like this:

&#x200B;

MIL: don't you think D smells good?

Me: Yeah I just thing the shampoo smell is really strong did you buy a different one ?

MIL: no its no the shampoo ! When I went to the mall one of the saleswoman gave me a sample of a baby perfume when I showed her a picture of D ! (We don't allow anyone to put pictures of our daughter on social media and my MIL shows pictures of my baby to anyone but since she doesn't share them we don't stop her).

Me: NO NO NO NO NO ! YOU PUT PERFUME ON MY D ????! I TOLD YOU I WAS AGAINST IT !

MIL: oh I forgot !

I was soooooo mad I told my BF so he could yell at her some more and I made her throw away the sample (I watched her do it too).

I told him that because we found each other, we got to delete the app.

He said he doesn't want to.

And when I asked ""Am I just an option?"" I damn cried. I felt embarrassed, I tried not to cry but I couldn't help it. He's been talking about the future, meeting the parents, marriage, having kids, but then he still refuses to delete the app.

""I'll delete the app when I'm ready.""

He's not ready to delete the app yet ready to talk about bigger things, as big as marriage.

And then it stung when he said, ""I'm telling you as a friend...""

A FRIEND?! He kissed me almost had sex with me (thank God I stopped him in time)! How dare him call me a friend?!

1643,Asshole,"I'm on the debate team. My partner and I are planning to run for co-captains of policy next year (one type of debate). My partner, let's call him Tim, is honestly the better debater out of the two of us. But I'm a better writer, and more importantly in this case, better at politics (well, as much as a high schooler can be).

I anticipate our main competition is a team, which also happens to be a couple: James, and Mary. 

The main reason I worry about them is because they're from two different social groups, with different friends. Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. 

The thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. 

So I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this. But everyone else seemed to agree that I was doing them a favor: they were incompatible but kept dating because of debate, and it made them unhappy.

So who's right? James or everybody else? Aita?

1645,Asshole,"Background info: our household is me, my husband, our two teenage daughters and my parents. Due to my mom and dad living with us all of our meals are rather traditional as my dad won’t touch anything else.


My daughters are not really into the meals we make so my eldest decided to pretty much cook for herself. She will occasionally eat with us, but most of the time she buys stuff with her money and eats whatever she likes. 


I don’t exactly like it, but anytime we tried forcing her to eat our food she’d throw a fit so I gave up. 


Issue:


I was planning to cook with use of ground meat today but realized I forgot to buy it. However, there was some meat apparently bought by my daughter. I took it and cooked a meal that I know she likes and also that the rest of family likes.


However, when she came home and realized I used it she got really irritated with me. She asked me if I took it and I said that yes I did, but I cooked something she’d enjoy. She said that it didn’t matter what I cooked because she had a “meal prep” in mind and now she can’t. 


I have to say that I felt a little offended by her making a fuss about it so I told her to just quit complaining about it and “meal prep” something else. 


She blew up then and told me that I need to pay her back for the meat I used. I laughed because it’s ridiculous, the meat she bought costed pennies and it’s not like I ask her to pay back for the food I buy to feed the family, right? 


She then told me that this is exactly why her and her sister don’t like me and that unless I pay back she won’t speak to me. 


My husband heard everything so I asked him to discipline her, but he said that he’s on her side as she paid for it herself and I’m not only an asshole to use her stuff, but also an asshole because now he will have to pay back money I “owe” to her so she doesn’t feel hurt by my “unfairness”. 


As of now no-one except for my parents speaks to me. Am I insane to think she overreacted and made me look like some kind of villain? Or am I the asshole here?

Recently, theres been a lot of joking about how ""everyone here is gay"" and ""straight people aren't even real.""

I really feel like I don't have the right to ask them to stop because I'm sure they've heard that however they identify isnt real over and over in their lives, and I truly have had a privileged life. Sometimes I just feel like the joking is a little hypocritical.

1647,Not the A-hole,"Edit 1: Shit let me get on PC to fix the format and add a TL//DR at the end.

This happened 3 weeks ago, but I barely talked to the teacher today because of several reasons:
1. My brother hesitated on telling me because he was told he could get it back that same Friday.
2. I can only go Mondays and Wednesdays.
3. She was absent last Monday I went.
4. We had spring break.

So my middle-schooler brother was wearing a black ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"" hoodie he had just bought a week prior. The hoodie was out of dress code for the color and the logo. He insisted on taking it to school because other kids wore all kinds of stuff and they didn't get in trouble. I know that just because other people do it, it doesn't make it right.


Anyway, this teacher saw him in the hallway and asked him to give it over. He did. Well, this lady left the hoodie on a cubby by the door. Mind you, when I went today, I had to wait about 10 minutes in her classroom because she was out and about somewhere. Obviously, she is careless about what goes on in her classroom.


When she finally decided to come back, I presented myself and reminded her of my brother and the hoodie. I then asked her what she's going to do about the situation. She told me ""I told him to look in the lost and found."" *Turns to my brother* ""DiD yOu LoOk In ThE lOsT aNd FoUnD?""
That's when she made me mad. Like okay ogre-looking-ass, you really expect a middle schooler who stole a hoodie to return the hoodie to the lost and found?


My brother then tells her that he looked multiple times and she looks at me with a ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ look. I then say, Thank you, I'm going to take it to (insert principal's name). ^I ^personally ^know ^the ^principal, ^although ^she ^might ^not ^remember ^me ^because ^she ^was ^an ^administrator ^at ^my ^high ^school ^a ^few ^years ^ago.


I go down to the office, and ask if I can speak to (insert principal's name) for an issue with a teacher. They tell me I have to speak to administration first, and I need to get a written note from my parents to do so since I'm not the legal guardian.


I guess I have to mention now that my dad works past the time the school closes and my mom is recovering from a surgery which she had 2 weeks ago. That's why I am doing all of this.


Anyway, AITAH for expecting the teacher to pay for what she took and lost? The hoodie was only $20 because my brother had it made. It's not like it's a big deal for her or I to get it made again. I just think it's unfair for my brother. If this was a cellphone we're talking about, and she lost it, I think it would be just as big of a deal. Why couldn't she just tell him to put it in his locker or bag or just carry it. It's her fault it's lost, so she should be responsible for paying for it.


TL//DR: Teacher confiscated my brother's $20 ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"" hoodie, left it by the door, and lost it. I am trying my best to have her pay for it.

1648,No A-holes here,"So two nights ago I matched with a girl who seemed pretty cute. We sent maybe three to four messages in total but they were pretty deep from the outset since she opened with a question about what I liked about my personality. Overall I could tell she was pretty smart and part of me wanted to end up trying to see where things but part of me was also hesitant. I was hesitant because I apparently hadn't realized that she had kids when I originally came across her profile. At this point in my life (I'm 27/M) I don't think I'd be ready to have kids or take on the responsibility of dating someone who has kids. I was considering the possibility of trying it out until I came to the conclusion that since I'm not too sure about it, I probably shouldn't go for it since I would be entering a dynamic that might cause more harm than good. As for why I matched with her, some days I'm in the bad habit of just swiping off the first picture or so and then other times I actually take the time to read all the way through a profile.

1649,Not the A-hole,"So my brother in law, who is 21, recently picked up his girlfriend and took her away from her home when she turned 18. For the sake of the post, let's call him Jake and her Bella.  

Bella was in a supposedly bad situation at home, in which she lived under the rule of her evil stepmother who took all of her kids money. So...

Jake's been waiting for her to turn 18, which occurred yesterday. Today, he picked her up. She left a note for her stepmom, and pretty much there is no turning back. Her step mom freaked out and sent a bunch of mean texts to him and Bella. 

Now she is living in my in-laws house (mother and father in law) and my Jake also lives there, with multiple other siblings. The family is very religious, and does not want the two living in the home together, in fear that Satan will tempt them to ""do the dirty"" before marriage. 

So now, Jake is asking to couch surfing at my house as well as his other brothers house. His other brother is older, married, and has a 3 year old child and a 1 month old baby. He also works nights. 

My wife asked if we would let him stay on our couch. I said No. Plain and simple. Here's my reasoning:

Jake didn't think this plan out at all. Bella didn't stand up for herself in regards to working full time for a year (she finished highschool early) and not saving a penny for herself. 
Jake has been mindlessly spending all of his work money and tax return money on guns and ammo and McChickens. 

So now that there is a problem he created, he is expecting us to be the solution. I enjoy my home. I enjoy my personal privacy with my wife. I have a high stress job and Jake is also a taxing person to be around. I love him and he is family, but overall, I'm saying ""No"" because 

1. I don't want him living on my couch
2. I want him to fix his own problems because I also got married at a very young age and got zero help from anyone in the family, even though we all live pretty close to each other. 

Am I being an asshole? Should I help him and just soften my heart? I'm of the mindset that it wouldn't be helping him. It would be enabling his irresponsible behavior and lack of planning a pretty major life choice (for himself and Bella)...

Backstory:
A few years ago my mum started believing in conspiracy theories, went from pretty open minded to racist and started sharing populist thoughts basically saying stuff like ""there's a NWO organisation, Merkel is the granddaughter of Hitler, the white population is being infiltrated by non-whites and its being replaced by those filthy immigrants"" etc. etc.
This of course caused many arguments and disparities between her and the rest of the family since we all tend to be open minded and think that these kinds of thoughts are just complete and utter bullshit.

Now onto the main part:
A few months ago after my mum got diagnosed with cancer and after my stepdad at that time left her she started dating this guy who's sharing these thoughts as well if not even a tad bit more extreme. For example I know that he's a flat earther and doesn't like the way our system works, especially the school system since the kids are being ""indoctrinated the wrong thoughts and are being teached unnecessary shit"".

I'm 19, my sister is 15 and has never been particularly good in school. My mum decided to take her out of school and to ""homeschool her at the school of life"" when she's ready, which is btw illegal since it's the parents responsibility to ensure the kids get the education and send them to school. 
My mum obviously doesn't want to have any of that ""indoctrination"" in state schools being pressed into her kids head, that's why she took her out. 
We argued a lot about this decision since I suspect that my sister will just use the time outside school to not do anything and therefore loosing contact to how the real life is, not getting a degree and not being able to not make anything out of herself. 

I and others from my family also fear that she'll try teaching my sister things that are coming from her reality. Things like those mentioned above, that the holocaust wasn't real and the allies faked it and that the talk about climate change is a huge scam caused by idk who.

I'm having thoughts of reporting my sisters absence and my worries to authorities which would mean that my sis would be forced to go to school and I'd probably be dead for my mother since I betrayed her.

She said it's an unwritten law that if you have a realtor in your family you HAVE to use them. I told her we are going to use our realtor and she blew up at me and won't speak to me. AITA?

1654,No A-holes here,A couple of weeks ago me and my gf were having sex and in the middle of it she asked I would be ok with have a threesome with another guy. This hurt me alot. I wouldn't have cared if she said that at any other time (and I wouldn't mind having a mmf) but the fact that she stopped me in the middle of having sex with her to ask makes me feel like im not good enough and has me making me feeling really insecure about myself. But I feel that I shouldn't say anything because I've also been trying to get her to be more open with me about what she wants sexually because shes typically to shy to tell me things like that. So would I be the asshole if I talked to her about this?,34,61,0.91
1655,Not the A-hole,"AITA for sticking up for my SO and making his mother cry?

SO and I are in our early 30's. Recently he has been struggling with anxiety/depression. He experiences a lot of guilt as a part of this. As a result, he has mostly stopped communicating with his family because they push him to talk about things that make him anxious and will guilt him for not calling. Its not like he's cut them out of his life, he just puts off communication until he feels ready for it, which admittedly can last a really long time.

MIL eventually got fed up and decided to come for an unexpected 4 day visit. This upset me because it felt like an ambush and ultimately made SO feel worse. I try to be understanding as I know she is just worried about him, but she could have at least asked when would be a good time to visit (to me, if he isnt responding) rather than just urgently coming. The context of this visit really made him feel very out of control and embarrassed so he decided to talk to her and tell her that this trip was a violation of his privacy and wasn't ok to do. MIL claimed she had no choice, he wasn't talking to her so she had to come. Privately I felt it was very selfish of her, she came to ease her own anxieties without considering how it might make him feel.

At the end of an awkward trip, I snapped. MIL was getting ready to leave, reiterating to SO that he needs to call more and laying the guilt on heavily. She was telling him how hurt his father is that he wont call, asking if he was mad at his father?, and explaining how his father thinks he is going to die soon (he's not, but is a heavy smoker and is anticipating getting a cancer diagnosis despite not having any issues currently) and he will die thinking his son doesn't love him.

&#x200B;

I snapped, ""I'm not sure guilt is the right approach here,""

MIL: ""well then what is?""

Me: ""Patience and understanding... he's an adult"" and then I left the room.

&#x200B;

I definitely said it in a frustrated way. Up until this point I had tried really hard to be smiley + friendly, so I think that my outburst hit extra hard. Then MIL left for the airport crying.

I tried reaching out to SO's sister and we had a really heated conversation in which she told me plainly that he needs to call his family. I don't disagree, but I suggested that they be understanding of what he's experiencing and allow him some space. She said his behavior indicates that either he's really rude or something is seriously wrong and when tried explaining, he doesn't want to call because his family just makes him feel bad by guilting him, she told me she was too frustrated to talk to me and hung up.

It sounds like nobody wants to hear how to help support him, they just expect him to change and I dont think thats a fair ask so I'm the villain. So AITA?",29,122,0.98

No."" so I said ""I sent him some, I'm sorry. I should've asked you first."" and she said it was fine but she doesn't want him having any more, so I told her that was fine I'd tell him and block him. I sent him a message that pretty much says ""(Daughter) and I talked and this is our decision. She doesn't want you having pictures, contact, or a relationship. Furthermore you signed your rights away, you don't get to ask for or have pictures anymore. I'm glad you seem to be in a good place but I think it's best we don't talk anymore."" I sent it to him this morning and then blocked him everywhere, so I'm not sure if he'll actually see the message but at this point I've done what I can do I think. I obviously need some therapy to work through the abuse and fear, but I've got to start having that spine to just cut him out permanently. One thing I realized was extremely assholeish of me was my thinking of ""ugh I'll just send him this, I don't wanna deal with him/deal with this."" but I'm the one putting myself in positions to** ***have*** **to deal with it because I'm too scared to piss him off. Anyway - Thanks everyone.**

&#x200B;

My husband says I'm not being an asshole but I still feel like I am.

Basically the gist is I had my daughter when I was 16 with my ex. Due to drugs he was in and out of her life, she never really formed a relationship with him, and never really knew her dad. I met my husband when she was 4 and he has raised her ever since, she sees him as dad.

In 2017 my ex asked to initiate contact with my daughter again, I told him I wasn't going to force her, she was at the age where she could decide for herself. She decided she didn't want to, last time they'd talked was 2014 and it was awkward as hell for her, so I told him as much.

EX got pissed off and said he was going to have the state terminate his parental rights because ""he shouldn't have to pay child support on a kid that wants nothing to do with him."" My husband and I had been talking about him adopting my daughter but I never really thought EX would sign his rights over (he always threatened violence, said no one would take his place) so when he said he wanted to terminate his rights I told him the state wouldn't do it unless there was a parent ready to take on the financial responsibility of her, and would he sign his rights away for my husband to adopt her. He agreed and signed his rights away in November of 2017. We didn't have any contact after that and the adoption was completed in 2018.

The beginning of this year he added me to snapchat, and I being the stupid people-pleaser that I am accepted. He's sent me a couple snapchats of him and his new little girl, asked how I am, so I try to be polite.Today he asked me if he could have some new pictures of my daughter, because he hasn't seen her since 2014. I sent him some, but now I'm thinking I shouldn't have. He never wants anything to do with her unless it's convenient for him. He went years and years without talking to her, and only started skyping her in 2014 because **I** reached out because **I** felt guilty that he hadn't seen her in so long. (I was dumb and should have just let sleeping dogs lie.)

I feel that he signed his rights over, he doesn't get to ask those things anymore. He may be her dad biologically but my husband has raised her for the past 7 years, she sees him as her dad. EX signed his rights over for her, so he is done with her, no more connections, no more pictures, nada.

My husband says it's not a big deal to send some pictures cause if EX *really* wanted to, he could find them on Facebook or somewhere else, but that I need to set concrete boundaries that he doesn't have the right to ask for these things anymore. Now I feel like it's too late to say anything cause I've already sent him pictures.

1657,Asshole,"Hello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fiancé and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. 

Last year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a ""secret"" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. 

Fiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially ""found"" money that may never happen again so we might as well have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?",690,1030,0.92
1658,Not the A-hole,"“Ryan” is 15 and came out to our homophobic parents about four months ago. They promptly kicked him out of the house and he had to come live with me. I’ve also lost contact with my parents because of this. 

For the most part living with him has been fine. He picks up after himself (mostly) and still goes to school and works to help me out with bills. 

One thing however, is that lately he has been seeing this boy and bringing him over to the apartment to have sex (I have a spare bedroom). 

I don’t care if he’s having sex or who it’s with, and I mean I really could not care less I can’t emphasize that enough, but it is making me so uncomfortable in my own place. I can hear them at night, and when I get home. I’m losing sleep because it makes me so awkward and uncomfortable. I feel like I’m losing my mind. 

This kid is also hanging out at my place a lot more than I would like. I suspect he doesn’t have a very good home life. 

I really want to tell Ryan to maybe cool it down because after all it is my place but I also get that maybe they don’t have anywhere else “safe” to go beside my house. I don’t want to make him uncomfortable and I don’t want to seem like a huge asshole if I ask him not to do it at my place anymore because he does help with some of the bills. But again, it’s kind of making me go crazy always having this kid over and hearing them.

1661,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a secular homeschool group.

&#x200B;

One of the moms is a lesbian (married to a woman) but is very, very isolationist driven.  Besides this class she doesn't do much with the kids besides some LGBT gatherings.  That's fine, to each their own.  I'll call her Jane.

&#x200B;

Her daughters are 12 and 14 (almost 15) She came about them in the ""ordinary"" way but divorced her then husband and remarried when the girls were 6m and 3.  Their other mom is the only other parent they really know.  Their dad was in the military and died not long after the divorce.

&#x200B;

We happened to be talking while the kids were in an class (kids do swimming, gym, cooking and art while parents chat) about first periods, sex ed and all things puberty.   Jane admitted that she's only told her daughters about lesbian sex and that babies come from sperm added to a woman from a petri dish.  This seemed a bit odd.  Later on, Pam, a mom with girls the same age clarified with Jane.  Jane has taught her girls about lesbian sex, but has not taught them about heterosexual sex.  At. All.

&#x200B;

Jane claims that we are being narrow minded and homophobic when Pam and I suggested that she perhaps cover the basics of heterosexual sex with at least her older daughter.  She said it's not needed because her daughters are lesbian, period.

&#x200B;

Except, I pointed out to her that her 14yo is very cosy with a young man and they sneak off for a lot of alone time.  Her daughter blushes profusely if you ask if she likes said boy. (Even though the activities are YMCA lead, parents help out a lot and we tend to share these sort of things with the parents)  But she also swears she's a lesbian.  Quite frankly, I'm not sure she actually understands what ""lesbian"" is.

&#x200B;

So Pam and I told Jane that it's imperative she tell her daughters about heterosexual sex before she ends up a grandmother.   We told her we would never, ever overstep her as that's not our place, but this is NEED to know information, and it needs to come from her.  Jane exploded on us and said that we should watch out or she'd tell our all kids (even the little ones) the details of homosexual sex down to the last detail the next time she got the chance.

&#x200B;

Right now, things are very icy between all of us.  All my kids know is that they are never to be in a room alone with another adult and I've been extra careful.  Pam's kids are 12, 9 and 5 and my kids are 9, 7 and 4.    And quite frankly, except for Pam's oldest graphic details about any sex are just not appropriate.  (my 7 and 9yos know about puberty and  well as Pam's 9yo.  Both 9yo's know the basics of sex.  Her 12 yo knows about heterosexual sex works and that homosexual sex can happen, too, but not details).

&#x200B;

TLDR:  AITA for confronting a lesbian mother when I found out that her 14yo didn't know about hetrosexual sex?

&#x200B;

***EDIT: Upon suggestion of another poster, Pam and I will be giving her older kid some teen magazines with information on hetero sex to slip to Jane's kids.  Hopefully, they will decided to read them and I think this is the best scenario that won't involve confronting a kid we don't really know.***

&#x200B;

***EDIT 2: Upon the suggestion of a poster who is a sex educator, I am going to see if we can have the Y do their ""safe dating"" class for the homeschoolers as a mandatory part of the teen gym class.  They don't need parental permission to run the class and it would be appropriate for all teens so it would be very obvious if someone tried to avoid the class.***",190,526,0.92

I’m turning 18 on April 1st, but I’m having my party on March 30th. I planned my birthday party three weeks ago, so lots of people had time to work their schedules around it. I planned a nice dinner and invited my entire family and everyone said they would come. Then suddenly, a week before my birthday, my aunt and my uncle planned their kid’s party on the exact same day as mine, despite their kid’s birthday being on the 23rd of March. All my but 3 of my family members have cancelled coming to my party to go to my little cousin’s. Everyone is saying I should just go to my cousin’s party and basically share a birthday party with her. 

No offence to this baby, but I wasn’t really wanting to share my 18th with a 1 year old. Yesterday my mom messaged the family group chat saying that she was upset for everyone assuming I should share a birthday party with my cousin. My aunt’s family told my mom and I that we’re being “ignorant and childish”. They also told me to go cry somewhere else. I then defended my mom and myself by saying that I was only upset that everyone cancelled on me, and that I’d still come to their party. I also told them not to insult my mom for defending me. I then left the group chat because I didn’t want to fight with my uncle. My aunt and my uncle think I’m trying to ruin their little girl’s special day. My aunt’s say I should just go to my cousin’s party and they’d all see me there. My mom and my grandma all said I have a right to be upset. I’m pissed because I planned all this and now a lot of people aren’t coming. So I gotta know, am I being unreasonable here? Am I an asshole? ",597,4913,0.98

I could tell when we first met at a party that she wanted to hook up with me, unfortunately I didn't hook up with her then due to other things that happened that night (got beaten up) and since then I've been hella busy, but I have been texting her back and fourth and I know she's down to fuck. 

If anything the waiting made her MORE desperate to get it done and dusted.

So I went out the other day on a night out and I know she was also going out to thar same club. **Important info - I took alcohol AND also drugs. Smoked a weird strand of weed.**

So I feel really weirdly buzzed and go out. I see her at the club and we start dancing, then making out. So I suggest going back to hers and she agrees. From this point on, I lost my memory. Maybe I was spiked again? (was picking up random drinks in the club).

So I wake up with no memory of what happened. I check my phone and see texts from her calling me ""Fucking asshole.""

Shit. I get intense anxiety after that. So I wait a few hours to calm down and call her and ask what I did. She said ""You don't remember?"" and I say no. 

She explains that once we got back to hers, we get naked and make out. As I reach for my condom, I throw it on the floor, get up and start dancing naked. Then I start spinning around and singing ""Pump Up the Jam"". She then promptly tells me to get the fuck out and I leave.

This is going to be a longish one, sorry in advance, TL;DR at the bottom.

For context: my husband's family is extremely academic, they hold education above almost everything else. But they hold education so high they don't fully understand real world job experience has value too. They pretty much think that if you have enough education (no matter what your degree) then a job should just magically fall into your lap. This is what my husband's middle sister (MS from now on) believes. MS has been working on getting her honors, her grades are good and she's going to be finishing this spring. But, MS has never had a steady job. She's done short contract work (5ish weeks) and volunteers to teach Catechism every Sunday. Now that’s she's graduating she's struggling to find a job. MS has been looking for about 2 weeks now and last night this happened.

We were visiting the MIL at her place and MS was talking to her mum (my MIL) and complaining that she couldn't find a job, MIL tried to be encouraging, and pointed out that my husband and I were able to find work after looking for some time. But then MS said ""well I guess I'm just not at blessed as OP and OP's husband"". (Yes, she actually said ""blessed""). I then inserted myself into the conversation (I am paraphrasing here)

&#x200B;

Me: ""Excuse me, but I am not 'blessed', I worked hard for my job. There's a difference.""

MS: ""That's not what I meant, you were just lucky to get your job.""

Me: ""MS, I didn't 'get lucky'. I worked. I had other jobs and work experience alongside my schooling that made me a better candidate for my job""

MS: ""Well I worked too.""

Me: ""No, you went to school and did your school work. You didn't have a job or get experience.""

MS gets kinda quiet and I keep going

Me: ""Jobs look at both school and past work experience and in my opinion they like to see work experience more than an educational degree. So I did both. Yes my grades weren't as good in the end but at least I have a job now.""

&#x200B;

At this point the conversation gets awkward and I decide keep my mouth shut. MS left and went off to her room. We stayed for a while and chatted with MIL and MS didn't come back out. The next day my husband mentions that he was talking to his mum and that MS was very upset at what I had said. MIL wanted my husband to talk to me and tell me to apologize to MS for ""being quiet rude as MS is doing her best"". Now I don't know what to do, am I an asshole for correcting MS? I can talk loudly but I never yelled or snapped at MS. I do have what I call ""resting bitch voice"" where somethings I say will sound way meaner, I try and do my best to not sound like a bitch but it happens.

TL;DR - my SIL is graduating and struggling to find a job and calls me ""blessed"" for having a job so I correct her saying I worked hard and got previous experience to be able to get my job then SIL goes silent and I hear the next day from MIL that I was mean to SIL and should apologize.",76,148,0.93
1668,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are both college students.  She lives in an apartment on her own and I live with my parents.

On Sunday, my girlfriend made homemade lasagna for our date night. She made everything from scratch, including the noodles. It was really good so after we finished I asked if I could take lasagna home for my family to try. She said yes.  When I left that night, I took the tray of lasagna with me. My girlfriend didn't walk me out so she didn't see me take the tray.

On Monday, I got a text from my girlfriend asking where her lasagna was. I told her I had taken it home for my family.  She said ""I thought you were going to take SOME... not the whole thing. I spent most of my food budget for the week on it with the intention to eat leftovers for the rest of the week. Now I don't know what I'm going to eat.""

1669,Not the A-hole,"I work at a restaurant as a manager.  Also for the record I am a non-smoker.  There are only a few employees that smoke, which are the older folks in the morning.  We also had a manager that smoked too, but recently left.  So now the only people that smoke in the restaurant are the few older employees in the morning.  It used to be a problem with the manager because he could sneak out every few hours to smoke.  I didn't like that because he left the store unattended.  The older folks will beg for a smoke break after lunch, and then go sit in their cars and smoke for a bit.  It's annoying, and I would sometimes give in for the sake of getting along.

With the manager who smoked gone, I thought it was time to institute a new smoking policy.  I wanted to enact this rule in fairness to all employees right now, and for the future.  Right now the rule is:

No smoking is permitted on the property at all.  This extends to any time before, during, or after your shift while you are in uniform.  If you are uniform and are smoking, you must leave the property to do so.  There are no more smoke breaks at the restaurant.  If you work long enough to get a break, you can use your break to smoke.  

I have a few reasons for this:

1) Fairness to other non-smoking employees.  It's not fair to allow some employees to take a short break and not work.  I feel this could be seen as favoritism towards certain employees, and that could cause others to feel resentment towards the management or the smokers.

2) Image and Look.  We work in a restaurant serving food.  Seeing someone smoke, or smelling someone reaking of smoke, could put someone off their meal.  I know it sure does for me.  We want to promote a fresh and clean image, and I think seeing someone smoke can ruin that image.

This isn't directed at any one employee in particular, it's just a good time because there aren't very many smokers right now.  Out of the 4 employees that smoke, I ran the idea past them.  2 of them are okay with it, and say it might give them a good excuse to quite.  One was upset but said they will deal with it.  The other is super upset and wanting to put in his two weeks.  He got all in my face saying it's discriminatory.

So here is the AITA part.  I am completely unsympathetic to smokers. I have never smoked in my life, nor will I.  I understand it's an addiction, but I don't think that's an excuse.  If I can go 5 hours without a cigarette, I think you should too.  I don't think it's discriminatory to say to a smoker that you can't take a smoke break for your 5 hour shift.  Tell me, am I the asshole for not allowing smoke breaks anymore and making it harder to smoke on our property?

So my father died yesterday morning.

I went No-Contact with him and that entire side of the family about 15 years ago and haven't looked back since. He was abusive to me, abusive to my mother, and abusive to my half-brother, who I don't really have nor want a relationship with. He was a violent drunk, and the son of a Nazi Officer during WWII. He was also known for having multiple girlfriends at multiple times, usually to take their money and feed his alcohol and tobacco addiction. He was a shit human being with no redeemable qualities. We will refer to him as Fritz.

Yesterday morning Fritz finally dropped of a heart attack, and we're all relieved and actually happy about it, like winning a lottery we didn't even realize we entered. But his girlfriend-of-the-year (who we will refer to as Jane) is pretty broken up about it. My mother reached out to Jane to wish her the best and express her condolences. Jane dropped a ""To tell the truth"" bomb, which she pined over the fact that my mother caused Fritz's two only sons to ""abandon"" him and wouldn't talk to him, especially in his time of need. She expressed regret over the fact that my half-brother and I never bothered to rebuild the relationship and meet the ""rest of the family"".

It was very obvious that my father filled Jane's head up with lies and played the ""poor me"" game the way he did his entire life. And my mother didn't appreciate playing the blame game when she was simply trying to be nice. So she responded:

>""Fritz had two different sons, 10 years apart, with two different women, in two different cities, in two different situations, and they both decided to cut off contact, and they both feel zero regret or grief. Perhaps if Fritz took some responsibility for his actions for once in his life, he wouldn't have felt so alone when he passed.""

Jane ended up sending a bunch of nasty messages before blocking my mother completely. So I sent a message to Jane,

>""Jane, I'm sorry for your loss. But you have known him for literally 1/25th of the time that I've known him. You do not get to comment on my or my brother's relationship with him. You don't get to pass judgment on what I chose to do after the trauma I experienced, and you certainly don't get to send nastygrams after we tried to offer condolences. We have no idea who you are, frankly, and we have no interest in learning. There is no ""rest of the family"", he was not part of the family and you certainly aren't either. If he lived for another two years, he would've had another two girlfriends. I understand you thought you were different because he never pushed you down the stairs or sunk his forearm around your throat, I understand you're hurt and that this is tough for you, but that does not make you a member of this family. Have a nice day, never contact us again.""

1673,Asshole,"I'm a new mom and get loads of packages delivered. I had handwritten signs that said ""Do not Knock"" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote ""Do not knock"" in every checkout cart that offered ""delivery options"" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.

UPDATE: I bought the sign on Amazon and would not have designed it to be so broadly worded.  I did not call or complain to anyone.  It's a really well reviewed sign so I don't think other people have had this cold dinner problem. Also, it says ""No soliciting, no exceptions"" as in absolutely no solicitors are allowed.  Not no deliveries.  And the ""other"" image shows a man with a briefcase who looks like a door-to-door salesman.  And ""all other deliveries"" is after logos of only couriers.  If it were for food delivery then you'd think it would also include a grubhub logo, seamless logo, image of a pizza, etc. Oh, and I'll definitely put up a post-it next time that says ""Food Deliveries Ok"".

1674,Not the A-hole,"So, right now I'm in kinda a shitty situation. I've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. All of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but I don't feel that way, heres the story.

I knew my ex for almost 10 years. We go back all the way to high school and have been friends. After we graduated I said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. We dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. I won't lie, I loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. She, however, seemed super worried. I sat down and talked with her about it. I told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy I would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. She was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

These past 7 months have been a roller coaster. She moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. That was until a few weeks ago. An old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. I was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. This guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. It turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. He is not lying about this. He sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. I was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. Along with this, he sent me a string of Facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because I make more money that the real father and she would rather I care for it.

Suffice to say, I was fucking pissed. I confronted her, she cried, I cried, it was a mess. In the end I broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. She's in the process of moving out now but I have not said a single word to her. I have pretty much told her that I want her out of my life. I also demanded a DNA test the minute the child is born. If it is mine, i'll help her support it. If not, then I am never seeing her again.

I've been cold to her. Her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but I've refused any contact with them. At one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and I kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. Any time she's tried to ""Reconcile"" i've shut it down,

My friends are saying i'm in wrong here. According to them she's pregnant and because of that I should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. I disagree fully. But I could be wrong. Am I letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",1451,24017,0.92
1675,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been married for 3 years and together for 2 before that. We live in Chicago and there’s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I’ll give it to one of them. Or I’ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She’ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. 

Anyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I’ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. 

A few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. 

Last night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. 

While we were eating she brought it up again. She said “you said you give about $125 a month right babe?” I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says “I outran you this week!” I didn’t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. 

Long story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.

I instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. 

She’s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. 

Now I’m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn’t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. 

EDIT: She gave $200 in one night. Remember this is the end of the month. She’s been giving away money the whole month already. 

Edit 2: Again, $200 plus everything she’s given over the course of March. Also we have a joint account. She has already been aware that I give money to the homeless whenever I can ",202,374,0.93

1680,No A-holes here,"Ok. I’m a single/divorced 31m teacher. BORING existence; work, grad school, laundry, etc. I had given up on dating in general. I have my shit together in the traditional sense; own my home, nice car, pretty content with my life. Just giving some backstory as to why I wasn’t interested in pursuing anyone necessarily, kinda comfortable with the occasional fling and that’s it. 

I have a friend with an older sister. She also has her shit together; owns a home, steady job, nice car, fun hobby, etc. I’ve just never viewed her as a potential partner. She made initial contact with me. Started texting daily, then it became every couple of hours, and eventually it was constant. She would best be described as a kinda plain/homely woman, and I’m not judging, I don’t exactly peak the look meter at a 10. It is known she’s never had a relationship, a date, a kiss, or anything else in between those. I began to slow down my responses to her texting as I realized she was probably viewing my friendliness as interest, and then I very directly made it known I wasn’t looking to date or have a relationship. I pumped the brakes hard. She took the hint, but would still text at least twice daily each day. 

Fast forward to a few months ago and I meet a woman, a former colleague, who I considered far out of my league, in multiple areas. She had apparently asked around for my number. We hit it off right away. Many of the same interests, outlooks on life, political viewpoints, etc. I was shocked. We took it slow, but it soon became apparent to both of us we had feelings for one another, so we’ve kinda moved into that weird relationship phase where it’s not really labeled, but it’s not just casual sex. All the while I’m still fielding texts from my buddy’s sister, but none of them are anything remotely indicative of interest in her. Just friendly texts every few days when I would respond to 2-3 days worth of her texts at one time. I also clearly indicated I was once again not looking for a relationship or interested in her. She’s been blowing up my phone the last few days as I have pumped the brakes pretty hard again, but, to reiterate, I haven’t implied or stated any interest in her at all. 

Things are getting more serious with the former colleague and that’s what I want for sure. I feel I’ve been pretty open about my intentions and not leading at all with my comments with my buddy’s sister. So..WIBTA if I simply “ghost” her? WIBTA if I just bluntly tell her that I’m dating someone, even though I’ve clearly stated I have no interest in a relationship? The implication of that being she wasn’t good enough for a relationship, which isn’t true, but I’m not looking for one with her.

We were walking around the mall and she saw that there was a Build-a-bear. She wanted to go in to see if she could get an outfit for her cousins bear. When we walked in, it was really crowded and I said “damn it’s way too busy in here to meet my soulmate today, let’s hit up Gap kids.”

Part of my job is going over applications for housing subsidies and government housing rentals as well as following up, checking status of applications, outstanding accounts, etc. Along with a slew of other employees, I make decisions whether an applicant can get subsidized housing or can continue to get it. There is *not much* leeway you can give but there is *some*. Why part of the process can be subjective I don't know, I just do my job.

My friend, single mother of two, is on subsidized housing. Her application came under review months ago and as luck would have it, it was my job to review it. Standard procedure is to recuse ourselves if a personal bias can appear, and I did so, but not before I took a look at her file first.

She was in arrears several months and the most recent inspection showed poor maintenance/upkeep of the property on her end. All signs pointed to possible eviction, but I had to recuse myself and handed it off to my superior who I guess delegated it to someone else. I don't know who.

She ended up being evicted and now lives in a shelter. I thought everything would be alright in the end but my friend made no attempt to solve her living arrangements issues. She insisted on ""fighting"" the eviction, ultimately doing nothing and hoping a miracle would happen. The government doesn't work this way.

We went out for coffee recently and through our conversation I let slip I saw her file and was going to work on it until I had to step aside and let someone else take over.

I just talked to my boyfriend and he said he definitely noticed my friend was being weird about it but he thought she was just teasing him. He was surprised to hear she was serious because, apparently, one of his friends made similar comments as a joke so he took my friend's comments the same way.

Also, he said he is a tiny little bit jealous... of my dance partner for dancing with such a gorgeous man. *swoon*

I'll be having a chat with my friend tomorrow. Hopefully she comes to her senses.

Thanks all for the comments and advice!



ORIGINAL POST:
I'm (25M) a dancer and a few weeks ago my dance group started preparing for a competition. I expressed my desire to compete in the couples' category to my mentor, and she asked me if I'd already thought of a partner and if I wanted them to be male or female. I didn't even think of this detail because I assumed she would just assign a female partner to me. But she asked me and I figured it would be cool to have a male partner. I chose one, he agreed and we've been practicing for about 2 weeks.

Here's the thing. My dance partner is gay and I'm gay and I have a boyfriend (together for 1.5 years). My boyfriend didn't seem too worried about this, however, my best friend was appalled when she heard I was DANCING with another MAN several times a week. She told me I was an asshole for actually choosing to have a male partner when given the choice. If I was assigned a male partner, then fine, but according to her, choosing a male partner is unacceptable, shitty-boyfriend-behavior. She is also convinced that my boyfriend is pretending to be cool about it because in her opinion he is ""too cool about it"", so she has *casually* started asking him *subtle* questions about it. He usually just jokingly changes the topic.

I'm starting to get paranoid because 1.5 years isn't that long and even though I think I know my boyfriend well, I guess there is a chance he's pretending to not mind. I have no idea what to think anymore. AITA?



Edit: Apparently, I'm not the asshole but I feel like one after seeing that the top voted comment is about my friend being a toxic human being. This is my first serious relationship ever and she's never had one so that might explain her weird and over-the-top reaction. To label her whole entire personality as toxic based on this incident is ridiculous. I only wanted to know who the asshole is, not for people to psychoanalyze someone they know one thing about.",222,1779,0.95

I'm 26, so there's not that huge a difference and as such he's kinda seen me as the cool uncle or whatever. He's a great kid, but I know he struggles with girls since he's shy and too nice, so I sat him down and gave him a few words of advice:

* If she rejects you, move on. She means nothing and you're better off not having her around
* Respect a no, and then block them
* Keep multiple balls in the air, so you always have a fall-back, and a better chance of success overall
* Don't waste your time or her's with games and friendship shit, cut to the point and conserve your time

Anyway my nephew apparently took this to heart and told my sister about what I told him, and she is FURIOUS, telling me I'm teaching him to be a psychopath, and to not respect women. I asked her what *she* had told him and it was basically some ""make friends with girls and maybe, perhaps eventually you'll get a girl"" type shit, and I sort of laughed at the thought that this is what she told him.

1690,Asshole,"Alright, let me preface this:

My problem with the 0-10 rating system is that it's only good for judging physical appearance, but takes nothing else into account. This is a huge problem, people themselves aren't numbers.

Being that my scale only judges physical appearance, I tried to make it an objective, realistic scale that can apply to every human being all at once to eliminate as many inconsistencies as possible. In my mind, the vast majority of the people you meet are going to fall in the range of 5-7. Using this scale, I rate myself a 5.5.

This is my personal (physical appearance only) 0-10 rating system. Use your imagination to fill nuances within the given ranges, as it's not strictly limited to integers:

&#x200B;

>**0-2:** I'm sorry. These are truly unfortunate people that are overtly deformed, or have gotten themselves into terrible accidents.  
>  
>  
>  
>**3-4:** Have hope, they just need to try harder. These people are what you would call ""plain"", or they have a few unattractive features that are hard to ignore.  
>  
>  
>  
>**5-7:** 90% of the population. Attractive enough to have more than a few romantic partners in life if they so please, but aren't attractive enough to skate by on their looks alone. This is the biologically dominant group. Attractive within reason, if you will.  
>  
>  
>  
>**8:** Well above average. This is where (what incels call) ""Chads"" and ""Stacies"" live. Could model for local stores as a side gig, or have a reasonably profitable snap chat premium.  
>  
>  
>  
>**9**: High end models that make a fortune from their looks.  
>  
>  
>  
>**10:** Reserved for legendarily attractive people. Only a few of these people have existed across time, so don't bother trying to get to this level.

We were at dinner, and I was telling her about how the typical 1-10 scale can be fixed to be more accurate (as I mentioned before, 1-10 scales are dumb). Then she asked me what I would rate her.

Well I pride myself on not being a liar, so I told her she's a 7, the higher end of biological majority. She didn't seem to take this well, I think that she had trouble separating this scale from other people's scales (ones where ""10"" is thrown about without care).

&#x200B;

It's one of those damned if you do damned if you don't situations. I think number scales are dumb, so I just shouldn't mention them because obviously the people I love are going to ask where they fall and the number is going to sound bad, even though it isn't.

1691,Not the A-hole,"Throw away because some people I know in real life know about my real reddit account.

When I was 16 I got diagnosed with PDD-NOS (a form of autism). If I say so myself (and what I hear from many others as well), you usually don't really notice that I have a form of autism aside from some social difficulties, which is why it went unnoticed for majority of my life. I'm 20 now.

Now the problem is, ever since my diagnose my father finds the need to tell everyone he knows or meet about my autism. And I mean literally \*everyone\*. Even people I don't even know or know who I am. Even when the conversation has nothing to do with autism in the slightest he still finds a way to tell people about it. Now let me get this clear, I'm not ashamed of having what I have and I usually do tell people about it after I've known them for a while. It's just that in this society there's such a negative stigma on having autism and a lot of people don't understand it. I just want people to know me for who I am instead of knowing me for my disability.

So last time I told him that I'd rather not have him telling other people about it. My problems are mine and mine alone and I don't want him to use it as a subject of conversation without my permission. Especially not with people who are complete strangers to me.

So yesterday, after one of my Computer Science classes, I was walking back to my dorm with a friend and he just blatently told me that 'I didn't look good with the feminine clothing and it makes him uncomfortable', I got kinda angry at this point and snapped at him, saying something along the lines of ""It doesn't affect you directly"" and ""I just wanted to be more comfortable with myself"". Now he's pissed at me, and not talking to me at all. Some of my other friends have heard what happened and have opted to his side, probably because he altered what I said.

&#x200B;

I feel like IATA just because I could have settled the matter better than instantly getting pissy at him, and just talked to him civilly about why I wanted to wear things like this.

I wondered if cutting ties with him after high school would be an a-hole move. In the comments, people suggested that I talk with my father heavily about our relationship. This is what happened. Also, sorry for bad format, I'm on mobile. 

I decided to sit down with my dad and explained to him how I felt about everything. The yelling, the consistent blaming for his wrongs, and him making light of my serious relationship. We talked for a solid two minutes before he scoffed and said that I was overreacting. I got angry, but kept my cool and continued. After ten minutes, he laughed and told me to stop acting like a baby. This tipped me over the edge and I stood up, telling him to shut his mouth for once. I yelled everything at him, all the specific times I could remember of him mentally abusing me. I told him that he couldn't get it through his thick skull that I was hurt by him. He went around the table and grabbed my arm, he raised his hand and treated to hit me. I told him to do it, and see what happens. Instead, he shoved me back and as I was walking away, trying to diffuse the situation he muttered that I was a mistake. I turned and pushed him, causing him to stumble and he grabbed me, tossed me across the room, not airborne of course, and told me to get out of his house.

1695,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for almost 13 years and have had no problems sleeping together in the same bed until I fell pregnant with our son in 2016. My pregnancy made me more sensitive to sound and seemed to coincide with my husband starting to breathe heavily and then to snore.

For most of my pregnancy my husband refused to accept that there was an issue. During that time I tried earplugs (so many different brands and materials). None of them blocked the sound of him snoring. I also found the sound of my own breathing and heartbeat irritated me further. I tried listening to music, Audiobooks and white noise. I could still hear him. Finally I started to move to the then spare room. I could still hear him through the wall but it was a vast improvement. 

My husband hated me moving and made it as difficult as possible to do so. My mum gave me a mattress for the spare room so he moved my daughter into that room to prevent me from using it. He says he struggled to sleep if I'm not beside him. 

Our son was born in September. I then had to contend with snoring and a newborn waking up throughout the night. After around 6 months my husband tried a couple of snoring remedies with very little success. I found myself on the sofa, more often than not with a newborn. My sleep deprivation got so bad that I wanted to die.

Finally my husband realised how much I was suffering after I told him I didn't want to be alive anymore. For the past 4 weeks he's slept on the sofa with the odd night of him attempting to share a bed with me. On those nights I'm usually on the sofa by 10:30pm having given up on trying to sleep beside him when he's snoring within 10 minutes of getting into bed. We no longer have a spare room as my son is in there. 

He tells me it'll get better that we'll work it out, that I need to think about it more positively but after more than two years of this I've had enough. I don't want to try anymore because when I do I end up having to move and find it difficult to get back to sleep. I would rather sleep in separate beds permanently. My husband hates the idea of us not sharing a bed and makes me feel guilty for feeling the way I do. I

She hasn’t heard of the band before. And put no effort in discovering them. That’s fine, but I told her part of the ViP package was meeting the band. I ultimately told her they were a conceptual metal band and a lot of their songs had a certain level of campiness to them. I think she took that too seriously.

Tonight is the show and last night we were texting what we were wearing. She sends me a hot topic Harley Quinn dress. I just don’t get why people idolize her so much. Since i really am nervous for this whole event i don’t want to look stupid, or be associated with it.

1706,Not the A-hole,"Last year, my sister got married. She and her husband both finished their degrees in what will be a very lucrative field. They both landed jobs in a city they like and plan to stay there for a while. They didn't want to move into an apartment, then move again in a year or so, so they asked some family members for money toward a down payment on a house. As they will both be making good money in the next year or so, and they had a good budget plan, my husband and I gave them some money with the understanding they would pay it back within a year or two (which they are doing). I didn't spread it around, but my sister's very open with our parents and she mentioned it to them. This wouldn't have been an issue, except:

Earlier this month, my brother got in a car accident. He's fine, no one was hurt any worse than a few bruises, but his car was totaled. My mom thinks I should give him money to help him get a new (or new to him) car, because he won't be able to afford one otherwise. I consulted my husband, and we're in complete agreement. We refused. We don't want to do this for a few reasons.

&#x200B;

1. This would be a gift, not a loan. There would not be a question of repayment. That makes this an entirely different situation.
2. This is the sixth (I think) car accident my brother and his wife have been in during the last five years.
3. This is the fourth car he and his wife have totaled between them, and I don't see their driving habits improving any time soon. We don't want to throw good money after bad.
4. My brother hasn't asked. My mom asked (well, suggested. Strongly suggested).

1710,Asshole,"*Heads up-- some folks my find this a little gross because it involves anal sex and shit*

I (M, 25) have been hooking up with a friend of mine (M, 29) on and off for a while now. We've both been pretty explicit about the fact that we are friends with benefits, and nothing more. Just in case you need context for our relationship.

He came over to my place and we started to have sex. For the uninitiated, sometimes the recipient of anal sex needs to prepare by cleaning out their rectum (not always necessary if you have the right diet for the record). He told me he was prepared, so we went at it, and one thing leads to another, and I look down and see his shit squirted out a little. In the process the fitted sheet came undone, so there was shit on my sheet and the mattress itself. In all fairness, it wasn't a lot, and it was pretty diluted by the lube. Still though, pretty gross.

When I saw what happened, I was instantly turned off. I told him ""hey, I think I'm done"" and he looked down and started apologizing. I told him it's okay, and it happens, but at the same time I was gagging, almost dry heaving, at the sight of it. So I ran over to my closet and tossed him a towel and asked him to clean it up. I couldn't even look so I told him I'd meet him in the shower when he was done.

He joined me in the shower and we made out a bit, but we didn't do anything sexual beyond that. We hung out for a bit after that and watched tv, but I could tell he was uncomfortable. Eventually he got home and then texted me saying how embarrassed he was. I told him that there was nothing to be embarrassed about and that was that.

I washed my sheets thoroughly in hot water, and that definitely took care of any germs or stains. My mattress cover was plastic though, so it wasn't washable. I went out to buy a new one. When I did, I texted this guy asking if he would be okay paying for it. It only cost $8. Then he responded ""Wow, over eight dollars? I said I was sorry. Didn't realize it was such a big deal to you."" I felt bad about putting him on the spot like that so I said ""How about you just buy me a drink next time we go out?"" He responded ""I don't know if I want to go out again. You really made me feel like shit over a normal bodily function. I was so embarrassed."" And that was that...

I get he was embarrassed, but I feel like he's overreacting here. Am I way off base?

**tl;dr:** The guy I'm hooking up with got his shit on my mattress cover. He was really embarrassed and my reaction clearly didn't help the situation. I asked him to pay for a new one, and he said I was being petty because it didn't cost a lot.",50,42,0.82

So I have celiac disease an autoimmune disease where when I eat gluten it will trigger an immune response in my small intestine and damages the small intestines lining (villis). Celiac disease is different for everybody and everybody can have different symptoms, For me since I had a late diagnosis I have harsh symptoms (and gall bladder disease and anemia) Like bowel issues, vomiting, gall bladder attacks and seizures. I am extremely careful when it comes to eating out at places because I get very sick. And a small note that celiac disease is NOT an allergy like a lot of people assume, it is an autoimmune disease.

Now I get to the story, So I went to Tim Hortons one day for lunch with my friend and as most people with celiac disease or people who just don't eat gluten when we go out there is not a ton of options for us at restaurants and fast food places. So I ordered a salad with no croutons and I told them I have celiac (and explained my restrictions as gluten) which usually tells the people to be careful because some people like me who have celiac really rough can get very sick from cross contamination. My friend ordered a bagel and her bagel was made first, So i'm waiting for my salad and i'm watching the Tim Hortons worker make it and i watch her cut up the bacon and make my entire salad using the dirty bread cutting board and the bread knife, so my salad had bread crumbs all over it. The lady handed me the salad and I asked her ""Hey I'm sorry but I have celiac disease and I just watched you make this salad on the bread cutting board and it'll make me sick if i eat this, by any chance could you remake this?"" And she had an obviously annoyed face by me asking her this and told me ""It's an allergy you will be fine"" and shoved the salad my way. This got me extremely angry and upset since I have had a ton of bad experiences with my disease and cross contamination and I (edit, not a full blown scream, I raised my voice a tad than my usual quiet voice definitely not a scream like some are thinking) and said ""It's a disease that is serious, not an allergy and i can get extremely sick and have gall bladder attacks and seizures from gluten and i'm not going to risk it by eating this that you improperly made, you don't know what my reactions are and I would appreciate it if I could either get a refund or this remade"". She didn't say a word and threw the salad in the garbage and proceeded to make me a new one while another co worker of hers who overheard the whole conversation showed her how to make it safely.

1729,Everyone Sucks,"Backstory:

I am an 18-year-old college student. My college has been taking a huge mental and physical toll on me due to the workload and my family's expectations of me. Their expectations being: I'm supposed to get my Bachelor's degree by the time I'm 21. During this time, I need a part-time job and I need to babysit my two nephews for the next few years while my sister gets a full-time job. As I am not perfect in my father's eyes, he constantly has to make loud and condescending complaints about me.

Tonight at dinner, my dad started his complaining about me yet again. He finally states, ""I think you need to get a J-O-B."" As this continues to be a common re-occurrence, I finally snap and say, ""You don't understand how hard college is because you didn't go."" He then starts getting extremely angry, complaining about the lack of respect he gets. My sister called me an asshole because of the rude comment, whereas my mother just asked me why I couldn't ignore him.

1730,Not the A-hole,"So some back story, I was in Ecuador for school for 2 weeks. It was kinda stressful and definitely took a lot out of me.

 When I was coming home, my girlfriend asked if she could come over, I said yes, but I don't want to do anything crazy I just want to relax and have some downtime since I'd basically been doing things non stop for the past 2 weeks in Ecuador. Then she asks if my friend could come over as well because I live with my sister and she had been trying to set my sister and my friend up for a couple weeks. At first I said no because I knew I would be tired from traveling and plus I was stressed because I had gotten behind on a lot of work and my friend was not a very relaxed person, he is more of a do all kinds of crazy shit kinda person, breaking things and me constantly having to stop him from doing something stupid. But she pleaded and pleaded and said that if he came over she would help control him and that we wouldn't have to do anything too exciting we could just hang out on the porch etc. 

Anyway the day finally comes and so I get home and I see every one and then I go and sit down on the couch to relax cause I'd just been flying for roughly 16 hours. Everyone immediately starts ragging on me about how I'm being boring and I'm usually not like this and how we have to do something exciting. I look to my girlfriend because I thought she would step in to help me but no, she starts saying the same things and saying that I'm being a buzzkill. I tried to defend myself to no avail. Then, when I tried to talk to my girl, she won't talk to me because I wasn't excited enough to see her. By this point I was pretty pissed and when I unpacked a 110 dollar rum I had bought in Ecuador, every one flocked to me asking for a drink. But as I said I was pretty mad so I said no, there is beer in the fridge. My girlfriend cried because I was being mean but I honestly just felt betrayed. 

Was I a bit extreame? I felt that my actions were justified as I had previously told her multiple times I didn't want to do anything too insane.",16,88,0.97

1733,Not the A-hole,"So I live in an area in NYC with alot of russian immigrants, and I myself moved here with my family when I was 14.  I am currently 19 and I work at a retail store, where several other employees, maybe 5% of the employees, are also native Russians or Ukrainian and its easier to communicate with in russian, sometimes in the break room and sometimes at the registers or in the back storage, basically most of my friends who work there and while working we speak russian.  

Now two days ago me and several other employees got a warning from management that stated that we "" are creating uncomfortable environment for customers and coworkers"" and ""Trusts our ability"" to communicate with each other and customers in English. She also mentioned that we effectively are creating ""exclusionary zones"" and has caused complaints and also something about political sensitivities of other workers. She also said she didnt care what we said off-duty or off the premises, but while on company groud we would now be required to communicate in English. 

&#x200B;

Now when talking to my other workers about this, one mentioned how he was told by a manager something along the lines of that often we would laugh while talking in Russian, and that other people would feel that us russian speakers are laughing at somebody else .

&#x200B;

We never would be in a group conversation with non speakers and just switch to talk in code or to make secret roasts about other people, we mostly talked in russian as its easily for alot of us and for some other workers. my opinion right now is that this is bs and unfair but i am open to discussion",50,100,0.95

1735,Asshole,"I'm a freshman, and at the beginning of the year, I was a completely different person: shy, bo friends, could not talk to girls, overly jealous of people, etc. At this time, among other clubs/sports, i joined mock trial. Being a freshman, I was automatically sent to the jv team. At the end of every year, the JV team has tryouts to see if you're good enough to make varsity. Another girl on the jv team was this girl, let's call her Morgan, who's a junior. My first thought upon seeing her is that, hey, she's pretty cute. But being my shy self, I really kept my feelings to myself. Plus, shes's a junior and I'm a freshman.

But as the school year went on, I became more confident. This was due to playing sports, making new friends through these sports, and learned to talk to girls.

So by this point in the year, I was pretty confident. And last week, it just suddenly hit me: hey, I can talk to Morgan now! So what's the problem? Last week was literally the last meeting for mock trial. So that meant I'd have to wait till next year before flirting with her. But during the meeting, the president mentioned, we have tryouts for next year in three weeks- we try out now instead of, say, the beginning of next year, since mock trial is fresh in our mind. This sparked an idea in my mind: I had so many opportunities to talk to Morgan- which I didn't take, since I was shy- because we were on the same team: we confer twice a week during meetings, meet up every weekend, and such. And next year, I wanted those same opportunities so I can flirt with her. *But*, I only really have these opportunities if we're both on the same team. I know that 95% I was going to make varsity (people on varsity told me), but Morgan had a pretty bad showing and was most likely going to stay on jv. And that's bad: if I'm varsity and she's jv, no meetings, no meetups outside school, and far fewer opportunities in general. So, my idea was this: if I met up every weekend, I could coach her so she might do well in the tryouts and make it to varsity. I think it's an overall win-win situation: 1) we help each other- I help her practice for the tryouts, and she (although to a lesser extent) helps me 2) I help her get into varsity, which means more chances to flirt next year and 3) if I feel like it, I might even have chances to flirt with her during our meetups on the weekend.

Our first meeting went well, and I flirted with her a little. I mentioned this to my friend, but he seemed upset I wasn't helping her out of the goodness of my heart. I just replied, whether I'm doing it for a good reason or not (and I think good here is subjective), I'm still helping her. So since I'm really not hurting her, and am instead helping her, I'm in the right here. He didn't seem to agree.

1736,Not the A-hole,"So every since I've moved to Texas, my neighbor has never really talked to us or even acknowledged us. She has 2 big dogs that she keeps in her fenced house. However, she does a shit job at keeping it locked. The dogs get out often, resulting with them going onto my property and shiting in my back yard. One of them bit my dad in the leg before, but he simply gave a warning to my stupid neighbor.
Unfortunately, what we anticipated occured unexpectedly.
My 2 small dogs were in my backyard, and one of them went to my front yard to sunbathe. My dad was washing dishes and watching her through the window. What he didn't see were the two dogs who had bad intentions.
They both began to attack my dog, partly skinning her back and digging into her organs. My dad kicks the front door open and tells them to scram but they had her in their mouths. She was yelping in pain. He went inside for the gun but at that point my other neighbor got the dogs inside and locked their gate.
We immediately took her to the vet and she stayed overnight.
My poor dog unfortunately died on Saturday due to internal damage. My neighbor just shrugged and didn't make an effort to at least lock her gate.
We talked to animal control and they can't do anything unless we have evidence her dogs were out. He did say however, that if we feel endangered for our family (including my baby siblings and dog), that we should do whatever we can to defend ourselves, including shooting the dog(s).
 Both dogs pooped on the same spot they killed my dog, possibly as a taunt to my other dog. They have tried hurting her too. She is all we have and I cannot lose my other dog.

I was super dead tired today, so tired that I fell asleep as soon as I came home from school. We always discuss things we (usually I) make for dinner the day before and share the recipe/dish we want to make with each other. (We planned on making a Indian potatoes with chickpeas today. It has 5 ingredients and tbh...it's not hard to make. You basically toss everything in a pan and add some cream afterwards...) Now I was SO tired (just finished and mandatory 20 page assignment yesterday) that I fell asleep at 3pm and slept till 10pm. We I woke up he was super mad at me, he told me that there would be no dinner today, because the potatoes aren't cooked through yet. I then asked him whether or not he has been cooking potatoes first before he tossed them into the pan (low-medium heat) with the other ingredients.  I did say that it's a pretty known fact that (unless stated otherwise) one should always cook the potatoes first.

He went from mad to being straight up terrifying, he told me that I should have told him. (The recipe sadly didn't state it explictly) That I would be the one at fault. That I now successfully fucked his diet. That it was my fault that he is ending up hungry and that I wasted 2 hours of his time he could have used to do something better. He also told me I was supposed to answer if he asks me something that being asleep is no excuse. When I said ""Sorry... I was sleeping."" he kicked his chair over and proceeded to continuously kick and step on it for about 30secs.

So....AITA? I do have to say tho, I didn't do a lot these past months due to depression (and then having to catch up one months worth of school) and he has been helping me out more than usual lately.

The case is, I have high-functioning autism. However, it's on the border of not being autism, so nobody except my really close family and girlfriend notice. 

My mother really wishes to help me, and I've been to various forms of counsel, but this is a couple of years back.

I've always wanted to join the military, but the Danish Armed Forces won't allow people with autism. Therefore I've asked my doctor to do a reevaluation, as I've changed quite a lot during recent years.

Bringing all this back to AITA, my mother blames all the things I do differently than her on my autism, and she used to always mention it to strangers, but I got her to stop.

Today my girlfriend and I had a fight, because I thought she was being hypocritical. I was visibly upset, and I discovered my mom and girlfriend discussing my autism, especially relating to our fight. I just can't help but feel like a test subject, where everything I do is autistic. However, I totally understand my girlfriend's desire to know more about my case, and I'm grateful for it. I just really hate my diagnosis, because it's in the way for all of my dreams, so I'd just like it buried and hopefully gone after the reevaluation.

I'm 28 and don't drive. I wanted to go see one of my best friends in Tampa, Fl (35 minutes from where I live). I wanted to be the least inconvenience as possible, so if I were to get a ride I wanted to be where people were going to be anyways. I got some friends who wanted to see her to take me up, hang out, and drop me off for a few days, and My sister, who said she would be in Tampa anyways, agreed to pick me up on her way back home. I confirmed multiple times and would have planned another week if she could not. But she said it was fine and everything was set. I've been up for three days, and the day before she was supposed to get me our cousin gets in an accident and doesnt want to see my sister, so she decides to cancel everything and doesnt want to get me. I know I have other ways down, but I feel, personally, betrayed and highly annoyed that she can just brush me off like that. But the thing is, if shes not going to be up, should she feel obligated to get me?

I know I should be driving at my age, but I never needed to, so I wanted this to work for everyone, not just me.

But I just need to know if im being a prick for still expecting her to drive 30 minutes to not leave me in Tampa with a 70$ Lyft Bill.

She said she wants to get me and I told her I'll add credit towards her ""personal uber account"" equal to the amount or greater, depending on our mood haha, it would have costed to Uber.

We had a big laugh, we are reluctantly nice again, and I cant thank everyone enough for helping me. You guys are wonderful and honest and more people would benefit from imput like that.

1745,Not the A-hole,"Hi all

Just a bit of context recently i lost my nan who was the primary carer for my uncle whose 37 and has Down's Syndrome.

In response to this my mom has had to pick up the pieces and start caring for my uncle, she has always maintained the position that should something ever happen to my Nan she would always take of my uncle. She has since moved into my nan's house and that's that.

Its worth adding that my Mom has two other adult siblings, my aunt and their older brother. Neither of which have expressed any inclination to care for my uncle now or ever and don't want to take any responsibility.

The problem i have right now is that my mom wants to make me a legal guardian and carer for my uncle should anything happen to her. This would make me responsible for his well being, health, finances etc. Essentially whats expected from a parent looking after a child.

Due to the age of both my mom and my uncle it is inevitable someone will have to care for my uncle after my mom for potentially 20+ years. Thing is she never asked me if this was what i wanted, she just assumed i would care for him no questions asked. When i told her i wanted more time and didn't want to commit to anything just yet, She screamed at me, said i was a selfish \*\*\*\* and put the phone down on me. I haven't spoken to her in 12 hours or so and i can't stop thinking about it.

Of course i love my uncle to bits and would never want to see him end up in the system/sheltered accommodation but the thought of having to care for an older adult with learning difficulties and health conditions scares me, i'm only 23 and still in uni myself. I had plans to move abroad, go travelling etc. Things i wouldn't be able to do if i had to care for my uncle full time.

I mean if the chips were down and no one else came forward, i would do it. But i would be saying goodbye to my life to care for someone else's.

AITA for not wanting to jump into the fray straight away? Is this something that should be expected of me, even though there are far older members of the family in a better position than me?  Should i accept there are things in life we can't change and this is one of them?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

After reading all your comments and mulling it over for a couple of hours i can safely say i'm not ready for this responsibility. My life would be completely different, i only just got comfortable with the direction its heading now and i would have so much to lose. Having to care for my uncle would be so much work, which i don't feel i'm prepared for. I know i wouldn't be happy and my uncle deserves far better than that.

&#x200B;

I won't be signing as my uncles guardian.

&#x200B;

I'm going to tell my mom that i can't sign and that shes wrong to expect me to do so. We've always had a close relationship but this is a bridge too far and is something we have to disagree on and will more than likely push us apart. I guess whatever happens will happen and if she can't understand my point of view then ill have to accept that and move on.

 If we are still on speaking terms i'm going to try and propose bringing my mom's siblings into the discussion to look at other options for my uncles care. But in all honestly i'm not sure how well that would work.

Well his girlfriend found out about it and understandably flipped out because they were talking about how she's not 100% happy in her marriage and how he was going to come through and see her while he was on his haul. He's a truck driver. Anyway she got into it with his girlfriend and I understand that she lives in a remote area but she could find better things to do with her time then stirring up drama with other people.

She's saying someone shared screenshots with her ex's girlfriend about stuff that she was saying. I told her to talk to me about something else that she had posted about on Facebook last night while I said that she could. Then she comments I would suspend I need to know that you're not the one that was sharing the screenshots with his girlfriend. I said first of all I would never do that and secondly it hurts me that you would think I would do that to you because you're family.

What I really wanted to say to her was well maybe if you stop stirring up drama you wouldn't have these problems. If you know that a man is attached then leave him alone ex or not. Especially because he's an ex. I feel that she has nothing better to do but the spend her days engaged in bullshit and drama with other people. I can totally understand her ex's girlfriend being upset. 

But yet she seems to think that she's not in the wrong here. First of all I feel like she is doing stuff behind her husband's back that she wouldn't want him knowing about it and secondly she's holding her ex's girlfriend responsible when in reality it's her fault. Also, I'm not too happy because it seems like she's not spending enough time worried about her kids and instead is worried about what everyone on Facebook is doing. Stop worrying about that Facebook drama and start spending more time with your kids.

I was unsure about how bad and even asked if walking around a lot (our double date required a lot of walking) was going to be OK. I was told sure, no problem. During the date, I’m being nice, trying to get to know her and all I could really get to know about her is her illness, she doesn’t work or go to school. Now, I also have a chronic illness, it’s in remission but nonetheless, I can relate and am aware that some illnesses are invisible. However, it did put me off a little that as soon as I introduced myself, she went right into talking about her illness.

Before he met her, he had plans to start a clothing line and seemed excited about it. Few weeks after the date, just me and my friend are hanging out, and I told him that while she seemed nice, I was concerned about some things, mainly that she didn’t work or go to school and that may interfere with his plans/life. I am admittedly a skeptical person and can be distrusting, and everything I was seeing, and hearing was contradictory, so I did mention that it seemed odd that she was drinking (despite being on many medications) and that she was fine to walk around for a few hours. Another example, I was told their sex life is fine and they have no issues with it, she has no pain during.

I also expressed concern about him taking on such a big responsibility of essentially a caretaker and that it may hinder his clothing line goals and other things in his life (for example, he complained he was gaining weight now even though he’s always been big into working out). He was very appreciative and grateful for watching out for him and basically praised me for being a great friend. Flash forward to present, I find out that my friend told his girlfriend what I said, taking it out of context and saying I said she was faking her illness and that I did not believe her – not mentioning anything else I said. He also said he doesn’t need my concern, he’s a grown man. He was also upset that “why would I even question her because sometimes she can’t even walk up the stairs.” Now he’s upset he’s the middle man and thinks me and her need to talk about it. I asked him if he could connect us again so I could explain and apologize. Thinking it over though, I feel like I don’t owe an apology because he shouldn’t have told her those things to cause this rift between us. Also, I didn’t even say the things he says I said, so I wouldn’t even know what I would be apologizing for. AITA? Should I actually apologize?

&#x200B;

Edit: ITA. I sent an apology email to my friend for giving him unsolicited advice and that I want to apologize to the gf for making her feel judged and bringing illness into question at all. I also mentioned that I wish he would have come to me first if there was concern or offense.  
Edit2: All for not, apology didn't even matter. He didn't think my apology was genuine and ended our multiple year-long relationship. Thanks for all the feedback, though, it really did change my perspective. ",17,51,0.92
1752,No A-holes here,"I’m a 23 year old male. I’ve been dealing with severe Hashimoto’s, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, chronic insomnia, and POTs syndrome for the last 4 years. I was a former college football player with a bright future. I had several surgeries in a row to correct some cartilage injuries. The health issues started after the surgeries. 

My dating life has been mostly non-existent for the last few years because I just don’t have the fucking physical/mental energy to date. Around New Years Eve, I met a girl from Tinder for drinks. We had a great time and have been dating the last several months. 

Over the last 3 weeks, my health has declined severely as a result of me over-exerting myself between work, dating, and life in general. 

I feel numb, flat, and just totally apathetic. My girlfriend noticed something was wrong over the last several weeks. I tried explaining my health issues to her. I told her that dark, low energy phases like this are common for me. She said she understood and was fully supportive, but still asks me to go out drinking, dancing, etc... when I really only have the energy to lay around her apartment. 

Yesterday, I told her I needed a 4 week break to simply focus on my health and recharge. She was heartbroken. She told me she doesn’t expect me to come back, but that she cares and wants me to get healthy. I’m so torn.

1754,Asshole,"Hey guys. Please hear me out before making a judgement - I know it sounds awful. 

I was with my ex girlfriend (I'm a girl too) for 8 years. In the last year, we had a baby. It was a mutual thing but she carried the baby, etc. 

I was never too sure about having kids until recently and I decided I'd love to have a family with her. 

She was always afraid of having a child because her mother and aunty and grandma all suffered from a severe post-natal depression. But, she powered through. 

She gave birth to a baby boy who was biologically hers and a sperm donor. She funded the whole thing with her savings and I was there throughout the birth. 

About 6 months after our child was born, we broke up. It was mainly because I did not want to be tied down so young, all kinda stuff like that. It was mainly my choice but she understood and accepted it gracefully. 

We stayed pretty friendly. 

I realised a few months later what a mistake I'd made and I tried to reach out. I practically begged her to take me back. She refused. 

I begged her to let us be a family (I'm the legal parent too as I adopted our baby after birth) and she said no, that at the time she was heartbroken but that I was right and she'd met another girl who she was dating. 

We fell out. I was heartbroken and I was angry. 

We stopped talking but she'd occasionally reach out asking me to see her son.

We met for coffee and I told her if she wants to be single and explore herself then I need that chance too. 

I told her I didn't want to see her but would have my kid on Friday nights. She said that was fine. 

She then broached the subject of child support and said she had funded everything and hadn't received a penny off me. She said that she wanted reliable child support and help from me. I told her that's fine. I sent her her first load of money and the next day I had our son and I saw that she'd gone out drinking and to the cinema with her new girlfriend. 

We got into a big argument and I told her that I'm not sending her any more money as she was just spending it on herself. She said that in 2 years I'd only paid £150, she's paid everything else so if she wants to go out, she can. She then threw in my face that I'd been on holidays and stuff. 
I said when I have my son on the Friday, I'll buy him whatever he needs, feed him, etc but that she had to cover the rest. She said I'm an asshole, so AITA?

It will be at her grandmother's Ranch and it seems like a pretty nice wedding. 

here is where the issue started. 

a few months ago me and 3 friends decided to plan a trip to Australia to backpack/sightsee for 2 weeks, the trip starts 2 days before the wedding so we can't go. G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. 
she is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. 

all of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not)

1757,Not the A-hole,"So the other day I went to a Korean BBQ place that is super popular where I live. There a little expensive but honestly really good. There always busy so the crew is in a rush to push people through as fast as possible. Well, when I went I ordered my usual. When I got to the cashier I asked for  medium drink with it. I payed and was handed my food. I asked for my drink and he told me that I didn't order one even though it did. He misheard me and added something else to my order that I did not want. When I corrected him he did not apologize and only told me that they gave me what I had payed for and if I wanted a drink I would have to pay for it. I told him that I didn't want what was added and did not ask for it but he did not budge.

I was a little mad but I payed for a drink and left. The place uses square so I left negative feedback on both purchases and said I was charged for something I didn't want and was not offered and compensation. Well, today the owner reached out to me. He refunded my drink and the added thing to my order and apologized. He said he talked to the cashier and that ""the problem had been dealt with"".

1758,Not the A-hole,"So basically I met this girl on Tinder, and we instantly had an amazing connection. I've met lots of people off the app and I can tell you, I've never wanted someone as badly as I wanted her before actually meeting IRL. Due to life circumstances getting in the way, we chatted non-stop for 2 weeks. Conversations about everything, our traumas, hopes and dreams, our childhood stories, our secrets... Needless to say, I was falling for her HARD and I was super anxious to meet up. The night before our first date I could hardly fall asleep, and she felt the exact same way about me. 

&#x200B;

Also, it's worth mentioning that we had been sexting really hardcore for days before our date, and basically there was the assumption that we would absolutely ravish each other the second we met. She was really forward and sexually agressive in her communication with me. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to our date, and the first moments go exactly as I had been dreaming about those previous weeks. We're really into each other and started making out, and that's when I noticed she had a penis. I stopped everything and I asked her ""so you're trans?!"", and she basically said that we had such a special connection, she was afraid of telling me earlier because she didn't want to ruin things and that since I am bisexual, she assumed I wouldn't mind. 

&#x200B;

I was instantly floored. Despite being bisexual, I am not sexually attracted by transwomen at all. It has nothing to do with not viewing them as real women, but there's something about the idea of a woman with a dick that's just offputting for me and it's totally not my thing. I then instantly made some distance between us, I was respectful to her at all times but I told her I needed to go home and process all this information before I could truly have any reaction. On my drive home I started getting really mad - if we hadn't been sexting, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, she doesn't owe me anything. But the fact that we were obviously going to fuck, how could she hide something like that from me and not give me the right to know beforehand? I feel really stupid for having constructed this fairy tale in my head for 2 whole weeks because she didn't bother to tell me this obviously relevant fact. It was a terrible feeling, and to be honest, I'm still really fucking crushed about it. 

&#x200B;

I got home and texted her, thanking her for the date but that I was disappointed  and pissed she didn't tell me before and that it wasn't going to work out. She then proceeded to get angry with me, told me I was being irrational and transphobic and what not. So tell me reddit, AITA?

She’s modest and a little shy and totally adorable. I loved hanging out with her and she told me how great I was and how much she loved spending time with me. I was on cloud nine. I really felt like we were moving towards a relationship and developing feelings for each other. Every time she texted me and asked me to hang out, my heart would jump. I was so happy.

Then it all came crashing down when I found out she was dating a guy in our dorm. Not only that, but this guy looks JUST like me. Same race, same build, just very similar, which means I wasn’t wrong in her being attracted to me. I was totally shattered that she pursued this guy instead of me. What did he offer her that I didn’t? Why him? Why was she throwing away the wonderful thing we had brewing between us? I was hurt and stopped talking to her for a few days.

After that, I decided that I wasn’t going to let this bother me. I love her and I love our friendship and the time we spend together. I reached back out and we started hanging out again. I can tell her boyfriend doesn’t like me at all and he’s probably insecure about me, but I don’t care because I love our relationship.

1760,Not the A-hole,"Background info, okay so my brother (11 almost 12) is the youngest of 4-call him 4, I (20f) am the second oldest with other brother being the oldest-call him 1 and my sister call her 3 (16) being the third. Growing up brother 1 was never made to do chores etc because he was a boy and chores, housework, cleaning etc was a girls job. Then when I was about 9/10 I had to take care of me and my younger sister meaning I had to make sure we were up, fed and walked to school. After school again it was chores and again my brother was a boy, my sister was ‘too young’ and should be allowed to play with her toys and 4 my youngest brother was only 2/3 at the time. So growing up I was essentially given the ‘mum’ role and even had to watch after them when my parents went out (friends, night-outs etc) and had to make sure they were fed, showered, put to bed all while still being young. I questioned this and was told that I had to be the one to do it because 1 was a boy and wasn’t mature enough even though he was 15/16 at the time older than me by 3 years but yeah. 3 couldn’t do it because she was too young which I got and 4 couldn’t either. 

Anyways now I (20) am being made drop off and to pick the two youngest up from school on any of my days off from work no matter the shift I was the day before. I took a week off as I hadn’t had anytime off in almost 4 months aside from 1 or 2 days which I legally had to be given. But during that week I was given the mum role again which is never given to 1 as he is still considered ‘not mature’ enough -he’s now 23- and they say they wouldn’t trust him to look after them which I get but still. 

They told me tonight I had to get my siblings from school, get them their dinner and attend some play thing in the high school 4 is going to whilst they go out shopping, even after I told them that it’s their child which they planned on having and that I never chose to have a brother but was told I had to do my ‘sisterly’ duties, even thought 3 doesn’t have to do any of the things I was made or am made to do. 

I know it’s probably just me being an asshole but I feel it’s pretty shitty that just because I’m a girl that I have to be the third parent to children I never even wanted.

I work at a large university as staff, who employs students on a part-time basis to assist with or duties. We generally keep students around for their entire time at the university, and become friendly, though not overly so, imo. Sometimes in the course of work, shifts run quite late, and I’ll offer a ride to a student knowing the buses have stopped running or won’t come for hours. I do this for all students that do not have a car or a ride, man or woman. 

The other night, I offered a student a ride home, which she gratefully accepted. I took her home without incident, but I don’t leave until they’ve gotten in the door, just to be sure they’re safely inside since I’ve taken on the responsibility of getting them home. This night, she did not leave her keys, and could not get inside. They turned out to be states away in her boyfriend’s car (spring break). I let her use my phone, and we went back to campus so she could use my computer to get in touch with her mom and try to figure some stuff out. 

Talk of a locksmith and hotels comes up, all I can see is dollar signs,and I was about to offer my spare room of my house. I don’t believe either of us would have perceived it as creepy; I’m a married woman about ten years her senior. I stopped short, though, as I thought about the professional line I’d be blurring and the doors it would be opening for the future.

She ended up being able to find a room with a friend for the night, so none of this ended up being an issue. However I still find myself feeling a little guilty that I didn’t offer another no-cost option to this college student, knowing money’s tight during that time of life. 

Was my hesitancy selfish? AITA?

1770,Not the A-hole,"Context: My mom is one of the top dog obedience handlers in the country. She trains and shows springer spaniels, and I grew up with 3-5 springers in the house at any given time. When I was 12, she bought me a springer, Luna, to show and train and I spent a good portion of my high school years in the obedience ring. Luna passed away five years ago, and I haven't had a dog since.

My husband and I have been planning to get a dog for more than a year. The reason we've waited so long is because my mom occasionally breeds litters to further her line of springers. She currently has one bitch that can be bred who was supposed to come into season in August. She still hasn't come into season eight months later, and we're getting to the point where we can't wait forever. We are planning to start trying for a baby this fall, and since I'm going to be the one training our dog, I'd like to get puppy settled and house trained before I'm potentially dealing with morning sickness, etc..

My husband and I talked this over and we decided that if my mom's dog isn't pregnant by June, we will get a different dog. I would love nothing more than to have one of my mom's springers, but it's more important to me to just get a dog than to get a dog from my mom's line. 

I would still prefer to get a springer. I know this breed like the back of my hand, and I plan to train the dog in obedience and potentially agility. I want an outgoing, high-energy working dog. This dog would be a companion first, but would also be my partner in this sport. It's important to me to get a puppy so I can properly socialize it, especially by bringing it around my friends' kids so it's used to children by the time we have our own. 

I've talked through the dog situation with a few friends, and have told them my plans to get a springer even if my mom's litter doesn't pan out. I had a few people recommend shelters where they got their dogs. I am open to looking at rescue puppies, but I'm leaning much more heavily toward getting a springer from a reputable breeder. 

Pretty much everyone I've told about my plans to get a purebred have been judgmental and unsupportive. I've been scolded with the ""adopt, don't shop"" mantra and asked why I would buy a purebred when so many shelter dogs need loving homes. I think rescuing a dog is a wonderful thing, and I give people who choose that option a lot of credit. But I don't agree with this idea that shelters are the ONLY morally acceptable option for getting a dog. 

I'm sorry, but I do not want a dog with built in behavioral issues. Shelter dogs are a toss up in terms of temperament, potential health issues, and how the puppy was socialized early on. I do not want an abused dog that will be fearful or potentially aggressive. 

WIBTA if I get a purebred dog?

1771,Not the A-hole,"So my wife and I have been separated for about a year and a half now. Everything has been very amicable. We have a good schedule with our two boys (ages 7 and 11), we hangout as a family usually once a week, and get along a lot better than when we were married. Things have been working out so well between us that we have not been in a rush to pull the trigger and finalize the divorce.

When we first agreed to separate, one of the things we agreed on, and she brought up first and was very adamant about is that the kids would not be exposed to anyone we were dating until we knew it was a very serious relationship. Something I was fully on board with and readily agreed with. Whenever I start to date someone, I joke with them that we will be married for a couple of years before I bring the kids around them.

The ex has a condo there that she goes on long weekend trip, or for family events, and for part of the kids school breaks. They have cousins near the same age there and I believe it is important that they have a chance to spend time with them.

They pent spring break there, and came back to my place on Saturday. Sunday morning I woke up and started making pancakes for breakfast. I asked them, how were the pancakes, and my oldest replied along the lines of that they are much better than mom's friend Ron. This set off big alarm bells in my head. Namely, who the fuck is Ron, and why is he cooking breakfast for my kids?

I didn't follow up, or ask any questions of the boys, and just got ready to take the boys to the beach. Later, we had to stop at the ex's house so the boys could pick up their backpacks for school the next day. I casually asked about Ron and why he was making breakfast. The ex just shrugged it off that he came by after hockey practice. She gave a little dismissive explanation, that as far as the boys know, he is just a friend. Later that night I texted with her and told her that I'm not comfortable with some guy coming over trying to ingratiate and buddy up to my boys. I also brought up the agreement that no boyfriends/girlfriends were going to be brought around unless it was something that was very serious. She replied that she wasn't sure how serious they were, but the boys just see him as any other friend. I also brought up that if things were getting serious, than we need to fast track finally getting divorced.

Now kids aren't completely clueless, especially they older one. I'm sure they aren't making out in front of the kids, but I also know that lingering glances, sitting close to each other, small signs of affection are there.

So AITA? For getting upset that I have no idea who is hanging around my kids, how much time he is spending with them, what kind of relationship he is trying to make with them. And come summer vacation when they are there for over a month, how much will he be around? I know as a divorced partner, I have no say in who she dates, and I do want her to be happy.",41,75,0.92

1773,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I coach an U15's boys Sunday 
League football team in the UK.

Over the weekend we played another team and proceeded to win 19-1. Today I received an email from the coach of the other team. He stated that we exhibited unsportsmanlike behaviour by allowing the score to get so big and that one of his players was considering quitting football due to the result.

To give some more details, at no point during the game did he ask me to take our foot of the pedal. In addition I took both of our strikers off with 20 minutes to go (they had 6 goals each at this point) to let the Centre Backs have a go up front. 

Obviously I feel bad that some of his players felt disheartened due to the result. However I have always distilled in my team that they should treat the game as if it's 0-0 at all times. He also never asked for mercy during the game and seemed like a good sport about the result at the final whistle. Had he asked I probably would have told my players to go easy on them from that point.

So AITA for letting the score reach 19-1?

Update: So judging from the replies there seems to be quite a large cultural split on this. Most of the Brits think I'm NTA, whilst a good portion of Americans think I'm TA. 
I think next time I'll probably bring the subs on sooner and swap players positions more. However I don't agree with telling the kids to not give 100% and just pass the ball about, as this seems more disrespectful to the opposition imo.",563,898,0.96

I told him that I don't care what he wears while I am not working with him, but when I am to not wear it.  It also gets VERY uncomfortable in public because when someone walks up to him and asks ""your in the military?"" He will lie and say that he is and starts trying to explain what he does and I have to intervene and explain the situation.  I know I am probably the asshole and I should just let him, hes not hurting anyone, but it just annoys me when he goes out and tries to lie about something he never did.


EDIT:  my client has autism, higher functioning than you would think and can be completely normal at times so yeah, he looks believable in uniform. First time I met him before I knew I would be working with him I thought he was in the military... until I started working with him a week later.",104,162,0.9

1776,Not the A-hole,"My grandfather still lives at home and is self-sufficient, although he is getting on in years.

I'm currently pregnant, and I have terrible morning sickness. I'm constantly sick and exhausted. I'm avoiding everyone who I don't want to disclose my pregnancy to because I don't think I can hide it without making up an excuse about having an actual illness. He is definitely someone who I do not want to disclose to yet.

When I was pregnant with my son he was visibly uncomfortable whenever the topic came up and told me that, back in his day, a woman just hid for nine months and then emerged with a baby. 

After my son was born he started asking me when I was going to have another child, and by the time my son was six months old, was telling me stories about siblings who hated each other because their mothers waited too long in between births. What he didn't know was that I *was* trying to have another child, and I *did* want my children to be close in age, but I was struggling to conceive. It hurt a lot to hear him trying to argue me into doing the thing that I was desperately trying to do. I didn't want to disclose my fertility problems because I knew he would want to pray over me and then continue asking for updates anyway, so I kept repeating that I would have another child when I was blessed with one. This didn't dissuade him at all.  

Visiting him with my son is not fun because he doesn't really interact with him. When I visit other family members they hold or play with my son and I get to sit down and take a break. When I visit him he sits and watches while I try to keep my son entertained in his non-childproofed house. It's exhausting to visit him, and I'm constantly asked about my plans to expand my family the whole time. He knows that I want more children, and yet he brings it up every time. 

I suggested he meet my son and I at McDonald's instead of at his house, but then he opted to order dinner and eat it on the other end of the restaurant while I supervised by son alone in the play area. He didn't interact with my son at all!! 

He is not aware of this, but last year I did manage to conceive and the pregnancy ended in a traumatic miscarriage. Again, I didn't tell him because I didn't want to be prayed over and showered with religious platitudes. He is not aware that his attempts to argue me into having more children, while I was still bleeding from painfully losing the one I had just conceived, is the reason I am currently avoiding him. I just could not continue to hear it. Now that I am pregnant again, I don't like that my options are to either tell him and risk having to inform him that I've miscarried, or hide it and again be lectured about how I should be procreating. 

I've told him that I'll see him on Easter, because on Easter I'll be far enough along that I'm willing to disclose. He's not happy. He wants to see his great-grandchild and he doesn't think I've given enough reason why I'm not facilitating that.

1779,Asshole,"AITA for driving off from McDonalds after my brother was rude to the cashier?

&#x200B;

This happened last night. 

&#x200B;

So a little backstory, my older brother wanted to tag along to somewhere I was going and I said I was going to pick up McDonald's for dinner and asked if he wanted anything. He said no he had just eaten and was stuffed. No problem there. He is also a server at a nice italian restaraunt, which comes up later.

&#x200B;

So we go to our event, which lasts 2 hours max. We're walking back to the car and he says ""I'm super hungry, we should grab some Mcdonald's or something."" I said ""Bro I literally just offered you McDonald's."" So I was kind of annoyed right off the bat.

&#x200B;

But anyways I'm driving him home and agreed to go through the drive-thru for him. I told him he can order since I'm not getting anything. The cashier comes on the speaker and asks what he wants.

&#x200B;

He asks for a hot fudge sundae, and she says the ice cream machine is down. He immediately says in a condescending voice ""It's down? It's 8:48 PM."". I was like""Dude. don't be a jerk."" So he asks the cashier if he can do a smoothie and she says yes, but she clearly sounds annoyed. He orders some fries too, and she gives the total and says to drive up. 

&#x200B;

I said ""You realize this makes ME look like an asshole now right?"" because I was the one driving, and she wouldn't have known it was him ordering. He just tried to play it off and say ""Haha, but it WAS you who said it!""

&#x200B;

So instead of going to the window I immediately left and he didn't pay for or get his food. He said he was joking and asked me to go back and I said no. I just headed towards his house. I've gone out to other restaraunts with him before and it always surprises me how rude he can be towards food workers when he himself is server. 

&#x200B;

He made some excuse about it and I said ""I would think as a server, you would know food service workers don't want to be yelled at for things that aren't their fault."" And he was again quiet after that, and I dropped him off.

&#x200B;

When I got home he sent me text saying he was hangry and wasn't thinking straight and thanks fr helping him save $10. I responded no worries, sorry I drove off.

&#x200B;

I told my wife when I got home and she thought it was super funny, and that I was a bit of an asshole but not entirely in the wrong. 

&#x200B;

So what do you think, AITA in this scenario?

1782,Not the A-hole,"Background: my great grandfather was a Colonel in the marines during WWII and Korea and beyond. When he was enlisted in WWII he recieved the Congressional Medal of Honor during the battle of Iwo Jima. Care of the actual medal and most of his stuff has fallen to me. 

My younger 2nd cousin (now 12) loves military stuff. When he was younger I allowed him to play with my grandpas flight helmet (grandpa became a fighter pilot between WWII and Korea) and he destroyed it. Part of it was my fault but also certainly my cousin's (his mom) as well because she didn't abide by my terms when I agreed to let him borrow it.

Early last year my 2nd cousin started asking for all of grandpas uniforms and medals. I initially sort of deflected but he got more and more demanding and I was so annoyed I decided I just didn't want to deal with it anymore and I donated everything to my grandpa's hometowns hall of honor. They were thrilled with the donation and are in the process of creating a permanent display featuring the Medal of Honor, his uniforms and flight suits. I figure it's a much better use then all the stuff being in my closet. The display will have a looping video of my grandpa getting the medal from president Truman, his retirement ceremony as well as some family films we had of him. I've seen the designs and it's very befitting everything he did in his life.

Edit: lots of people commenting I did it out of spite, I don't think I did. What the situation did to was spur me into action. Sorry for not making that clear. I'd been thinking for years over what I was going to do with that stuff and this scenario sort of forced me to make a decision.

Edit 2: just to clear up more confusion, 2nd cousin (or cousin once removed I just learned) literally demanded the stuff from me. He’s 12 and his initial email was “I know you didn’t vote for Trump so I like the military more than you. You need to give me Grandpa Fred’s stuff. I am home all weekend. You can bring it over whenever you want. I want the medal and the flag to be separated out because it is most value (sic)” 

Family to a person is pissed at me. They think it all should have stayed in the family and that I was a jerk to assume my 2nd cousin woukd have treated the stuff the same at 12 as he did the flight helmet when he was 6.

1786,Not the A-hole,"So my little brother calls me 6 days before his wedding just to ""tell"" me about him having a wedding. He doesn't ask if I want to go, no invitation, nothing of the sort.

He says, ""Hey I'm getting married next Sunday and I just want to give you the heads up""! I promptly congratulate him and because it was a last minute notice, I assume that it's a simple courthouse marriage. However, I was startled when he says he's having a wedding... WTF right?

&#x200B;

To add to that, he tells me it's on a whim because he's shipping out for the Air Force in 8 days and wants to get married right before going. He is doing it for the benefits as you get more going in married so I can understand all that.

He also adds that the bride's family wants something big for their daughter so that is why they are having a wedding. Again, I can understand the thing with the bride and her family, but why tell me just 6 days prior to? Is it actually possible to prepare a wedding that fast?

&#x200B;

I would also like to add that I live overseas but very flexible so I can go to my brother's wedding even with the late notice, but as I continue to talk to my brother, the conversation is just chit-chat. Not once does he ask if I want to come. We chat for about an hour and the invite never came. So I got the message that I'm not invited.

&#x200B;

The next morning, my mother calls and she tells me to just go. I'm reluctant but the benefits of going totally outweigh not going. So I go online and reserve a ticket. unfortunately, as I was reserving a ticket, I realized that my passport expired. How unlucky is that with just 5 days to go before the wedding!!! I'm pissed! 

Now I'm working on trying to renew my passport but it has to be a life or death emergency to get it renewed in a day. I even contacted an old colleague who works for the State Dept. but it doesn't look promising. 

&#x200B;

As family, this whole thing with my brother telling me about the wedding last minute and not inviting me really upsets me? He and his fiance had to plan this ahead of time right? 

&#x200B;

So, for the benefit of the doubt I bit the bullet and called him back and asked him directly if he actually wants me to go and he says yes.

I tell him, ""thank you for the invite, I wish you said that last night! Btw, my passport expired but I'm working on it"". He tells me that it's fine if I can't make it because it was so last minute. I reply, "" Yes it is last minute but it would have been so much better if you let me know about your wedding much earlier.""    

I didn't expect anything after saying that but I think that was the trigger that blew him up. He was yelling so much that I could not understand most of what he was saying. From this point on, it's a one way conversation of him bringing up past drama I don't even care about.

&#x200B;

1787,No A-holes here,"In 8th grade I asked a shy, quiet girl out and she said yes. Looking back on it now it was something I jumped into too soon as I really didn’t know her all that much. Things went smoothly for the first year and then things started to go downhill.

This girl had some pretty bad social and mental issues (social anxiety, depression of some degree, and even lived in a not so supporting household). This led to her being a girl who kept to herself mostly, even from her boyfriend. It would be a journey just to find her in the morning, as she didn’t have a phone.

Then her problems got worse, to the point of her cutting herself. This is when she completely separated herself from everyone, including me. She would barely talk to me and seeing her so broken and hurt made me as a boyfriend feel useless and pathetic. 

I felt horrible that I couldn’t help her. She was very much in a bad place and there was nothing I could do.  I wanted her to be able to find someone who could help her with her issues.

With us being so separated, I started losing the feelings for her I used to have and started getting feelings for another girl who shared feelings back. It was a feeling I missed. 

After a month of this, I told my current girlfriend that I wanted to end our relationship and told her that I was losing feelings and that I felt that she needed to find someone who could actually help her with her problems. This went over like a car on bricks.

Immediately, word went round that I left her for another girl and that I broke up with her because of her mental issues. People HATED me. They didn’t know my side of the story and didn’t bother to find out. The took the word of the innocent, shy girl.

Three months later and that girl is more social than she ever was. She’s actually talking to people in our school. So i don’t know if I was holding her back or if she just randomly became social.

1789,No A-holes here,"A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 ""tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!"" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
It started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.
I get a call from her around 11am. ""What the fuck is The Almanac?"" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""I always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.

I've been telling my mother that she needs to slow down and that she's gonna end up like my father if she keeps continuing like this. She's told me that I'm just nagging her and that since she's my mother, I shouldn't worry about her.

That was going on for 2 to 3 years, or so. (started when I was 13.) She's a full-blown alcoholic. (Even more than before my dad died.) This year, I've been worried about her. She drinks too much, so I try to hide her booze and dump it. (In an attempt to make her slow down on the alcohol.)

I've been doing this for months. She thinks I'm drinking it all, (even though I won't touch the stuff.) and blaming me for drinking her missing booze. Even when she **DOES** actually drink it all. She [pulls a Patrick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR8-K7ocZbo).

The shops were not open yet, so we couldn't get a pregancy test yest. But we started discussing what we should do. Currently I am in a state in my life where I definitely do not want to have kids, so I said to my bf (M26) that I probably would get an abortion if I turned out to be pregnant.

I said sure, we definitely need to talk about it, but when it comes down to it, i'ts my body so my decision. He got really really angry for saying that.   


I tried to explain to him that of course we will make it a mutual decision, and we will talk, explore our options and objectively try to weigh all those options, but in the end it is my body and if we really don't agree on it it is my call.

I said well, it is a difficult one, but you cannot force a women to abort a baby if she doesnt want it as it is her body.

We're both in our 20s and have been together for nearly a decade. We just relocated to a new city for SO's career, but are making very little money and it's tough to make ends meet sometimes. We currently both work in the gig economy, so income can be unpredictable from week to week. SO comes from a wealthy family, and it's their family who is helping us out with our rent, so our primary expenses are food, gas, groceries, and utilities. 

Well, my SO is crazy irresponsible with finances, even with the little money we do have. Part of it isn't in their control, because they have a mental illness, and one of the main symptoms is compulsively spending. So I feel bad for criticizing their habits... but on the other hand, because SO comes from a wealthy background, I also feel that they have no concept of what it's like to budget. My SO has never had to penny-pinch or sacrifice to make ends meet. I came from a family that wasn't nearly as privileged, and regularly had to make money stretch from paycheck to paycheck.

Because of their habits, I'm completely in charge of our finances, and I hate it. SO begs me every day to eat out, or to ""treat ourselves"" because they worked hard or had a stressful day. I do empathize, but it's just not financially responsible for us. What really drives me crazy is when they beg to go out for food when we already have stuff at home. I'll even list the things we have, but they will insist that they just aren't hungry for those things. It makes me want to scream, ""So what?! Tough it out!"" But I never do. Sometimes I just give in because I'm tired of arguing about it every fucking day. 

Sometimes to make our money stretch until payday, I skip meals. My SO never does, and that makes me resent them, if I'm totally honest.

Because when I do suggest we be more frugal, they get really upset. They always say that, in the worst case scenario, their parents will send us money. I'm appreciative of the help they already give us, I don't want them to give us anymore. I really want us to stick it out for ourselves.

Mostly everyone is friendly, and we have some neighbors that would truly qualify as friends - like the ones in this story. We've known these neighbors for at least 2 years, participate in activities together, have each other over for parties, and recently have even traveled over a weekend together. We've really clicked on a lot of values, conversations, and senses of humor. We all can tell some pretty raunchy jokes, and sexual innuendos abound. They're Catholic (we're not) and they have a very young baby (~3 months old).

So last weekend a mutual neighbor-friend invites my wife and I and this other couple over for dinner. The 5 of us are having a great time, making conversation and laughing, all sorts of jokes. Our host had made a cheesecake for dessert, and asked someone to whip some cream for a topping. The husband from the other couple happily obliges and quickly starts making masterbation jokes as he beats the cream (too easy, right?)

As we're eating, the other couple tells a story of how he likes to tell jokes but she often messes them up, and he proceeds to tell a joke about being embarrassed to have sex with fat girls, and then she told it how she butchered it.

In the course of conversation they mentioned how their baby slept through mass, and how the priest likes to wiggle the baby's toes on the way out the door.

I must have made a face like I was holding in a fart because our host leaned over with a twinkle in her eye and said ""priest joke?"" And I said something to the effect of ""ehhh I'm just not sure they wanna get the priest started so early...""

And the dude said to me, seriously offended, ""you may think that that is something to joke about, but the rest of us don't find it funny at all.""

My wife quickly and sarcastically retorted, ""Yeah, we draw the line at fat girl sex jokes"". And everyone was quiet for a few seconds while trying to regroup.

The evening lasted another 30 minutes or so, and the rest of the conversations felt forced and awkward. I've since seen the wife of the other couple and we acted like everything was fine, but I haven't seen the husband.

Obviously no decent human finds it funny that priests have actually been so predatory. Just like I wouldn't have found it funny if he was actually in the kitchen beating his dick into a mixing bowl on front of us. Not every joke is funny, but I feel like my joke wasn't out of line with the rest of the humor of the evening.

My mom died in 2012. My dad went completely off the deep end and got into drugs and alcohol. I was out of the house by then, but he and my younger sister got evicted from our apartment. My 15 year old sister (we'll call her Ashley) had nowhere to go. She stayed with one of her best friends (Kelly) for about 5 months.

I grew up babysitting Kelly but after she hit her teen years I barely saw her. I heard a few stories about drugs, stealing, not being able to hold down a job for more than a few months, etc. You know, typical teenage drama.

Here we are today: Ashley and Kelly are both in their early twenties. Ashley lives with her boyfriend, a roommate, and another guy is crashing on her couch. (An entirely different issue, dude is freeloading and won't leave). I am almost 30, and live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my fiance, my now sober and disabled) father, and 4 cats.

Ashley calls me up and says Kelly has an emergency situation at home. She needs a place to stay. Can she crash with me for 2 or 3 MONTHS while she tries to find another place to live? Oh, and she wants to bring her unfixed, unvaccinated cat.

My 3rd bedroom is basically storage space, a futon, and three giant litter boxes. I told Ashley that Kelly is welcome to couch surf or stay a few nights on the futon if it's really an emergency, but I wasn't comfortable with an undisclosed amount of time without some kind of game plan.

After half an hour of bickering the likes of which we hadn't done since I was in high school, she tells me she can't believe how selfish I was and she was ""SO disappointed in me as a sister"". 

Not 15 minutes later my dad walks into my bedroom with the other tactic - guilt. Kelly would be willing to pay for the room. Kelly's family took Ashley in when he was fucked up, Kelly should be like family to us, it's the ""Christian"" thing to do, why can't I show a little compassion, etc.

I told him he didnt understand the psychological and financial burden I'd be under, the legality of it, not to mention the stress and anxiety. Introducing another cat into my horde would bring a plethora of new issues. He left after telling me he was concerned about my immortal soul for being so callous.

Anyway, I went home with a woman the other day, a bit younger than me at the Uni. When I took my shirt off she asked me about the tattoos, and I told her, after which her mood was completely gone and she left.
Later I asked for an explanation, and she said that she hated how they glorified war, which I've heard in the past but don't agree with, and is not what I'm asking about here. She also said that I was culturally appropriating the culture of POC, a term I'd never heard before that day, and found bizarre given most of the cultures represented aren't ""of colour"". Although calling them POC was a bit strange, I suppose she may have had a point, but I felt that all of my tattoos were soldiers, of which I had been for a very long time.
So, subreddit, do you believe AITA for having these tattoos? It's certainly too late to do anything about them now.
Edit: I had not heard the term POC before. I had heard of cultural appropriation. I thought this might have been unclear",76,31,0.83

1804,,"Before I get judged to quickly, let me explain. 
22 years ago, I had a one night stand and accidentally got the woman pregnant. I didn’t want to keep the baby (obviously), but ultimately, she didn’t feel comfortable with an abortion and wanted to keep it. I decided to step up and be a father to my child. Together, we have an gorgeous daughter who’s about to graduate from undergrad and intends to go to grad school. 


This weekend, my daughter called me and said her mom wasn’t willing to pay for grad school, and she asked if I could help supplement her education. Her reasoning is that I’m planning to pay for my son (her half-brother) to go to school, and she feels like I should contribute to her education. She sounded seemed to end the conversation early. About an hour later, I got a text from her LIVID. She accused me of caring more about my “real” family as opposed to her because I haven’t paid anything for her college career. But, there’s so many reason I’m not comfortable paying for her education, including:

1. I pay child support. I’m a civil engineer with a relatively decent salary, so the courts made me contribute a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. I tried to get it lowered, to no avail, but calculating the costs, I contribute way more money to my daughter than my son. 
2. My daughter wants to go to expensive private school, while my son wants to go to a less expensive state school. Her graduate school costs upwards of $30,000+ a year for two years, while my son’s entire 4 year cost will be less than $25,000.
3. When she graduated from high school, I spent $12,000 of my own money (no help from her mother) to give her a car, while the only thing I’m giving my son is a new game console and some video games.
4. Her mom in the high 5-digits - low 6-digit salary and can afford to pay her education. My wife (my son’s mother) makes about 500 a month with her own little business. It’s not much, but she can do it from home and help with the kid.
5. My son is choosing a practical major. He wants to go to Computer Science. While she wants to get her degree in something useless (not going to be specific, but think along the lines of gender or black studies). 

I told her that I support her academic endeavors, but I’m not a bank and my money is mine, and that I don’t appreciate being talked to with so little disrespect. I see her every other weekend, spend time with her, and have shown I’m a good father, and to overreact over something trivial is disrespectful. She told me to to enjoy my real family because I obviously love them more than her. That hurt; i told her that we can talk later when she’s less emotional (maybe not the best choice of words) and she told me to “fuck off you sexist asshole”. I didn’t mean it like like the way she took it; I think she’s blowing it out of proportion. 


Tl;dr: Paying for son’s undergrad, but refused to pay daughter’s grad degree and I’m somehow sexist. Am I the asshole?

Edit: she wants the whole thing paid, not a portion. 

(Edit 3) I’m getting a lot of complaints about how I’m changing the story, so to be clear, she *first* phrased it as a contribution to her education, and then later on explained she wanted everything paid for. Like I said in edit 2, there was a character limit (I think it doesn’t apply when you edit), and I guess I erased the section that made that part clear.

Edit 2: I was told to include below that her mom paid for undergrad and she has no loans right now. Sorry, reddit has a character limit and it was autoremoved so i had to take out details. 

Gonna try to limit the edits, but just wanted to say that I know I come off defensive/abrasive in the comments, but I was annoyed that everyone was making me out to be a piece of shit for not being a piggy bank for a grown adult.",1546,1341,0.91
1805,Not the A-hole,"I was in a relationship with this girl for more than a year now and two weeks ago I found out that she was cheating on me. As it turns out, she was actually cheating on him with me. Ours was a monogamous relationship because she wanted it to be. She told me one day we could get married and start family.

She was sleeping with both of us during the whole relationship. Also, I found out that she was also getting intimate with a co-worker in addition to everything.

Because I did not want her fiancee(4 years since engagement) to be in the dark, I told him everything. Fiance and her family know each other well. Now she told me not to contact her ever again or she will call the police.

She is calling me the asshole because ""I could have ended things like mature adults and not extract revenge. I have ruined her character and reputation"".

This makes no sense to me. If she had told me that she is engaged and I decided to keep a fuck-buddy relationship, I understand the need to be discreet.

Am I the asshole for doing what I did? I was just looking out for a fellow man.

&#x200B;

EDIT1: Excuse me, English is my third language.

>If she had told me that she is engaged and **if** I decided to keep a fuck-buddy relationship, I understand the need to be discreet.

Corrected it. What I mean is if someone still agrees to have an affair with a cheater, the need to be discreet is understandable. Personally, I would not pursue anything with someone like that.

EDIT 2:

Turns out, she told him the same story she told me. 

""I want to be with you but I did not want to hurt your feelings. I care about him too. I was so confused and did not know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I fucked up.""

I did not buy it but her fiance did . He suggested me to leave her alone as she has a lot on her plate. Then he blocked me.

I also talked to the third guy. He said he just got out a divorce and does not want to be in a relationship. She told him that she broke up with me a couple of months ago(actually happened two weeks ago). He did not admit to sleeping with her but said they hung out at his house as good friends and she cooked food for him. On pressing, he admitted to kissing her on the cheek and that's it( I don't believe that, I think he is just being discreet). I remember lately she was working 'longer hours' too.

Here’s the thing. I’ve been under a lot of stress at school. Lately I have been falling asleep without texting her goodnight. It’s not a big deal to her, but it is to me. I make a point to text her good morning and good night. So I turned them on and she asked me why. I said it was so she would know if I fell asleep or something.

She told me they make her uncomfortable because she jumps to the conclusion that I am upset if she sees I read the text and didn’t respond. In the beginning of our relationship (I was definitely a dick to her and was borderline abusive. I have changed quite a bit since then) I would turn them on if i was mad at her to let her know I read the messages, but wasn’t going to respond. She claims that gave her a lot of anxiety, and for this reason, feels anxious when they are on. I told her she’ll get used to it.

Lately, she has not been texting me as much (we usually talk throughout the day), like 5 to 6 messages per day, and prefers to talk over the phone or in person. I think she is being childish and immature. AITA here?

1808,Not the A-hole,"The title sounds bad but I do believe I was in the right for saying so.

So, my dad has been dating this woman that he met at a massage parlor (she is a massage therapist there) and she has been throwing red flags left and right. And they’ve only been dating for two weeks. 

Red flag #1: She told him that he is not allowed to speak to his ex wife anymore (my mom) because she is jealous and sees her as a threat. My mom remarried and would never threaten their relationship. Plus my father and mother have two children together and also have 7+ grandchildren together, so naturally they talk from time to time.

Red flag #2: She limits the kind of food that my dad can eat at restaurants and at home. Now, my dad isn’t a huge guy. He is about 20 lbs overweight but overall eats very healthy and exercises regularly but he sometimes likes to treat himself to something like a cheeseburger or a couple slices of pizza. She put an end to that.

Red flag #3: She told him that he needs to clean the entire house. Again, this seemed unnecessary since the house is clean with the exception of a few dishes in the sink and clothes on his bedroom floor. She spent the entire day laying in his bed while he steam cleaned the carpet in every room of the house and made everything shine. 

Red flag #4: This is where I put my foot down and finally spoke up. My dad came downstairs and informed me that one of our older cats will now have to live her life inside of his bedroom closet because his girlfriend thinks that would be best to keep the house clean since our cat occasionally has accidents on the carpet. 

I flat out told him that she’s a bitch for suggesting that and implementing so many rules within their first month of dating. My dad obviously took great offense to that because he basically worships the ground that she walks on.  We aren’t on speaking terms now.

Been together for a few years. Moved in together quickly.  Did everything for her, including all cooking and cleaning to the point that she got dependent.

I stopped seeing my friends because she couldnt deal with us ""not spending time together.""  She said if I loved her I shouldn't want to be apart.

I just didnt want her to feel hurt. I felt like it was my job to make her happy and take care of her. I completely ignored my own needs.

Breaking point was she came home one day out of the blue and said she was attracted to someone else, that we needed a break, but she didn't want to break up or for me to move out.

That broke me. I packed my shit and was out.

Since then shes been freaking out, accusing me of hurting her mental health, of not being a good boyfriend. I finally told her flat out, this isn't a break because you aren't going to change.

I recently lent 10000 dollars to a friend in order to help with his CC debt.  Well he lost the 10,000 dollars on god knows what and got kicked out of his apartment and is still unemployed.  He has 2 dogs and a cat that are very nice and well trained.  He has owned them for several years.   He needed a place to keep them and asked if he could keep them at my house for a few days.  I said yes.  He had to go back to his moms several states away and said he would come back soon.  He didn't come back for 4 months and ignored my messages, refused to call me back, and left me on read.  He came to my door yesterday and said im back I want my pets now.  I asked for the 10,000 dollars and money for watching his pets for four months.  He said ""no"" and that he would never have the money to pay me back for either things and I should cut my losses there.  I said well you wont be getting your pets back until I am paid back 10,000 dollars and shut the door in his face.

1812,Asshole,"So I just ate dinner at a local chain of ramen restaurants that has a customer rewards system. Every time you finish a bowl you get a stamp. After 10 bowls eaten you get a free bowl of ramen. The only stipulation is that you have to finish the entire bowl to collect a stamp. I was particularly hungry today and decided to get extra noodles in my bowl of ramen (and a pint). I almost finish the bowl but left a little broth left because I was way too full and literally couldn't stuff anything more in my body. After paying, I bring out my rewards card which already had four stamps. The waitress refuses me a stamp and cites the rule of finishing the entire bowl, broth and all. I explain that I’d been allowed a stamp during a previous visit with a couple of sips of broth left but she still refused. I found this ridiculous for two reasons: A) the bowl I ate was notably larger than any of the standard menu items for which a stamp could be redeemed and B) I had just spent close to $30 including tip and was evidently a good repeat customer. After presenting this argument she still wouldn't give me a stamp. I eventually got fed up and said that I wanted the tip money back.

I really don’t think I was trying to take advantage of the situation; it wasn't like I took a few bites and demanded something outrageously generous in return; I genuinely ate as much as I could and the thing was damn near finished. I also work in customer service and it’s very common to make little exceptions all the time for good customers. I don't think I was rude to her but the principle really bothered me.

1813,Asshole,"So, Me (45M) and my wife (43F) have two kids. One son (17M) and one daughter (16F), both still in high school. 

The situation here is that my son cheated on his last girlfriend. They broke up several months ago, but he really hurt her feelings by cheating on her and then dumping her. He's done this with the two previous girlfriends he had as well.

Me and my wife don't condone this at all. However, we don't like to punish him for it either. We don't really want to get involved with his sex/romantic life. 

But really, my wife agrees with me that punishing him would be a bad idea. Even though he has issues with those types of things, he's a great kid. He's got outstanding grades (among the best in the school), he's competed in debating tournaments and he's an amazing athlete. As crude as it sounds, he's ''all around'' amazing. He's made us so proud as parents, he does our family proud. As it stands, he even has a shot at getting acceptance into an Ivy League school (or a school of equivalent caliber, if he goes for MIT/Stanford types). 

If he wasn't doing much with this life, we would have more incentive to punish him I guess, but really the way things are, we don't want to give him too much negative treatment. In fact for most of his life, we have disciplined him when he seriously misbehaved but for the most part, we took a more positive approach and told him he can achieve whatever he wants in life. My wife smothers him a lot more than I do, but really we're proud of where he is going.

Now my daughter is also great, but she seems to be taking serious issue with our non-punishment of his cheating. This caused a big argument recently as she shouted at us that ''He can't keep getting away with treating people like crap!''. She was making reference to his ex who he cheated on, and also said that he is a ''monster for cheating''.

She was very emotional during this argument, but I think this was because our son's ex girlfriend was also my daughter's friend. Why else would she get so emotional over him cheating? 

So we just told her ''Look, you're emotional right now. If you want to keep acting like a baby, then do so, but you're not going to achieve anything. You shouldn't be talking about your brother like that''. We offered to take her out for a family meal and she refused and moped around in her room.

1815,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for three years. I love her and I’m very proud of her (she’s had a tough time at work recently) so I wanted to surprise her with a really awesome gift for her birthday. 

Her birthday was last week. In the months and weeks running up to it, when I’d ask her what she’d want for a gift, she kept telling me she only wanted a card. Like, one of those custom made ones, for example. When I’d reply and tell her that she’s got to want more than just a card, she’d firmly state that was all she wanted. She said that cards were more sentimental to her and that they had long-time value unlike presents. 

The thing is, I really don’t see the point in cards. I get why she would like a custom made one, but we have tons of framed pictures of us together. I’d just be recycling photos we already have on display. I’ve never got her a card before and she’s never complained or brought it up. 

I ended up buying her a new laptop as hers has been faulty for a while. I was super stoked about the present and thought she would be, too. On her birthday, when she found a wrapped present, she was immediately pissed. When she opened it, she was even more angry. Told me that it wasn’t my responsibility to fix her electronics and that she is perfectly capable of deciding when her laptop should be replaced. She asked if I had got her a card and I said no. I told her that I had spent enough money on the laptop and I didn’t see the point in spending another £7+ on a custom made card. She hasn’t spoken to me since. 

She’s been staying with some friends who all live in a shared house and I cannot understand why this is such a big deal. I admit I could have handled it better, but the way she reacted to (what was supposed to be!) a thoughtful gift has me pretty shaken up. I didn’t realise a card would be so important to her.

1817,Asshole,"It's not easy writing this. I want to make clear that I haven't decided anything yet. I'm just considering all options.

About 2 weeks ago me and my girlfriend found out that she's infertile. We had been trying for a baby for almost a year, and we got a bit worried. So we decided to check the both of us, and it turns out that she is infertile. There's not much more to it, but they are 100% sure. We've been together for little over 5 years. I'm 24 and she's 2 years older, and we thought that the time was right. 

Obviously we are devastated by the news, and I understand that it's an even bigger blow for my girlfriend. I've been there for her and we support each other, and I think that we're at least dealing with it. 

She has already suggested adoption or a surrogate. I told her that was good idea and left it at that. The thing is, I don't want to adopt a kid. I also don't want a surrogate. I want to have my own kids, with my own woman (I don't know how to phrase this but you get what I mean). I get how this sounds really selfish. But it's how I think, I can't change that. I don't think I would be capable of adopting a kid. It's just not me. Is it weird that I want the woman I'm with to carry our child? I don't think it is. I want it to be our kid. But I know I'm not thinking straight right now. 

I want kids. I want them with my girlfriend. She was about to be my fiancee. But we can't. I've been seriously thinking of breaking things off. I love her with all my heart, she IS the love of my life. I wouldn't want to put her through a break up after this news, I know she needs me. But I can't shake this feeling. I understand that many might not understand my thought process here. I don't know what to tell you. Would I be the asshole?

Edit: I certainly don't see her as a walking baby maker as some of you have said, that thought alone disgusts me. It might very well be my emotions speaking because of the news. I haven't been in a good headspace since we found out. I want to stress once again that I haven't made a choice yet. I am only keeping all my options open.

Someone suggested therapy and I am definitely going to check if there is someone available near me. I realize that my thinking is unhealthy and that it shouldn't get in the way of my love for my girlfriend. You people may not believe me but I see her as my everything. She means the world to me and I wouldn't want to hurt her even more. This thing about having kids the natural way is something that's deeply rooted into my mind, I can't help that.

I will try to make this short while adding all relevant details and I also want to make this as equitable to my wife as it is to me and even though I feel she is wrong, I wouldn't be posting here unless I was self aware enough to admit some fault. 

I got married to my wife on March 9th. Her parents agreed that if we had a small and cheap ceremony they would pay for 100% of our honey moon and allow us to stay in their house (they plan on retiring there in a few years) for 3 weeks. I wasn't aware of this but one of the conditions of this was that my wife and I were supposed to stop in and say hello to multiple sets of their ""Belize friends."" I think all told it's 5 different couples that we were supposed to make an appearance. As of yesterday, we were on couple 4 and while I was sort of annoyed that I wasn't made aware of this, couples 1 through 3 were nice people and the second set was these two hilarious gay dudes named Rod and Pete and Pete owns a helicopter who flew us all around to see the sites and that was awesome. 

Couple 4 was where shit hit the fan. They were much older, had obviously been fighting with each other and were super agitated. It was about 1000 degrees inside their house and they just sat and bitched the entire time about how their kids never call, how the husband's alcohol problem had flared up again, how the wife wanted to die because of her plantar fasciitis. We sat in these people's sweltering living room or almost 6 hours (that's not a joke) and we weren't offered so much as a drink and when I finally said I'd like some water, the kitchen was filthy as were the dishes and the husband was so shitty because I took a bottle of hot Dasani from under the sink. 

When we left,  I lost it with my wife. I told her that was one of the most miserable experiences of my life and those were two of the most miserable people I've ever met. She retaliated that those were two of her ""dearest friends"" and I was being super ungrateful to her parents who were paying for the trip. I told her that I wished her parents had made it clear that spending a full work day with American gothic on opiates was a condition of the honeymoon. She got so pissed at me that she called Rod and Pete to pick her up and I haven't seen her since yesterday evening. Her phone is either off or dead as my texts are not showing as delivered. I don't know how to get to their house even though its not that far so I'm just sort of hunkered down staring at my phone not sure what to do.

She announced yesterday that she was bringing a guest speaker to our classroom, a woman (and close friend of hers) who tours schools giving speeches on the dangers of drunk and distracted driving. This woman lost her young daughter in a drunk driving accident and is a severe burn victim, and my teacher told us ahead of time that her presentation will be an extremely emotional one, as she will describe the accident she experienced in detail.

My teacher stated that we all need to be on our very best behavior, and treat her with the highest of respect. She established that there will be **no** interruptions of her presentation tolerated; so that means no going to the bathroom and no tardy arrivals. She stated that she was locking the door at the start of class, and that any students who didn’t have the respect to show up on time would have to sit outside the duration of the period.

I obviously planned on arriving on time to that class (as I always do), but was called up to the office near the end of the preceding period, and by the time I was let go we were already a good 5-10 minutes into the next period. I hustled over to my classroom and knocked on the door, and through the window I was met by a huge scowl from my teacher, a shake of her head, and a gesture to wait outside. I gestured to the office, trying to indicate that’s why I was late, but she turned her head away and ignored me. The woman giving the speech didn’t notice me, as she was very invested in her presentation. At this point, she was talking at length about the morning before she got into the crash, detailing emotionally the last few hours she spent with her daughter alive.

It was quite cold, stormy, and unpleasant outside, and I **really** wanted to get in. I understand my teacher’s rule, but think that it’s horribly unfair someone should have to sit outside in the cold if they have a legitimate excuse for being late. I started knocking very hard and loud against the door, rapping against the window, calling out, “Hey, I’m out here! Can someone let me in?”, and waving my arms around in front of the window. About 30 seconds later, the woman stops and says, “I think there’s a student out there. Can someone let him in?” Someone ran over and finally let me in, and my teacher flashed me another gigantic scowl. Fairly soon after, the lady continued her speech, and things went smoothly the rest of the period.

At the end of the class, my teacher scolded me for not listening and interrupting the speech giver, and gave me a detention even after I explained that I had an excuse for being late. I’m considering telling my story to the Vice Principal and fighting this detention. AITA?",514,1138,0.95

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",311,27255,0.91

1825,No A-holes here,"Sorry if this is long, I ramble a lot.

I’ve known my best friend since we started high school and now we are halfway through college. We were both there for each other for EVERYTHING. Every milestone you could have in as a teenager into adulthood. I deeply care about her and I currently have uneasy feelings about her boyfriend/fiance (i don’t know). They have only been dating for like 7 months and she announces that she’s pregnant. At first, like any other person, I’m ecstatic and about to cry about the news! I was genuinely happy for her and then reality checked in. She has a full ride scholarship to our University, she’s very intelligent and has almost all A’s. She says she will still finish school but i’m unsure about that or at least it’ll be so difficult. She doesn’t have a job. She’s also almost broken up with her boyfriend several times (she comes to me every time she considers it) She even emotionally cheated on him (texted some guys because she got bored of him). Her parents are completely against the pregnancy and being terrible to her which causes her so much stress and has caused her to be cut off from her family. Now I feel like she’s rushing her life; she says “Me and (BF) are getting married” “we are getting an apartment together” like she’s 19 turning 20 this year, only has been dating him for 7 months, and almost breaks up with him every month. I haven’t expressed any disagreement with her and have been super supportive...however I told my boyfriend that it’s fucked up but getting a miscarriage is the best thing that could happen for her. (she would never get an abortion). I said I have literally nothing to gain or lose from her having a child but in her best interest she shouldn’t have a child. My boyfriend was totally upset with me saying that in private and said it was messed up and rude. Then the other night she called me at 12 AM saying she wasn’t pregnant anymore. She was bleeding and went to the doctors and found out she had a miscarriage. I cried and was sad because that is a traumatizing thing to go through and I feel horrible for her. Now my boyfriend is saying I am a horrible friend and that i was just faking being sad because obviously I wanted her to have a miscarriage. I tried to explain that I wasn’t HAPPY it happened I just want the best for her.m even though it’s tragic her future has so much potential.

The first time she wasn’t ready to move. The second time I confronted her about her flirting with another girl and she got mad. The third time she said she was scared because the next step was marriage and she wasn’t ready for that. And yesterday morning she broke up with me and said we were toxic. 
She doesn’t make enough money to pay half of rent and she doesn’t have a whole lot of friends where we live. 
Still, I told her she needed to get her stuff and move out. She asked me to give her some time but I don’t think I should be on her schedule when she has done this to me for four years now.

While most things are good, they have a housekeeper who I refuse to interact with any more.

Over the last year and a half, she has repeatedly spoken to my wife in Spanish in front of me (she knows I don’t speak the language), criticizing my food choices and calling me fat. She also, on other occasions when she was alone with my wife, has told her that I am a lazy, good for nothing person, and while my wife may be happy now, she says that we will likely be divorced within three years. (My wife and I are best friends and do everything we can for each other, so this part cuts especially deep.)

She has also been rude to my mom, who is the nicest person I know. 

My in-laws have told me that they’ve spoken to her, but nothing they’ve said has made a difference. There’s always a few weeks of mutual indifference, and then some new insult gets thrown my way. 

Despite this, when I am the only one around, I will frequently get asked to drive the housekeeper to her bus stop. I get it, she’s old and she has a limp, but I don’t feel like this is my responsibility.

I spent time with my family, my friends took me out, I had a lovely time except for one thing: my boyfriend did nothing for me. I got a happy birthday text but other than that no presents or plans of any kind. This did bother me so I brought it up with him and he told me birthdays aren't his thing, he doesn't even celibrate his own. I was disappointed but accepted that that's just the kind of guy he is, it's not like I had a bad birthday anyway. I made a metal note that he doesn't do birthdays left it at that. I feel the need to point out that this is a newish relationship, we've been together since last summer so we're still learning little things like that about eachother.

Fast forward to last weekend and Saturday was my boyfriend's birthday. We had a quiet night in, watched a movie, ordered take out and hung out. We were cuddling when he asked me what I got for him. I was surprised, said I didn't get anything and reminded of the conversation we had after my birthday. He pouted about it and asked why I didn't bother doing anything. I reminded him that he did nothing for mine, but he insisted it was different because I'm, in his words, ""A birthday person"". This honestly made me mad because this seems like a bullshit double standard. He does nothing for my birthday and that's okay, I do nothing for his and that's not okay? Seems like nonsense to me.

So my question here today is am I the asshole here? My boyfriend insists I am but I really don't think so.",488,3506,0.96

1830,Not the A-hole,"This happened like two hours ago, and although it’s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.

I’m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We’re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).

One of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)

Before she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.

Ashley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said “it just sounds like they’re both really insecure” and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).

I chimed in (this was a group convo) “it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure”. And Ashley goes “What? What did I do?” And I replied “date a 14 year old.” 

NOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn’t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. 

She got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was “too far”. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified “that was just for *insert my name here*”

We then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone’s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she’s no longer upset)

But I don’t think I was in the wrong, it’s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.

I've never had an issue with their relationship and have always been very happy for the both of them, he's stayed here multiple times, she's stayed at his home multiple times, he eats dinner with my family some nights. However, recently I discovered a string of very odd things to do with his mother, she told my daughter to think of her as her mother, calls her her future daughter, critiques some of the ways in which I raised her,  says once she's married her son then she'll finally have a good mother, but then I discovered something disturbing, my daughter told me she'd been feeling depressed and when her boyfriend told his mother she arranged an appointment herself, and told her if she's prescribed anything she has to take it. She didn't make me aware or simply offer advice, she acted like her mother and took care of it. When I told her I thought this was unacceptable, she told her son who berated my daughter about telling me, her boyfriend and his mother apparently have been pressuring my daughter to move into their home also. To me it's like she's trying to indoctrinate my child and turn her against me to make her more her own child, I don't want to come between them if they're happy but her boyfriends support of her actions and part in them has made me feel like the relationships underbelly is both toxic and manipulative, so I asked her to break up with him due to the countless red flags that make me fear for her safety.


UPDATE: I didn't realise how many replies this had gotten after reading and replying to just a few. Me and my daughter had a long conversation, in which she also revealed a lot of controlling and manipulative behaviours from her boyfriend as well as her mum, she's been to the doctor a few times and is starting therapy soon, she spoke to her boyfriend and it apparently turned into a big argument in which he defended his mother repeatedly, she decided to break up with him. She told me she feels unsafe around him and is taking an extended break from school due to her current health and I'll look into home schooling or transferring, whichever she chooses. To answer many of your concerns about our relationship, me and my daughter are very close, however with me being a single parent who had to work a lot to provide for us when she was younger, my daughter fears putting any stress onto me and has a habit of minimising her own struggles, we don't and never have had a difficult relationship. I'm not an anti vaxxer nor do I put down and ignore her mental health issues as some have speculated.

We are getting married next month and when discussing buying wedding rings he said he didn’t need one because he didn’t have a finger for it to go on. Now, he still had his right hand. I said I had always assumed that he would just wear it on his other hand, but he said as his father didn’t wear a ring he didn’t see how it was important. I suggested wearing the ring on a chain around his neck, he said he isn’t into jewellery (this is very true, he owns none).
This upsets me a lot. I don’t believe he has ill intentions, he dotes on me and would never be unfaithful to me. I’ve even had strangers in clubs/bars come up to me and tell me how adorable he is because they started conversations with him and he just immediately starts talking about me but thanks them for their interest. BUT I had always thought my husband would wear a ring.

AITA for being upset that he won’t wear a ring when we are married?

1838,Not the A-hole,"So for context, a few years ago my aunt and uncle got a new car and offered to give their old car to my uncles son, who didn’t want it , then they offered it to my other cousins and they declined as well. Finally they offered it to me, and of course I said yes I could really use another car! So they give me the car within a month it needs a new transmission and various other things costing over 3 grand and over the years I put at least another 2 grand into so at least 5 grand total. I drove this car everyday and put lots of miles on it, and the same with my other car which I knew was on the verge of needing a very expensive repair, so I planned on selling them both and getting something decent with lower miles. My dad opens his big mouth and tells my uncle I’m planning on selling the car he gave me so without even consulting me my uncle decides apparently with my fathers approval is going to take the car back and give it to his son who didn’t want it the first time around... I love my uncle and he has been very good to me but this was really out of character for him to just decide this without discussing it with me... so I can’t really argue because I don’t want to cause family drama. His son flys out I pick him up from the airport take him to the dmv and send him away with the car. I get a call a few  days later asking me why all these problems with the car have not been fixed? This is when I got upset and told him you know what? I didn’t want to put any more money into this car I already put in over 5 grand because I was planning on selling it, and I reminded him I that I told him before they took the car back that I put lots of miles on it and it’s far from perfect condition... am I the asshole for getting upset with him after he had the audacity to question why I didn’t give him the car back in perfect condition after he didn’t even discuss it with me first? So now of course that major problem with my other car that I knew was going to happen happened and now I have. Nothing to drive because I can’t afford the repair, when if I could have followed through with my original plan I’d be driving something decent right now. The whole thing is it ruined my plans I did a patchwork repair on my other car because I knew I was going to sell it but since I ended up having to continue driving it it’s fucked, and had I known at the time I wouldn’t be able to sell the car my uncle gave me I would have had my other car repaired fully with a warranty when I had the money at the time...

Edit: the car was transferred into my name, I transferred it back to my cousin. I felt like I couldn’t say no because my uncle has done a lot for me, and is normally very conscious about how other people feel... just not here it was very out of character for him.

Edit2: the part where I feel I was an asshole was when he called to complain things weren’t repaired and I basically said “ it’s not like I did no maintenance to the car I had this and this and this done and it cost me X so I think you have no right to complain about anything especially since you fucked up my plans and didn’t even ask how I felt about returning the car before just deciding yourself I would.”",44,27,0.93

I live in a nearby city and not always go back to my hometown (where she lives), but when I do we still hangout and really enjoy our time together. 
We were talking about getting back together and she told me she was working on it and that she would be able to be with me again soon, and it made me very happy. 
Last week I went back to my hometown to go to my friend's bday party, my plans were to smoke, drink, and have a good time with my sister and my friends. When I told her that I was going to a party she started asking me to take her with me. I tried to tell her that she would not appreciate the occasion, and that I'd like to have some time to myself, and that we could grab a beer on the next day and spend the whole day together. 
Of course she refused to accept. She said I was basically telling her that she's not good enough to hang out with me and my friends. I gave up on trying to explain to her that I just wanted to have some time to myself. 
A couple hours before the party I noticed that a few names were added to the invite list. Of course her name was there. I asked if she would really go to the party and she said that she was going with her friends (even though she only knew me and one other person in the entire party). 
When I got there and she saw me she started trying to kiss me but I didn't let her (multiple times). A few minutes after that she came to me holding hand with a guy and asked me if it was ok if she kissed him. 
I told her ""I am not your dad. You should do whatever you think is right"". 
So she kissed the guy right beside me, while I was watching. 
Needles to say that it ruined my night. After that I think she saw I was mad with her, so she kept trying to talk to me and kiss me for the next our or so, and then she left the party.

1842,Not the A-hole,"So obviously, my husband poops. When he goes to the bathroom, he takes his phone in with him and watches YouTube. I guess he uses this as private time and a moment to himself. 50% of the time, this is not a problem and is fine.

The other 50% of the time is when this habit reaches ridiculous heights. He can be in the bathroom anywhere to 20 to 40 minutes. His record is an hour, and I had no idea how his legs aren't just completely asleep. If he offers to help me with dinner after he uses the restroom, I know I will be making dinner alone. If we need to leave to get somewhere and he needs to use the restroom first, I know we're going to be late. It's especially frustrating when we're having an at-home date night and we need to pause a movie, and I hear him in the bathroom laughing. Mostly it is video game stuff, so not anything I am interested in watching. (For the record, he is not constipated nor does he have trouble going. If he can't find his phone he takes 5 minutes tops.)

I'm seriously thinking about asking him that if we're together, doing something, or going somewhere to please not take his phone in there with him. Part of me feels controlling, the other part feels that I am super tired of waiting on him. AITA?

EDIT: For the record, if we're doing our own things I don't care how long he's in the bathroom. It's when I end up waiting on him forever that I have a problem with it. I'd only ask him to leave his phone outside the bathroom in the latter situation.",37,78,0.95

It really cast a bad light on a day that was supposed to be happy. So I told my sister to just drop it. She became very upset and told me to shut my mouth and not comment on what I don’t understand.

Before we started to date I gave him a list of my yellow/orange/red flags as a human and warned him that it’s probably not a good time in my life to date me. He didn’t care and was okay with the following that I told him or he knew before hand:


* Less than a year ago I got out of an extremely abusive relationship and I don’t know what a good relationship looks like. And that I’m seeing a councilor at my school, which isn’t the best but I can’t afford anything else. 

* I’m a full time grad student who lives at home with her parents and I don’t have a job. Lots of my time is spent reading, writing, at the library, or doing volunteer work.

* School comes first and I still have 2 years to go. 

* I’m unemployed and have 0 income right now. I can’t share any expenses for dates, entertainment, trips, drinks, etc. 


I was extremely explicit in my warnings, and basically tried to convince him to not date me. Even though I know I want to be in a long term relationship again one day. He told me he was okay with paying for everything (he has a high paying job and we live in a very affordable area). I’ve tried to be courteous and suggest free/cheap things to do in the area, but he likes to do expensive things and doesn’t mind paying for two. I’ve enjoyed the time spent with him and we usually have a good time. We have a lot in common and have a lot of things to talk about. 


However, he made a few comments about me that were supposed to be a “joke” in front our friends (friends that he has known for a year, and that I’ve known from anywhere from 5-15 years) that has made me reconsider the relationship. 


While we were at dinner with friend he said a few things along the following: [….] “Tell me about it, not only do I have to pay for these things myself, I have to pay for her too!” and “Eventually I’d like to visit X place, but I’d have to pay for two [motions towards me] and I can’t do that now.” and “If somebody [motions towards me] ever gets a job then we can go do X activity with you guys too! haha, just kidding sweetie we know you’re still in school.”

Now I will defend her a bit; she said that all of her tables were currently (and usually) in the back, and we were seated closer to the front near the cab register and where the waitresses grabbed the food to deliver to tables.

We didn't pay too much attention to it until we asked for the check. And let me preface what I'm about to say next with this; I always tip 20% because I understand that servers don't get paid minimum wage and live off of tips. However, my waitress walked past us 4 times (behind the counter), rung up another table and talked to her coworkers within a 15-20 minute time since she gave us our check.

Now onto the story. Yesterday we went out to lunch with my mother in law, my husband, and my daughter. Lunch was fine, food was great, we talked and got along just fine. I even hugged her goodbye (I'm not a touchy person so hugging her is compromising and really affectionate for me) I thought all was well. Then I get home and see she posted on social media a picture of her, my husband, and my daughter, with a message about what a nice lunch she had with just the 2 of them. I went to the bathroom during lunch, where she quickly took the picture of the three of them. (I totally understand wanting some pictures without me and wouldve taken the picture had she asked) I didn't even know about the picture until I saw it on social media. And it honestly kind of upset me that she went out of her way to make it look like I wasn't there. I didnt mind the picture, just the sneakiness of taking it while I was in the bathroom and then not tagging me in the post about lunch like I wasnt there. (Yes I know its dumb that I'm upset about social media. It's just it seemed like our relationship was on the up and the post makes it seem like she still has beef with me) 

So when I saw the post I requested to tag myself in her ""check in"" to the restaurant we were at  and commented ""Lunch was great! I'm so glad the 4 of us could get together! :)"" admittedly it was pretty passive aggressively addressing that she intentionally excluded me, but I think to anyone else it just looks like I enjoyed lunch with my family.

1848,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR at bottom. 

For those of you who may not know, a spam Instagram account is a secondary account some people may have where they post photos that are unflattering, use it as a diary, etc. Last summer I (21F) found out my little sister (14F) had private one and I decided to follow it. Mostly because we don’t keep in touch as much since I’m away at college and figured it’d be nice to see what’s going on in her life. She accepted it but in hindsight I believe she didn’t realize it was my account. She has 1k+ followers on it so I may have just been lost in the crowd. Regardless, I was following her and thought her posts were mostly funny, but I started getting a bit concerned. I realized that she was acting inappropriately for her age (crude language, some sexual implications) as well as lying to my parents about where she was and who she was with when she went out with her friends. I didn’t act on that at the time because I didn't want her to get mad at me for snitching and lead to less of a relationship than we have already, but when she posted rudely about me, I confronted her. We were able to peacefully hash it out but she was surprised that I was following her in the first place.

The next day, I noticed she had blocked me on her spam and main account, but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to have drama again. A few says later she spent the night at a friends and considering her previous habit of not being truthful with my parents, I decided to make a fake Instagram page, followed randos from her follower list and then followed her spam. She accepted my request and I was able to see her posts again. The posts were still questionable but nothing I thought was worth mentioning. I stopped checking up on her as much and after I got a new phone a few months ago, I never logged into that account again until last week. 

I got curious about what she was up to after logging into it, I saw a video I’m concerned about. It’s her twerking and lifting her shirt up, which I think is extremely inappropriate considering her age. I never mentioned the account to my parents before but am now considering doing so because I’m worried about how sexually she’s portraying herself to her 1k+ followers at such a young age, but I can’t without admitting that I made the fake account to my sister and breaking her trust. AITA for making a fake account to keep tabs on her, and WIBTA if I told my parents what she’s been posting on it?

Tl;dr: I made a fake account to follow my little sisters spam account where I noticed she was being inappropriate and lying about her plans to my parents. Am now considering telling my parents after seeing a video she posted of her twerking and lifting her shirt to 1K+ people at 14 yrs old.",41,49,0.94

1851,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I were using the pull-out method and I got pregnant. I know, stupid. We've since started using condoms. 
I got the abortion pills (which we'd agreed I'd take if it ever came to that) and took them at home this weekend.

About 5 minutes after I took the pills, my boyfriend headed out to the gym. He asked me if I wanted to come as he was leaving, so I texted asking if he seriously thought I should work out while miscarrying, and he responded that he had forgotten. It bothered me a little that he didn't think to stay with me, but I figured I'd handle it on my own, so I didn't ask.

Less than a half hour later, I was in horrible pain, uncontrollably puking all over the bed, so I called him and asked him to come back. He came right away and put the sheets in the laundry, and everything else in the bathtub (I washed them the next day). He asked me if he could go back to the gym, but then seemed to feel bad (I was curled up in agony at this point) and said forget it. 

He stayed home for the rest of the night and got me water and ice packs whenever I needed them, which I really appreciate. 

But I was in horrible pain for hours, and I kept asking him to talk to me to distract me, and he would say like a sentance, and then go back to reading on his phone, until I reminded him to talk again. He kept saying he couldn't think of anything to say, but.  
A- he's a massively talkative person who I've spent hours listening to when he's on long winded rants, and now suddenly when I need him to say literally anything to keep me distracted, he's speechless.   
B- I asked if he'd read me a book, and he kept changing the subject when I'd suggest it.

I get not wanting to entertain someone for hours, but considering this pregnancy was both our responsibilities, yet I was the one going through the hell of the abortion, I feel like it's a fair ask that he at least read me a book while I sit in pain for the both of us.

I told him that I feel like he spent his time wishing he was anywhere but there, and he pointed out that he helped a lot and I wasn't being appreciative.

I'm grateful that he gave me physical support for what I couldn't get on my own, but I feel like he dropped the ball on emtional support, which I really needed.

AITA for being mad at the lack of emotional support? Should I just be grateful for the support he did provide and let it go?

Edit: people keep suggesting that my boyfriend was going through emotional distress over the abortion which caused him to shut down. He wasn't. I discussed it with him before and after. Neither of us were conflicted, feeling guilty, or otherwise stressing over the emotional aspects of the pregancy.

Regarding going to the gym, he stayed even after I texted him about the abortion, because he thought it would start at least an hour after I took the pills, so he'd have time to work out and come back. I'm not mad about that, he didn't know and he came back when I asked. I'm just mad about the lack of emotional support once he came home.",283,812,0.92
1852,No A-holes here,"As a hobby, my GF and I regularly dance West Coast Swing (obligatory plug - it's a lot of fun and super awesome). The culture is very low-key and casual. Anybody can ask anybody to dance, and it's expected you not refuse unless there's a reason (i.e. I'm taking a break, or I'm about to leave, need to go to the bathroom, etc). In my area there is usually several opportunities a week to go out dancing, which is pretty nice.

&#x200B;

GF has a close friend who also comes out regularly - chubby, and has been losing weight due to her dancing. Due to her newfound confidence in her body image, she's been gradually wearing less when going out. At this current point, standard outfit is a bra covered with a kind of lace see-through non-shirt outer-shirt (you know, the kinds that don't actually cover anything - that people wear over tank tops, etc).

&#x200B;

She likes dancing with me, and normally pulls me for a few songs - but it's just so uncomfortable at this point. I don't mind that she wears what she wears *per se* \- I'm glad she's more comfortable in her skin. But during the dance, hands go on back, hips, and shoulders - and it sets off my ""as a boyfriend to someone else, I shouldn't be doing this"" alarms. GF is very uncomfortable with it too, but doesn't want to cause conflict by asking her friend to wear a shirt in public.

1853,Asshole,"Background: my stepmother came into my life when I was about 5 or 6. I am the youngest of five children but the oldest three went with my biological mother. I grew up at odds with my stepmother and sister who generally teamed up on me as my father was working on the road 8-10 months/year. 

Fast forward to last year: 

Dad had been having a lot of health problems and appeared to be on his death bed. I was taking sick time off just to be with him. He'd go to bed and I'd have a couple drinks to blow off some steam before heading home (90 minute commute). I even cancelled a family trip to China that my wife planned to be by him (lost 1000s in flight and booking fees). Stepmom accuses me of using dad as an excuse to drink. I blow it off. 

Chirstmas comes. She asks what my son wants. ""A nice RC car."" She goes to Big Lots and the damn thing won't turn straight outta the box. Wife gets a super-used silver plated watch with chinks of silver missing everywhere disguised in a new box. Wife and son are upset but I tell them to be grateful. Nothing was said to stepmom. While visiting one day, she takes me aside, stares me right in the face, and accuses me of cheating on my wife. I never have. I blow it off.
 
Valentine's Day comes and I wish her a happy Ash Wednesday (she is Christian, I am not). She responds by saying she hopes I have something nice planned for my wife. I say we're going to a nice restaurant she wanted to go to. ""That's a bad idea. It'll be long waits and terrible service."" So I go off on her. No cursing, no name calling, but I brought her to justice on her previous offenses. Her reaction? ""We're making a lot of important decisions right now and you just made them easier."" Wow. Using my dad's poor health to threaten to take me out of the will (they have a very healthy retirement). 

I stopped talking to her. She and my sister stopped talking to us. Come to find out a couple months ago, she went to the hospital for jaundice. Dad is forbidden by her from telling me about her condition but she took a dozen people down to the Bahamas last week so it's probably pretty bad. Also, some of dad's comments lead me to believe she doesn't have long.

I couldn't be happier. My life has been relatively drama free since I cut her out. I am looking forward to spending my dad's last year or two without her in the picture. Not to mention, I think it's just desserts that she used my dad dying against me and now it seems she will go first. AITA here?",35,28,0.81
1854,Everyone Sucks,"I (F20) have been living with my roommate (F20) for about a year now. We’ve already made plans to move out and live with other people in a few months (unrelated to any of this). For the most part, she’s a really good roommate; she pays everything on time, cleans the whole apartment, is very quiet, and even though we aren’t friends per se we are friendly and get along pretty well.


She doesn’t really cook, and her side of the fridge/her cupboards are pretty much bare (like she literally just has condiments in the fridge right now). I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can’t afford to eat out). 


Starting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, or a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original). I didn’t really think much of it, or just assumed I was being absent minded.


Lately though, it’s been getting much worse and it’s clear she’s taking my food and trying to replace it (hence the products sometimes being slightly different). I’ve gone into the cupboards and found unopened packages of things that I KNOW I’ve already opened.


Last week I confronted her about this and she broke down crying and told me she’s been bulimic for a long time, she knows it’s wrong, but she can’t help binging on my food sometimes, et cetera. Also that she doesn’t want to be like this but she’s stuck on a waitlist for treatment. She was apologetic but I was still mad at her. I told her that I’m sorry she has that issue but it shouldn’t be my problem and if she needs to eat she can just buy her own food since her parents support her. She pointed out that she replaces everything she takes but it still bothers me knowing that someone is eating MY food. I understand there’s something wrong with her but it’s not like she can’t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people’s tables. I told her that and I don’t understand why this is any different; it’s not socially acceptable to take other people’s property regardless of what’s wrong with you. She also said she knows she not a good roommate because of this so she tries to make up for it by being good in other ways (like being the one to clean every week) and trying not to let her problems affect me (the examples she gave were not crying loudly or puking when I was home). I didn’t say it but I think it’s disgusting to know that someone has been regularly puking in my bathroom.


She cried in her room for a long time and we haven’t spoken or made eye contact since then, although I’m trying to be nice. I feel bad but I also don’t think I actually did anything wrong. We’re both 20, IMO it’s not unreasonable to expect her to control herself. Like do I want to eat a whole box of cookies? Sure, but I don’t because I know better. I’m just asking her to exercise the same restraint here. 


Am I the asshole?

Edit: I wish I had left out the bulimia part because everyone is fixating on that. It’s the stealing that bothers me, and I don’t think Im and asshole for asking her not to steal from me.",675,811,0.85

1856,Asshole,"Our dad mellowed out quite a bit after I was born but back when my brother Jeff was younger, he was a real prick, as Jeff would put it. 

Jeff said Dad would knock him around when he drank (which was all the time), would constantly yell and berate both him and Mom, and was just an all around shitty human. 

I’m not sure what happened when I was born but dad mellowed out a lot after I was born. Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he’s never looked back. 

I know that he got sober not long after my birth so I’m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn’t entirely Jeff’s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. 

Well, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom & I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn’t helping at all with the funeral planning. 

She asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. 

I went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. 

He went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with “that asshole’s” funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn’t want to cause any more problems so I left. 

I haven’t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I’m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn’t want to help. 

So AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom’s sake?

1857,Asshole,"My(34f) husband (37M) said he was going to take me on an incredible date to Chicago were we would stay over and see a show, a play and have a good meal. This was supposed to be my birthday gift.

The main show cancelled and so the date was cancelled. I thought he might get me flowers or take me to see a movie but nothing happened.

A month later we were sitting at the kitchen table and I told him that I was bothered that he made this big sweet promise and then didn't do anything at all for my birthday.

Right then and there he bought tickets to a different show on a weekday that I can't go to. So now we're having to give those tickets away.

I honestly didn't want a gift I had to ask for anyway.

We had a fight about it last night.

Now we're in this catch22 that sucks really bad. If he tries to make up for not keeping his word, it's because I asked him to do it which doesn't (in my book) count for as much. I was raised that having to asking for apologies, good deeds, and affection takes away from their meaning. OR, if he does nothing he's kind of not admitting that he fucked up.

From my perspective I just feel like shit about the whole thing. I don't want my husband to think it's okay to promise me things and not follow through, I feel taken for granted because I had to basically ask for an apology. Last night he did apologize. It still stings pretty bad that he hasn't actually DONE anything to show me he loves me and messed this one up.

I told him I'm just going to forget the whole thing happened and not equate his lack of gift or apology with him not caring for me because I know we both just want to move on and not be upset about this anymore.

1858,Not the A-hole,"So my family is Catholic, and proudly so. They regularly go to church and signed me up to CCD (3 hour class for kids to learn about Jesus). When I was younger,  I was also a Catholic,  so I didn't mind going. 

However,  for the past few years I have been an atheist, and no longer believe in the Christian god. I brought this up to my mom, and the conversation went something like this. 

Me- (Explaining I am an atheist and I don't want to go to church/CCD because I no longer share those believes) 

Mom- Well why not? Your brother went through confirmation, and so did your dad and I. We are Catholics. 
(Getting confirmed is a sacrament in the Catholic Church where you stand in front of a priest and say ""I reject Satan,  I believe in God,  I believe Jesus rose from the dead,  etc. This gives you the right to get married in a church. ) 

Me- Well, you are Catholics,  but I am not. I don't believe in God anymore, and I don't want to practice those beleifs in church or CCD. You can go without me,  I don't care, but i just don't want to go anymore. 

Mom- Too bad,  you're going to church and you're going to get confirmed. As long as you are under my house,  you are a catholic,  end of story. 

I left it at that because clearly the conversation was going nowhere. I understand that parents have 'control' of their kids until they turn 18, but I think this is crossing boundaries. 

AITA for not wanting to go to church or CCD with the family. 

EDIT: So after reading the responses I've decided to talk to the priest about it,  and tell him I'm an atheist. He's a pretty chill guy,  so I think he'll understand.

Long story short, we end up a party at like 330 and everyone is doing coke (not me), including her, and they're all in the bathroom for like 45 mins.

1865,Not the A-hole,"So, I am a music student at a public university. The past two years we have had a visiting professor for the instrument I play. In this time, he has threatened to fail multiple people for mundane reasons, encourages hazing of ""lazy"" students (also known as students with jobs), and has told students they should leave and never come back if they have to have a job and not commit to the instrument. 

The final straw was earlier this semester, when he told all of his students minus the few he was targeting to isolate the rest of us. He said we were unethical in our practice sessions, a bad influence to the studio, and shouldn't be there. The funny thing is, this worked. Out of the 21 people on the instrument, 6 of us (including myself) were completely ignored except when we were being harassed to quit. 

I'm a senior, and so are two others. One of the other 3 are dropping out after this semester because of this. The other two are trying to stick through it, but one of them is a freshman and her mental health is taking a decline. She is being treated the worst; these other students have been cornering her and telling her she's worthless, and no one likes her, and she should quit. Basically your typical high school bullying, except the teacher told them to do this and we're all adults.

There is currently a search for a permanent position, and this professor is a finalist. In retaliation, I and everyone else being harassed wrote formal letters describing everything that has happened to us. We have also spoken to multiple people on the hiring committee and the dean of the music building. I took it one step further and went outside of the school of music to talk to the dean of students, who specifically deals with students' well beings.

I never met the guy and I only know about him from what my girlfriend said about him. Basically they had been friends for years (since their freshman year in college) because they were in the same small program and dated for about 2 years before they broke u. They had been broken up for 2 months when we started dating.

&#x200B;

Apparently he had issues with drugs for a long time but she thought he was clean when they started dating but then he started them again during their relationship. Initially she tried to be supportive and help him through the addiction and help him get sober but it was too much strain on the relationship and he started becoming emotionally abusive so they eventually broke up. She's kind of a goody two shoes type girl who is super studious, who doesn't even party much and it kinda seems this guy was her ""bad boy phase."" Again I've never met the guy, this was just the impression I got from him.

Anyway he sadly died 1 month ago from an accidental overdose and my girlfriend was devastated. His parent invited her to the funeral which I thought was a bit odd but I was supportive of her going. It seems she blames herself partly for his death.

However I soon started getting annoyed at some of the things she keeps doing. She has posted 5 pictures of him on her instagram since his death. I get she was mourning but I don't think all mourning has to be pubic on social media and that was even more pictures that we have together on her social media. I think it unnecessary and disrespectful to me. I told her this bothers me and she kind of brushed it off and acted like I was over reacting but said she would stop.

Then yesterday i found out she got a tattoo of a guitar with his initials on it. The tattoo is about 4 inches long.   Her ex was an avid guitar player. Obviously I was really mad. She didn't even consult me or check with me if it was okay and just got a permanent reminder of her ex on her body. This obviously wasn't a spur of the moment decision either.She only has one other tattoo which honours her late grandmother and her own parents hate tattoos and were mad she got that one.

1868,Not the A-hole,"Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

On to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""Taking public transportation is for losers"". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

The real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

After a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

I have a 16 old brother, 13 old sister, and 3 more brothers who are 11, 9 and 3. I pay part of the rent every month and am living at home with everyone until I go to Uni in Spetember.

We lived in a cramped house atm, only 3 rooms between all of us. Dad doesn't live with us and I should be going to uni in September. I work most days of the weeks but the days I am home she gets me to babysit my 3 year old brother. Every. Single. Time.

And when I say I'm going out on my days off, which isn't often, she says ""oh"" and has this look of almost annoyance on her and it makes me feel bad. It just feels like all I am here for is to be a second parent to my little brother, it's gotten to the point where he's accidentally calling me mum which is sweet but concerning. He's my brother, not my child. It just frustrates me because I know she won't be able to get me to babysit once I'm at Uni, so it just feels like shes taking advantage of me whilst I'm here. My brother goes to preschool in the mornings as well from 8-1 so it's not like hes constantly home either. 

She doesn't ask my 16 year old brother, because he's just gets annoyed with her and it's against the law to leave minors alone with him because of his age. But it just puts more pressure on me to say yes because in her mind I have no reason to say no to babysitting. So if I do say no shes bound to get annoyed at me.

Dont get me wrong I didn't used to mind the odd time I needed to babysit, because he can be a handful and she deserves a break from him for a few hours. But it's just gotten to the point where I can predict when she's gonna ask me to babysit. I know it's more convenient for her to leave him with me whilst she does her shopping or goes to pick up my other siblings from school, but she makes me feel like she can't do those things unless I babysit, which I know she can because she does it when I'm working.

I guess it's not the babysitting itself I'm annoyed with, it's the fact that she expects me to at this point and it's making me angry with her.

So Reddit, AITA?


Edit: I haven't spoken about it with her in fear of upsetting her. I'd feel like even more of an adshole if I did :(

Edit: Okay so turns out I was wrong about the law lol and my 16 brother CAN babysit. My mum had always just told me that kids cant be left alone without someone over 18, sorry!



Update: spoke to mum. She got a little upset at first but agrees that my brother needs to pull his weight a bit and help babysit as well. She said that she appreciates the help very much and that she'll ask more in advance in the future rather than the second I get a day off just so I get time off as well :) Thank you all SO much for your help, it's meant the world! ❤",69,193,0.96
1871,No A-holes here,"This is a bit of a ongoing issue I have...

My girlfriend stays with me 99 percent of the time but has her own place, she doesn't stay there and stays with me.

I get up at 5:30 every morning for work, she works at 9am so gets up after I leave in the morning.

I live in a loft style bachelor apartment, it's big for a bachelor but the main area is still all one room except for the kitchen and bathroom.  I have a remote controller three direction light on the ceiling. It shines a light towards one wall, the other and then onto the loft bed. When I wake up in the morning after my alarm goes off I use the remote and turn on two of the lights and leave the one facing my bed off. This is so it does not shine directly on the bed. I also put the radio on in the kitchen to listen to the news when I get up.

My girlfriend constantly get mad at me in the mornings for turning the radio and lights on so early. She wants me to turn on a little lamp that's below the loft and does not light up the whole room. If I did this I would be fumbling around in the dark, trying to locate all my things to get ready and go and it would generally be a struggle every morning. She also wants me to not turn on the radio as it bothers her but it helps wake me up and start my day.

I'm going to keep turning on the light and radio, I love her to death but this is where I put my foot down. She's staying at my apartment that I pay for, if I want to turn the light and radio on in the morning to get ready I'm going to keep doing it. I am gone within 40 minutes of getting up and she gets to go back to sleep, which she does with no problem every morning.

Am I the asshole here?  


Edit: I just want to add if I get after her for having the TV too loud when I'm trying to go to sleep since I go to bed before her she makes a big deal about that so I just learnt to accept it. Seems like a bit of a double standard. ",70,97,0.95

ok so, this is my first reddit story but i wanted to share this somewhere. i've been friends with a person for a few years now, and they're alright. however, they are a little... how should i put this.... a little unruly, stuff like smoking paper and cigarettes, underaged drinking and openly discussing how they'd like to shoot up our high school. anyways, for a while they would send me gross, messed up or extremely lewd art of characters from shows or games i liked, or make gross comments about one of my original characters, and it seriously ticked me off. i asked them to stop several times and they didn't. i blocked them a few times, but ultimately i still wanted to be friends and i still wanted to talk to them, so i unblocked them every time. i did warn them though, every single time.

one day, they sent me something of a show i liked, a seriously messed up comic. i, of course, reacted with a 'hey wtf', and promptly blocked them, without warning them first this time. then they messaged me on another account, and the conversation goes as follows:

f = friend

me = yours truly

f: yo hi i'm not mad or anything but can i ask why you blocked me on \[other account name\]? i'm genuinely not mad, i'm just confused, i don't think i did anything to upset you this time

me: stop fricking sending me gross art of things i like

f: dude im- f\*ck off,, its literally just art, its not like its real jfc. i understand it makes you uncomfortable and yes i probably should have stopped sending you that sh\*t but if i remember correctly, most of that stuff i sent had an nsfw warning, you can literally choose not to look at it. like, if youre going to block me over some immature shit like that warn me first, yeah?

now after reading this message, i am absolutely livid. nothing they sent me had a nsfw warning. i did warn them, several times, and each time they ignored it. 

me: literally nothing you sent me had a nsfw warning. and i also told you to stop so many times surely you'd have seen it coming

f: its just? such an immature reason, i dont undrstand

f: like f\*ck, you could send me bloody animals gore or some sh\*t and yeah i'd be disgusted but i wouldn't block you

as im reading what they send, i'm growing angrier and angrier. im thinking 'tf??????' i'm immature? ok lol

i should mention that at the time of this, i wasnt doing very good mentally, and i liked these shows because they were fun and made me feel happy. and the thing is, my friend knew about all of this as i'd often talk to them about it in detail

every time i told them to stop, the downright said no, literally saying at one point, 'why not persist to make your life miserable?'

anyways, we still talk from time to time, they moved towns and i dont see them often. so, i just want to know, am i the asshole in this situation?

TLDR- friend gets mad at me for blocking them when i told her several times to stop sending me lewd art of shows i like, calling me immature for blocking them for this reason",18,32,0.92
1876,Not the A-hole,"ok sooo, I'm still in college and my boyfriend has a full-time job. we've been together for the past 5 months and he got into an car accident (wear your seatbelts, people) that has left him paralyzed waist down. since the accident he has been bedridden. not really sure but I think he will get a wheelchair when his shattered femur heals. 

so, not to make myself the victim, but this has put an incredible strain on my studies. he calls me during my classes to make me do his errands, pick up his painkillers, drop off parcels at the post office, make him breakfast, lunch and dinner etc. some days when he doesn't need my help with anything during the day, I spend time caring for him during the evening which cuts my effective study time short, plus the relationship hasn't been THAT serious, more like a more committed fwb thing

I have supported her through countless hardships and two years into the friendship I realised it wasn't a two way street. As soon as I had any kind of trouble she told me she couldn't talk about it. 

She has 3 instagrams and has legitimately posted a photo every 30 mins she was in hospital just to have her own little pity party. Her reason for being in hospital was real and that but she made it into such a show of woe is me. 

She just went to hospital again and messaged me for the first time in a year in a half. She asked about the only thing she knew about my life and then by the third message was complaining about her life. 

Would I be an asshole if I told her I did not care and that I was sick of only being messaged by her when she wanted a pity party? 

Keep in mind I have seen her update her 15 best friends  that she loves from her hospital bed. She has no shortage of people to pity party with she just likes an audience. 

Edit: sorry for being unclear. I have seen her in the past year and a half if infrequently. We are both part of a larger friend group and every time there is a party she is all over me. Hugging me and saying how much she has missed me. 

We also went to the same university. When we did run into each other on campus she would sit me down and spend an hour talking about how shit her life is. While simultaneously mentioning how poor she is when  her parents literally give her hundreds of dollars every week. Hundreds more than the rest of us have in our weekly budget. 

This is the first time she has messaged me in a 1 on 1 chat in over a year. Not the first time I've talked to her. Sorry for not making that more clear. ",19,59,0.88

 He has to leave every morning at 10:30AM to get to the train station to take him to the city. He thinks it's a dick move that I don't want to wake up every day and drive him there and that I'm making him Uber.

From my perspective, he's already staying at my house and being fed which is already a huge favor. I don't think I should be expected to drive him there every day.

1879,Not the A-hole,"I told my wife earlier last week that we are really struggling with money and we shouldn’t buy anymore new things for the new place we’re renting. She said she wanted to buy a new coffee table to match the tv stand, I reluctantly said okay fine given the style might go out of stores soon. 
We got a new couch, I said we don’t need to buy anything else. She agreed. Then one day she goes, We need new cushions even though we had so many which she decided to throw away. I said no we don’t, we don’t need to keep spending money on things.

Today, she comes back home with new cushions. I cracked it and told her off for spending money we could put towards our savings. 

I know you might think, “they’re just cushions” but I feel like agreeing that we aren’t spending any more money on random things and then going out and doing the complete opposite is a betrayal of my trust. 

AITA?

Edit: she also noted that she wanted to buy food to eat today but decided to spend that money on the cushions, I said well, we have plenty of food at home. I avoid spending while I’m working because we can put that money towards our savings. ",105,254,0.95

My dad died 3 years ago. He had a huge collection of over 100 classic rock records (some of which are signed) and some memorabilia and he wanted me to have it because I'm the only one in family that loves this music.

My mom and my two younger brothers (14 and 12) are a bit short on money. Their storage water heater broke and they don't have money for a new one, and it would take a few months to save up for it.

I promised mum that I'd help them financialy as much as I can (I'm a student but I get enough money from art commisions and work), but even with my help it's not enough. Mum is urging me to sell my dad's records because apparently they'd get them enough money for new water heater, but I refused . Mum is obviously angry at me now and I feel incredibly guilty, but I just can't sell them. They remind me of my dad and bring him back to me a little bit. Plus, he spend his whole life collecting them and getting them signed and he knew I'd take care of them.

So, AITA?

Update: Idk if anyone is going to see this update, but whatever.
I talked to my brother and he told me that mum was saving up for a holiday and is going to use that money to buy the water heating - the savings are going to cover most of the price. My aunt and uncle are more than willing to borrow her the rest of the money and my uncle is going to install the heater for free. 

Mum has always hated asking somebody for help (especially financial) and she wanted to take my brothers to a holiday for a long time, so she is still really angry at me (according to brother). 

In the meantime, brothers (and mum, if she stops holding the grudge) are going to come and take a shower at my flat because it's a 10 minute walk from their place.

Some commenters were worried about mum selling the records behind my back - you don't have to worry about that. They are safely hidden and locked in my bedroom. She would have to literally break into the apartment complex, my flat and kick the door to my bedroom down to do it.",58,90,0.94

I watched him turn from a teenage apprentice to a head chef to business owner and back to sous chef after losing it all through stupid mistakes (drugs) hes now 26 this year , lives in a shithole home with his parents and 4 younger brothers (nothing wrong with the structure or the parents they just never clean up after themselves) he met a girl about 6 months ago and they are officially in a relationship. Hes changed (obviously) so now I don't see him as much and when I do it with his gf .. again not a problem she's actually quite nice.  Just in that 21 year old ""let's party"" frame of mind constantly .. anyway... 

The last 3 or 4 times I saw him he was asking me a lot of questions about kids (having had my own son at 26 under very different circumstances eg my own place in a relationship for 6 years etc etc ) so I out right asked him if his gf was pregnant he said ""no but we are going to start trying soon"" 

I told him straight ""You aren't ready for a child , you need your own space, you are in massive debt, you have only been with your gf 6 months you still have so much to learn about each other, you work like 100 hour weeks, how are you going to do that with a baby keeping you up all night "" he told me I don't know what I'm talking about  and if I can do it at 26 so can he. 

I've had to bail him out 3 times in his life due to him jumping the gun to early and I feel like hes using the thought of a baby to distract him from his current problems

My brother is pretty private about his relationships, so I don't really know what happened between the two of them. My siblings and I all tried to talk to him in the weeks after the wedding but he just said he didn't want to talk about it. 

The holidays came and went and we found out he was traveling with his ex over winter break, which is cool, we all honestly had no idea that they were still together. I had seen my brother a few times since, but since he had always said he didn't want to talk about it, we didn't bring it up.

I had taken a bunch of photos and was showing them to her, and she seemed interested. I honestly didn't think twice that it might upset her. 


Well, my brother texted the family group chat later that I was being a huge asshole to her, that the gf had to go to the bathroom during dinner to have a cry. He said that they're working on their relationship and there were hurt feelings and feelings of embarrassment on both sides, and it has been difficult being public about the relationship again and now his gf feels  unwelcome by me.

He decided to get a trampoline for his grandkids and kept it in his back yard, close to my property line, but still in his yard. For those of you who haven't experienced it, trampolines act like a kite in heavy winds and his is no different. During a pretty strong wind storm the trampoline sailed into my house and damaged some siding and a downspout. I'm pretty handy, so I told him what happened but I can fix it with extra material I had laying around. I told him not to worry about the damage as it only took me an hour or so to fix, but I asked him to anchor down his trampoline so it wouldn't happen again, especially since it came dangerously close to my brand new air conditioner unit. 

About a year passes since this event and I never saw any anchors for the trampoline, but I never looked too closely. We had a nasty wind storm across most of the US last month. I decided to aimed my security camera at the trampoline/my house in case this became a insurance nightmare over trampoline damage my brand new air conditioner. 

The storm wakes me up at 4 am and I see the trampoline in my yard, very close to my new air conditioner unit. I go outside and drag the trampoline to the middle of his yard, as far from my house as possible and go back to bed. When I wake up a few hours later I see the trampoline is upside down on his patio, the frame of the trampoline is damaged and a window is cracked on his house. If I didn't move the trampoline to the middle of his yard, it without a doubt would have damaged my house. 

AITA for moving the trampoline to his yard and causing it to break/damage his house?

1895,Not enough info,"Backstory: I(M) have a son(10) with an ex-girlfriend. We have been broken up for about 8 years and have both moved on in our own lives. About 5 years ago, she met the man who she is currently married to while working in the County right underneath where we are from. 

She married the guy, moved down there with him, which is about 50 miles south, and they had a kid. I also got married and had my own kid as well. 

We’ve always been civil and would meet halfway to switch my son off every weekend. I would get him Friday after school and return him Sunday afternoon. 

About a year ago my EX got a job at a hospital in her city that required her to work nights. Her husband took over switching my son with me on the weekends. This was working for us. 

Just recently, maybe 3 months ago, she and her husband separated. He stopped putting as much effort into caring for my son. And while he still does watch him while she works, he has refused to drive halfway to switch off with me anymore. 

This has me driving 100 miles round trip to get him for 2 days and then driving 100 miles round trip to take him back. 200 miles total. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to tell my ex that we should maybe work it out to an every other weekend visit, (which is what the courts mandated.

I just broke up with the love of my life because she absolutely is dead set determined to attend Naturopathic school in order to work with cancer patients. She believes that vaccinations lead to autism and a whole heap of pseudoscience that basic science disproves such as homeopathy . I believe alternative medicine that works is just normal medicine. I understand that the world is over prescribed, doctors are just prescribing medication to negate the symptoms as opposed to digging deeper to treat the root cause of the issue. But I am not willing to go back to the dark ages of science because modern medication works. I think that ND's have there place in this world as a alternative to modern medicine.

1904,No A-holes here,"This was a couple years ago, with a former roommate, F. We lived in an apartment that did not allow pets, as per the lease. Several cats wandered around the complex, and my roommate ended up taking a liking to a kitten. F would take the kitten inside, feed him, and otherwise care for him any time F was home. He was cute, as all kittens are, but I was always begrudgingly opposed to taking him in, on account of it being a lease violation that could cost us the apartment. F didn't care, and dug in further, getting proper cat supplies, and getting the kitten fixed. He let the kitten out when he was at work and keep him inside otherwise. 

After a few weeks of this, the kitten was attacked by some of the older cats and his stitches from the fixing were torn on top of other severe injuries. F told me that his finances were wiped out from the cat supplies and getting him fixed, and asked me to cover the ~$300 operation, or the kitten would have to be put down due to the injuries. I ended up deciding to decline, as he already owed me a lot of money from backed up bills and I had been opposed to taking in the adorable lease violation in the first place. Without my money, he had to have the kitten put down. This understandably tanked our relationship for the remaining 7 months we lived together.

I bring this up now because I've since moved out and became a cat dad myself, in an apartment that allows it. I grew up with pets, but this is the first one that's actually my own. It's given me a lot more context into his feelings at the time, since it was the first pet he'd ever had in his life, and the pain I caused him as a result of my decision. Was I the asshole after all in this situation?",223,274,0.91

1908,Asshole,"Background: I’m 26f and engaged to a guy I thought was the one. I love him so much it hurts and I can’t bear the thought of life without him. We have a great life together.

One of his fantasies is me with another girl. He’s said he’d love to see it, he loves to hear stories about the dew times in college i kissed other girls and he loves it when I tell him stories about other girls while we are having sex. 

Edit: one of his biggest fantasies is actually exactly what I describe below, his fantasies don’t  differentiate between him being present and watching or me doing it with out him around. 

I went on a girls trip this weekend. On the trip was a very cool girl I’d never met before and she and I stayed in and drank wine while all the other girls went to a movie and club. One thing led to another and we ended up completely booking up in the Airbnb. It was very fun and felt amazing but we both agreed that it was just a hook up and no emotions, it wouldn’t happen again and that the only people we’d tell were the respective men in our lives because her husband has similar fantasies. During the whole thing I was so excited at how turned on my fiancé would be when I told him what happened. 

Well just got home and was so happy to see him and i told him what happened. He freaked the fuck out and told me I cheated. I asked him how was it cheating if he’d tacitly given me “permission” by telling me hundreds of times how much he wants me to hook up with other girls. He said I should be smarter than that and it was “just pillow talk.” I cried and cried and told him how sorry I was but I did it “for him.” He said that was bullshit and stormed off and the last thing he said before apparently turning off his phone was “not coming home, need to re-evaluate if this is the relationship for me.” 

I’m devasted but can see this going both ways. I didn’t mean to hurt him in fact just the opposite but part of me sees his point. 

Am I the asshole here? Please help me see this more clearly.

1909,Not the A-hole,"So basically my brother, his wife, his son (M 14), and his daughter came down to our place to visit us, me and my girlfriend. So over dinner we started talking about the gym, since my brother and his wife are trying to be a better and healthy family, and on the subject, my nephew started talking poorly about the gym's community. When asked why he was being so negative, he told us that when he was working out on a machine, this 30 year old came and asked him to move. The nephew declined as he was using the machine and he wasn't done working out yet, so he wasn't just going to move because this random man asked him. His parents started saying that he did wrong and soon, my girlfriend agreed with them. I was surprised and I strongly disagreed because he was on the machine so he didn't have to move until he was finished with it. His parents reasoning for why their son was wrong was because he was younger, and since he was younger, his workout wasn't as important as the man's workout. I thought that was total bull crap, since age doesn't determine how important a workout is. Both my nephew and the man were trying to benefit their body, so they were equal, and age doesn't matter. Anyway, after dinner, my brother started talking shit to me and how I was wrong because ""respect your elders"" and that crap. I kinda feel bad since I'm not my nephews father and I kinda disrespected his father in front of him. Anyway, AITA?

It has potential to be biast, and knowing that my cousin is a teenager, it might be. But he’s a great guy to know and he’s really nice and he doesn’t tend to be biast, which I am very proud of.

1911,Everyone Sucks,"I wasn't even planning on posting here but I told my roommate about this story, and he (more or less) called me a douchebag, but I don't agree.

Last night I went to a bar after visiting a friend of mine. I just wanted something to drink and I was feeling good so I said to myself why the hell not? Anyways I sit down at the bar. I'm casually talking with the bartender and shooting the shit with some drunk dude next to me. After a few minutes a guy and a girl come in and the girl sits next to me. I greet them and turn back to the dude next to me. Sometimes the girl asks me something and I slowly join their conversation, I thought everything was cool.

When the girl left for the bathroom, the guy she was with turned to me and asked what I was doing. I asked him what he thought I was doing, and he said that he was on a date with the girl and that I was getting in the way. I told him I wasn't doing it on purpose, but that I would leave them alone. So I go back to talking with this drunk fuck next to me. 

After maybe 15 minutes the dude leaves for the bathroom, and the girl immediately turns around and starts talking to me. She was being incredibly flirty. I'm talking going out of her way to touch me for whatever reason, laughing at everything I say and making strong eye contact. I noticed that she was really attractive and our conversation went smooth, and when the guy came back she was barely paying any attention to him.

To keep it short, she started blatantly hitting on me, and she ended up coming home with me and we slept together. Initially I felt bad for the dude but she clearly made a choice, and I gladly accepted it. I don't feel like I did anything wrong. Am I the asshole in this situation?

1912,Not the A-hole,"When sister 1 got married it was kind of a all hands on deck situation.  She was pregnant and neither her or her boyfriend had very much money.  My mom paid to rent out the fire hall and for the kegs of beer.  I paid for and cooked all the food.  My other two sisters set up the tables and chairs as well as the decorations.  

The food was pretty expensive and both sister 1 and her boyfriend kept adding requests, literally up until a couple hours before the wedding itself.  It was a lot of work and I really didn’t enjoy doing it.  

What kind of sealed the deal as far as not ever wanting to do this again was during the toasts sister 1’s boyfriend thanked my mother and sisters for all that they did.  I know it’s petty to be so miffed about not being thanked, but it did really rub me the wrong way to be the only one overlooked after I just dropped so much money and work for them. 

Sister 2 is getting married now.  It’s not really the same situation.   Her fiancé has an ok job as far as I know they can afford to have it catered.  While she was talking about it came out that she assumed that I would cater hers since I did sister 1’s.  It’s not a ridiculous assumption or anything, but I corrected her that I really didn’t want to do that kind of thing ever again. 

She didn’t say anything at the time, but I guess she’s angry at me about it.  Both my other sister and mother have texted me about it now.  I can see how it would look a little shitty to do it for sister 1 and refuse to do it for her, but I really don’t want to drudge up years long shit from the previous wedding to explain.  Besides it was out of necessity for sister 1’s wedding.  Sister 2’s situation is different.",30,44,0.98
1913,Not the A-hole,"Note: My mother is paralyzed from the waist down, I also used to work with kids who have autism worse than his brother. His brother hates all women to the point that if anything touched by a woman goes near him it must be cleaned or removed. He is also very manipulative and abusive to everyone in their family.

Ok, so throughout our relationship my boyfriend's little brother frequently calls him in a panic asking for money or to get him things or take him places. This has gotten worse because he is back home for his last couple of semesters in college. Since he's moved back home his brother's demands have grown out of control where he runs out of my house to his brother's bidding. I used to (emphasis on used) go to their house every Friday to spend time with his younger sister and parents (his brother, like most autistic people, prefer to be alone), now almost every Friday they cancel or change plans on me last minute, I have ADD and anxiety so changing plans usually makes me upset but I also think that's a part of my personality.

One of the things my boyfriends family did to change plans on me last minute was decide to change plans, but not tell me and then alert me the day before around 10 pm (22:00) that I was to come to their house later because his brother wanted to go out to eat with just him, and it had to be Friday because Friday's are special. I just broke down at that point, my lizard was sick and I thought I was going to get to be with people who supposedly care about me. It was not my best moment.

His brother does a lot of things that I find really mean and rude. That says a lot because I worked with a girl who had violent outbursts and would curse at me but she never was malicious and his brother is. My heart hurts to see this 18-year old abuse their family like that.

Recently I told my boyfriend that his brother's behavior toward his family specifically his sister and mother was too much for me to handle, I said I was especially horrified that my boyfriend wouldn't tell his brother that you couldn't speak to your own mother like that. I said I would not be returning on Friday nights indefinitely and would only see his family if it was a large familial event like a wedding or reunion (we are Hispanic so it happens a lot). I've confided to my parents about this who both work with disabled people since my mom is one and my dad works in a clinic for people with brain injuries. They said this was something I couldn't avoid if I loved my boyfriend and wanted to stay with him.

My boyfriend also wants his brother to move in with us after he graduates college at his parent's request (I want to go into a grad program so I'll still be in school). Because of this, I have considered breaking up with him.

I know it sounds selfish but my heart is breaking. Am I a jerk for wanting my boyfriend to spend time with me that doesn't include changing everything around so that he can focus on his brother? I'm so conflicted and so hurt at the same time.

edit: clarity on who wants to move in with who

Edit: Thanks Everyone, I called him and we talked. It went poorly he said he never thought of how his brother treated anyone could be abusive but he knew he was an enabler. He said he never thought about how I would react because I am very comfortable with disabled people, considering it was my job for a while. He still wants his brother to move in with us at some point in his life but they are not going to try and give him therapy because they thought his behavior would improve as he got older and not get worse. At this point, I broke down because the only thing I could see in my head was a daughter we had getting treated like his sister and mother, or a son thinking it's ok to act like that and either be abusive or compliant. We are going to talk tomorrow because I started having a panic attack. 

Edit: thanks guys for your input you've made me realize I'm not being sensitive and crazy and that my feelings are not based on not getting attention but real issues like avoiding abuse and dangerous situations. I'm not sure what to do moving forward but it's really nice to not feel irrational  or crazy. ",28,48,0.94

1915,No A-holes here,"My gf [30F] and I [26M] recently went through an extremely difficult time a few months ago. Jan 2019, her 7 year old son passed away (epilepsy). She also has her daughter (10) and I have my son (5). 

We have been dating for nearly 2 years now, and have an extremely healthy relationship. Amazing communication, trust, and intimacy. We plan on moving in together the summer of 2019, just a few months away. Considering it's me, her, and our 2 kids, I plan on getting us a 3 bedroom house. Here is where the issue comes in:

She suggests that we get a 4 bedroom or 5 bedroom (4th bedroom would need to be for my office, as I work from home). She wants the extra bedroom to put together her son's room exactly the way it is at her house now (she hasn't touched it since the day he passed, understandably so.) I informed her that buying a larger house is going to really be stretching our budget, and we may not be able to make it happen.

Please note that at this point, I have not exactly expressed to her that I don't want to use up a room on a replica of her son's room. It's space that we would actually need to use (God I feel terrible even saying that.)

At one point, she even suggested that if we get a 3 bedroom house, that she would put her son's stuff (bed, dresser, clothes, etc.) in MY son's room. I just don't think that's fair to my son to have to go through that.

I love her very much, and plan on proposing later this year. Our kids love each other and we are an extremely happy [blended] family. Obviously there's no way she can be the asshole in this situation, considering she's just grieving from the tragic loss of her son, but I honestly feel like I'm not being exactly an asshole either..

With that being said.. Am I The Asshole for not wanting to use up, or spend extra money on a significantly bigger house, for her son's furniture?



EDIT: Her son was mentally challenged (dravet syndrome) so he could not speak, use the toilet, eat correctly. His furniture and room smell like urine, so that's another reason I wouldn't want to transfer them over. NOT the main reason, but a factor, nonetheless.


UPDATE: So her and I did get a chance to talk about this tonight (March 24th), and she is very firm about not wanting to see a grief counselor. She’s had multiple counselors growing up, and she is strongly against being in a 1 on 1 session with one. She does not want to do any type of group sessions either. I’m going to contact the support group for the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, as they have board members that will reach out. It seems like that, and time to heal, are the only options..

1916,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been dating a guy for two months. Throughout this time I’ve felt like I’m on an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes he’s in a great mood, is affectionate and nice but others he is very cold, distant, and moody. He often rants on text message about things that are annoying him or stressing him out and I’ve always listened and given him space to vent. It’s so confusing because on some dates he’s turned up with flowers and has been all over me then on others it’s like he treats me with contempt. 

Friday night we went out for dinner and as soon as I arrived at the restaurant I could tell he was in a bad mood. He grunted hello, was giving me one word answers and didn’t seem to want to speak to me. I complimented him on his outfit and told him he looked nice to which he said: “I was going to say the same to you but I can’t be bothered.” He very rarely pays me compliments and it hurt to hear him say this especially as id really made an effort to look good. 

Id been excited about going out with him and had been looking forward to dinner but his coldness completely threw me. I asked him if he was ok and he just replied that he was in a bad mood. I asked why and he said ‘I don’t know, I just am. I don’t need to have a reason, deal with it.’ I know he’s stressed with work at the moment but I felt so uncomfortable with how he was behaving that I said instead of sitting in silence and having an awkward dinner I’d rather go home. To clarify, this was the third time he had behaved like this towards me but the previous two times I hadn’t said anything. 

He blew up at me at this point and said I was over reacting and that it was his right to be in a bad mood if he wanted to. I said I’d leave him to it, got up and left.

Since then he’s messaged me saying I’m pathetic, a drama queen and that I am obviously used to men ‘kissing my ass’ which he is not prepared to do. AITA here guys for walking out like that? I’m feeling really bad right now. 

EDIT: wow I am shocked at how this has blown up! Thank you so much to every one of you who has taken the time to reply, the comments have been super helpful and they mean a lot. I guess I need to look at why I was even second guessing myself, I think my self esteem is quite low which is why I’ve been doubting how I behaved. 

The guy in question sent a few more messages saying he is in shock at my behaviour and that I am clearly high maintenance and a ‘nightmare.’ He even said he’s not surprised I’m single and that other guys clearly couldn’t put up with me. I’ve since blocked him. ",616,3557,0.95

I felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit.

It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank.

1921,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday I (38F) attended a very small local movie festival that screened two classic movies.  The venue was a small community hall, with about 120 attendees.  Seating was in 12 rows, each with 10 metal folding chairs, split with a center aisle.  The chairs were packed pretty tight for the small space. The movie was projected onto a screen like you would find in a classroom, at about blackboard height.  This was a low-budget setup, nothing fancy.

A woman (late 50's?) sat in the middle seat of the front row. She was wearing a large sun hat and was blocking a good portion of the screen for everybody behind her.  It was fashionably placed on her head, tilted back, so maximum screen blocking by the wide round brim.  I was in the 4th row and not directly behind her, but could not see around her hat.  

&#x200B;

I realized that she was not planning to take off her hat before the movie started, so after a long internal debate, I decided to ask her to remove it. I'm pretty shy and usually just ""roll with it"", so it was pretty bad to make me speak up. 

Me: (kneeling down and using a quiet voice) Excuse me, ma'am, could you please remove your hat? It's blocking the screen and we can't see around it.

Her: (horrified look, long pause, started tearing up...)  No! I can't remove my hat.

I went back to my seat, and she left in hurry, visibly distraught.  I think she was crying.  She never came back.  People turned to look at me, confused about why she ran out crying after I spoke to her for 5 seconds. 

&#x200B;

Now I feel like garbage because I obviously stepped into a highly personal issue here.  I can't get it out of my head. On one hand, maybe I was being cruel and insensitive by asking her to remove her hat (I keep thinking maybe she had chemo and was wearing a wig and just wanted to enjoy a movie without stressing about what she's going through).  On the other hand, she decided to wear a big sun hat to watch a movie and decided to sit right in the middle of the front row, without regard to anybody else.  There were plenty of other seats open at that time that would have allowed her to wear the hat without blocking anybody's view.  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I upset a lady by asking her to take off her big hat during a movie.

Normally, I would happily yield the right-of-way, but in this case there is a dedicated bike path literally five feet to my left.  I’m not talking about bike lanes painted on the existing road.  This is a dedicated bike path completely separate from the road.  If were talking about a painted bike lane that shares the street with vehicular traffic, I would understand the desire to ride with their child on the sidewalk, but that’s not the case here. 

Residents of this city requested tax dollars be spent to construct and maintain this path, yet this couple feels they are entitled to fly down the pedestrian sidewalk and have everyone make way.  Never mind that pedestrians always have the legal right-of-way, in my opinion this is just being a selfish dick

Unsurprisingly, the husband barks at me for not making room and I point to the bike lane and tell him to use that if he’s unhappy.  

His spouse then tries playing the,  ‘We’re a nice family trying to enjoy our day and you’re being a jerk’ card, to which I reply, ‘I may be jerk, but you’re clearly illiterate and point to a sign saying cyclists should use the dedicated lane.’ 

Dumbass husband then assumes a ‘come at me, bro’ posture and starts walking aggressively towards me.   Of course,  this immediately causes my dogs to go into ultra-protective mode, especially my German Shepard.

There was a very overweight girl in front of me in line and we both ordered the same exact thing. 

I glanced over at her portion sizes as we were both getting ready to pay and noticed that the guy working there gave her literally double the portion sizes he gave me- like I’ve been to this restaurant before and he gave me 5 pieces of orange chicken while the other girl got at least double that and we paid the same exact amount. 

I gave the guy a dirty look, but didn’t say anything. 

I’ve had this happen to me before at the same restaurant and it’s really starting to piss me off because I’m paying the same as other people and getting less food than them. It’s not like I’m rude to the people working there when I’m ordering there either. 

I’m a girl who is 5’5 130 lbs and look a lot smaller than I weigh because of how I carry the weight, so I assume that the guy working there just assumed I wouldn’t have as great an appetite and therefore would be okay with smaller portion sizes. 

Ik how reddit feels about overweight people and for me this isn’t about the girl and her weight or eating habits. She’s allowed to eat whatever the fuck she wants to and I’m not going to criticize her for that. 

My issue is more with the people working there being unfair with the portion sizes they give me. I feel like everyone should get the same portion sizes, regardless of how big or small you are, since we’re all paying the same amount of money for food.

IVF wasn't something we could afford and we're fairly certain we'd never be able to adopt. After a day or so of thinking it through, I told my wife that I wanted to keep and raise the baby. 

My wife is now roughly four months pregnant and we just broke the news to my parents. Knowing about my fertility struggles, it didn't take long for my mother to connect the dots and realize that the baby wasn't mine (I had gone to her after my wife confessed for advice). She didn't take it well AT ALL. Since she found out, my mother has been constantly telling me to divorce my wife and let her raise ""the mistake she made"" on her own. When I refused and told her that I want this baby, she switched to instead guilt tripping me about how the baby's real father will want to be involved. (Spoiler alert; he doesn't. He doesn't want kids and refused to even talk to my wife after she told him she was pregnant.)

She's gotten worse over the past couple of days. She was so supportive when we considered using a sperm donor last year, so I'm utterly baffled as to why she's suddenly decided that I shouldn't raise a child that isn't mine. Last night was the final straw. She decided it would be A-OK to give me the ultimatum - make her get an abortion or divorce her. No. Fuck no. I love my wife more than anything. Yes, she made a mistake, but I am not going to hold it against her. I've known about this baby for a little over a month and I've already grown attached, even though it isn't mine. 

My mother's behaviour is driving me up the wall. I haven't let my wife see any of the messages she's sent me yet, though I worry she might start harassing her about an abortion soon. I'm considering cutting my mother out of my life until she pulls her head out of her rear. This behaviour isn't okay and I'm not having her upset my wife over a mistake we've both moved on from. Yet, I hesitate to actually cut her off because...she's my mother. I love her and I desperately want to see her come around.

1929,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I split when he was a resident. Now he's a surgeon. I'm a lawyer, so I make good money on my own. I have custody of our daughter and he has visitation every other weekend. He's been paying me a small amount child support that I've been using for treats or putting into a college fund. However, now that he is a surgeon, he's making significantly more, and I'm taking him to court for an adjustment. A lot of friends and family are calling me greedy for pursuing child support when I could raise her easily without it, but I think I'm entitled to the money so I can grow her college fund faster. AITA?

Since I have written it 100 times in the comments, my ex chose this custody arrangement and has declined to work this out in mediation. He currently pays $50/month, as is standard for a non custodial parent making under $50k/year.

1931,Asshole,"I work as a line cook at a fairly popular restaurant. One of my coworkers is a woman who is for the most part a nice, productive employee, but has an extremely annoying habit: when asked a question, she’ll almost always provide an answer that’s incorrect, and follow it up with a grin and a “just kidding”, and the correct answer. For example, if asked “Do we have any apples left in the pantry?”, she’ll respond, “Yes, three dozen,” grin, and then say, “Nope, just kidding. We don’t.” Or “Is the chef in?” “No, you just missed him! Nope, just kidding, he’s still here.” Additionally, if she sees someone combing through different sections of the freezer or cabinets, she’ll often say, “What are you doing in there? You can’t be in there,”; and when the person stops and turns around, perplexed, she’ll grin and say, “Just kidding.”

The entire time I’ve worked there with her, she has done this almost every time she’s asked a question, and it **really** annoys me a lot. And I’m not an easily angered person or someone who tends to get into conflicts with coworkers. Up until last week, I never called her out on doing it; I would just give a half-hearted smile and keep my thoughts to myself.

The other week, I was in the midst of working a long shift and was tired, hungry and in a cranky mood. My coworker provided a joke answer to something I asked her, and finally, I snapped and confronted her. I didn’t do so in a hotheaded or dramatic manner, but I was **extremely** stern, serious and blunt in a way none of my coworkers had ever before seen me. 

I told her that her behavior is unprofessional, unfunny, and that there’s a word for giving answers that aren’t true: lying. I told her how I have no respect for liars, described how toxic lying is to a workplace, and stated that I don’t trust a word that comes out of her mouth as she has lied so much over such trivial things. When she responded she’s just been trying to be funny and that it’s part of her general joking nature, I responded, “you call it funny and joking. Well I call it dishonest, despicable, and **extremely** disrespectful.” I finished by telling her if she can’t behave in an honest, professional manner, I will have no problem reporting her to the head chef, and getting her a much-deserved write-up; and by looking her straight in the eye and telling her, “I will **NOT** tolerate being lied to”, before walking off.

The rest of the day, she seemed kind of “off”; her eyes were big, she was very quiet, and seemed kind of embarrassed. I ended the shift by telling her that I’m not mad at her, that I think she’s a terrific employee otherwise and that my confrontation was just meant as constructive criticism. She accepted this, but the past week since has been barely speaking with me at all; and has been extremely serious and reserved with me (different from her usual joking manner). Did I go too far, and should I apologize further?",74,197,0.95
1932,Asshole,"This happened a few days ago and first I thought she was overreacting but I mentioned it to a friend back home who told me I was being an asshole so I've been thinking of it more...


I travel a lot for work and was recently in a really dope city for a conference in which I got put up in a super swank hotel. I match with a girl from tinder and we exchange snap usernames and start talking on there. We send a couple of innocent snaps before she mentions she is in an Open relationship and was just looking for no strings attached sex, pretty much a hot romp 1 off. This piques my interest immediately and tbh I started getting a bit hard and my thoughts racing. I ask her when she wants to meet up and she tells me she'll get through with her day and then hit me up.

Blood rushing to my dick, I send her a couple video snaps of my suite. This thing is seriously huge. Double room. Sweet bathroom. Amazing view with a balcony. I follow up with where I'm staying, that I have a private super swank room and that maybe she should come over when she's done with work. She opens the vids and says the room looks great, thanks for the view and offer etc etc but that she has had bad experiences with meeting strangers at hotels in the past and that she would rather meet somewhere neutral first to see if we vibe. I say okay.

About 5 minutes later, I'm completely hard and looking over this girl's pics and get a bit caught up in the moment of possibly banging someone elses girlfriend in a city i'm visiting. I send her a quick dick pic and a view of the skyline from my balcony and tell her ""Or you should just come over right now and I can fuck you against this window.""

She shuts down immediately. Calls me an inconsiderate asshole for ""pressuring"" her after she told me she had a bad experience. I honestly didn't think it was that big of a deal and more spur of the moment sexy but she immediately blocked me and unmatched me from Tinder. It's been a few days since and I'm still blocked so I ended up mentioning it to a friend back home who basically gasped and called me a raging asshole. So.... AITA? ",349,997,0.89

1934,Not the A-hole,"For context, my workplace is a very small (about 100ft^2 or ~9.3m^2) outbuilding, and only accommodates 2 people (three is stretching it) people at a time. We only have about 5 people who work throughout the week, so it’s a very small department both in terms of space and people.

Recently I have been absolutely disgusted by the way my coworkers leave our space. Food in boxes and bags left for weeks at a time until it expires. Drinks untouched after a few swallows. Fresh fruit left rotting in the back room. And that’s just the uneaten stuff. I think I’m the only one who sweeps or mops spills off the floor and cleans off the counters and desk.

I have been asking nicely for everyone to clean up after themselves and to not leave food in the building unless they really need to do so (one person is diabetic) for over six months. Yet everything I listed before was still a regular occurrence. And so I finally broke. I’m tired of cleaning up other people’s messes when they are too lazy to clean up after themselves after repeatedly being asked to do so.

So I instituted a new food policy. If you leave food in the building after you leave and it is unopened, it will be put on a shelf for you to collect. If it hasn’t been collected or opened by the end of the week, it’s thrown out. If open food or fresh fruit is left behind, it gets thrown out the next day. The same goes for drinks.

I think this is fair, but everyone who works here is saying this is way too harsh, and I am out of line. AITA here?

EDIT: I made an exception for our diabetic coworker, since they need quick access to certain foods; they have a designated area to leave their food and drink. And over the summer, we have a cooler with communal cold drinks (Gatorade and water, mostly).

1935,Not the A-hole,"So I heard about this sub through a friend and figured y'all could maybe help me out in this situation because I'm having a real moral dilemma here and I don't know what to do. 

Basically it goes like this: a month ago, my best friend's sister got married. I've been friends with this kid for over 15 years and his family basically consider me one of their own so naturally, I attended the service. At the after party I ended up taking a shit ton of shots with one of the ushers, one thing led to another and we ended up sleeping together (I'm 20M he's 23M for context). He asked me the next day not to tell anyone about it, getting pretty upset and telling me that he is gay but still in the closet and not ready to come out yet. I told him sure, no problem because I get that everyone comes out at their own pace and outing someone is about one of the scummiest things a person can do. We became pretty good friends and have hooked up five more times after the wedding. 

All of this would have been well and good if I didn't find out a week ago that this man is married to a woman, with whom he has two children. The wife was out of the country for work at the time of the wedding and as the kids are both under 4 he opted not to bring them and they were with his parents. If I'd know any of this about him obviously I wouldn't have slept with him at all, let alone as many times as I did. I feel really gross and sickened by myself because I've been cheated on before and I know how horrific it is. I confronted him about it and he broke down crying saying he wants to leave her but feels like he can't because of the kids etc. 

I'm just at a loss on what to do. On the one hand, I don't want to out this guy. I did some casual asking around about him with my friend's family and apparently his parents are not the type who'd respond well to finding out their only son is gay. I've come to care for him quite a lot and I really don't want to cause any kind of familial tension for him. But on the other hand, I know his wife has a right to know that he's cheated on her (I suspect that I'm not the only one as he has a Grindr account) and feel obligated to tell her. WIBTA if I let her know, even though it means essentially outing him in the process? Is there a way I can do it without outing him? 

ETA: Just a clarification. I do not *want* to out this man. Some people seem to think that this is about me having some burning desire to reveal his sexuality to the world, and that is absolutely not the case. The absolute last thing I want to do is hurt him or his family in any way, and if anything I'm frantically searching for a way to let his wife know he's being unfaithful (which she has a right to know) without outing him. I agree with many of you that I should convince that he needs to tell her he cheated or somehow otherwise end things with her if he truly doesn't want to be with her any more and I plan to discuss this with him at the next available opportunity.

1937,Not the A-hole,"Look, before you click the title and type YTA, let me state my case.

I'm an Northern Irish guy living and working with my girlfriend in England and while we have a nice house and a dog, the neighbours kids are terrorising us and getting their parents to threaten us when we don't bow to their every whim.

Over the past year, the kids in the estate kick a ball against our high wooden fence nearly everyday, the noise it makes is annoying but we can live with it. However, sometimes the children kick the ball over the fence and come knock on our door to get the ball back, again it doesn't bother us too much.

Recently however, the kids have been kicking the ball over numerous times in the day and I work hard 9-5 so surely it's understandable that sometimes I couldn't care less about the ball, especially when the kids are rude to me and swearing at me when I give it back to them. So one day after retrieving the ball 5 seperate times and witnessing one kid attempt to climb my fence and get into my garden, I issue an ultimatum, if the ball lands in my garden again then I'm keeping it til the following day and then they can get it back.

The kids went and told their parents that we took their ball and won't give it back so here comes two parents knocking on our door yelling at us to give their ball back. Me and my gf protest saying they are damaging our fence, being rude to us and we insist that we are being reasonable qbut the parents keep saying the same thing ""give them their ball back now"", except more and more forcefully each time.

So what am I meant to do? Live my life as the defacto ball boy of the estate, eternally returning the balls back to their selfish, demanding owners under coercion by their parents?

Now I should preface this next bit by saying that I'm aware that my next actions could make me an asshole and I would normally agree, however, I would argue that I'm not THE asshole in this situation.

After having some kids dad come to my door and square up to me, I had enough, clearly noone bar us are interested in having a reasonable conversation about playing with a ball in the middle of a busy road (when there are 2 perfectly good parks 1 min down the street) or respecting other people's space so when the ball came over the fence last, I grabbed my sharpest kitchen knife and sank it into the football so to emulate a nail puncture. I step on the ball and squeeze a load of air out with my foot and then throw it back over the fence, making a much harder thud when it hits the ground 

Now I know this is petty and immature but I've had enough of acting as a surrogate parent to these whinging little shits and I feel someone should at least teach them that actions have consequences, especially if their own parents couldn't GAF.

Edit: on reflection I do feel bad, mostly because the gf thinks I'm the asshole for using her good knives but I was a wee shit when I was young so I can't judge them too harshly.

UPDATE: just got home from work and the neighbourhood kids asked if i can go get their ball again, I said I'll have a look. Then I just told them it's not there. They're now throwing stones at my house.",139,845,0.97
1938,Asshole,"I've been talking to this guy for a few weeks and we hit it off immediately. We even had a short coffee date during lunch break, and we were on the same vibe. He was funny, charming, similar sense of humor. Everything went great. I should add that we had sex talks as well, discussing kinks and stuff. 

So we decide to have a real date and then he asks if I'm on birth control. I think a few hours and cancel the date. He was confused saying it's just an innocent question, unlike all the stuff we talked about before. And we were both hinting that we will have sex on the first date, so what's wrong about birth control question?

My reasoning is this: if a guy is about to have sex with someone he just met, he MUST be jumping out of his way to use condom. It's a MUST no matter how many times we flirted dirty. And if he even thinks of not using a condom with a girl he just met, that means he was likely to do it before, which means he is at a much higher risk of having an STD and I'm not cool with that. 

I don't trust people who even entertain the idea of having sex with a person they don't know without a condom. I can't risk that even if he ends up using a condom. Doesn't matter that we discussed the sex positions or what we like in bed. I want to feel safe and I don't feel safe even if he thinks of not using a condom on a first date even for a second. 

Hope I explained my reasoning well. Question is - am I the asshole for that line of reasoning? 

Edit: for people who assume he asked ""to be safe I won't get pregnanf"" I say - don't be dumb please. I made it clear I want no kids. He asked because he wanted sex without condom. Or you really think if I said ""no I'm not on birth control"" he would cancel? Do you really know any guy who will reject safe sex because the woman is not on birth control? Come on. 

Second edit: for people who think that ""safe sex"" means safe for me to not get pregnant, and not safe from STDs as well - fuck off. I want a safe sex for me personally. I rejected a guy who suggested an unsafe sex. Sex on birth control without a condom is an UNSAFE sex. 

AGAIN: CONDOMS DO NOT EQUAL PILL. SEX WITH CONDOMS IS SAFE. SEX WITHOUT CONDOMS IS UNSAFE NO MATTER IF I AM ON BIRTH CONTROL OR NOT. ",190,74,0.63
1939,Asshole,"Sorry for any mistakes, English isn’t my first language.

I recently started working at an LGBT youth center. Aside from organizing a lot of fun events, we also try to educate people about different things (sexuality, STDs, queer history, etc.) and take care of various kids who have trouble at home because their parents don’t accept their sexualities. It‘s honestly a wonderful organization and I just love working there.

The other day I met up with some friends. I talked about how much I love my new job and they all agreed that it sounds great. There was one guy however (he‘s a friend of a friend, not sure why he even brought him along) who didn’t really... understand the point of the organization. He said it‘s not right to segregate children from each other because of their sexuality and there’s no need to send them to different youth centers since every center can essentially do what we do too.

I tried explaining to him that not all youth centers do what we do and that it’s important for young LGBT kids to have safe spaces but he disagreed. At some point I really didn’t feel like arguing or justifying their importance to a random dude anymore so I just said „And what makes you think a straight guy‘s opinion on this subject matters?“

He got super offended, telling me he can comment on whatever he wants to despite being straight and that if the roles were reversed I‘d call him homophobic.

I didn’t think much of it at the time but now I‘m wondering if my reaction was a bit extreme. For the record, I don’t actually believe someone shouldn’t be allowed to state their opinion because of their sexuality but sometimes it might be better to just LISTEN to people from marginalized groups and not add your own two cents, especially when you have no idea what you’re talking about.",717,701,0.81

1941,Not the A-hole,"This happened yesterday and I wanted to see if I was being a jerk.

Context/Background:

* My wife and I have been married for a few years
* She was previously engaged for several months but then her fiance called off the wedding, so she was never married to him
* She had an engagement ring and they were in the middle of planning and had already put down some deposits on venues before he called it off (just to give an idea of how far along they were in the process)
* Last bit of context. After we got married, she had some skin issues and couldn't wear her rings for a bit. Now she is able to wear her engagement ring that we bought together. However, not her wedding band.

With that out of the way. We are in the midst of moving and as part of that she came across her old engagement ring and wedding band from her previous fiance. She kept them, and her plan was to give the engagement ring to her daughter once she is 16yr old, so she was showing it to her.

The wedding band was also there and she said/asked: 
""Oh, this is convenient. I haven't been able to wear my other band for a while now, would you be ok if I just wore this one instead?""

I was very taken aback by the question. It seemed like a weird question to ask if she could wear the wedding band that she was going to wear for her prior relationship vs ours. She could see the look on my face, so she back-tracked a bit and said: ""...orrrr maybe not"".

I said something along the lines of, ""no, I wouldn't be comfortable with that and honestly, I can't believe you would even ask a question like that? What makes you think it would be ok? It was a really weird question to ask frankly""

So yea, we had a fight about it. He point of view was:

* She had never worn the ring at all, and hadn't even looked at it. It came with the engagement ring (a buy one get one free) and she doesn't place any emotional significance in the band. The engagement ring she does cause she did wear it. She said I was placing the emotional significance on it vs her. The ring is a complete non-item to her hence she was ok with wearing it now.
* I tried to make the point that it was hard for me to separate the band from the previous relationship and the fact that it is called a ""wedding band"" not like, ""random trinket with no emotional significance"". Also, because I was so upset, I said, ""the question felt like you coming to be and saying, hey, is it ok if I sleep with someone else"". A bit of hyperbole on my part, but like I said, I felt upset and kind of betrayed.

We ultimately agreed that we will go buy her another band together. But she was still not getting that it was a weird question to ask. I know that I overreacted a bit with the whole, ""it was like you were asking me to sleep with someone"" but at the same time isn't it a weird question to ask? 

So that's my question, WITA for getting upset by her question to wear the previous wedding band?

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback. I was already thinking that I over-reacted. It was fine that she asked, it was fine that I felt weird about it and wasn't ok with it. Arg, I'm disappointed in myself for escalating like that vs just saying, ""yea babe, that's kinda weird, I'd rather you not. I'd love to get another band together though.""

For example, we met through a friend of hers I had been casually seeing a few months before that and she has no problem with her and I hanging out even if she (K) isnt there.

All of my friends like her and I feel the same, if I’m at work and she wants to get drinks with “my friends” and their significant others I encourage it.  We trust each other.

Recently though a friend moved back into town and has been hanging around our house quite a bit.  He was nice to my girlfriend like I would expect my friends to be but in the last few weeks I think he overstepped.

He’s invites her out to breakfast multiple times, which she accepted once, and demanded to cover the tab and insisted it was his treat.

She mentioned a book she had been wanting a hard copy over at a get together and he purchased it and brought to our house the next day.
 
Lastly I can notice him checking her out every chance he gets and I feel like he sees her different than my other friends.

1944,Asshole,"Basically, I am a doctor who graduated from one of the top med schools in the country. Because of this, I know what it takes to make it as a doctor. My eldest daughter is also on a medical track: she goes to a top 20 school and is excelling. She is a junior, and will probably get into one of the best med schools next year. 

My youngest daughter is not like us. For my eldest daughter and I, math and science come more naturally. It’s not something we need to work hard at. My youngest daughter, however, really struggles with these topics. In college, she has to study for her STEM classes for hours and hours just to get the average grade at a school that’s not very difficult. 

My daughter, to her credit, is a VERY hard worker and I admire that. However, that hard work could be placed to a field that she can really excel in instead of being a doctor; she will always struggle in med school, but she can take her talents elsewhere and become an amazing law or business major.  

The drama is that she called me yesterday and told me she had trouble getting accepted with an internship, and asked if she could work with me this summer. I basically told her she should reconsider the medical professions because she spends all day studying and she is barely average, and I don’t think she can succeed as a doctor. BUT I reassured her that it’s okay and she can find something else to shine in. On the phone she was really quiet, and I ended the phone call with “I love you”. After this, I have my eldest daughter, ex-husband, mother, and siblings spamming me and telling me to apologize. Youngest won’t even pick up the phone. 

I understand that her feelings may have been hurt and while that’s valid, I think tough love will help her in the future. For example, it may have hurt her feelings when she was younger because I wouldn’t let her eat cookies for dinner, but as a parent you need to protect your children, even when it hurts them in the short term.

1945,Not the A-hole,"I will try and keep this story very mutual as i understand you are only hearing it from my side of the view. Some history about me, I have had some very poor relationships and I know I am not the perfect guy, however I am 'too nice' sometimes which makes people walk all over me. I had a job where I didnt require a place to live due to excessive travel. It was a wonderful job and I unfortunately got let go. This amazing woman let me move in with her and her family and she has really been there for me when times are tough. I had enough money to get my life back on track and within one month of living at her parents with her I got a car, job and an apartment. I got the apartment in my name because i have been through a relationship before where things ended up not working out and I was screwed. I guess you learn from your previous relationships. She helped me move into my new apartment along with helping me buy new furniture and she came with me to purchase my new car. She has really been there for me. She immediately moved in with me and I could tell after a month she wasnt that comfortable. Maybe it was because of the drastic change from her parents? or maybe it was because we moved towards the big city? I still will never know but I could tell she was very uncomfortable. 

My wake up costs are nearly $3000 dollars. Yes i know this sounds like a lot but my new job was paying well. Rent $1650, Car $400 with insurance, Phone bill, other bills, student loan. Yes it comes close to about $3000 dollars. Insane right?

Well fast forward 5 months later, I asked her to help me out with rent even if she could pay me $500 and possibly groceries. anything as this point because it is very expensive for me to be paying for both of us. She works full time 40 hour weeks. She makes about $3000-$4000 per month before taxes. She would never help me out!

Its getting to a point where I am coming off as a dick now because she is not helping me pay the bills at all, and i keep confronting her. Her excuses make me even more upset like how she said she pays her sisters gym pass and she doesnt even go. how does this effect me or even us? One of my friends asked if she splits the rent (idk why he asked but i was standing right there) She blatantly lied and said yes she helps a lot. I confronted her about this, she still just plays completely dumb about it and tells me she has no money and comes up with excuses where her money goes. 

I cant keep doing this. I told her 'love' isnt enough to keep this together if she wants to be in a relationship it needs to be made together it feels very one sided right now....  It just sucks because im not that kind of guy that would just end it based off something like this but enough is a enough.

1949,Asshole,"This situation has be resolved, I’m just more or less curious as to what the internet might think.

I’ve been with my girlfriend for over two years, and while we have our troubles, the relationship has been phenomenal. We usually go about fights by talking through them and we try to understand each other. It’s important to note that I have crazy anxiety, and I understand this and try my best to combat it. I know I might get dreadfully anxious due to something that doesn’t deserve it, and I will try my best to control it.

So my girlfriends dream job is to be a piercer. She’s pierced herself multiple times, pierced her friends multiple times, and she’s actually very good at it. I’ve pushed her into it as well, she deserves to follow her dreams. She tried and tried to get an apprenticeship, but people kept turning her down until now. She finally found someone willing to train her. She’s been going and having an amazing time, and I’m happy and proud for her.

Unfortunately my anxiety has gotten the best of me here. I feel like there were too many independent variables, but that was an issue we were able to talk out. I had an issue with her piercing wherever she wanted, and her being the only girl surrounded by guys that she shares a passion with. Now for this part, I knew I was wrong. Whenever these issues pop up, I talk to her about why it upsets me, how I’m upset at myself for being upset, and then she walks me through why I should be more comfortable with it. She nearly never has to compromise because I know I’m in the wrong.

Now here’s where the real AITA comes in. My girlfriend was over he other day and offhandedly mentioned something her teacher said.

He said, “So your boyfriend is okay with this?”

She said, “Yes.”

He said, “Good, I don’t want to have another boyfriend barge in because his girlfriend is piercing a penis.”

And you know what, I took that wonderfully. We never talked about it happening, I never realized she might be piercing dicks, but I just figured hey, it’s a part of the job. I just let it go because it was her passion, and it genuinely did not bother me.

She goes to the salon, trains with her teacher, and has  a fantastic time. She gets off and calls me right away, tells me about her great day and so on. She then asked me, 

“Do you want your dick pierced?”

“Well no not at all.” 

“Okay! Well then I’m going to have to ask someone else!”

And there was the problem. The idea of her piercing dicks wasn’t an issue when it was a stranger. But the idea of her asking our personal guy friends to do it? I immediately had an issue with it. I don’t want her to know what one of our friends dicks look like, work related or not. It just bothered me a lot, and she simply could not understand why. AITA?",100,229,0.92

My mum broke her elbow about 3 weeks ago and since then I've been doing everything for her. I even sleep in her bed, just in case something's up at night (I have gotten up in the middle of the night a lot, without ever complaining. Even though I already get a max. of 6h of sleep mon-fri). However, I'm an adult myself and have things to do as well. I'm very stressed about a ridiculous amount of college deadlines all ending in the same week, have had to recover from my 3rd burnout since last summer, have depression and anxiety (which have been pretty bad for the past 2 months) and am also on the autism spectrum (important in a minute). We don't have close friends or even family at all where we live, but my grandparents took a 7h car ride to be around to help.

Whenever she asks me for help, I jump. I do every tiny little thing for her. But I also have things to work on myself and can't just neglect college assignments just to help her with something like dusting off a shelf. She gets irrationally angry at me every time I don't help help her do something. If it's something I know she can't do, like get her medicine out of the containers (as well as opening any sort of container or bottle for that matter), or getting her an ice pack because of the pain, I do it immediately. But whenever I know that she can do the task herself and I'm working on something important, I refuse. And mind you, if I'm not busy, I usually help with that stuff as well.

Her most recent fit of rage was about me not wanting to help her wash her hair, because for one she can do it herself, that's a fact, and secondly it's sensory hell for me. This is where the autism part comes in: I don't particularly like touching other people much and am mildly phobic of germs and dirt (greasy hair is a nightmare). I have, however, helped with that at the beginning when I knew she couldn't do it herself. Now she can, though, and I don't have to trigger my usually non-existant gag reflex. I do help with putting care products in her hair, brushing her hair, everything but the actual washing part. She knows why and still gets angry at me.

Back when I had to get surgery on my ovaries and got out of hospital, but still was in immense pain, she didn't help me a single bit and even sent me to school (which I was still in back then) while barely being able to walk. Don't get me wrong, she's always been a good mum, but apparently didn't understand that back then. Now that she does understand the pain of post-surgery, I could have totally done the same, but didn't. I help out as much as I can, but sometimes the amount of help doesn't satisfy her wishes. Plus my grandparents are also present.

My (M22) GF (F21) snores very loudly. I hope it is only because she has a little bit of a could right now and it won't be like that forever. So every time I wake up in the middle of the night, there is no way for me to fall asleep again. I will just shift myself a little bit, forcing her to wake up.

I really dislike doing this but I also don't want to just lie there the entire night listening to her. AITA?

First of all thanks for all the answers. She does know, that she snores from time to time. I just didn't want her to tell her about it, because I didn't want her to have trouble falling asleep, because she worries about snoring. Sadly it is reeeaally loud, so I don't think any kind of earplugs would be able to dampen that enough for me to not hear it anymore. 

For those who said, that she is sick and needs the sleep: I do agree, but I think we are sleeping enough for that not to be the case. According to her the sickness also doesn't hinder her on doing anything anymore, since it has almost cured. And since I'm also infected and don't really mind, I think I can believe her. 

I will talk to her about it, since I shouldn't continue doing this without her consent. Thanks for everyone who replied :)

&#x200B;

Family History: My partner has always had a rocky relationship with his parents and in particular his mother (now known as MIL) who has been diagnosed with a mental illness. MIL has always been the type to start arguments and disrupt the family and has kicked my partner out in the past over small things e.g. if he hasn't called her back in a short enough timescale. My partner's father (now known as FIL) and brother are both enablers and just try to keep the peace and not call out MIL when she gets out of control. Personally, I don't like waiting for the next time that MIL is going to blow up and would rather go LC but that is up to my partner.

Main Issue: At a family gathering in February we were all sharing a box of chocolates and I mentioned that the dog was not allowed to have any. As most people know, chocolate can make dogs seriously ill and as it has no part in my dog's diet it shouldn't have even been an issue. A couple of weeks later during yet another argument, my partner said that MIL screamed out that if she wants to feed the dog chocolate she will. Which was not what they were arguing about originally so I'm not sure why she burst out with it but still.

1965,Asshole,"This is a throwaway account because reasons. On mobile so sorry for formatting if it’s an issue. 

About 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with HSV1, or ‘oral’ herpes. 

The fun thing thing about herpes is that there are two types and you can get either HSV1 (oral) or HSV2 (genitals) but you can get either type on either your mouth or on your genitals. Each type is more commonly found on the respective body parts, but it’s possible to have oral herpes on your genitals and genital herpes on your mouth. 

My question is because I have oral herpes, but on my genitals. 

I haven’t told my boyfriend about my condition. My reasoning is that if I had oral herpes on my mouth, I wouldn’t bother sitting him down for a big chat about it. It’s such a common condition and there’s no stigma for people with oral herpes on their mouths. I know some of those people do disclose with their partners before kissing them etc, but I find that unecessary.

My doctor told me that because I have HSV1 on my genitals and not HSV2, the risk of transmission to my boyfriends genitals are even lower than normal. Oral herpes doesn’t spread to the genitals as easily as genital herpes does. 

I never sleep with my boyfriend when I’m having an outbreak. I would have told him if I were diagnosed with HSV2 on my genitals, or my mouth cos I go down on him.

*Edit: There aren’t any real major problems in our marriage that’s causing our sex life to decline, I’m just dealing with a lot of grief because I’ve just lost three close family members back to back. We don’t have a nonexistent sex life, just not what it was before I lost my family members. I’m in therapy to help with dealing with the grief but this is still fresh since this all happened in January and February. 

My husband and I are friends on social media. Usually he shares funny memes about anything and everything. Lately he’s been posting about how much he misses having sex before marriage killed his sex life. He shares posts all the time about nobody giving good head anymore. He shares stories that say things like “I wish I remembered what sex feels like, been too long.” And I put up with it for a long time. But I have never been comfortable with it. I toyed around with the idea of telling him to take all of it down, but was scared to overstep. 

Well one night after I was dealing with some serious depression and my sex drive was all but evaporated, my husband asked me if I would at least try to do it and see if I enjoy it or if I would just help him get off. I told him that I wasn’t in the mood for anything sexual at all. 20 minutes later, he posted on social media “Turned down again. Ugh. Don’t get married kiddos.” And it hurt my feelings so bad that I started crying because he was once again telling the whole world our personal life. So I told him to take all of it down. And he flipped out on me. He said that he had the right to vent about his frustrations and it’s not like it’s hurting anything and that I can’t tell him what to do with his social media and that it was rude of me to even try to tell him what to do with his own pages. So now I feel disrespected and guilty. He thinks I’m overreacting but I don’t see it that way. 

So, Am I The Asshole for telling him to take those posts down and to stop posting things about our personal life and marriage behind closed doors, since they’re not my social media profiles? I know he has the right to vent but where does one draw the line between venting and TMI?

1972,Not the A-hole," So a bit of backstory to this;

Me and SO are getting married later this year and we're having a very small wedding overseas and we're trying to fund our families coming. SO's brother has a girlfriend of one yearish (BGF) but we've never met her due to the fact that we are currently living abroad. We can't really hold that against her but SO's brother decided that he wouldn't go to our wedding if she couldn't go. SO's parents absolutely adore BGF so we reached an agreement with them that we'd pay for B bit not for BGF and the two of them could save together for their flights and they'd have a room in a place that we would pay for.

SO wasn't massively happy with the arrangement, she doesn't like the idea of having someone who is a stranger to her at our wedding and in our pictures, especially if she may not be in the picture for a significant amount of time in the future. Que sera though, provided B isn't going to have a hissy fit and not come them we're willing to make concessions to try and make all parties satisfied if not exactly happy.

Fast Forward to today;

B sends a message to SO asking BGF can wear a white dress to the wedding as it's the only one she can find.

We're a bit upset by this; firstly she's there because we want all of SO's family there but he has the lack of tact or common sense to turn round and ask us for her to wear white to our wedding. We've politely said we'd prefer that she didn't but after him flipping out and saying he won't come if she can't we don't know if we've made a mistake

So, reddit, AWTA?

TLDR; Unwelcome girlfriend of SO's brother wants to wear white to our wedding.

Update: We didn't hear from B after saying that we'd prefer BGF not to wear the dress. SO called her parents for some reassurance. Parents decide to berate her for being upset, claim that M wanted to wear a white dress and now she'll have to find a new one and that we should've said from the start that we didn't want people wearing white. D says that's she's being silly and says that he's going to be wearing a white suit and white socks and white shoes and if that is going to upset her. Then got annoyed when she started getting upset. I sat with my mouth open through the whole thing. I'm so proud of her for not breaking down in front of them as it seemed like that's what they wanted...

To answer some of the questions in the comments, she was mostly unwanted because SO's parents offered to help pay for her to go but wouldn't help SO's grandfather who she actually wants to be there. She got upset by that and that's where the animosity towards BGF came from. That and she's included in the family by SOs parents in a way that I wasn't until about 3 years in to our relationship.

I'm not sure B is an asshole to be honest. He's not made... the best decisions in the past. Him doing something like proposing to BGF while we're there is something I'm concerned about but if he does he'll probably end up looking like an idiot and it's out of our control anyway. 

Family is really important to SO so I don't want to uninvite B, I think it would kill a little bit of her to do so. To an extent that fact is being used against her but that is not my business to address at all.

To the people saying ruin the dress, YTA to be honest... if you're being serious... I posted this to check if we were being rude and for a bit of guidance. Doing something horrible back won't fix things and will just ruin the day. Maybe that's cowardly but I'd rather as little drama as possible.  Thinking about it is funny as hell though.

Thanks for people's input, it's nice to see that on the whole people think that we're not being horrible. 

To the bridezilla comment, I'd agree that we are making decisions about what people can and can't wear but we've tried to go about it in a nice way. As I've understood things, and it seems most people on here do too, wearing white at someone's wedding is a bit of a faux pas anyway, and B at least is somewhat aware of it (hence asking the question) so it's just a question of what one wearing white to the wedding implies. These pictures will be with us for the rest of our lives and I think a bit of selfishness, that I hope doesn't impact people or make life too inconvenient for them, (arguable what too much is but hey) isn't the worst thing in the world. 
I appreciate your comment just the same though. I've made sure to try and handle the situation as politely as possible if nothing else.

The breaking point was when he was talking about one of his female friends while in bed with me, and how beautiful she is etc. He then gets a text from one of his sister’s college friends at 11pm. And wanted to postpone our plans so he could meet with another female friend.

At this point, I’m just DONE with the female friends. All of it. Told him to stop texting them, and seeing them because his focus, attention and mind is with them and it’s effecting our relationship. 

He said I was controlling, juvenile, and overbearing but will think about it. Am I the asshole?  ",39,58,0.91

1977,Not the A-hole,"I'll preface this with some background. Surrogacy is legal where I live, and has been since 2012. My wife and I will be married for 5 years as of this November, and have been together for 8 years. We have 2 boys, a 5 and a 6 year old. She stays at home whilst I go out and work a 9 to 5 to support the family, and for the most part we're content, with the genral challenges which come with a relationship.

Now we were talking about having another child. She had her implanon (contraceptive implant) removed so we can start trying. I'm pretty excited, I'm in a really stable job with good career prospects, and I'm in love with my wife. We have a family which comes with it's own challenges of course.This morning, she comes in to the kitchen all nervous; I ask what's up? She takes a deep breath and says she wants to be a surrogate for someone she met 2 weeks ago. This wasn't exactly the statement I was expecting on a Sunday morning in the kitchen. Initially, I'm not feeling any negativity, and my wife rattles off a list of requirements which includes me needing to be on board with it. This is about when I became triggered as the concept settles in, and I started shutting off in a confused state of anxiety. The issues are as follows;

* She's known this woman (a fellow home school mother in our community) for about 2 weeks.
* This would put having our own child on hold.
* I'm worried there will be attachment issues after the pregnancy.
* If I'm not on board, I'll likely push my wife away.
* There may be financial implications; we aren't in a position to support someone elses pregnancy.

I understand; this is her body, and ultimately I cannot stop her from doing what she wants to do. If she really wants to do this, she will take our children away and do it on her own.

I'm currently trying to go through scenarios where I would feel comfortable with the idea, and I think this ultimately comes down to the fact that it feels like she's prioritizing someone elses child over ours (This makes me feel a bit rejected) for someone she's known for a very short time. I've worked so hard to support her in what she wants to do in every way (Stay at home, home school the kids), however I don't think this is something I can get behind, at least not until we've had our 3rd child which we literally just started planning for.

TLDR; wife wants to have someone elses baby, instead of our own, for someone she's known for 2 weeks. I'm not comfortable with the idea, and have the power to stop it as my agreement is required by law.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Hopefully I'm doing this right, sorry mods if I am not. We sat down and had a discussion, and I explained that I was upset because it felt like she wanted to prioritize someone else's child over our own. I get that this is a jealous instinct, but she understood. Other points:

* No money reimbursement, but medical costs would be covered. Insurances to be investigated.
* Our child and family comes first.
* For the people saying things don't add up; my wife has always been an open minded thinker, and likes to help. I can't include the context due to post length, but it wasn't completely left field; we had a discussion about surrogacy years ago. The only odd thing is that she's only known the woman for a short period of time.
* The woman has 1 child, but had her uterus removed due to hereditary kidney cancer which spread. If there is any health risk due to this it's a definite no.
* The 'leaving me' comment comes from frank discussions we've had where she's outlined she clearly wouldn't need my support if it came down to it.
* Thanks for the input, especially the advice from experienced surrogates.",54,103,0.96
1978,Not the A-hole,"I (18,F) occasionally babysit two twin boys (6) for a nice, Christian family. They often have me read from a kid’s bible and say prayers with them before bed.
I was raised Catholic but am agnostic now and I’m not big on the whole religion thing, but I have no problem doing this. I respect that it’s their religion and they have a right to raise their kids this way. Besides even though religion isn’t for me I still can appreciate its good qualities and recognize that prayer and faith in something bigger can be a beautiful thing.

However, last night the parents said they had left the kid’s bible at their church last week and asked me to read from a Ken Ham kid’s book instead. It was called the Answers Book for Kids. I told them I would, not knowing what was inside. I didn’t know who Ken Ham was but I looked it up after reading some of the book- he’s the guy who thinks not only was there a literal flood that covered the earth but Noah actually took dinosaurs in the ark lmao. He built a giant ark in Kentucky and argued with Bill Nye and stuff.

I started reading from a page in the book about where we came from. I was shocked how how the book misconstrued the theory of evolution and blatantly made things up. For example, the book said something along the lines of, “Some people want you to believe that we evolved from monkeys-how silly does that sound?” No. Just no. The theory proposes that humans and apes shared a common ancestor, NOT that we evolved from monkeys, and when you put it that way, it sounds just as silly as a giant guy up in the sky. I tried flipping through the pages to find a page suitable for children but all of them said some shit like how the earth was only 10000 years old, carbon dating is wrong, and dinosaurs existed with people. What 6 year old even knows what carbon dating is anyway. If you don’t believe me I think you can get a preview of the book on google books.

Anyway, after flipping around the book a little I told the boys they could pick out a different picture book and we’d read that instead. I didn’t feel comfortable spreading harmful ideas into impressionable minds. Like I said I do not mind helping the boys pray or reading bible stories but this was just obvious propaganda and willful ignorance. 

When the parents got home they asked me if the boys said their prayers and read their book and I respectfully told them that I didn’t feel comfortable reading the book. Awkward silence ensued. I couldn’t tell if it was because they were pissed, or they were confused because they didn’t know what was in the book (which I thought might be the case since they seem like nice, intelligent people and I can’t imagine them teaching their kids those things.)

I still feel really weird about it and maybe I should have just followed the parent’s instructions. After all, they are paying me to take care of their kids. So, AITA?

I've been dating my GF for about a month. honestly I feel much stronger about her than she does me, but I'm hoping she comes around. She is on our university gymnastics team and is an incredible athlete. I went to her meet this afternoon and was freaking shocked to see how much of her floor routine had ""sexual"" elements. She did her routine to ""p'on da replay"" and as an example she crawled on all fours, she shook her ass, she did this thing where she went up and down her body with her finger (including her breasts) and then acted like her finger was sizzling. And during all this, her teammates cheered. I was blown away that this sort of sexuality was not only allowed but encouraged. 

After the meet I told her I didn't think she should do that sort of stuff. She told me that it was normal for gymnastics and that her routine had been worked out for years with coaches and choreographers. I told her it was normal for strippers who danced for dollar bills. She told me I didn't get it. I told her that I didn't understand what was to get, I was her boyfriend and it was my job to look out for her. She told me ""you are literally and asshole and way overstepping your bounds!"" I told her that I didn't want to fight and she said it was too late. So instead of her going on a romantic date I had planned, she decided to hang out with her teammates. I am so upset because I was counting on seeing her tonight. 

Based on what she said, am I the asshole for thinking her routine should be less sexy and telling her so?",2044,12580,0.78

Most days my husband and I have sex I’m used to not getting off but today I was feeling extra frustrated so I asked him 

“When’s the last time you had an orgasm?” 

He immediately said that it was a loaded question, which it was. I replied with “I haven’t had one since October.” 

His first response was a loud groan and “Because I’m SO awful and everything I do is wrong right?” Then he started to get angry while he was driving. He started to shout at me that I always attack him and nothing he does is ever good enough. He said he didn’t like the way I approached the question and I apologized for it but now he’s slamming the door to our room over and over, blowing up my phone, and making half-assed apologize like “I’m sorry you have to bring things up in a way that upsets me”.

Anyways. I want to be strict with my sister. She is 14 and has already lost her virginity. Shes done drugs and other things in her old life. My goal is to be stricter but teach her along the way. My husband believes shes smart enough to do whatever she wants. 

She has been on Xbox a lot and made some friends one being a 20 year old man. She talks to him a lot and has been deleting messages on Xbox between the two of them. I want to put a stop to a 20 year old man talking to my 14 year old sister but my husband is saying I'm a jerk and I need to let her do what she wants because ""it's just xbox"".

1983,Not the A-hole,"This one is a bit complicated so bear with me.

My wife and I have a great relationship. We live and support each other and have built a life and family together that we are proud of. The one rough part of our life right now are some fertility issues that have made it difficult for us to conceive our second child. We have had multiple miscarriages and have been trying pretty non-stop for a most 2 years at this point. We are a few months from implanting our first round of IVF.

My wife is very uptight about anything baby related. When trying to conceive she has drunk no alcohol, no caffeine, is incredibly sensitive to things like lunch meats etc. basically all the things you would expect an already pregnant person to do. I get it, these are things she can control and I have done my best to support her.

Here is where things get a bit difficult. My wife is an infectious disease physician. We have not traveled below the Mason Dixon line in 5 years due to her concerns around the Zika virus. I have done my best to be supportive of this but it has been incredibly difficult to negotiate with my job.

In a few weeks I am expected to be in Vegas. Under normal circumstances I would bow out but this is one of those few situations where I really can’t. I wouldn’t go as far as to say I will get fired but I would be SERIOUSLY screwing some people over.

I know that the likelihood of me contracting the Zika virus is essentially null and have tried to reason with her but she is drawing a pretty hard line and is clearly pretty upset. I feel like I am caught in a really hard place here. At the same time I think I have been enabling some behavior on her end that I probably shouldn’t be enabling.

So Reddit AITA in this situation. Should I just suck it up and screw over my job in favor of my wife’s concerns?

My sister [17] is always talking down on things I [16F] do. She always mentions how I’m a “catfish” for wearing makeup, and criticizes the way I dress. Which, I’ll admit bothers me but I try not to pay too much mind. And she always runs to tell my mom when I do something “bad,” like getting a tattoo. 

But the other day she keep insinuating that I’m “promiscuous” because I spent 3 nights away from home, in which I would only come home to shower and leave again. In reality, I was helping a friend who’s mom just had a baby, by driving them around and just babysitting so they could rest. My mom knew this but my sister didn’t. She kept making comments and calling me a “hoe.” 

I didn’t really care much, as I know who am I and my mom knew where I was. But she just kept going on and on about how it looked bad, and saying it’s not fair that I don’t get in trouble for doing “those kind of things.” 

So I just blurt out, “ At least I’m not sending nudes.” I only knew she does because she sent some to a friend of mine, and he was being a jerk asking me to send some too, so he could “complete the set.” 

My mom just turns to look at her, and my sister’s face drops. She got her phone taken away and she can’t go out “until further notice.” 

My sister and I don’t have the best relationship, so I don’t feel bad that she got in trouble, I just feel bad because of the disappointment in my mom’s face. I feel like that was something my mom could’ve gone without knowing. And now everyone in the house is super tense and I just feel bad.

1985,Asshole,"A little back ground: All my roommates are dating someone and are very open and involved with their sexuality(/are sexual beings?) Me on the other hand, I am always the single one. I don't like dating people and I am not a very sexual person and I am just not interested in that stuff at all. I get annoyed and uncomfortable if people express PDA around me or talk about their partners in a sexual way or romantic way. I think this is fair, but all my friends think it's cute and support each other. And I mean... I support them too, we are all friends and I am glad they are happy. But I just can't be around that all the time.

So me and my roommates are preparing for the fall/late summer where we are hoping to move into a nicer house together. While we were taking inventory of all the furniture we had, I half jokingly said that I didn't want them have sex in our house especially while I was there, and they all turned to look at me like I was crazy. (Also, there are four of us, and our house has two rooms and a small office. Two of them are sharing and the other one is using the room while I get the office. I don't really mind using the office, but the reason they get the bigger room is because they want more space for when their SO comes over and all my other roommates agreed. I mean, that's gotta be SOME sort of discrimination lmao)

Here's where I might sound like the asshole: All of my friend's SOs live pretty far away and go to different uni at the moment, so they would probably only visit for weekends and holidays. Unfortunately, my friend's parents don't really approve of their relationships so they couldn't go back to either of their houses if they wanted to get off. I feel bad for them, but not that bad for them...I'm paying rent just like the rest of them so it's equally my house and I don't want to sleep in my tiny room hearing them bang each other through the thin walls.

I really really REALLY value privacy and respect, and of course I want us to all be comfortable in our house, but I think that it can't be that hard to go fuck in your car or rent a hotel if you're that horny and desperate...

I know I probably sound like a bitter wanker and maybe I made them seem like horny fucks, but we normally all get along really well and I really like them so I want this roommate situation to work out with no hard feelings. And I really don't want to get pushed around just because I'm single or the youngest in the group...

So give it to me straight doc, am I the asshole?

Edit: Yeah I guess a lot of you guys are right, and I kind of already knew that I was being an asshole lol. But man I wish people could just turn off their sex drives or something haha. As someone that doesn't really experience sexual attraction I have a hard time seeing their side, but I am going to think about what I said, and hopefully we can have a good compromise where nobody feels too uncomfortable.

1986,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: My mother died of a relapse of leukaemia not long ago. Prior to her relapse, she had a run in with this cousin at another family members wake. This cousin was rude, verbally and emotionally abusive and caused my mother no amount of hurt, she embarrassed her in front of the mourners and belittled her to the point where mammy had to leave. 
In the past, this cousin also verbally and physically publically attacked my father in an attempt to defame and slander him, she emotionally abused my mother and accused her of theft and attempted to chastise child me for not speaking to her when she knew that I knew all this had been going on. 

My mother passed away recently after a relatively short but absolutely brutal relapse of leaukaemia that no one saw coming. On the first night of her wake, I knew this particular cousin would show, so I sent word round the men that she was not to be let in. 
No one in the family can stand her for all the lies she has told over the years, her general behaviour and a load more indecent incidents that I wont list here; so there were no shortage of volunteers for the task. 

Well I was proven right, she showed up with her sisters in tow and was politely told at the front gate that she wasn't welcome. 
Her sister asked if it was all of their family, to which she was told no, just THAT cousin. 
This went down quite badly, and long story short, they stormed off. 
When I carried my mother's coffin to the car, my 80 year old grandfather seen that cousins brother and put his hand out for a handshake (which was difficult as he is very weak) ...cousins brother never took it, kept his hand in his pocket and just looked at my grandfather. My grandfather is 80, has become very frail over the years and was burying his only child. 

I've had no dealings with any of them since. 

Now some months have passed and some of the family have said i was too harsh and should have allowed that cousin to pay her ""respects"". But for the life if me I cant see how! My mammy didn't like her; for good reason, and would have turned in her coffin at the thought of that cow gawking at her, spinning her lies and trying to emotionally manipulate people into 'donating' to her fund to send her away for 'special treatment' for her 'terminal tumour'...(its been going on so long the fucking thing could have gotten its national insurance number years back!)

We've since moved on from that, but for some reason that all triggered something in me and I know find myself quietly worrying to myself about if he'd prefer someone that's asian over me (I'm white).

Though I have these feeling I recognize that he isn't doing anything to make me worry and that it's my mind playing tricks on me and tend to not be accusative towards him with these feelings, instead I tell him when I'm feeling jealous and why so he reassures me that it's just in my head. I'm seeing a therapist and have been diagnosed with anxiety so I'm working on it.

BUT around a week ago I saw a message on his phone lock screen from a foreign friend that said ""well at least you know you love her"" and I was immediately panicking. He was already asleep and I didn't want to wake him up to ask about it, so I tried to put it out of my mind and watch a documentary or two. By the time I decided I wanted to go to bed all of the what ifs were still plaguing my mind so I unlocked his phone to look at the conversation (the first time I've ever done something like this). He told her that he's been having issues where his mind wanders and will absentmindedly think of other girls from time to time and that once or twice he though of someone else while we were having sex. I immediately started crying and he woke up, I told him what I did and what I read. He explained to me that it's not conscious when it happens and he thinks that it's just a ""guy thing"" and hates that it's been happening and said he wasn't upset I snooped because he too would've been anxious about the message that was on him lockscreen. I then pressed about him thinking of someone else while we were having sex and he said that it was the same girl he messaged about this issue! He told me thought of her came and left quickly and that not focusing on me had made him go a bit flaccid. 

Now I feel rather insecure and have been concerned since. Today he was in the shower and I was just in the bathroom talking to him when the same friend messaged him and something in my stomach turned and I immediately looked at the conversation. I know it was wrong of me and that I shouldn't have done it and he asked me if I opened the conversation since the notification from her was gone and I told him yes, that I briefly looked but then put it away because I knew it was wrong. He told me it was okay and he truly wasn't mad but reminded me that doing things like that isn't okay. I feel terrible and I'm afraid that he's secretly mad at me even though anger wasn't something he expressed, it was comfort and reassurance instead. As far as these actions go am I the asshole here?

1994,Not the A-hole,"**Update/edit**: thanks everyone, I already kind of thought I’m not the asshole, but since I am not the best for socializing I did wonder if maybe I didn’t realize I was the asshole. 

Maybe now I can feel more relaxed when having earbuds in public. 

Some things to make it more clear: 

I think she got angry because she felt ignored(?), maybe she had to repeat herself and that seems to anger some people, I used to be soft spoken as a child so I know some people hate it




—-

I was at target trying on a pair of heels, I have my earbuds while I shop/go around (I take it off if I have to talk to a cashier or employee). 

This lady is passing by and she has one airpod, she says something and all I can see is her mouth moving, then I remove one earbud and tell her that I’m sorry but I couldn’t hear her. 

She looks angry and says that she likes the shoes I’m trying on, I thank her and kind of try to break the tension by mentioning her airpod and that I may get a pair, she seems even more angry now and says “yeah but I only have one in public because I’m not rude”. The whole thing was weird and it felt a little passive aggressive.

Here’s my reasons..

1. I listen to music in public to kind of be in my own zone, wearing only one earbud would be pretty worthless for that
2.  I usually have a focus when I go shopping, I hate listening to strangers conversations, kind of distracts me
3. It may sound silly but I also use it to avoid random men flirting with me sometimes, I’ve had even store employees do that so it bothers me. 
4. I feel that listening to music makes me relax, I’m a bit of an anxious person so it helps

I’ve never thought it’s an issue, I feel that I don’t owe random people my attention (unless they’re an employee or something), the only times I think it could be an issue is if I’m in the way (but I’m a small woman and my anxiety always makes me really aware so I’m never standing in a path).

We share locations with each other and we have even prior to our relationship, it just something my family and friends do Incase anything ever happens. Yesterday I was leaving school and checking to see if my grandparents were home, when I did I noticed that my girlfriend was at a old weed dealers house, this guy has hit her up at 2am saying ‘What’s the deal, come over’ and things of that nature more than once. Now, I’ve acknowledged that this bothers me in the past and out of respect of the relationship she said she would stop going through him. 

So immediately I messaged her, I asked her what she was doing over there. She responded with “Picking up ____ from *insert dealers name* house” I was fine with it and relieved, just told her I wish she would of communicated with me. 

Now, as I go back to check to see if she had left, she’s still there 20 minutes later. So I got a little suspicious, we grew up in a small town so of course I knew the guy. I decided to message him and ask him what was going on. He proceeded to tell me that he was kicking it with *insert girlfriends name*.  I asked about it and again she covered it up.

It has turned me into a dick towards her and I feel like I’m questioning her every move, I ended things. As the day went by I slowly became less mad and agreed to meet with her, she started crying and asking for me back, touching me, and me being a fool I chose her back. But now I’m just right back to being a dick to her and questioning everything.

So AITA for letting one lie cause so much turmoil?",18,42,0.82

1998,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend has bedbugs.  She’s said she only found three and told her apartment manager.  Exterminators are coming next week.  I’ve been present and quick to answer calls and texts from her, but I really don’t want to take any chances on them spreading to me.  She’s feeling hurt about it.  She said that she would shower, get dressed from the clothes that were just washed, and leave her apartment without touching anything.  That there would be no way they would spread.  

I feel bad for her.  I miss her too.   I’ve just went through that hell before and never want to again.  ",25,87,0.96
1999,No A-holes here,"I was a supervisor for some years at a local manufacturing plant with a strict policy on attendance. This happened within days of me getting my promotion.

I took over a department that had been without supervision for a while and as such was in pretty bad shape. The employees were basically running wild because they had been able to do whatever they wanted for the better half of a year, including missing as many days as they wanted with no repercussions. This is what I walked into. I immediately started doing warnings for attendance and other issues to try and get the department in line. One employee (I'll call him K) I wrote up when I first started had missed several more days than were allowed according to policy, and the only reason I didn't fire K was because no one had written him up about his excessive absences. In my write up, I explained that if K was late, or missed any more days his employment would be terminated. Two days later, K came in 2 hours late. I brought him to HR and terminated his employment as I had promised. As I was walking K out he told me that it was pretty messed up that I had fired him the day he found out he had cancer, that i had basically killed him by taking away the health insurance needed to fight it. I had some discretion to cut him some slack, but didn't, even though I felt bad. So, AITA?

Edit: I found out about his cancer diagnosis after terminating him, while escorting him off the premises",63,53,0.85
