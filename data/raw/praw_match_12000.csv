0,Not the A-hole,"I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit due to info request: We were not spooning, she was sitting next to me laying on my chest.

Edit of my own free will: Idk if it's important info, but I didn't yell.

Edit: I think I've read most everything now, thanks for all the messages of support and hate, I liked them all. Some people asked me to make an update post, I don't think I will, sorry. I've been speaking to them over the past few days and I know why they said what they said (although it's not relevant to me telling them to fuck off), but it's pretty personal and I don't feel like sharing. I wont be apologizing to any of them, especially now that I know their reasoning. I love my wife, but it hurts that she doesn't trust me.",2680,37090,0.93
1,No A-holes here,"We both can cook. Lately he’s been cooking more than me because of my work schedule vs his (I cooked maybe 2 months ago) but for a little background info: I work 60-80+ hours a week (I’m a resident) and he’s unemployed/between jobs/drives Lyft occasionally. 

Also, I’ve had a gastric sleeve over 1.5 years ago, so the amount of food I can or want to eat is way less than his. 

The other night I was eating a bowl of cereal for dinner because that’s all I wanted. He came home after a couple of Lyft drives, saw me eating and said he’s hungry. I said okay, well I’m just going to eat cereal. He then asked me if I can cook some food for him and I giggled and said no. And that made him mad. I laughed because I was surprised that he asked me since I told him I’m fine with just cereal and thought he was joking. He later said me laughing made him mad, and he’s really bothered that I haven’t cooked in a long time and he feels like I don’t care about his hunger.

I’m currently on one of the busiest rotations we have in my program - and I have been since July 1st. There’s been days when I come home exhausted/burned out and he’s done absolutely nothing all day. So yes, I haven’t cooked in a long time. But I figure given my work schedule vs his, it’s only fair that he picks up more of the house work. I can see his perspective, but if I’m hungry I can figure out food for myself and don’t expect him to cook for me, whether or not I’m tired.

So AITA for not cooking for him?",32,37,0.85
2,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account.

So myself and my group of friends are in our early to mid 20s. Most of us still live with our parents so we’ll generally have a party or get together around someone’s house whenever one of us has a free house. One of my friends, R, is a Muslim girl and doesn’t drink alcohol because of this; she is the only person in the group that doesn’t.

Whenever one of us hosts something all of us always bring our own booze for the evening (the host normally says “bring booze” in the invite or whatever but everyone knows to anyway). However, R tends to not bring anything at all and asks on the evening if she can drink the host’s soft drinks. A few of us noticed this and brought it up amongst ourselves but to my knowledge she was never pulled up/asked why she does this.

In my opinion it is rude of R to assume that the host of the party will be cool with her helping herself to their soft drinks. I know most of us live with our parents so it can be argued that she is not necessarily taking drinks we have paid for, but at the end of the day it is still drink that my friends and/or their parents have bought for themselves. On top of this, if I am not drinking alcohol at a get together for whatever reason I will still bring what I am drinking for the evening and I don’t understand why R feels she gets a free pass when everyone else in the group always brings drink.

Anyway, I hosted a get together recently and fairly early on in the evening she asked if she could a have a glass of Coke from the bottle I had in the fridge. The conversation then preceded pretty much as follows:

Me: “Have you not bought anything to drink?”
R: “No”
Me: “Why not?”
R: “Well why would I bring booze when I don’t drink it?”
Me: “Yes, but you could still bring what you’re drinking for the evening. Everyone else has, booze or otherwise, and it’s rude to assume that I’d be fine with you just helping yourself to my Coke”
R: “Why are you having a go at me over this? I’m literally just asking for a glass of Coke”

At this point I could sense an argument brewing and I didn’t want the evening to have an tense atmosphere from the start, so I went and got her the drink. I then said to her that going forward if I’m hosting something I expect her to bring what she’s drinking for the evening as per everyone else. Notably she was then a bit sulky for the rest of the night and left early.

I was hanging out with some of my friends (not including R) a few days later when one of them brought it up. Some said I had a valid point and it was fair to call her out on it whilst others said I upset her and made a big deal out of nothing.

So yeah, AITA?

**EDIT: Responses to a few recurring questions/comments:**

**“What do you guys do for mixers?”** - The majority of our group predominantly drinks beer, cider or wine so this isn’t really an issue. Occasionally me and a couple of friends might have vodka or gin and we always bring our own mixers when we do.

**“What do you guys do for food?”** - We don’t really have a set thing for food but generally some people will eat beforehand and the rest will order a takeaway or something and split the cost amongst themselves. If someone hosts something like a BBQ then everyone chips in for the cost of the food.

**“It depends how much she normally has to drink”** - I’d say she probably drinks at the same pace as us throughout the evening so probably on average she’s having 6-10 glasses or cans of drink.",220,192,0.87

4,Not the A-hole,"So basically, the place me and my boyfriend live doesn't have a washing machine. His mom kindly told us we can use her machine when we visit, which is usually twice a week. We arrived with our laundry but she was using the washing machine was in use. We waited, but then I realized I can't wait around because I had work. I told my BF to just chuck the clothes in (mostly my underwear and 1 dress) when the washer was done. So I leave and come back to ask my BF where my clothes are. He said that he only did one load before he needed to leave so he just left the clothes there for next time. Ok cool. We went there 2 days later and ask his mom where my stuff is. She doesn't know. I look everywhere and think hmmm that is weird I really need to wash my underwear. 2 more days pass and I ask her again where are my clothes? She said that she ""thinks"" she threw them away while cleaning her house. She said she didn't know who they belonged to so she just threw them away and she is very sorry.

WELL I was really upset about this. First of all this felt really personal. None of my BF's clothes were missing plus she lives with her two teenage daughters who have very similar Victoria Secret underwear to mine and none of there stuff was missing either. Of course they are just clothes, I can always get new stuff but for me it is about the principle. I told my BF that I need her to pay me back for what she threw away. At least $100 since she also threw away a dress of mine. He thinks I'm being an asshole for no reason. He said ""YoU HaVe PleNTy Of mOnEY JuST BuY NeW OnEs"" and also ""IT WaS aN AcCiDenT"" Again It is about the principle. If I ""accidentally"" threw away her stuff I would be expected to pay for its replacement and I would do it because I'm not a shitty human. I've asked his mom for the money and she said she will pay me ""soon"" whatever that means. I'm sure she will, but now the whole family, including my BF act like they have some problem with me. They don't treat me the same and all I can think of is ""HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU MAD AT ME!""

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Just to clarify, We offered to pay for laundry in the begging but she refused to accept it so I didn't offer after a while. We bring our own soap and take our wet clothes home to hang dry in the sun usually. She doesn't have a dryer so we either hang them there or at home. The clothes were left in a green laundry basket that my BF mom gave to him. Also, his mom was not doing our laundry we were just using her machine.",1068,6900,0.95
5,Not the A-hole,"So, I'm a 21 year old female. I've started working at this company 5 months ago as a junior developer. I'm by far the youngest person at both the company and within my team, the second youngest being a 45 year old guy. My female co worker that's been working here for 20 years is quitting to pursue something new, and we're holding a farewell dinner and pitching in together for a parting gift. Now the gift they chose is particularly expensive, and would cost each of us like 100 euros. I joined the company after they made some ""reforms"". For instance, I don't get an end of the year bonus like my co workers and I don't get a lease car, I don't get my health benefits covered or any of that and since I'm in a junior position, I make way, waaay less (though still considerably much considering my age) money than my co workers, yet they expect me to pitch in the same amount as them even though they worked with her for decades and I've only been working here for a few months. I don't really think it's fair to expect that of me, especially since I'm in the middle of trying to buy an apartment and need every bit of money I can get right now...

6,Not the A-hole,"So i’m fairly sure im in the wrong but i’d like some other people’s opinions. Me and my friend (both guys) are planning to go overseas for around 2 weeks next November. I brought this up to my girlfriend and she said no straight away and wouldn’t provide a reason, just no. I was naturally disappointed with this and brought it up later. She explained “the reason I don’t want u going is I’ll miss you, I’ll be extremely anxious the whole time and ur in a different time zone so we can hardly talk and I won’t know what ur doing or if something goes wrong.”

We’ve been dating for the past year and I understand her perspective and she has pretty bad anxiety. I’ve called the trip off because I want to do what’s best for her but i’m also really really disappointed because i’ve never been overseas before.

7,Not the A-hole,"I don't have many friends in my grade. Basically only two best friends and they decided to sit together on the bus during our school trip to Poland.

The next best option was to sit behind them with the only guy who wasn't paired. He's a gay classmate who's a little weird.

I think this guy ""H"" has some type of autism. He does things like stare at people inappropriately long, talk loudly or laugh in serious situations. He also doesn't have a good sense of personal boundaries and likes to get very close to people, not realizing it's strange.

That's exactly what happened when I sat next to him. H got over-excited when I started playing a difficult game on my tablet and kept begging me to try it out and distracting me.

When he felt sleepy he asked if he could lean on my shoulder because he can't fall asleep sitting upright. I'm like, dude no. Personal boundaries and all. But he asked so loudly the guys behind us heard and started laughing, so they and some other classmates teased us that we're secretly a gay couple.

Just to clarify, I'm not gay and so H's actions made me uncomfortable. H also then overreacted to those guys teasing us instead of letting the joke die, so of course that added more fuel to fire.

I was tired of all this crap and it wasn't worth putting up with just so I could sit near my friends. So I lied to the teacher that I was feeling road sick and might throw up, just so she'd bring me over to the front of the bus with her and I'd escape from all the drama.

Am I the asshole for doing this? I feel bad that H is socially challenged in some way but I don't think that's my fault or problem to fix.",76,535,0.93

11,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys first post here I need to know cuz I feel really bad right now.

My sister (20 F) and I (17 M) both live in France. I'm starting uni this year so I asked my mum if I could apply and try to do all the paperwork myself because I need practice for when I live on my own (France is well known for its hellish amounts of paperwork for anything). I managed to do most of it by myself and so my sister asked (she was in England at the time working) if I could re-apply her for her third and final year in uni since she didn't have a computer.

Since I was going to England too visiting family, I told her that we could do it together at our grandparents. So I go over there and ask her when she should do it but she was also dealing with some health issues at that time and unfortunately the deadline to fill out her re-inscription was only a few days ahead. So I told her I'll try and do it by myself, this was the day before the deadline. I thought I had managed to do all of it well but when unfortunately I mistakenly ticked ONE wrong box and applied her to a completely different town than the one she had her student living accomodation (1h30 apart from both towns).

I sent loads of emails, tried calling the university that evening and the next morning (deadline was at 12 a.m) but nothing went through. I told her and she panicked but I told her that in a few weeks they re-open applications (like a sort of second time round) and that we can try again then. 

She's been screaming at me and blaming me for the past few weeks and I understand that I messed up but I told her that she has to deal with it now because 1) Im moving myself to a different town for the first time so I've also got a load on my plate and 2) she had like 1-2 months to re-apply before hand. 

Today was the re-opening date so I got my sister up this morning with a cup of cocoa, gave her the numbers she had to call and told her they open at 10. 

She's tried like 5 times and they keep redirecting her to different people and nothing is getting done about it. So she won't talk to me now and blames me for everything, says its my duty to sort it all out and that now she's gonna lose her student accomodation and have to move back in with our parents and lose a year of her life doing nothing.

Tommorow we are going to said town because I need to buy stuff for my new place and at the same time we're going to go to the university since it might be easier sorting things out in person.

I feel really bad about it now, my sister has been through a lot (suffers from anxiety and depression), am I the asshole here ? I tried my best to fix things up but I got my own shit to worry about now.

Tl;dr : Sister has to study in a different town than the one she needs to live in because I messed up and she blames me for everything.",101,357,0.94

13,Everyone Sucks,"So this whole situation with my girlfriend began about two weeks ago. We have been dating for 3, going on 4 years (this December) and we have two dogs together. I used to have a ball python as a child and I missed having one, so I decided to ask her how she felt about me possibly getting one again. When I initially approached her about it, she asked why I wanted one as they gross her out and she has zero interest in ever owning one. I explained to her that it would be on the first floor, you know, out of sight and out of mind.  

She said that she did not care if I got one, but she does not like snakes so she wants nothing to do with it. After about two weeks, one of my good friends and I take a trip to the reptile store to go look at a couple of ball pythons. She calls me while I am there and again says the same thing she had said before. Her exact words were “do whatever the fuck you want”. Fast forward to this past Monday night when my girlfriend and I are laying in bed. She turns over in bed and asks me “What are you going to do about that snake?”  I was rather confused and asked her what she meant. She told me that she was unable to watch tv because the snake was freaking her out. Keep in mind its in a 10 gallon tank tucked away in the corner of the room. 

She refuses to talk to me about anything but getting rid of the snake and we have been arguing about it for the past couple of nights. 

AITA for getting a snake after asking my girlfriend if I could get one and her response being “do whatever the fuck you want”?",141,31,0.8
14,Not the A-hole,"To preface this, I am childfree but I genuinely love kids and often spend time with my friends' kids and, when I'm able, I spend as much time as I can with my other brother's kids (I live across country from both bros). 

Recently, both brothers traveled to my state with their respective families for our cousins wedding. They were both here for a week or so, but one drove out here with a camper and the other flew. 

My husband and I offered our home to the brother and sister-in-law that flew and their kids. The other brother we gave several recommendations to for great campgrounds nearby that we thought they and the kids would enjoy. 

Well, the brother staying with us has awesome kids who I get legit jacked about seeing whenever I get to. They're funny and kind and just all around sweet kids who are easy to handle. I ended up spending a couple of days going out and showing them around and having a great time. 

I also went out of my way to spend a day just with the other brother and his step kids but to be frank, it was fucking miserable. He has three steps kids and the older two are nice enough but kind of moody, while the youngest is just... Honestly? A shitty fuckin kid. She's incredibly rude, obnoxious and downright *mean*, which is pretty fucked up for a seven year old. 

I spent one day with them and I was at my wit's end. I managed to spend two full days with my other brother's kids on top of having them at out house for four evenings without feeling overwhelmed or annoyed, but one afternoon with these kids and I was *done*. 

He texted me today wanting me to go out on a day trip with him and his step kids and wife again and I politely declined, saying I was tired and needed a day to myself. He got upset because this was going to be their last day here and I had spent so much time with our other brother and his kids and he felt like I didn't care as much about spending time with his family. 

If I'm totally honest, yeah I actually don't care as much about spending time with his family, because his step kids are brats and I find them completely exhausting. I have genuinely made the effort to get to know them (they've only been in the picture for a couple years) and I've been trying, but I honestly hate spending time with them and can only handle so much.  

My brother accused me of liking my other brother's kids more and I straight up admitted that, yeah, I do. I admitted that I think his kids are brats and I don't like being around them. 

He's pissed and my Mom thinks it was mean and uncalled for to tell him the truth about how I feel about his kids, but I feel like my only other choices were to lie and pretend I was busy or to suck it up and pretend those kids' behaviour is acceptable. 

So AITA for admitting that I don't want to spend time with my brothers step kids / don't like them? Or justified in being honest?",158,982,0.97
15,Not the A-hole,"I was taking clients out to dinner a while ago, ten miles east of nowhere and over an hour’s drive from the town I and my friend live in. 

I spotted her husband and some woman at a table and figured she was a friend or colleague of the husband’s and went over to say hi thinking it was a funny coincidence. 

I get up to the table and the husband looks like a deer in headlights and says “listen this is not what it looks like” and pulled me aside. 

Before I could even realize what was going on he said “I’m ending it. I’m here to end it. Please don’t tell [his wife] it would only upset her.” 

For some background, his wife has been dealing with an illness and the treatment kills her sex drive (not indefinitely - just for the duration of the treatment.) So the husband explained this woman I saw him with was for carnal release, he had no plans to leave my friend and he loves her, and I shouldn’t tell her about this. 

So I think it over and try to put myself in her shoes and decide if it eventually comes out later that this had gone on and I knew, she would have every right to be angry. I thought if I was in her shoes I would want to know.  

So I just sat down and told her “this is what I observed and I felt you should know.” 

Obviously it destroyed her emotionally. The catch is — her husband really was breaking up with the fling now that the treatments were concluding and he could have sex with his wife again. This has been confirmed by a third party. 

So a lot of my friends are basically saying I stuck my nose in where it didn’t belong and I ruined her marriage. 

The friend says she recognizes I was trying to help but she needs some time apart from me to process all these events. 

Now I’m severely regretting saying anything, especially since it seems like they would’ve gone on with business as usual if I’d shut my mouth because he was breaking up with the woman. 

AITA?

17,Not the A-hole,"For context, I come from an Asian household and English is not my first language. My mother had recently gave me a proposition to sell the house she's living in (my childhood house) to me for 100k and help her pay her other debts (credit cards and other loans) with it. Her plan was i'll get a loan from the bank for 100k to buy the house and she'll give me back half of it so i can pay my debts too. So we purge all our debts and only focusing on paying 1 debt together. Reason for this was because i finally got a good paying job, (not that high but i'm finally financially stable) and my salary is the only one enough to pull this off. I also have some debts that i'm still paying such student loans and a car that i bought for my mom to use. I'm the 3rd child in the family and both of my older siblings are not financially capable of doing it.

I'm still in my twenties and i wish to work overseas in a couple years time and do not wish to carry this debt that will take at least 30 years to pay. I asked my partner's advice about it and she said that it's insane that my mother is asking me to pay for her debt for a house that i don't even want (it's a shitty house). I honestly don't know what to think because as I grew up Asian i feel obligated to help my mom pay for her debts as she said she'll give me back 50k and i can pay my own debts so we'll just end up with just 1 debt to pay. Not to mention she's still gonna live in the house so there's no way i can sell it because she won't have a place to stay.

My partner is not Asian so I told her its very hard for me to accept that she's telling me my mom is being manipulative and taking advantage of me and in my culture it isn't that simple to throw my family away. I asked my sister and another asian friend about it and they said that she's my mom so she's not doing it out of maliciousness and genuinely wants to make the situation better and i as her child owe her as she has raised me till i got this good job.

I'm considering saying no and cutting off contact with her in case she still insisted because i don't want to live a life full of debts even if its just 1 debt. I'm starting to resent her cause she's being selfish for putting me on the spot and sacrificing my future to inherit her debts. I'm offended that her reasoning for it was she doesn't want we to fight for inheritance when she dies and paying for 1 debt is better than trying to pay all the other debts. I don't even want the house, i don't care about inheritance they can take the shitty house and how does taking a debt to pay for another debt makes sense??

I haven't said no and she's bugging me for my copy of salary slips to go on. Worse of it she ask me not to tell anyone about it but i told my sister anyways and I cant believe she sides with her. Am i the asshole here?? How do i even say no to this??",26,27,0.92
18,Not the A-hole,"So I’m going go make this quick. Not a whole lot to be said. I’m going to do my best to summarize the situation. 
My wife and I have a baby on the way. Baby is due in December. I’ve never had a child of my own, but I have two step children. We’re newly weds.
Long story shorter, we’ve just moved. We’ve been in the house about 5 days now. My wife and I have discussed getting a puppy after the baby is born but I’ve repeatedly stated I need to adjust to a baby (first time father of my own child) before introducing a new financial element into the mix. To paint the picture, 
We’re dead broke. There’s barely money for basic groceries. We haven’t unpacked. I work 5-7 days. Week and every 1.5 months I get 3 days off for a weekend. We haven’t received any bills for utilities yet (which will be approximately the triple cost). Our rent is $200 more a month and she’s about to quit her job due to being pregnant. So this places a financial burden on me of around $600 plus a month (approx) on top of what I already pay. I’m stressed about the money. I love my wife, but I’ve stated I’m not ready for a dog yet multiple times.

So here’s the issue. Today while I was at work she tells me “ I have a surprise. Don’t be angry because I’m not apologizing.” BAM. It’s a puppy. The dog has fleas. We haven’t unpacked yet. And one of my step children stated “she went be behind your back and got a dog!” 
So now we have a puppy. She’s 6 months pregnant and won’t be able to care for it. She won’t be working so I will be picking up the financial slack of her not working PLUS having a new born...and now a puppy. I’m trying to do my best with the situation but I’m really aggravated that she went behind my back and got another financially draining thing added to my list of things to care for. 
I love my wife. And I love dogs. But I don’t feel the timing is right and she stated “I didn’t ask because you would have said no.” 
I’m upset because we’ve discussed this and I wasn’t quite ready. I’m upset because I will be the one paying for the animal since I make the money and she has no health benefits. She will be unemployed with no means of income. And I’m hurt because I feel she blatantly disregarded my feelings in the matter and didn’t care what I felt about the situation.
Am I the asshole for not wanting to care for a puppy yet? 

Thanks for your feedback. I’ll try my best to respond.",59,38,0.92
19,Asshole,"For context, I’m a grad student and been dating my girlfriend for a little over two years. We are quite serious, and had talked about moving in together, marrying, kids and the like.  
 

A few months ago, I was out drinking with a buddy who brought along his friends. I’d never met any of them before, but we got along great. I had noticed that one of them, his sister-in-law to be precise, was being a little more than flirty but I didn’t think too much of it.  

A few hours later, we’re blind drunk and having sex in a hotel. 

A few days later, I finally pick up the courage to talk to my girlfriend and tell her what happened. We break up immediately. I apologize profusely, telling her what a huge mistake I’d made, and begging her to take me back. She tells me that there is no way in hell that that will happen. 

A month goes by, and at this point I’ve given up hope. She’s blocked me on all social media and refuses to answer my texts. The other girl has been texting me the entire time, and I finally cave and grab drinks with her. We end up being FWBs, although I’m very clear to her that I’m in no position to be anything more than that. At various times, we have sex without protection, although I always make sure we buy the morning-after pill the next day.  

After a few weeks, my ex-girlfriend texts me and says she wants to meet. We end up having a very long, emotional conversation with many tears and she takes me back. One of the conditions she has though, is that I’m to no longer see or have any kind of contact with the other girl, which I readily agree to (after sending her a text letting her know what happened).  

Fast forward 2-3 weeks and I start noticing certain symptoms and I immediately get myself tested. My worst fears are confirmed and I text my girlfriend immediately who also tests positive. I ask my girlfriend if it’d be okay if I text the other girl and let her know so she can get tested too, and she vehemently says no. I feel like I have a responsibility to do so, so I text her anyway. Cue the other girl calling me all kinds of names, and cussing me out for implying that she gave me the disease (which in all probability, she did). I get a text from my friend a few hours later tearing into me as well, saying he’s going to tell our friend-group about my behavior. That weekend, while my girlfriend is using my iPad, she finds out that I had texted the other girl and is now furious at me as well for breaking one of her few conditions. We aren’t talking again, and I fear she may break up with me again. 

I know that it was wrong of me to cheat on her, and that breaking up with the other girl via text wasn’t the most gentlemanly thing to do, but AITA for telling her that she might have/have given me chlamydia and that she should get tested ASAP as well?

My GF (F24) has a gynaecologist appointment this afternoon, which she told me (M25) about a few weeks ago, but I completely forgot about. When she told me about it she asked if I could pick her up afterwards, as her doc is about a 1 1/2 hour ride/walk away from our home using public transportation. I agreed of course, because she's a great gal and I want her to be happy.

About 4 years ago I started my first job as a technical support manager at a lighting company. We were a department of about 8 technicians, who each handled the support for some countries. I handled middle east, some other guy was responsible for russia and so on.

These guys were like a small family to me, and we regularly gathered after work so we can go grab some food and drinks together.I've spent about 3 years working there and quit because I was just not getting paid as much as I needed, and so did a few of the other guys.One of them, the guy who held us together like glue, moved to the USA so we kinda just stopped hanging out after that.

Now here comes the conflict with this.

A few days ago the 'murica dude was like ""Hey, I'm in Austria for vacation for a few days, how about we gather the guys and grab some dinner <today>.""Now this was a pretty neat idea, as we haven't met for over a year and I excitedly agreed to the meet-up.

This morning as GF and I were getting ready for work I told her about my plans for the evening and she reminded me I promised to pick her up after her doctor's appointment.Her appointment is at 15:30; I work until 16:30. Driving to her doc and back home takes me roughly 2 hours. The meet-up was planned for 17:00 and would be on my way home. From home it's another half hour ride to get there.I was a bit befuddled because I completely forgot about it and asked her if she could ride the train home, so I can hang out with the guys, because I would be about 2 hours late to the meet-up. She gave me a very mellow ""Well okay.""After that I offered her that I could go ask my boss if I can leave early, so I can pick her up and go to the meet up afterwards but she told me I should go meet the guys instead, again in a very mellow tone.

Leaving work early I would still be late to get there, but only by half an hour or so, if she doesn't have any delays at the doc.

WIBTA if I don't pick her up?

&#x200B;

Edit: 

Thank you very much for your opinions. I've realized that forgetting about it and insisting on the meet-up makes her feel like I don't value her. 

We talked again and I'll go pick her up. We have a flexible time model at work, so leaving early should not be that big a deal, I just have to work in the time some other day.",104,191,0.93
21,Not the A-hole,"So throwaway because I don't want to link this to my main account and because I don't want to be identified sorry. Also father's day in Australia is at the start of September.  
My husband and I have been married for 6 years and we have a 4 and 2 year old and had our third child 9 weeks ago. So basically my husband hasn't gotten me anything for mother's day the last 2 years, I do understand I am not his mother but I thought because our kids were so young we would help them get the other parent gifts until they could do so themselves. I continued to get him amazing father's day presents and I was really upset when I again got nothing this year and when I asked why he couldn't really give me an answer other than he was super busy and forgot.   
My kids and I were having coffee and a playdate with MIL, SIL and my nieces and nephews last week when my SIL bought up father's day and was gushing over the present she got her husband. They asked me what I got for my husband and I said nothing. That he hadn't gotten me anything in years so I assumed we were no longer getting gifts for each other on these days. They both got really upset with me and lectured me on how ""men will be men"" and I shouldn't hold it above his head. 

I am no beginning to think that I am being an asshole but at the same time, why is it fair that I get nothing? So WIBTA for not getting him a gift because I am getting so much flack from MIL and SIL now and they said they were going to tell my husband so I'm sure we'll have a big arguement about this later.",86,248,0.95

I'm just not a fan of kids. I'm usually pretty busy with work, and my idea of a good time is not singing a bunch of nursery rhymes or listening to stories about their imaginary friends. There's a reason I don't have kids, because I don't want them. But my brother seems to think that I want nothing to do with them because they're adopted and not blood related. I'm thinking he feels a little bad that he didn't have any biological children--my parents certainly have a lot to say about that mixed with the fact I don't want kids at all, so they don't have any biological grandchildren. But I really would feel the same way about his kids if they were his biological kids; kids are kids, whether they're blood related to me or not, and I'm not a fan of them. AITA?",108,256,0.96

24,Asshole,"I (27M) moved in with my ex bf Brian (30M) after escaping an abusive relationship. 

About 6 months into my relationship with Brian, he felt very sick and told me he might be dying and put me as the sole beneficiary on his life insurance and gave me instructions for after his demise. Well, after a quick check up with the doctor, it turned out to be nothing too serious, and he made a quick recovery after being given a prescription for antibiotics.

Brian treated me very well during our 2 year relationship. But, I never saw my self as the house husband type, which he was okay with... but due to mental health issues and a few other things, I never ended up getting a job after moving in with Brian. 

Supporting me financially while I did not do much in the way of housework caused a lot of resentment in our relationship which came to a head about 3 months ago and we ended our relationship. I moved back in with my mother in rural Mississippi (not exactly a fun place to be gay y'all).  Despite not being able to work it out, I loved Brian very much, as I believe he did me as well, even after the breakup. It sucked being in love with one another but not being able to work it out.

But here's where things get really upsetting... about a month after Brian and I broke up, Brian was tragically killed when a drunk driver T-boned his car.

Brian had no will. As I was still named on his insurance, I got a payout of $200,000 from his policy. He was generally a don't sweat the small stuff outside of work kinda guy so I'm sure he just never got around to changing it... he HATED paper work.

His brother (26M), as next of kin, received his assets, totaling about $300,000.

I would give up the money in a heart beat to bring Brian back, but I can't lie, it has really turned my life around for the better. It goes a long way around here, and I was very much struggling before the payout.

However my his brother, who Brian described as spoiled and ungrateful,  has filed a lawsuit against me for the life insurance payout, arguing that since we were not together at the time, it was not meant for me. I have vowed to fight him tooth and nail for the money. I was named on the policy, and it's not like Brian's brother was left with nothing. 

I am not asking whether or not I am legally entitled to the money... that's the lawyer's job. I am just asking if I am being fair.

### Am I the asshole for fighting my deceased ex boyfriend's brother to keep the life insurance policy my ex took out for me?

Or would the right thing be to give the money back to Brian's brother as Brian and I were no longer dating at the time of his death?

Brian's brother also argues that since we broke up ""because I was a freeloader"" it make me taking the money even more wrong",73,54,0.88
25,No A-holes here,"My sister and I used to plan our dream weddings together when we were kids. We always said we would be each other’s maids of honor. As we grew up we stopped (but still shared cute dresses we found online) until she got engaged and asked me to be her maid of honor. It was amazing and fun and it was great to look back on all those times as kids. My sister and I are still really close.

I recently got engaged and I want my sister to be maid of honor, but to be honest it’s just a lot of work. She’s very busy and she’s not exactly organized. I had to help her fix some logistical problems for her wedding that could have been prevented fairly easily with better organization on her part. My fiancé and I don’t have a lot of money, and a lot of the wedding is going to be diy. 

My very close friend is already very excited, and is sending me cute cheap ideas that fit my theme. She’s very logistical and is amazing at planning and budgeting. She’s an artist and wants to help with the diys. I haven’t even picked bridesmaids and she’s already being absolutely amazing.

I want to ask my friend to be maid of honor because I don’t want to give the maid of honor responsibilities to my sister. I think she’d hate it, other than the actual day of. I know my friend would do an amazing job but I don’t want to hurt my sister.

26,Not the A-hole,"I’m on mobile, sorry.
It’s an incredibly long story but I’ll give you the short version. A little over a year ago I started having some health problems. It took the better part of the past year to get a diagnoses which still isn’t 100%. My mother is a loud mouth and had to tell everyone she knew about this and keep them updated, so when I received my first diagnoses (MS) of course she told a million people and I was NOT happy, that was something I didn’t feel people needed to know, I didn’t want anyone’s pity. Shortly afterwards my neurologist told me I did not have MS but had a rare genetic disorder called adult onset leukodystrophy, my mother has been better at not spreading this news but I still have all these people she originally told about MS asking about my health every time I see them. Leukodystrophy and MS have pretty much the same effects, at least at the beginning, and I’m really tired of trying to explain to everyone what leukodystrophy is when I don’t even fully understand it yet. I mean, I don’t really want all these people knowing my personal business anyway. WIBTA if I just told them it was MS? There’s really no difference as far as a bunch people who don’t know anything about demyelination anyway are concerned and people know what MS is, or at least think they do. Nobody has ever even heard of leukodystrophy.


**EDIT** I just want to make clear my moms not a bad person she just did a shitty thing. She was scared, I’m her kid and I’m sick, she was looking for support. I just wish she hadn’t looked for it from so many people. I’m not angry with her (anymore) but I also have no interest in broadcasting my business, or explaining what’s going on over and over again.",27,51,0.92
27,Not the A-hole,"My grandfather had to put up with a lot from my grandmother. I am not trying to speak ill of the dead here, because my grandmother had a lot of trust issues with hospitals and doctors due to a dark history that I won’t get into here. But as a result, when she got sick (cirrhosis of the liver) as she got older, it lead to her not wanting to be cared for by them. My uncle tried hiring private nurses to come to my grandparents’, but my grandma sent them away. The only person she trusted/wanted was my grandfather (likely because when she went through her past trauma with doctors, he was the only one there). It took a toll on him, though. Eventually, there was nothing more that could be done and she needed round the clock care by professionals, so she was moved to a nursing home that could tend to that until her death, where everyone visited her daily. That was seven years ago.

About a year after that, my grandfather started dating again. No one blamed him for moving on so soon. So much of his life had been dedicated to my grandmother’s illnesses, it was time for him to focus on himself. He mostly played the field, but would occasionally see this one woman we’ll call “Margaret”, who lives in the same retirement community as him. He quite liked her and as the years have gone on, they’ve gotten closer and we all assumed they would become an official item at one point. My mom (his daughter) really pushed this, because she wants him to be happy and not alone.

Then, Margaret was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. She moved out of the retirement community and in with her daughter. She’s still with it for now, but they don’t know when things will start to go downhill. My grandfather has visited her a couple of times since, but has now said he doesn’t want to go through the same thing he did with my grandmother, having to watch someone deteriorate. He’s not stupid, he knows that he’s old and that if he ever did move on seriously, that person could likely die before him, but he can’t deal with another sick person.

My mom thinks it’s bullshit and says he’s abandoning Margaret in her time of need. I told my grandfather he’s taking care of himself and doing what he needs to do. He spent so much of his life taking care of everyone else (his wife, his kids-worked two jobs, etc). He shouldn’t stay with someone if he’s uncomfortable. My mom says I’m wrong for supporting him and we need to encourage him to “do the right thing”. I think he’s a grown man and we can’t make him do anything. I do see her side in a way, because she also is asking how he’d feel if someone did the same to him.

28,Not the A-hole,"So a little background, I live on the second floor of a triplex home. Recently, someone new moved into the third floor and has been putting in new floors, so there are workers in and out of the building all day. 

To get to my back door, you have to walk up 2 flights of steps to get to a very small deck area.

So I'm leaving my apartment yesterday to catch a bus (time sensitive) and there's this older woman I've never seen before walking up my steps onto my deck. She's smoking a cigarette. This isn't that important, but I think cigarettes are disgusting and that it's rude to smoke in public. She starts basically yelling in my face, speaking very rudely. This is how the conversation goes:

Woman: Is Jim here?

Me (shortly): No. 

W: The workers in there, are they on break??

M: There are no workers in there. Get off my porch.

At this point she starts walking back down the steps.

W: You don't have to be rude!

M: Well when you come on my property, I'm allowed to be.

W:It's not your property, YOU RENT!!

Now she is in the grass.

W: I try to be a good neighbor, but no...

M: I've lived here for a year, if you were such a good neighbor, I'd know who you were.

At this point she is gone and I go catch my bus. I didn't think much of it but when I told my parents about it my dad called me mean and said I was too harsh. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, I was rude to her, but I just think it's disrespectful to come to someone's BACK porch, speak to them so abruptly with no introduction all while smoking, and expect to be met with kindness. That's just not who I am. So AITA?",40,112,0.96
29,Not the A-hole,"This happened on my way home from work today and I still can’t believe this actually happened. 

I ride a motorcycle, and having the ability to be less restricted by sitting in a car, if I see something that can be done quick I’ll generally do it. This includes things such as picking up garbage at stop lights, closing gas covers on cars, etc. All small things that don’t really matter. 

Anyways, on my commute to work there’s quite a bit of construction that results in stop and go traffic for about a mile or so. While sitting in traffic, I noticed the gas lid on the car in front of me was open slightly. It was one of those BMW SUV’s so it wasn’t a cheap car. All cars in front and behind me were completely stopped so I figured I’d go close it. I crept forwards on my bike, reached over, and pushed it closed. I figured that would be the end of it but oh no. The lady driving saw me in her mirror and immediately put the car in park and jumped out. She ran around the car towards me. At this point I had backed my bike up so it wasn’t even close to her car anymore. She started yelling at me saying “why did you hit my car!!! Do you know how expensive this is?? I need your license right now!” 

As you can probably guess I was pretty confused and couldn’t really find any words to say to her. She kept yelling at me, then she finally looked at her car and noticed that there was nothing there. No scratches, no dents, not even a fingerprint due to my leather gloves. She turned back to me and said “you’d better learn not to touch other people’s stuff, asshole”, then jumped in her car and drove away. 

I thought I was just doing something nice, AITA?",40,33,0.9
30,Not the A-hole,"I (21F) resigned a lease with three other girls (all 21F), and while this happened last semester, my roommates actions are making me second guess who's TA.

We are all seniors in college, and we are all fairly independent people. The first half of year living together was great- we all respected the ""unspoken"" rules of the apartment and had little to no issues. Come second semester, roommate (for the sake of the post we will call her RA) got a SO and things changed dramatically. At first RA would give a heads up that the BF was coming over/staying the night. Once she knew we were all ""on board"" with him, his visits became more frequent and longer. While it was petty of me, I'll admit, I kept tabs of all of the nights he stayed- in a 30 day period, he stayed a total 18 days/nights. We all tried approaching the subject through casual group chats like ""hey if we could send a text when guests are over that would be great!"" trying to keep it as lighthearted as possible because RA has a tendency to  be passive and eventually blow up. Well, that didn't work. I truly don't mind when people are over and have tried to have a go-with-the-flow attitude, but I had had enough come spring. BF wasn't paying utilities, rent or water. Fast forward another month and we all had a roommate meeting where I did most of the talking (other roommates were scared to confront her because of her previous outbursts). I explained to her that I wasn't comfortable with him being over as much as he is, that it has caused not only my anxiety to rise to the point I can't be near them as a couple, but it was also impacting my other 2 roommate's mental health.  I explained that it wasn't fair to any of us to have a fifth roommate that we didn't ask for nor want to have living with us. Additionally, since I did look at the lease, I explained that with him being over as much as he is, we are in violation of our contract and could be evicted. I understand that it may have felt attacking, but rather than apologize and or take any ownership of the issue at hand, RA blew up. She said that he is only here to help with her anxiety because ""I hate living with you guys, I hate you, and I wish i never resigned. If i could live alone I would."" RA said that she would not be changing anything, he is her guest and only stays in her room so he will continue to stay as much as she would like.

Fast forward 3 months to today, she has moved back in for the upcoming year and has yet to talk to me (or even look at me for that matter). I tried clearing the air this morning saying that there are no hard feelings on my end and that I want to be able to have a fun, stress-free, semester and that I hope that there is no bad blood between us and we can move on from last semester. In response she said, ""I think we are fine.""

So reddit, AITA for saying something to her?

Edit 1: We all have dietary restrictions so we don't share food unless we ask to borrow something random. Also, I don't share a bathroom with them, but it is three girls to one bathroom upstairs (which bathroom use in the morning was something another roommate brought up since she was late for several classes).",26,25,0.86

34,Not the A-hole,"I (32F) live with my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.

After work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

Angrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

Anyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??

UPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.

Thank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.

I'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...

And thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.",2927,17039,0.9

37,Not the A-hole,"I come from an upper middle class family and my parents have always emphasized to me the importance of college and education. When it came time to apply to colleges, they repeatedly told me that “cost is not a factor” and they would provide all of my tuition and housing throughout my undergraduate degree. So, I decided to go to a very expensive out of state university which a one of the top ranked in the country for my major.

I have always been a good student, but during my senior year of high school my grades dropped significantly due to circumstances outside of school. This freaked my parents out, and they thought I would not focus or be a good student in college. Because of this, halfway through my first semester in college, my parents instituted a GPA bar. This meant if I dipped below certain levels of GPA I would have to pay an increasing percentage of my tuition. They set the bar quite high: I have to get a GPA above what is required for the honor role in order to not pay 25% of my tuition. Even lower GPA results in even more percentage paid by me. I, of course, agreed to this GPA bar because I didn’t have any other options. 

In my second semester, I did poorly in a few classes because, frankly, college is difficult. I still did well overall (I was above the average gpa in my major at the school and on the honor roll), but I had dipped below the bar by one grade in one class. As such, I had to pay 25% of my tuition this semester, which constituted all of the money I had saved by working the entire summer.

On the one hand, I recognize that I am extremely privileged to have parents pay for any amount of my college or even to be going to college at all, and to have the financial option of going to any school I could get into. I also recognize that I agreed to the GPA bar and failed to get a high enough GPA, so it is fair for me to pay. 

However, I can’t help but feel pretty angry because I think if my parents had told me they would be instituting this bar before I selected a college, I would have at least considered the cost in my decision and likely would have gone to a much cheaper in-state school. Additionally, I have an older brother who had a GPA below the bar during his first year of college, but he didn’t have the bar and so didn’t have to pay anything, so it feels like my parents are singling me out for a bad experience in high school. I also think their original intent has been lost; I can understand them wanting to ensure that I’m not goofing off and wasting their hard-earned money, but it’s clear to me and them that I’m past what I was dealing with in high school, yet still struggling to meet the GPA bar simply because they set it so high. 

So, AITA for being angry about having to pay?",133,131,0.89

Said I was taking her grandchild away. She literally said, “what if I get cancer and no one lives near by to take care of me?” This conversation happened last week.

While I was busy doing something else I asked my MIL to take the pasta salad I had prepared out of the fridge and taste for seasoning. She said that it needed more salt and I told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. She used it anyways and oversalted the dish. I was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. I told my MIL that I would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but I did anyways. About 15 minutes after the guests arrived I see the delivery guy at our front door. I tell my MIL to get up and she asks why. I tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. She looks at me stunned and asks ""why should I pay him"". So I have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. She finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. The guests seem kinda awkward too and my MIL didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

After the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. She called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that I embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. It's been three days and she's still angry about this. AITA?

Ever since the first day of school, my teacher has declared that he was an atheist and that religion was ""holding back"" the rest of the world from developing. At first, I thought that it was a bit weird but ignored it since it was my first day and I worried about other things like finding my classes, friends, etc.

After a couple of weeks though, he started scrutinizing each religion. Like it first began with Christianity, then Judaism, and then finally my religion Islam. (Now note that I was already uncomfortable with this criticizing the other religions, not just my own) He started saying stuff like ""Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was a fake, the Qu'ran is made up, Muslims are barbaric, etc"". I started to get a bit annoyed and now offended so after a week of him doing this, I talked to him after class that I was uncomfortable with him scrutinizing religions in what is supposed to be ANATOMY class. He listened and then argued that he wasn't hurting anyone and that it was his freedom of speech.

46,No A-holes here,"I've known for a long time that it would be difficult for me to have children but I have recently found our that it is impossible for me to conceive or carry my own kids. I am absolutely heartbroken. I feel like I've been training to be a mom my whole life, acquiring knowledge and skills, and now...

Anyway, several of my girl friends have had babies and while I am so happy for them and their kids are cute as hell, I find myself not only terribly envious but incredibly sad when I see them on Facebook or other social media. They have the one thing I cannot have: a child made with my and my husband's genetic material (I know adoption and surrogacy are options, but they aren't options for us right now due to budgetary constraints, though when we are more financially stable, we're excited to start the adoption process). 

These friends have invited me out or over their homes to hang out but I just can't seem to make myself go and socialize with them and their kids. I want to meet their babies but it just causes me so much anger, hurt, and sadness. Am I the asshole? Would I be the asshole to tell them this is why I don't want to hang out?

Edit: I want to be clear, I don't dislike my friends' kids or any other kids. I love children and I used to have a great time hanging out with other friends' kids before my infertility was diagnosed.",61,82,0.82

49,Not the A-hole,"AITA for refusing to bleach a woman's hair? 

New account. SO thinks I handled the situation poorly, but I think what I did was right. 

So I (26F) work part-time as an independent hairdresser.  I have a mini salon set up at home and I attract clients mostly through word of mouth. 

Two days ago a new client booked in with me at 3 o'clock to have her hair trimmed and bleached blonde (she wanted to go from her natural  colour to an icey blonde). I've lost quite a lot of clients recently due to relocation,  so I was keen to impress this woman and work on building my client base up again. 

However,  when this woman came in at 3 o'clock,  I could immediately tell that her hair was in terrible condition. 

Her hair looked extremely fragile and thin. Her ends were badly split and on the crown of her head there were parts of her hair that were so thin you could see the scalp through the hair. When she sat down in her chair I - very gently - ran my fingers through her hair and there was an abnormal amount of breakage just from running my fingers through. This woman was in her early to mid 30s and it was pretty clear she was suffering from hair loss.

So I, very delicately, explained to my client that I was happy to trim her hair but I wouldn't be bleaching it for her today  because the condition of her hair wasn't currently healthy enough to bleach and withstand the chemical treatment. To my surprise,  the client insisted that her hair was in fact healthy and she needed to go blonde.

I used my hand mirror to show her the parts of her crown that were balding and the thinness of her ends so she would understand that she had a serious hair loss problem..

 Even then the client insisted that her hair was maybe a little unhealthy but not that bad and she still wanted the bleaching done. 

It became pretty obvious that the client was in denial about her hair loss. However,  bleach is a harsh chemical that would further damage her already fragile hair. 

This woman and I go back and forth for a while and she is not budging about wanting the bleaching done. Eventually I put my foot down and tell the client that I refuse to bleach her hair  because it could further aggravate her hair loss and I do not want to be responsible for her losing anymore of her hair. If she wants her hair bleached she can find another hairdresser to do it for her,  but in my professional opinion, she should be going straight to a doctor and/or dermatologist.

The clients gets the message and leaves visibly upset. I just know she will leave a bad review but to be honest I don't care. There was no way I could bleach her hair and feel good about it afterwards. 

I admit maybe towards the end when I was trying to talk her out of bleaching her hair I got quite frustrated and maybe I came across as very blunt and harsh.

50,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

So my niece turned 3 the other day. To celebrate I picked up some balloons and my boyfriend and I took her to McDonald’s for lunch (I had to work that night and would be missing the family birthday dinner) 

We got our food and the three of us were sitting at a table in the play place eating. A young boy came up and started playing with the balloons. Ok, no big deal. The kid hit the balloon and it hit my boyfriend in the face. Still not a big deal, it was an accident, right? Then I notice that the kid is trying to bite the balloons so I say “HEY! Don’t do that!”  The “hey!” Was kinda shouted because I was trying to get the kids attention, but it not like I was yelling and screaming at this kid. 

His mother hears this and rushes over saying “He’s autistic! He doesn’t know!!” I just said something along the lines of “oh, ok” but this woman just keeps ranting and raving, starts packing up her shit, saying stuff like “some people just have no respect!”

I definitely felt a little bad about it, but then I started thinking, why wasn’t she keeping a better eye on her kid? He was playing with our balloons for a few minutes before that happened. My big thing was he was BITING the balloon, it could’ve popped in his face, which is why I had the reaction I did. I feel like if the balloon had popped and he had gotten hurt by it, then it would’ve been my fault and an even bigger scene.

54,No A-holes here,"Hi Everyone,

My daughter is turning 6 in 2020 and would therefore be starting grade 1 in Sep 2020. Currently she is attending kindergarten at the local public school (or more accurately will in September) but my wife wants to send her to private school starting in 2020-2021. Specifically, she wants to send her to the same private school where she went, and where she was Head Girl in grade 12. My wife said that she found that being in private school really allowed for her to have significant academic, professional, and personal growth. 

My wife and I can definitely afford to send all our kids to private school, but I don't think it is a good idea. For context, my family was middle class (lower-middle when I was younger) and I went to a good public school. My parents grew up in poverty and my dad was effectively orphaned at a young age. However, I went to an elite college for undergrad (I live in Canada so a good school doesn't cost more than a not so good school). This college was disproportionately private school students and I noticed that they had a certain kind of attitude, on average. They tended to not be cognizant of their privilege and tended to be corrupt and look down upon public school students. My wife of course was an exception. 

My fear is that my kids would end up like one of those private school types. Plus, I feel that her being around rich people will make her materialistic and going to a public school would make her more grateful about what she has. My wife and I are doing well, but we are not super-rich, I don't want my kids to be jealous of the super-rich, nor get their 'poor people are inferior' ideals. 

I also don't see private school as the best use of funds. I rather donate that money to charity and use it for vacations and other discretionary spending. My wife however, is really insisting on private school, saying that it aided her be a better person and succeed academically. And my wife is more successful and academically more advanced than I am so she kind of does have a point. Furthermore, she wants her daughter to go to the school she headed (again fair). And she said that since she earns around 2.5 times what I do, it is mostly her money paying for it (again fair). She thinks my ideological opposition to private schools and my stereotypical view of private school students is getting in the way of doing the best for our kid

However, I still don't want to send her to such a school for the reasons above. AITA for not being on board with my wife's wishes for our kids?

57,Not the A-hole,"So my (27F) husband (28M) has been wanting a project car for a while. It's never been the right time, though, as we have two young kids, we bought a house, had other car loans to pay off, I'm a SAHM, etc. Recently we decided to buy a new vehicle to better suit the needs of me and the kids. I had to compromise on what I wanted because he was adamant he didn't want to spend over X amount, which was fine. We got it and I'm happy with it, and he was supposed to drive my old car to save on gas. After a couple months, though, we ended up selling the third car last week because he thought it was an unnecessary expense keeping it on our insurance.

Fast forward to today, he comes to me and says he wants to talk to me about a car he likes. It's a suped up 1990 Ford Mustang, and he wants to take out a $10k loan to finance it. I told him I'm not ok with that, we already paid off our other vehicle and have the new loan to pay off, and I had to compromise on it because he said money was the issue. We also don't have a very large savings, and while it'd be no problem to make the payments, I'd rather use that money to pay off my car or save up. I also told him that he's not even 30, we have plenty of time to save up and get something he likes, but that now is not a good time.

This sent him off on a tirade about how I never let him buy things, I don't like anything he's interested in, and that he's going to do it anyway. This upset me because in the past he's bought things without checking in first, such as a $1k gun, equipment to go hunting, parts for his truck. We also used to have issues with him financially abusing me that have been hard to get past. Basically just making up lies in the heat of the moment.

At this point I told him that the discussion was over, because obviously we were both upset and couldn't agree, and that the bottom line was I'm not ok with his plan, but in the near future we can discuss a way to compromise and get him what he likes. He responded by saying that he isn't asking me, he's telling me what's happening and that he's getting his car. Once again I told him the above, and said if he does this without my approval it will make it abundantly clear that he prioritizes his hobbies over our relationship, and I'll be very hurt. He scoffed at this and was rude to me the rest of the morning until I left for an appointment. 

The problem here is that he is the one who goes to work and makes the money, but we are also supposed to be a team and make financial decisions together. I feel bad because I know he really wants this car, but I just can't stomach the thought of financing ANOTHER car we don't need. So, Reddit, AITA here?",46,39,0.91

She then said she repulsed herself and looking in the mirror makes her feel sick.

 "" If you repulse yourself so much that you cant look in the mirror, cant have a photo taken of you, hate all the clothes you wear and feel so uncomfortable with yourself that you want to be sick, then do something about it, use it as motivation to be how you want to be.""

Last week, my son went to my brothers with his hair grown past his ears. When he got dropped off on Sunday, his hair was cropped very short and top dyed blue. He said his uncle told him he needed to cut his hair but my son didn't want to. Mh brother told him if he got his hair cut, then he could dye it blue do obviously my son agreed to it. He also came home with deodorant.

I asked my brother why he allowed him to dye his hair blue. My brother said that my son's hair was too long and looked like a girl. He let him spray blue hair dye to make him feel like it was his choice. I told him he should have asked me first and my brother said he was 10, not 5 and his friends play around with hair spray dye. He then mentioned that he's hitting puberty and asked him to buy him Axe.

62,Not the A-hole,"So I (24F) was visiting with my boyfriend's (26M) family and was having a particularly heavy period. I sometimes have to wear pads in addition to tampons when it gets this heavy to prevent leakage from destroying my underwear. I can't control it-I'm on birth control and have spoken to my doctor but it is what it is.

Anyway, BF and I are visiting with his family and I'm trying to not go full Carrie with the bleeding so I have to change my tampon/pad every few hours. There's a guest bathroom that BF and I are using (staying at his parent's house) and there's a trashcan with a lid. Nobody but guests uses this bathroom.

We're having dinner (BF, me, his mom, his dad, and his 14 year old sister) and my BF's mother says that she made steak cause she knows I can use the iron (lol). That was a bit embarrassing but whatever. But *then* she decides to use that as a segue to ask me to dispose of my sanitary products somewhere off their property.

BF's family lives in a very rural area-the closest neighbor is a good 5 minute walk (on a dirt road) and the nearest store is ~10 minute drive.

I ask her why-they don't have any small children or pets who could get into the trash, and I only changed my tampon/pad in the guest bathroom. I'm very careful with disposal and wrap the used products in toilet paper as well as the outer wrapping of the next tampon/pad I use. She says that she just doesn't want ""toxic waste"" in the house. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable and also wondering how exactly they handle BF's younger sister's period. But I don't want to embarrass her and the conversation's already ridiculous enough to be having at dinner that I quietly ask if we can talk later.

BF's mom erupts-she starts spewing this angry rant probably more intensely than my lady parts are spewing blood. Says I'm disrespecting their house and their rules and if I can't comply, I need to leave.

I don't know what else to do, so I go start packing to stay in a hotel for the remaining 3 nights of the visit-also, because BF's family lives in such a rural area, me staying anywhere else meant I was likely just ending the visit right then and there (which is what ended up happening).

I went to a hotel about 45 minutes away (it was the closest) for the last nights and enjoyed room service while my period finished running its course. BF stayed with his family which I don't blame him for, we live on the other side of the country.

However, the whole thing has now caused a huge rift. BF's family despises me and while BF kept quiet and tried to just keep the peace, he's in a really tough position with his family now. They're saying that if I couldnt compromise for something so small, then I'll be a terrible partner down the line.

WITA for getting a hotel instead of driving to a trash area every few hours? I honestly don't know what else I could have done, other than hoarding my used tampons and pads in my luggage, which seems horribly unsanitary and honestly fucking weird.

**Edit: Just read all of the responses--thank you everyone for helping me believe that I'm not crazy here! I know it might seem obvious from an outside perspective, but having experienced all of this I've been really wondering if I was in the wrong or if there was some better way to handle it. To those questioning the validity of this post, I have no way of proving that this is true but I can guarantee my imagination does not stretch far enough to come up with this scenario. Unfortunately, it really happened. I'm not sure what this means for my relationship with my BF but after reading all of the responses, it's becoming more and more obvious that he did not handle the situation well. To those of you who responded about what this sort of issue can lead to down the line, you're absolutely right. I hadn't really considered how big of a red flag all of this is when considering a future with this family. I will be sitting down with my BF when he gets home from work tonight and trying to discuss all of this. I probably won't update because I doubt it'll be all that interesting, but apparently my boyfriend's been getting text messages all day from *both* of his parents about how they think I'm a bad choice for him and he needs to leave me...all of this because of a heavy period, smh! I don't know if our relationship will survive this, but I know I'm not going to be a pushover about it. Thank you all for the support and feedback!**",668,3094,0.96

For anyone not really aware of Malta’s history, they are very very catholic and my mom and dad being old are definitely from a different era.

When my parents came she didn’t bother covering at all. She’d feed breast out which is totally fine, awesome, EXCEPT my parents aren’t used to this at all and were visibly upset. I really don’t understand why she did this because she didn’t do that in front of her dad AT ALL.

When she arrived back home the next morning, she confessed she had slept with and stayed with a married co-worker of hers. It was the last month of our rental contract so I immediately moved out and separated. I was crushed, but after about a month I told her I wanted to work it out and people make mistakes.. blah blah blah. I spent the next year of my life letting this person drag me along emotionally, but in the end I saw she was just being selfish, wanting to have her cake and eat it too. She was still messaging the guy on the DL and hanging out with her drinking buddies a lot more than me, so I painfully cut my losses and told her to hit the bricks.

Haven't spoke a word to her since (about 12 years), despite her reaching out on social media a few times with the, ""that was a long time ago, we can be friends, right?"" routine, to which I always politely replied ""I don't think so"". The truth is I will always kind of love and hate her, as she was my first really serious relationship as well as my first really painful loss. Frankly, it took me years to really get past it all.  After dating a few other dudes, she got with and eventually married the guy who she cheated on me with, who was now divorced from the marriage he was in at the time. They have been married probably about 3 years. I dated multiple people in-between but eventually married to a girl about 2 years ago, who shares a close mutual friend of the ex.

About a week ago the mutual friend died unexpectedly and at the visitation, the ex, who I still haven't spoken with, came up to us and introduced her husband to me, and I simply said, ""You're out of your mind if you think I'm shaking this guy's hand."" and walked away. My wife didn't give me too much shit about it since she knows the history, but she still said I was being an asshole since that was 12 years ago. AITA?

69,Asshole,"Okay so some backstory. Last week I (20 M) was coming home from NYC on NJ Transit to see a movie with my friend. I usually take the train at 4:18 to avoid the rush hour, but I had to work late and instead planned to catch the 6:20. Penn Station was unbelievably packed, and then they made an announcement that a train scheduled a few minutes before mine would be cancelled, and the 6:20 (the train I was planning on taking) would absorb all those stops, essentially doubling in length. When my track was announced, I ran to the train and was lucky to get a seat, while most people were crammed up like sardines in the aisles and vestibules. Unfortunately, the train also left about 13 minutes late, so combined with the added stops, it looked likely that I would miss the movie.

I was texting my friend (also 20 M) about how I might be late, and texted him a quick photo of the packed train car. I then snapped him a pic of me eating a slice of pizza I picked up while waiting for my train for some humor. A minute or two later I hear a lady in the seat behind me muttering about how rude it is to take a picture of other people, over and over. I was confused and turned around and asked if she's talking about me, and she loudly yells that she is. I tried to explain that I took a photo of me eating pizza and she was not in it (the pizza photo was a selfie and she was behind me) and she quickly yelled that it was the other photo. I had completely forgotten about the quick photo I snapped of the train car, and then apologized and told her that I was showing my friend how crowded it was. She proceeded to get quite angry and was quite loudly claiming things such as: ""Just because you have a phone doesn't mean it gives you the right to take pictures of other people"", ""How, rude, disrespectful, disgusting that is"", ""That's such an invasion of privacy"" etc., and basically repeating those thoughts over and over. It was a tightly packed, yet quiet car so everybody heard, and I saw two people nodding in agreement. I chose to not engage, and instead stare forward as I turned red in embarrassment. A few minutes later, I hear her talking about how I am a ""dirty pervert"" and so on. I am a 20 year old gay boy and have been called quite a few names in my life, but never this, to my amusement. I chose again not to engage, but quietly exit at my stop.

The lady did not appear to be mentally ill or not in her right mind, just incredibly angry. A few people, also, were nodding in agreement, but I find the entire situation completely ridiculous. Was I the asshole here?

70,Not the A-hole,"I got pregnant at 26. My fiance and I were planning to buy a house and built a family together but when I was 6 months I found out that he had been cheating on me with a colleague of his several times throughout my pregnancy (I'm guessing even before that but I don't now for sure) He was very apologetic and wanted to continue our relationship but I wasn't able to forgive him. I honestly find it hard to be around him at this point.

It was extremely hard but I had a lot of support from my family, especially from my stepsister, who came all the way from Hawaii to live with me for the last 2 months of my pregnancy. I delivered my daughter in November.

Now my she's already 9 months old and honestly I'm just tired. My daughter means everything to me but I feel really alone in the city I live. My ex has the baby once every other week but I'm still extremely exhausted most of the time, and just wish I had some people here that I could rely on. I'm on my own most of the time.

My dad and stepmom have visited me twice since the birth of the baby and I talk to them a lot on the phone. I'm guessing my dad notices how unhappy I am because about a week ago he told me that he had talked to my stepmom and that they would be very happy if I moved in with them. They live in a (relatively) big house on Hawaii and the baby and I could move on the upper floor where my stepsisters used to live. My dad is retired and loves kids and already offered to help me with the baby, which would be an enormous relief. I know that I can't live with them forever but with the profession I have, I know that I would be able to find work there in the future, and they live in a pretty rural area which i think would be perfect for raising a kid. So I'm actually thinking about going there and never coming back. At least I wanna go there for now.

When I told my ex about this he nearly broke down and was also extremly angry. I know he loves our child and he accused me of acting out of spite and that I was trying to rip his daughter away from him, which isn't true. I have been very supportive of his relationship to her since she was born, but the thing is he completely relies on me to take responsibility for her. He has her just over 1 day every other week and isn't able to take her any longer. He also isn't able/willing to work any less than he does right now, because he's trying to work his way up in the company. So I do feel because I take almost all responsibility for our child, it is my right to decide where we live. And even tho I'm not trying to take revenge, the fact that he cheated makes me less considerate of his feelings. He has the means to travel and visit us, and I would be willing to visit him too.

71,Not the A-hole,"Okay i get the title probably does make me sound like an asshole but heres the context:

So basically me and my family go on holiday with this other family and one of the sons (22) has got an obsession with me (17). He constantly messages me everyday saying how he loves me and how he cant wait to finally be with me but i've told him im not into him multiple times.

Its gotten to the point where hes gotten possessive and whenever i hang out with my guy friends he calls me a whore and things like that and says that im his and im only meant for him. Bare in mind when i first met him i had a boyfriend (we broke up 2 months ago) but that never stopped him. I have literally told him everything to get him to leave me alone but he wont and whenever i block him he gets his mum to call up my mum to have ago at me.
 
He just keeps saying that i need to be with him and that ill love a guy like him and i feel like the only way he'll leave me alone is if i tell him im a lesbian (Im bi) but i feel like thatll be too disrespectful towards the community. My family is going on holiday with his again in january and i literally fear that he will do something crazy cause im only 4""10 and weight only 6st so i have no idea on how to get him to back off.

So will i be the asshole for lying?

Small edit:

I have shown my mum the messages but she just sees it all as teasing

74,Not the A-hole,"First, I live in a European country where we are very relaxed about nudity, so I'd ask US redditors to take the cultural difference into account. For reference, being topless at the beach is commonplace and booty shorts are a staple here.

I work at a large call center with a very friendly and relaxed atmosphere. I have been here for two years and get along with everyone: I've never had any kind of problem before this.

Our dress code states that no workout clothes are allowed or ""anything that goes against common decency"". In my two years here only one girl has been reprimanded for her clothes, and she was wearing booty shorts.

I always wear dresses, mostly either form-fitting knee length dresses or short skater dresses. Many other women wear this types of dresses, but I have an extreme hourglass shape body with very large breasts so I'll admit they look more striking on me than on most people. I am not going to work with my breasts hanging out, though, my dresses show barely any cleavage. My dresses might be short but I'm not showing my ass either.

My bosses, my bosses' boss and her own boss all know me and know perfectly well the way I dress. None of them has ever had anything to say about it, and until now neither has any of my 40+ coworkers from my team.

Recently a new employee joined our team. She is around my age (mid 30s) and from a more conservative country than mine. At first this woman started making passive-agressive comments like ""You are coming in fresh clothes today!"" (in our language that would refer to temperature) to which I answered in a joking way asking her what would I wear otherwise, since it's been consistently hitting 40°C this summer. 

This came to a head a couple days ago when she took me apart and told me that she thinks my clothing is inappropriate for a professional setting. I pointed out that most women in our team dress similarly and she said it's not the same for me since I am curvier than them, and that I should consider the effect my clothes have in male coworkers.

Now, my point of view is:

1.- The dress code is the same for everyone no matter their breast size.

2.- If my clothes were inappropriate it would be my bosses' task to tell me. They have done so for other people when there was a problem with my wardrobe.

3.- The comment about the male coworkers I find downright offensive. They are full grown adults who can control themselves, not neanderthals or animals. I feel like she is insulting my friends, to be quite honest.

But talking about it with a friend she said that I should consider that this coworker comes from a more religious Latin American country and I should respect her wishes and not make her uncomfortable.

So tell me, Reddit, am I the asshole here? Should I dress differently to suit a single coworker's sensibilities?

Edit- 

Thank you all for your input. And thank you for the NTA veredict! Although if someone comes later to say ITA I'll thank them all the same for their point of view.

I won't be talking to HR or my bosses. I don't want to create a bad situation for someone who is a recent immigrant in my country and has it harder than most people in the job market.

In her defense, she has heard us talking about each other's wardrobe a million times. But always in a positive way. Like ""oh, you are wearing a tight t-shirt to show off your gym gains!"" to male coworkers, or ""Whoah girl you look HOT in that dress"" to girls. We do that, and no one feels bad about it. But I remark we are always positive.

I will talk to her in a gentle, distended way, about how our habits differ from her. I might be a bit stern about the male coworkers thing because it really pisses me off and I am human. My coworkers are not perverts and I really dislike the implication. 

As an aside, after writing this I realised that one of my favourite coworkers is a literal pastor for his Christian Church in his country, and not only he has not complained but his wife dresses quite similar to me, including the curves (they are Brazilian).

So thank you for your input, Reddit! I won't tell you how it goes because I don't expect anything to happen.",25,274,0.88
75,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend just drove for 2 days straight for about 20 hours. She went across the country for a great (but temporary) work opportunity with distant relatives and she planned to be there for about 3-4 months. Due to circumstances out of her control, she won't be working there.

Now she wants me to take the Amtrak (train) to her and drive her back to where we live. The train ride would be about 40 hours and cost around $350. That's obviously a long time on a train and $350 is a decent amount of money. I just bought a new car a month ago so I'm trying to build up my savings again from using a chunk for the down payment. Even if money wasn't an issue, I'm going to be totally exhausted from the train ride and not feel like driving. I looked up airfare and that's double the price of a train ticket.

On top of all of this, I'm really overwhelmed at work right now. My boss is not going to be happy about giving me a week off of work with only a day or two notice. I've already had to take a few days off recently due to taking my dad to doctor appointments. It doesn't help that I'm also our only income now since her job fell through.

She said she's not mad, but I can tell that she is.

AITA?

Forgot to add this:

It's all made worse by her friend that suggested last minute that she would take the train to help her unpack, if she wanted. I find this hard to believe since this friend isn't very well off. Obviously I don't have proof, but I think this friend might have just said that knowing that my girlfriend would deny her help. Now that she needs to come back, to her it looks like I'm not as caring as her friend.",47,68,0.92

77,No A-holes here,"If you have read my perilous posts you would know that I have a now 17 year old son (happy birthday!) and also that my wife and I are foster parents. We recently brought in a pair of siblings that needed a home. Apparently they aren’t the only kids that need a new home.

Last night my son’s girlfriend (let’s call her Amy) joined us for dinner and herself and my son broke the news that Amy is pregnant. My wife and I were in complete shock. We thought we had given him enough information about sex and contraception but I guess not.

Amy told us that her parents were very religious and disappointed in her. They have told her that if she decides to keep the baby that they will send her to live with family some where else, but that if she agrees to put the baby up for adoption they’ll let her stay. She wants to keep the baby. My son then asked if Amy can move in with us. 

Honestly, I love Amy. She and my son are very happy together and that makes me happy. But this is a lot. And with two new foster kids we aren’t even sure we could bring someone in that wasn’t family and that wasn’t being fostered by us.

This is a cluster fluff of controversy and I don’t know what to do. Would I be the a**hole if I said she couldn’t move in?

Edit: to clarify, I have no problem letting her move in. We have the room and the resources. What I’m worried about is being the bad guy if it turns out that I can’t have her living with us while fostering. It would come down to choosing between her and our foster kids and either way someone would be sent away/hurt.

78,Not the A-hole,"My apologies for any grammatical errors as I am on my phone.

I (23F) recently got engaged to my boyfriend (23M). I knew it was coming, but it still took me by surprise. We haven't set a date, but am targeting spring 2021.

I also recently have been looking at breast reduction surgery. I am 5'5"" with 28J breasts. While they are a huge part of who I am, and who I am in my friend circle, there are lots of problems with them. My back and shoulders hurt. I have to buy bras from the UK for a small fortune. I can't run any more, and that is how I love to get my exercise, etc. Walking down the street I get a lot of looks and rude comments. You can google big breast problems.

I haven't talked to my fiance about getting breast reduction surgery, although I will. He obviously loves how I look, particularly my breasts. He really loves them. 

I plan to eventually get surgery, and have talked to a surgeon to get information. I have been slowly thinking about it for years, and went to see the surgeon for a consultation the day before engagement and was going to talk to fiance. I floated a joke a year ago asking how he would feel ""if my boobs fell off"" and he was horrified. I'm not sure I want to wait 2 years. I have no idea how he will react if I say I want to do this, nor my sisters who often tell me how jealous they are of me. My friends are all jealous. My mother would be likely to flip out. I think that is partially religious, that I'd be messing up the wedding, and that I'm ""perfect the way I am.""

Basically am I an asshole for wanting to do this soon, and how do I have a conversation where I don't come out as the ass?

Edit: Thank you everyone! The surgical consultation and engagement both only happened last week. I haven't talked with him yet because everyone is going crazy asking about the wedding, ring, planning, and apparently how many children we'll have. I can barely think straight with everything going on. Maybe I'm just scared what he will think, but I am definitely going to have surgery eventually. Maybe as people said below I should do it soon, before the wedding and see how it goes. I'll edit this once I have the conversation with him. My surgeon thinks it could go through medical insurance as a medical requirement, but that's TBD. It's important enough that I'll still get it done, as I have a very good job and would devote the money to this. Also some really good jokes in here.",343,938,0.96
79,Asshole,"Ok so it’s a little more nuanced than the title suggests. 

I had to get my measurements checked for a potential job coming up. Everything - chest, overarm, waist, hips, inseam, neck etc. I went to a few stores in my area to try and buy a tape measure, even though I suck at doing measurements myself. No luck though, so I went with plan B, finding a local tailor to see if I could buy one from them. Then I thought, wait a second, these guys are professionals.. they could do a better job than I could. They presumably know the correct procedures for accurate measurements and how to perform the more obscure ones, like ‘overarm’, whatever that is. 

So I go into the tailors, a husband and wife team, and ask them if they’re willing to help me out. They looked incredibly confused, but accepted. I asked ‘would you charge for this?’ and they shot each other a look, and after a few seconds the wife, seemingly unsure herself, blurted out ‘yeah it’ll be.. £15. £15 for this. A little put off by what seems like quite a steep price, I said sure let’s do it. 

So I’m going through the list of measurements and we’re making some progress. But I’m directing the whole procedure, even doing some myself as she speaks with a different customer who just walks in. That annoys me a bit. We get to inseam and she has no idea what that is? Even I knew what it was. I grab the tape measure, put it to my inside leg and ask her to read the figure on the bottom. We get to overarm, and again she has no idea! I actually had to google it and show her. We finish up, the whole process took about 2, maybe 2 and a half minutes. 

Really angry that I’ll have to pay £15 for essentially borrowing a tape measure for 2 minutes, I begrudgingly ask, ‘you still want to charge for that? Didn’t really take that much time..’ She seems confused and says yep, £15. Fuck it, I think. At least I got the measurements. ‘Do you take card?’, I ask, and she says no it’s cash only. Right. Well, I don’t have any cash. She says well you can go across the street to the cash machine and come back. 

I really was going to go get the cash and come back. I really was. But as I was walking away, I couldn’t help but think that £15 would be an absolute joke for that service. I hopped on a bus and got the hell out of dodge. 

So.. AITA? Genuinely curious

EDIT: Welp, it seems I am decidedly, overwhelmingly the asshole. Not just the asshole, but a lying, entitled, and potentially criminal one too. Gotta day I didn’t expect it to be so decisive. Thanks to the NTAssholers & ESH’ers for making me feel ever so slightly better. 

I am seriously considering going back tomorrow and giving them the money. I’m a little nervous of their reaction though.

For context. I loaned my older brother $100 for gas money to get back and forth to job interviews and groceries when he was unemployed last year in February saying he could pay me back when he got a job. To make things clear, I didnt ever pester him about it and was very understanding about his mountains of debt he had. Just asked about it every once in awhile. 

Well it's been a while and hes been working at this job for about a year now, I poked him a few times about paying me back, he continuously said he couldn't, or tried to trade me his broken down truck in compensation a few times (which I couldn't drive) or trade the $100 for that in his girlfriend's dispensary's weed (which I dont smoke, and been told it's bad and overpriced anywas even if I did)

 After denying those as trade he ghosted me for about six months and ignored me when I brought it up. Well the other day I sent him a message on Facebook and said he could do a payment plan for the money and again he flat out ignored me again. I'm getting frustrated and hes screwed other people over too, I dont want to be one of them. 

So reddit. Would I be the asshole if I started adding interest onto his borrowed money until he pays me back? I have a limited budget and the $100 would be nice to have back now that's hes working and financially stable enough to spend hundreds on weed and alchohol every month.

83,Not the A-hole,"This happened to me yesterday at work and it’s something I will never forgot.

I work at an animal shelter and I had a customer come in who I remembered from a few weeks ago. A man who had adopted this cat  named Nelson. I remember this because Nelson was one of the few cat we listed as “sensitive” (so we know to keep them in a private room where they won’t be bothered by crazy younger cats) because he came from a home where there was trauma. Do to this he is extremely skittish and can misbehave in occasion. 

The man came in with Nelson in the carrier and came to the front desk asking to talk to our manager and that he had a complaint. I asked him what the complaint was but he insisted he wanted to talk to the manager, Allen, who helped him pick Nelson out. 

It takes me a few minutes to find Allen because we are all generally all over the place here and when we come back Allen asks the guy what the issue is, is the cat sick or did it hurt you etc general things we ask when people roll up trying to return a pet. In most cases we can work it out and make sure the animal doesn’t have to be returned. I stuck around because I wanted to hear why this guy was trying to return the cat bc I’m nosy. 

He said “he refuses to listen to any order I give him”

Allen and I were a little puzzled and asked what he meant. Allen said  “well we don’t his full training history but most cats know the general word no because of the tone behind it, have you trie-“

The guy cut him off and said “He is choosing not to listen to me! I told him the rules when we got home and he has ignored every single one.” The guy went on a rant saying how the cat was told to use a little box but he pissed on the floor multiple times, how he told the cat to not go into the spare room but he still does.... and so on.

Right then it clicked to me. This guy thinks the cat understands WHAT HE IS SAYING

I asked him “Wait- do you think the cat can understand you? Like.. he understands the words you say to him..?” 

The man tilted his head at me and looked at me like I was an idiot and said “He is choosing not to! That’s the fucking issue!”

I couldn’t help it I busted out laughing so hard I almost teared up. That’s just never never anything I’ve ever heard of, someone genuinely thinking animals can understand what a human was saying like they were also human. 

Long story short I was told to leave the room by Allen who figured out the issue and I did kind of feel like a dick after because I guess the guy had never had a pet before and hadn’t really been around animals other than a few well trained dogs and he legit thought animals could understand you. My boss wasn’t mad at me at all, but told me I acted very unprofessional which I do agree to some extent. I don’t think I was an ass but I know I should have made not laughed so hard. I was on kennel duty the next two days. 

I shouldn’t have laughed in front of him but damn I couldn’t help it. 

Edit: the cat was returned but in this case it seems to be the best outcome. Also- shelters aren’t always the worst situation for an animal! We love our babies at our shelter. (not case for all tho)

Lately, a harmless looking little old man has been coming in. Harmless until he opens his mouth. Hell sit up at the counter and talk with ONLY me (usually the only white guy working) and talk all sorts of racist aggressive bullshit, about how he’s probably spent more time in Vietnam than anyone here, how all the Vietnamese he knows are violent phrases and threats, about all the shit he’s seen and why that makes it ok that he harbors a “real intense hate” for them (his words not mine). Literally, it’s non stop. Keep in mind, up until this last time, I’ve been nothing but respectful. I don’t say much, but I listen, and have even thanked him for his service even though I have negative feelings towards the war he fought in and his attitude towards it. 

My last straw was when he walked up to the kitchen window and stared down one of the cooks, and came back and said some really gross shit about what he could’ve done to him in Vietnam. So I asked him, why are you here if you hate them so much? He laughed at me and told me I’d never get what it’s like to have gone to war. Answer made no sense, but ok. So I asked him to keep it to himself while he’s here and be respectful, and he said it didn’t matter because they couldn’t understand him anyway. I repeated myself and told him if he can’t be respectful he wouldn’t be welcome back and I’d speak with my managers about it. He mumbled something about how vets aren’t respected and stayed quiet until he left. He really is just a little old man, probably very scarred from the war, and I kinda feel bad now. AITA?

89,Everyone Sucks,"So this happened a long time ago, but I'm still very confused about what was right and what/who was wrong. Sorry for the long story.

So I was in a pretty serious relationship at the time. One day his older sister comes in and they let me know she just got engaged, and she says something like ""so you know, mark your calendar for next year"". (If it's relevant, the core of the family is REALLY close knit, and the wedding was like 150+ guests)

**A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE WEDDING:**  
My boyfriend starts talking about the wedding preparations, etc. He's never mentioned me attending, so I'm not sure if I'm invited or not. **I know nothing about wedding etiquette, so I didn't know if I was supposed to get a verbal invite, if it was assumed I was going, assumed that I wasn't, etc.** Eventually I become pretty sure I'm not invited. I'm hurt to be honest, but figured maybe it's normal and I'm not supposed to be invited.

**TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE WEDDING:**  
my parents bring it up, I say that I'm not invited and they kind of freak out. They say that it's pretty insulting, that I should absolutely be invited since I'm a long term gf of the brother and they are all very close. I defend him and say it's not a big deal, but really, I'm a little hurt, I just don't know if I'm entitled to feeling left out and if my parents are wrong.

**I end up asking my bf if I was invited or not**, and he makes sort of a ""this is awkward gesture"" and tells me that they don't know yet, because a lot of guests have started asking to bring their +1, which keeps increasing the wedding size, and now they don't know if I can come. He tells me that he'll probably know in a few days if I can come.

I get a little more upset, because even to me it seemed that I should be put before a lot of extra unintended guests? But also because it's 2 weeks before the wedding and it sounds like the extra requests are a recent issue, while I've been on hold for a year? And I'm supposed to go back to college (5 hrs away) around the same time of the wedding, so I kinda need to know to organize, get a dress, etc. He doesn't really see the problem and just shrugs it off, thinking that I'm getting worked up over nothing.

**Three days or so later he calls me and tells me that I'm officially invited now.** By then I've mentioned it to a couple of friends and they were all seething on my behalf, some even saying that this is stuff they would break up over? So by then I felt pretty humiliated and had started to be actually offended.

So I tell him that honestly I didn't want to come anymore, that I felt a little embarrassed to show up to a wedding that I had practically had to push to be invited to. He implied that I was TA because I was being petty and childish, and after the wedding he made me feel pretty bad because ""everyone kept asking where I was"" and it had been awkward for him.

So, AITA for having said no at the end? Was this whole invite timeline normal and I made it out to be more than it should?

*Edit to clarify: 1. I was never clear on what exactly happened behind the scenes. In hindsight I think that maybe his family thought I was invited all along and my bf bottlenecked the invite, but I'm not sure why or if it was intentional. At the time though, I think I was mostly hurt that my bf didn't seem to care about me attending by keeping me on standby.

2. Since I thought I wasn't invited, my family and I had already planned to take me back to college that same weekend. Rescheduling the trip for the wedding would have been inconvenient for us, but I could have done it. I didn't because I WAS offended and didn't want to tell my family we had to reschedule because I was just now invited. So, mostly hurt pride.",32,34,0.89

91,Not the A-hole,"Essentially i'd just finished work after a grueling shift, I'd spent the day working with chemicals, i had a killer headache from them, and was just extremely pissed off / depressive mood in general at this point, It was sunny that morning so i was wearing Shorts + TShirt, But when i went to walk home there was a heavy rainstorm, So i was walking home freezing, cold and just wholly pissed off.

Fast forward a few miles, I'm almost home, And as i'm walking down the pavement, Up infront of me is a mother with 3 children, Idk ages but id guess they were between 7-13ish. They were all holding hands and walking up pavement in a sideways line, Taking up the entire pavement (Pavement just means sidewalk if you're American).

Seeing this, I walked over to the very far side of the pavement (The road side), Growing up my mother always told me the man should go on the road and the women / children on the inside. And i've done that all my life, Usually i'll even step onto the road if its a thin pavement, However this time it was a main road (Not a highway but a very very busy 4 lane).

So i'm literally walking with my right foot up against the kirb, I physically cant walk any further to the side, And this mother and children are still linked arms and wont form a line (The mother was on the road side).

Just before we came together, I knew they werent moving, She had clearly seen me for about 15 seconds coming, And i wasn't going to walk on the road and risk my own life so they could pass, So i just kept walking, And essentially my shoulder barged the mother. She didn't fall over or anything and it wasn't like, a malicious barge (Just walking pace), But she was taken back a step and shouted ''Oi!'' as i continued past her, I didnt turn around, i didnt stop, i didn't apologize, i just kept walking. (She was obviously unhurt and completely fine physically).

I just got home, Calmed down a bit from my s\*\*\* day and now i'm starting to feel like i may have done bad here, But at the same time... In my mind, I don't think its fair i should have to get hit by a car just so her and her kids can continue to walk holding hands.

What do you think, Am i the asshole ?

# Edit - I'm putting it here because i cba replying it to everyone, The mother was walking towards me too. She wasn't stood still. She walked into me at the same speed i walked into her. She never stopped because she expected me to step out onto the road the let her past.

Edit 2 - Should have mentioned, On the 'other side' of the pavement, There was a wall. There was no way around them, It was a wall and a road with the pavement inbetween. I went to the road side because in my mind its safer to have women / children on the inside.

# Edit 3 - Again, getting bored saying this on every single comment. When i said ''Shoulder barge'', I didnt put any special effort into it, It was literally just our arms / shoulders making contact as we walked past, I didn't put any extra speed / movement / strength / action into it, it was literally just walking. She had 90% of the pavement to move over onto to avoid collision with me, My only option was step onto the road to avoid collision. She had 100% of the power to avoid this collision with me. The mother was completely unharmed, I was completely unharmed and her children were not involved in anyway whatsoever. Our arms/shoulders merely bumped in a gentle yet firm manner.

Edit 4 - A lot of people are saying YTA because i could have said 'excuse me', Can you also explain why she isn't also the asshole for not doing the same thing? She walked into me just the same as i walked into her. Why should i even have to say excuse me when she herself with her own eyes can see i have nowhere else to go and the only way to avoid us hitting is for her to move in any situation whether i say excuse me or not.",239,284,0.87
92,Not enough info,"My fiancee has been unemployed for almost 6 months. She has been constantly applying for jobs, but the job market is garbage here. I've been supporting us both, and it's soon going to be more than I can afford.

Her best friend in the world is getting married soon. It's very important to my fiancee that she go. They are extremely close.

Last week, a work friend who knows about my fiancee's situation let me know about a job that was available. It was part time, it was close to where I work, and we knew a couple employees that were willing to put in a good word for my fiancee. It also paid more than her previous job. 

The only problem is that it had a 90 day probation period. That meant no vacation or sick days for three months. That mean that IF her schedule had her working on my fiancee's friend's wedding, she wouldn't be able to get the time off.

And that's only IF her schedule has her working that day. It's a Saturday.

My fiancee refused to even apply because she won't risk the possibility of having to miss her friend's wedding. 

I understand the situation, I really do. The wedding is really important to her, and there wouldn't be a chance of her finding someone to cover for her because the job position would just have her and one other person. But she's been unemployed SIX MONTHS and I'm pinching pennies to make  rent.

She's not lazy or mooching off of me in any way. She's just that loyal to her friend.

97,No A-holes here,"The story is a little more complicated than it sounds.

We have twin sons. I'll call them Billy and Jack.

Jack fell very sick with a serious illness when he was 8 years old.

For a while we thought he wasn't going to make it. A charity provided us with two tickets for Disney world. We couldn't have afforded it otherwise.

I took my Jack but unfortunately he fell very sick within the first day and spent most of the 1 week trip in bed. He was very disappointed. But he went into remission a few months later and my wife and I agreed to do the trip again once we saved up enough.

The kids are now 13. Jack has unfortunately suffered some permanent limitations as a result of the illness. They are severe and he is very angry about it, understandably so 

A large number of my family members are going to Disney world. We were invited too.

But the reality was that we could only afford to pay for one person.

My wife and I then realized that Billy was always getting the short end of the stick and we decided to let him go. It was more like I decided and convinced my wife. I feel bad for pulling her into this.

My reasoning was that even though he didn't enjoy it, Jack had the chance to go once. Also, if Jack went, at least one of us had to go too. That adds to the cost. I promised my wife we would take Jack again in a year once we'd saved up.

This seems to have made us the biggest assholes in the world. People in our lives have judged us harshly although they seem to eventually become sympathetic.

But nothing has really prepared us for Jack's reaction. He has become uncontrollable with anger. He has been resenting his brother for being healthier for a long time.

Now that the trip is over, we've had to keep the boys physically separated because of the fighting.

Our home life is total chaos. We asked Jack how do we make this better. He's been incredibly upset for several weeks now.

He says it's too late and we've made clear with our choice how we feel about him.

I've tried to arrange the trip earlier by borrowing money,  where I take or have my wife take Jack but he's refusing and says we've ruined that place for him.

98,Asshole,"Mobile, sorry. Also throwaway because my boyfriend knows my account.

My boyfriend is currently in the interviewing process for what is almost his dream job. The problem is, it's in a small town three hours from the major city we currently live in. 

He doesn't want to move there without me. He says I am more important to him than this job so he'd rather not take it and stay with me than move without me.

This puts a lot of pressure on me because obviously I want this job for him, but I don't want to move. I'd be uprooting my whole life to go to a place where I don't have job opportunities or friends, and not even people my age to hang out with (small town with mostly older people). I would more or less stay home all day. I also have a history of depression and anxiety and I'm really concerned with moving to where I'd be by myself and bored 8+ hours of the day.

As a compromise I'm asking to move to a town 1.5 hours from where his job is, which is the nearest city. The town his job is in is in the middle of nowhere, this is the only town with a population of over 20,000 and where I could maybe find a job, restaurants, etc. 

I know it's a long drive for him but it is really the only way I can see myself being comfortable with moving. Lots of our older friends act like I should just move with him and it will be fine, someone even got upset with me and said that I shouldn't need more than him and our pets. 

I'm wondering if im being unfair. AITA for asking him to commute?

Because I am paralyzed, I have no bowl or bladder control. I don't even know if I have to go. Since I am hooked up to a catheter and wear diapers.

And I don't mean like it's just an unpopular scent, I mean it smells like someone threw poop in a plastic bag and set that on fire. No debate from anyone I've asked so far, the soap smells like burning plastic and ass. At first I thought it was a prank. NOPE! That's the unique smell of 5-8 year old hand soap that was dug out of an unairconditioned storage locker in the middle of Texas! Maintainance has no idea how long that soap has been out there, just that when it was found they were told by my boss to put it in the women's restroom.

Now my boss is male so he doesn't have to use this ass soap, no he has some honey and milk soap for the men's room. So he's disinclined to change the soap for the women's room since there's only 8 of us vs the 40+ men at this office, also he's an accountant so he's happy to cut costs where he can and doesn't want to throw away the soap. I don't want hands that smell like ass all day, and he's started to complain he can smell it too, first assuming it was my personal hygiene and not his ass smelling soap!

Here's my dilemma. My son has a voracious appetite, but eats extremely healthy. I don't make anything fancy for school, and I pack his snacks in containers rather than bags so we can re use them. I feel like maybe part of the problem is the fact that I want to re use containers (10 plastic bags a week adds up and is unnessary waste ) and the other problem is that i give him more than one thing? 



This is what his typical food intake looks like at school
Morning snack: hard boiled egg, yogurt tube, some berries or a banana and water. Easily something he can wolf down in the 10 mins allowed. 

Lunch box: personal chicken pot pie (or something warm and small) veggies like snow peas, broccoli, carrots. Sliced apple or fruit cup, and maybe some crackers or gold fish crackers. With milk from the cafeteria or water. 

Lunch snack: a mini bagle split into 2 turned into those pizza bite things that i toast up before school, and some bell peppers. Or string cheese and a can of smoked oysters. 

And the thing is. He eats pretty much everything! There may be a few carrots left over, or a bite of apple left but everything else is devoured. And he is really good about saving his leftover food so we can give it to the worms or hermit crabs.

I'm the youngest child in my family and also the most financially successful. I don't have any college debt (I got very lucky with scholarships) or any dependents, I have a high-paying job, and I live in an area with a fairly low cost of living. On the other hand, my older siblings have a lot of debt, they're both married homeowners with children, and while they work jobs with great benefits, they don't take home as much as I do.

I don't see my family very often (I live in a different state), but when I do I like to treat them (brunch, coffee, ice cream, movies, museum visits, etc. We're foodies and daytime partyers 😅), especially when they come visit me. I'm not a particularly affectionate person and this is how I'm most comfortable showing my family that I care about them. However, while my parents just say thanks when I surprise them by picking up the bill, sometimes my siblings get upset with me.

- For my birthday, they both flew to see me. We went out to eat a few times and they paid each time. Whenever I tried to pay (they'd already spent all that money on plane tickets), we ""argued"" until I gave up

- I flew home a few weeks ago and my sister and I went to get coffee. She offered to pay, but at the cash register my nephew (her son) started getting a little fussy, so I slipped the cashier my card while she was distracted (and afterwards she seemed annoyed with me)

- In general, I refuse when they try to pay me back for things like movies. I'll ""forget"" the cash they hand me or drop it back in their purse when they're not looking

- I have *never* said anything about treating them afterwards (i.e., I don't bring it up or keep count or try and hold it over them. I'm genuinely doing it because I enjoy it)

Both of my siblings are much older than me (they were in their late teens/early 20s before I even hit double digits) and they always paid for me when we did things together when I was younger, so I figure I have a while to go before I catch up.

106,No A-holes here,"Last year I had an argument with a neighbor during the winter, right in my driveway.  Had a particularly heavy snowfall and had to leave my house by 6 AM to get to work.  So I was out at 4 AM, just started the snowblower to get my driveway cleared.  He surprised me by actually leaving his house in middle of a blowing blizzard to come and argue with me.

I explained to the guy that I am out here running a snowblower because I have to get to work.  I assured him that I'm out here for a good reason, not because its my favorite god damned time to move snow!  The only thing worse than having to listen to a snowblower at 4 AM from *inside the house* is being the guy who is running one *outdoors* at this ungodly hour.         
 I told him he should be thankful (he is retired and has no need; presumably) that he doesnt need to run a snowblower and can stay indoors.  I also pointed out to him that the city runs plows, salt trucks and other heavy equipment which is louder than my snowblower.  They have a duty to keep the roads clear.  Snowfall is one of those things that needs to be dealt with.

He started to get nitpicky and asked if I could do just enough so my car could leave.  I explained that there are other users of this driveway than just myself so the entire thing had to be done.  Plus I'm not going to fire up the blower for just 5 minutes and then have to fire it up again at night when I return from work to do the rest of it.  Absurd.  When I return, the snow is heavier and probably iced up making for a harder job.  He just wanted to argue so I started the machine, turned my back to him and proceeded to do the rest of my driveway.  I had places to be and had no time to argue.

Wanted to add that we live in a northern US state that sees much winter snowfall.  It's no surprise that when snow falls, we need to deal with it, including removing it.  All my years snowblowing at early hours and this is the first time someone has actually had the energy and drive to come outside and argue!  I have heard other's snowblowing noise at odd hours and never thought to confront them with hostility about it.  Even if I did wake up from the noise.  I always figured noise is just a part of urban/suburban life.  Until I live in the country side, I wouldnt complain.

Lastly, its not illegal to remove snow at any hour.  We have a noise ordinance that exempts snow removal equipment noise following a storm.  I'm not worried about the legality of this, more about the manners and etiquette regarding neighborly relations.  Does this guy have a leg to stand on?  What would you do here?",204,149,0.9
107,Not the A-hole,"My friend is the manager of a large reptile shop. By all accounts she has done very well managing it and it has a great reputation. She does not have a degree. She keeps and breeds a great deal of species of reptile herself and was the first to breed one type of lizard in our European country. But she primarily sells very simple pet reptiles to families and does not work in any sort of conservation or education capacity. She has no published scientific studies.

The reason I got called an asshole is that my friend has written a series of books and in the author blurb she specifically describes herself as ""an experienced herpetologist"".

I told her I felt that it was a bit misleading as she's not a herpetologist. She does not have a herpetology or a zoology degree, does not work in any science or conservation related field and her job title is ""pet shop manager"". She DOES study reptiles I suppose, but mostly at home on her own time as part of research into how to breed rarer things to sell for money, which is not as far as I'm aware, the technical definition of a herpetologist. She is not a zoologist, and herpetology is a branch of zoology specifically. I have a degree in zoology and work with herpetologists who specifically have a specialised degree in herpetology. Therefore I feel by putting herpetologist on the author bio she's making out like she has a degree in zoology or herpetology and that could be misleading. 

I have read the books and I have no problem with their content and I know that she knows what she's talking about and does have a decade of hands on experience, but I don't consider her to meet the definition of a herpetologist and don't want anyone to be confused about this or for her to be in any trouble for representing herself incorrectly either. I am not in any way suggesting she's not qualified to write these books or that people shouldn't buy them - she is qualified by experience, and I hope they are very successful and helpful to people. But I suggested she change it to ""an experienced reptile keeper and breeder"", rather than ""herpetologist"" to avoid any potential misunderstanding. She called me an asshole and said that I was judging her for not having a formal qualification and said I'd always looked down on her achievements because I work in a zoo and have a degree, and she works in a reptile shop and her knowledge comes from hands-on experience and self research rather than formal education. 

I do not look down on her and didn't mean to upset her, but I do think that we work in different fields and mine is more science driven and her self-given scientific title isn't correct.

109,Asshole,"As most of the posts in this subreddit, this happened quite recently to me.

About me: I am a broke-ass college student who can barely afford living but also wants to get more knowledgable in certain areas. Therefore I was very interested in attending a camp by a globally active group (it's a bi-annual thing).

This group is a data security group called ""CCC,"" on my watch, they are the most well-known group of white-hat hackers.

Now to get to the camp: Unfortunately, they sell tickets, which is kind of expected. Nobody gives away education for free, even if they actually want more people to be educated about something. However, the tickets they sell are at extraordinary prices. To addend the camp (you still have to rent a spot to sleep at, buy food and get yourself a tent), one adult pays \~250$.

Alright, not a problem for me, let's look up the price for children or students - 75$. Since I don't even have that money at hand, at first, I was very frustrated. Obviously. However, they offer a solution that allows you to name **any** price you want.

In fact, this ""name your price"" thing might actually work very well for both ends. On my watch, it's quite unlikely that those who love the project and can actually support it will try to cheap out. It also allows you to reach a wider audience since they can just reduce the price.

So I thought. Apparently ""name **any** price you want"" only applies to prices *above* 75$ or 250$ respectively.

Am I the asshole for even trying to pay 0$ for a ticket to an educational camp?

EDIT: Thank you, kind strangers of reddit. You really made me realize not just how wrong it is to pay nothing, but also why. It helped a lot, thank you very much. However, I want to add in this edit that I also tried paying 40$, which is something I could afford when cutting down my food. Again, this is not possible, because you are not allowed to name any price below the already cheap 75$.

I also want to add that those are experts who I would be asking to teach me (see this great [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exkt0uf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)), which is why even the 75$ are hilariously low. Me not being able to afford it is a different story, which does not entitle me to artificially ask for a price reduction.

EDIT 2: I also wanted to thank the people who engaged in a very educational [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exkujgz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and wanted to give a special shout-out for the insider information provided by u/gehwegdepp in [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cthl1f/aita_for_wanting_to_pay_0_to_get_a_name_your/exljonk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I for myself have learned through your discussion that helping at the camp would be beneficial for both parties.  


For everyone reading this post to learn something themselves, here is a TL;DR:  
1) Don't pay ""nothing"", that's absolutely disrespectful. Pay what you can means does not imply freeloading, it means that you actually give what you can give. This also works for tours or other PWYC services.

2) Education is not free, especially being taught something in person isn't. If it is, say in school, take it. If it's not, don't complain or try getting a lower price. This also applies for study apps which are frequently cracked or resold by script kiddies.

3) If you have any special request, ask. Ask the team behind a camp if you can get a ""free entry"" by volunteering or contact someone and offer something *mutually beneficial*.

4) Because freeloaders exist, we have to volunteer to support projects we love. Be it to clean up after a concert or something more general like helping the elderly .

5) It's not part of the German, maybe even western, culture to bargain. Even if it says PWYC and recommends 10$, it doesn't mean you should go below that. Instead, see 1,2 and 3.",25,27,0.77
110,Everyone Sucks,"Background information. My significant other and I have been dating for a little under a year. I come from a more affluent background, and he does not. He is paying his own way through college, while also working full time, which I think is great, and support him to the best of my abilities. 

Turns out last semester he didn’t pay off his total balance that was due, and he has enough money to cover the balance but is short by like 100$. He has to pay that balance off by like tomorrow if he wants to take classes next semester. 

He and I have been rocky for a couple of months. I think he is great, but I loan him money VERY often, and he isn’t great about paying it back in a timely fashion (not that he doesn’t pay it back, it’s just not a priority for him, or he forgets, etc.). I probably loan him 100-300$ every month for rent and basic necessities. 

I dont really want to loan him the money. I told him for months before this that he should go in and make sure his account is up to date, register for classes, etc and he never did. And because of that now he is scrambling to get everything together. HOWEVER I feel like the asshole for not wanting to loan him money because loaning him $100 isn’t like the end of the world for me. And then he could take classes, and he has a payment plan for the rest of the semester. It’s more the principal of it. 

He’s upset because if I Dont loan him the money he can’t take classes, he’s older and just starting college, and because he’s working full time it’s going to take him a while to get through school, might not be done with his undergrad until he is well into his 30s. And me not loaning him $100 just sets him back another 6 months. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting to loan him the money?

Edit: THANK YOU for all the responses. I wanted to clarify that I think what bothers me about the situation is not the money itself, it’s the lack of fore thought. I feel badly that I dont want to loan him money. I ENJOY supporting him.

Edit Two: I should mention, my SO is not particularly perturbed if I do, or do not, loan him money. His opinion is if he has to take another semester off he will. He’s not happy about it. But to him it is what it is. HOWEVER, I still feel like I’m going to be the asshole if I Dont loan him the money. Even though it was his mistake.",43,31,0.91
111,No A-holes here,"When my son was born, he had a dark skin complexion. Wife and I are both quite pale in complexion. Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.

Now for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn't easy but I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go. The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does. Now this realisation has got me very paranoid.",2121,7222,0.97
112,Not the A-hole,"Skip to last paragraph for quick summary.

I grew up with these guys. Our friend group was roughly 10. We knew each other since 6th grade, hung out every lunch period, tried to ensure we were in the same classes at HS, and hung out every weekend, sleepovers, etc.  After graduating, 8 of us even went to the same university, lived in the same apartment complex, same floor, and even roomed together every year. Our relationship did change a bit at University. They got into frats, drinking, smoking weed, while I did not. So at parties, I did have to go through an adjustment period of them getting drunk, rowdy, or simply smelling weed in the air. Regardless, I got used to it and I thought everything was great again as we'd hang out often.

We all graduated and went our separate ways. Different states, careers, post grad, etc. First few years, we'd hangout again when we'd all visit home and we would visit each other's places if we had free time and money. Around year 3, I noticed not as much communication towards me, and noticed on social media that some of them would get together every few months to hangout. The communication got less until it was non-existent outside of 2 of them for the next few years.

4 years post grad, I'm getting married. Send out invitations to all my friends and while some had legitimate excuses, most people just said ""I can't make it"", with only the 2 mentioned before showing up. At this point, the signs are obvious and I know they just don't care about talking with me, it hurts, and I decide to move on. After getting married, the wife and I located to the same city where one of my friends who had a legitimate excuse lives. I text 3 times in a span of 3 weeks and no response. So I know where he stands.

3 years later my career has exploded to the point I was mentioned in a magazine pertaining to our industry. I'm not making millions or anything, but it's a possibility as my work has reached a lot of ears. One of my friends I still keep in touch with shared it on social media, and now I am getting text messages from those friends who stopped talking to me.

I know it's not worth my time to rekindle our friendships, but I did respond, but have also kept my distance. Now, I'm getting invited to hangout with them, or asking if I'm ""free"" if they happen to visit my city, or if I will be visiting ""home"" during the holidays. Part of me is tempted to ghost them right back. Another part is to professionally let them know how they hurt me by ghosting me originally without any explanation. And then there is that part that is really tempted to just lay it out on them. WIBA if I go the third route?  


Edit: I've had a chance to go through all these responses late last night, early this morning and I plan to go through the rest during lunch. There's a lot of variety in responses, but the things that stood out to me the most is that lashing out at them may result in my career being hurt down the road. I also consulted my two friends I still keep in touch with (they also keep in touch with the other guys), and also suggested something similar along with just taking things slow with them. Given I had already responded a few times to some of the messages, I'm just going to keep things at arm's length and go with a ""I'm busy"" route with the current invites I've gotten. From there, things will just stop, but if they persist, I will re-evaluate what to do next (though not lash out).

Thanks everyone.",537,4962,0.96
113,Asshole,"Throwaway, I was at a wedding and one of my cousins who has a very outgoing, joking personality was there. I haven't seen him for a long time and back when I saw him more frequently, we used to drink a lot together. I was looking forward to getting thrashed at the wedding.

We talked for a bit and I offered to get him a drink and he said something like ""haha, I stopped drinking awhile ago, doctor told me I was on my way to getting cirrhosis"" 

Now anyone who knows him will know he was the biggest drinker, so I figured he was joking, and he framed it humorously so I just joked around with him and told him, ""alright I'll get a ginger ail for you.""

I ordered a vodka soda for us and after he took a couple of sips, he freaked out and said ""wait does this have alcohol?"" I laughed and told him it does and he ran off.

Later on in the party he and my uncle and some other people (including the bride) came up to me accusing me of giving him alcohol. I told them that I didn't think he was serious and should have been blunt with me. They kicked me out of the party and I told them to go fuck themselves and I left.

114,Asshole,"Throwaway account for reasons.

I don't want to give too much detail/background on my parents or their relationship because I think it is unnecessary to judge AITA. However I will say the divorce needed to happen in order to gaurentee safety to everyone in the family. Also, the divorce was necessary to help some family heal mental wounds. Not up for debate.

To the facts:

Father requested a special type of birth certificate (BC) from ME that I do not have. This would require me to fill out paper work and send it through the mail along with a check for 50 USD. He claims he's trying to get the divorce done in another country and my BC is required. Also, he is willing to pay the 50 dollars for it.

Truthfully I feel uncomfortable helping in any way. As the title says, not only do I support the divorce but I encouraged it. AITA if i tell him that I still support the divorce but I dont want to participate in any way?

Edit: I appreciate the response from everyone. Some people requested more info in the comments. I will try to extract what I think is necessary in order not to say any bias. I'll start by reiterating that I feel uncomfortable helping. This is because I do not trust him and I suspect he may be lying to me about the divorce process. I am really not well versed in law so I really dont know. I asked a lawyer I know but she doesnt do this law so she couldn't give me an answers. I also dont know what he could possibly do with my birth certificate, but I feel uneasy about giving him that documentation. So what I really feel uncomfortable with is the fear that he would misuse my birth certificate. 

I apologize I didnt include this much detail in the OP.i wanted to elaborate because it seemed that me saying ""uncomfortable"" translated to me not wanting to lift a finger.",68,32,0.79

It's one of the ones with like 10 different nobs and levers to get everything perfect.   


So, they asked me to help assemble all these new chairs (like 20+) when they were delivered and they were telling everyone that if they got a new chair they could take their old one home.  


One of the ladies in our office did not like the new chair once she sat in it so she opted to keep her original chair (it was not a fancy one, just wider). They offered this new chair to any of us that had not switched, nobody wanted it so I sat in it and it was quite comfortable right out of the box and did not need any adjustment. So I took it, it wasn't really any better than my other chair but the fact that I could take the other chair home was enough of a selling point to use the new chair.  


Now, my office mate across the hall (Who has the same fancy chair already and also declined the new chairs) saw me wheeling the fancy chair into the corner of my office & decides they want my fancy chair because the color is different... (hers is more of a beige while mine was black). I told her that was fine, I'll just take the beige one home... I'm sure you see where this is going.  


She says we were allowed to take ""our old chairs home"" and the beige one is her old chair so she will be taking it home herself... So I said nevermind, I'll just keep my chair and someone else can take the new one; she doesn't want it even if she can take the beige one home.

117,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a while back. I saw a post from my brother-in-law saying he and my sister are getting divorced. He mentioned that they agreed to remain friends, but that they just didn't work as a married couple. I messaged the two of them individually asking if they were okay and the general response I got from both of them was ""yeah, it's just a weird situation but we'll manage, thanks for checking up on me.""

Not long after, I got a private message from my mom saying ""did you hear? Sister and BIL are getting a divorce. You need to unfriend BIL right now."" When I asked why, she just said ""just do it."" I had thought maybe BIL and my mom had some kind of altercation so I messaged him back asking if anything had happened between the two. He said no and that it was weird that she'd ask me to do that. A few minutes later I get another message from my mom saying ""why did you tell BIL that I told you to unfriend him? All you had to do was keep your big mouth shut."" I didn't respond after that.

Several months later I met up with my parents and they told me the whole story - that BIL had basically maxed out a bunch of credit cards and put the two of them in debt, and he may have cheated on my sister but it was never flat-out confirmed one way or another. So yeah, fuck that guy.

I told my mom that knowing that information would have been good, and she responded by saying that when she tells me to do something, that I should just do it because she's my mom, she loves me, and she'd never intentionally sabotage me or my relationships.

He wants a FT 9 to 5 office job and not PT job moving tables and chairs. I addressed it to him and said that I have no idea what his career goals care and he should had applied.

I had HR post the job to the public but they had over 200 people apply (it's a good paying government job). It would have taken months to find someone. So I needed someone quickly so I asked HR to contact the top three people who were on the city employment list (a list of people who were second or third choice picks for jobs).

They came up with a list of three people. I was shocked when one of the candidates was my part-time employee. HR is campaigning for him. In the end, I am choosing to not hire him. 

Why? Two reasons. He's a good worker and knows his stuff, but I don't think he and I would get along and I doubt I could find someone to take his current job. I can find a decent secretary but not a facility staff. It pays low, the requirements are high and it's nights and weekends.

Hey all,

I don't really know how to word this, but this is really bugging me right now, and I don't know what to do about it. I'll give you a little backstory about how we managed to get this many dogs.

So, over the course of several years, we adopted 4 dogs, which I was ok with, since we were giving them a nice home to live in. However, when we were on vacation in the caribbean, my dad and my sister volunteered at a dog shelter, and after convincing my Mom, and not getting the ok from me, they brought home another dog. He promised that was the last dog we would ever get, and we even joked about it later that year when my Mom bought a bumper sticker that joked about it. Well, WHAT DO YOU KNOW, next year, again, without both me and my Mom's permission, he brought home yet another dog from the same shelter. I was semi-ok with this one, as it was found on the side of the road when she was just a baby.

Another year goes by, and no more dogs thankfully, but then, with just a few days warning, he decides to foster 2 dogs for ""a few weeks"" he told me. Well, 2 months go by, and these dogs are still with us, bringing our total number of dogs up to 8. My mom was NOT ok from the very beginning when he fostered these dogs, and what made it even worse, is that he actually sounded serious about KEEPING them. When we finally found another family to adopt them, I asked him about it, and he told me ""well, only if your Mom wants to get rid of them"". Ok, so that was the end of it, right?

Nope, fast forward a few months, literally with no warning(he told me the same day, woop de do), he fosters yet 2 more dogs. This time, my Mom was 100% not ok, and told him not to bring those dogs home, yet he did it anyway. This time he only told me a week. Guess what? He lied to me again, what a surprise. A few weeks later, one of those dogs got adopted by a family, but that means that the other one doesn't have a home, and she is still living with us at the moment, bringing our total up to 7 dogs at the moment. I wouldn't mind too much, but this dog man, she just won't stop whining and barking. It's annoying me so much, and I seriously can't take it anymore. In fact, he actually told me, in person, that he wants to KEEP her, which really pissed off both me and my Mom.

Now don't get me wrong, I love animals, and I love dogs, but I think my dad has gone overboard with the number of dogs that we have. WIBTA if I try and explain it to him? I've tried before, but he always finds a way to defend himself.

Sorry if this isn't written properly or is explained vaguely, I just wanted to get this off my chest so that it isn't bugging me that much.",22,26,0.91

123,Not the A-hole,"I have two daughters from my first marriage, one is 28 (I'll call her Brooke) and the other is 24 (I will call her Amanda). I divorced their mother when they were fairly young and I ended up with sole custody of them as their mother had mental health issues and refused to get treatment. I raised them both as equals and made sure that they had the same opportunities growing up. Brooke did very well for herself, she got her degree, has a very good job, her own house and recently got engaged. 

While Amanda was gearing towards the same path in her own way, she ended up getting sidetracked by an abusive relationship when she was 18 and said relationship only ended by the time she was 21. She still managed to get a good job and enroll into college but dropped out after a few months. Once the relationship was over I counselled her to focus more on herself and take care of her mental health. She took the advice and started therapy, but then, 6 months later she met a guy who I personally do not like. He struck me as a selfish man with a big ego. I voiced my concern to her but she paid little attention.

Then 3 months later she announced she was getting married with said guy. I held my tongue because at this point I realized anything I said to her would only make her angry and let it happen. 6 months into the marriage she tells me she left her job and therapy too, she also sold her car because her husband had one and that was enough. She would complain about him from time to time, he's indeed selfish and with a big ego, he also doesn't listen to her and considered divorce multiple times but never took action. Well, last year she got pregnant and things got more noticeable. He never went to appointments with her and once my granddaughter was born he barely helped her and would leave her at home while he went out to have fun.

Yesterday she called me to talk because once again they were fighting, at some point she started to get angry out of nowhere since she was the only one doing the talking and I was only listening. She started to throw accusations at me saying that I didn't do enough to keep this from happening and that it was my fault she was living a crappy life. I told her that this was not true at all and that she had the same opportunities as Brooke and clearly the only differences where the choices that were made and that she should own up to them instead of running. She said I was kicking her while she was down and that I was clearly playing favorites and throwing it in her face.

The next bit will sound harsh but it's important. Mom almost never talks about dad and when she does, there's no hint of sadness, only fondness. She's not 'actively mourning' if that makes sense.

In March I proposed to my gf \[32F\] and she said yes. Yay! Soon after, we discussed whose last name we would take, because we both wanted to have the same last name as each other and our future kids. My fiancee is in a niche career where name recognition is very important (being vague for anonymity). I've been with the same company for years and plan to stay here, so I felt like it would be easier for my name to change. After discussing it a bit, we decided to both take her last name. It helped that I only share my last name with a bunch of distant relatives, while she has many siblings and cousins with the same last name.

We didn't make an announcement about this, not seeing it as a big deal, and only told people who expressly asked. Lots of people did actually ask, because in her field this is a common issue (eg, her family found out early because one of her bridesmaids asked at a dress fitting in front of her mom and sister.) My mom never asked and we never raised it.

Well, I don't know who, but someone told my mom last weekend at a party we were hosting. Mom came up to me almost in tears and asked if it's true that I'm changing my name. I took her aside and said yeah, and explained why. She said some surprising things - that this is a betrayal to my dad and to her,  it's like I'm completely turning my back on my family, and she couldn't believe I would ""throw away"" the name that's meant to honor my dead father. I tried to explain that's not how i see it at all and I didn't realize she was still in such pain over my dad, but she wasn't having any of it. She asked why we didn't discuss it with her and I said, truthfully, because we had already discussed it with each other and made up our minds. This did not go down well and she left the party in tears. I've tried to call her since but she texted me to say she needs some time.

My fiancee and I have been discussing this a lot. We both don't think that we're TA for taking her name (but welcome any judgements). However she thinks that maybe we were TA for not discussing it with my mom first and letting her find out this way. Knowing now how she feels about it, I do wish we'd spoken to her privately, I guess I just really didn't think she'd be upset. However I remain firm that we didn't need to discuss it with her. We had discussed all of the options with each other and it would have been disingenuous to ask for her input when we weren't going to change our minds no matter what she said.

127,Not the A-hole,"Last Sunday, I received an invitation for an interview for a secretarial position, offering a wage of 9,000-15,000 a month (not USD), 9,000 is the minumum wage here, and as I am business graduate with experience, I was hoping for something like 13-14k, that will serve me nicely as I pursue my masters. 

My rent is around 9,000, which is partly subsidized by my parents si ce my sisters live with me.

I got to the interview, it went well, I was asked to come back that afternoon for a final interview, I did. 

I got the job, and I start the next morning at 7:30 am. As I was going out, the owner asked me if it was okay that he paid me 300 a day (365 is the min wage) while I was on training and then after an evaluation I will be *bumped up* to the minimum wage. No mention of anything higher.

I said nothing. When I went home, my mom urged me to take the job even though I will be making pennies per minute, she said it was better than nothing, which is not a bad argument.

I went to the job, it was easy. I got to talking to all the staff, all girls by the way, the owner said he liked girls talling to customers. Amyway, everyone is kind of mum about the salary, the most senior girl there was hired just six months ago, some four months ago amd some last month.

One girl did say that its good but she said that it was minimum wage. So there was definitely no talk of anything higher than 9,000 and that got me concerned. This was yesterday.

I had no work today due to a provincial holiday. I signed nothing, btw.

Now, this morning, I got an imvitation for an interview to another company, and I wamt to go, but it was scheduled during my office hours, meaming if I go, I will be fired automatically.

The pay for this new job is supposedly better, 15k, but they used the words ""up to"" so I am not confident. My logic is that it cant be worse than below minimum wage, right?

My mom is threatening to not speak to me if I go to the interview. I fully intend to go, WIBTA?

**Info**: I liked the girls in that company and the boss and his son and the girls seems to like me too, I feel comfortable there. 

but since it was a family business, there's not much clarity to anything. Everything is vague, how much will I make, how will I receive it, those things. They havent asked to see any official doc or any id from me and I get the sense that they have a high employee turnover.

on the other hand, the job I will be interviewing for tomorrow is for a comtent writing company and writing has been my passion for a long time now, I dont know howngood I am but I do have experience.

**Edit:** I was a dummy not to ask clarifying questions to the boss, but to my defense I was heat stroked at the time and I was only working for a day.

But I did remember that the most senior girl said shes gonna be working today and will be receiving 30% more salary for the day, but she said it was just a 150 or 170 increase and not worth it because she has uti

I calculated, and if 170 is 30% of her daily salary, then she couldnt have been earning more than 14k a month. So thats my best hope of achieving with this company",73,74,0.88

129,Not the A-hole,"I and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend’s wedding, and for the past few weeks we’ve been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said “I love this but they don’t have it in my size.” (She is US 14.)

I agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group’s conversation moved along. 

Yesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn’t think too much about it because it’s not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.

A few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn’t buy it because it wasn’t available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I’m trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I’m skinnier. 

To be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn’t intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn’t answered my calls or messages. 

So I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn’t buy because they didn’t have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",3598,19471,0.9

132,Not the A-hole,"Hi all, I'm relatively new to this sub but I'm already a fan and this incident is completely fresh so am looking forward to hearing everyone's opinion!

I live in a condo and share a wall with some particularly noisy neighbors. I moved in in November 2018 and have not had a good night's sleep since then. They have kids and are screaming and swearing at each other at 1am, 2am, every single night. I even heard the young kid, looks to be elementary school age, call his own father a 'little c***'

I tried being reasonable with them, I firstly wrote them a letter because I don't like confrontation, I tried talking to them face to face, I then escalated to the local authorities who I must say have been really helpful and understanding. 

After a particularly bad week of no sleep I snapped and when I got up for work yesterday, I played some pretty loud music. This was at 7am and was not for longer than 10 minutes. I checked and in my area it is only a disturbance if you play loud music between 11pm-6am so I was within my rights to play music at 7am.

My neighbor was straight round and started yelling at me. I tried telling him that all I wanted was for them to keep it down during the night but he really didn't get it, called me a bunch of insults and stormed off. 

AITA for being admittedly a bit immature and retaliating with the loud music?",585,3492,0.97

134,Not the A-hole,"Title aside, I think this is a more lighthearted question.  (Though you guys might scream at me, who knows!)

Live with my fiancée, we own a house & we both work full time.  Neither of us particularly enjoy doing chores but we've split them more or less 50/50, loosely based on ability/practicalities.  E.g, my work has flexible hours so I always do the morning dog walk because it matters less if I'm late.  That sort of thing.

I've suggested in the past about us hiring a cleaner to do the deep cleaning.  If we can just focus on keeping the house generally tidy, and pay someone to come in each weekend and finish up.  I was told, ""You just want to pay someone else to do the chores, so you don't have to grow up!""

For a quick bit of relevant financial info - we run the house, savings, bills etc from a joint account, but we both get an equal allowance each month to spend on whatever we want.  'Fuck it money'.  She tends to buy masses of cheap stuff from China, I tend to buy useless gadgets and Steam games I'll never play.  It works out pretty well :)

So, one of my chores is vacuuming (because I'm physically better with the vacuum on the stairs, I guess).  I honestly hate it, but that's fine... don't have to like it, just do it.  Until one day I had a big brained idea, I bought a robot vacuum cleaner!  I used my own fuck it money, since it was my chore to do, and it's been an absolute dream.  The carpet looks so clean.  So good that the next month I bought a 2nd (So we have 1 for upstairs, 1 for downstairs).  Now I only have to vacuum the stairs and the sofas, everything else is taken care of (I do the corners of the rooms, too, silly circular robots).

It sounds dumb, but I feel liberated.  I don't get all angry that I'm having to vacuum, and I don't feel guilty about ignoring the mess/putting it off til later.  The bulk of it just gets done & I can tackle the rest with ease.  This got me thinking again, ""Seriously, why don't we hire a cleaner?""  Imagine that I could pass this liberation onto my fiancée, too?  If we both took a cut from our fuck it money (cleaner is obviously a luxury not a necessity for the household)... but if past conversations are anything to go on... 

So my question, is it asshole behaviour to pay someone else (or a robot, or two) to do my adult responsibilities for me? Or would my opinion be justified that as an adult I can choose to spend money or spend time, as long as the job gets done, what does it matter?",151,402,0.97

Two of the people are a middle aged black couple who tend to place objects around the gym next to machines they want to “reserve”. So tonight is arm night and I’ve finished everything except for my tricep pulldown which is conveniently part of one of those “4 in 1” type pieces of equipment with the different attachments. There’s two of these machines and a guy is on the other one using the attachment so I go over to the other “4 in 1” and begin my sets. As soon as I start, the wife of the couple walks over yelling “Excuse me! Excuse me! We were using this machine!” And I say “I didn’t see anyone anywhere near here and I just need to do a couple more sets.” Well this sets her off and she screams “My water bottle is right there! And points to a plastic water bottle sitting on the other side of the “4 in 1” machine. I just kind of brushed her off in an attempt to finish my sets when the husband takes notice and comes marching over from across the gym and goes “You’re going to get off this machine right now!” And I replied “Nobody was using it. I’m going to finish my sets. This is my last thing of the night and the other one is being used.” They both then walk away and not even 30 seconds later the woman comes back and screams “GET OFF! IT’S CALLED COURTESY” And I completely ignored her and rushed my last two sets. By then her husband had also come over and I say “Courtesy is not “reserving” equipment that you’re not using.

&#x200B;

I'm 29(F) and have been dating my partner, Tom 31(M), for 10 years, we're very happy together, very much in love, have 2 beautiful children (3&1) but have no plans to get married at all. We're happy the way we are, we have nothing against marriage, it's just never been something that holds importance to us. 

&#x200B;

My Sister, Beth 23(F) is getting married to her boyfriend of 2 years, Jake 25(M), we're all happy for her. Me and Beth have never been super close, mostly because of the age difference, we didn't spend much time together growing up, but we've never had any real issues before now and we've always got along OK. 

&#x200B;

Anyway as I said Beth is getting married and the other day I received my invitation, it was addressed to just me, not me and Tom or even me and a plus 1, just my name on it. I was confused because I know for a fact she's having a huge wedding and inviting almost everyone she's ever met so I couldn't see why Tom wasn't on the invite too. I figured it must be some mistake so I called her.

&#x200B;

Well it wasn't a mistake, we chatted for a few minutes then I just dived right in and said, hey I got an invite for the wedding but it didn't include Tom? Beth said that's right we're having a 'married couples only' rule, I told her that rule usually doesn't apply to serious couples, its supposed to mean no casual dates not exclude people who've been a part of the family for a decade, she replied that no, not married means not married regardless of everything else. At this point I think maybe something else is going on so I asked if she had a problem with Tom, to which she replied no, she had no problem with him, she just wanted a proper, traditional wedding with proper wedding etiquette. I told her that if Tom wasn't invited over something as silly as 'proper etiquette' then I wouldn't be coming either, we're a team and implying that we somehow don't count as a couple because we're not married is frankly insulting. She burst into tears and accused me of ruining her wedding, called me some pretty unpleasant names and hung up.

The rest of the family are refusing to get involved or share an opinion on how they really feel but I'm definitely getting just humor your sister on her important day vibes from everyone, she's been calling our parents in tears constantly and I think they're starting to get pissed that I'm causing her so much sadness and not just doing as she wants, but I kinda feel like this isn't something I should back down on.

141,Not the A-hole,"I am a father to 3 “young adult” (ages 18, 22 and 24) sons who live with me and who for the most part have always gotten along (normal brotherly fights but nothing serious). However throughout this summer I’ve noticed a bit of a tension between them. I told my youngest to spill the beans since I figured the conflict was between the older two since they seemed the most tense. My youngest tired to avoid eye contact and kept trying to play dumb but I kept pushing. My eldest child had some bad history of impulsive behavior when he was a few years younger (the worst being an incident which resulted in his expulsion from college) but he had been slowly improving his life and I didn’t want to be too late to help him if he had done something to jeopardize itI really didn’t want my youngest keeping secrets.

When I finally got the truth out I was in shock, it turns out that middle child gathered a baby (my granddaughter) over a year ago, but had refused to even see the child. My oldest found out since he happens to work with a cousin of the mother, and he has been trying to get his brother to take responsibility and be there for his child, but he has refused. 

I confronted my middle child and we got into a huge fight. He claimed that being a father would ruin his plans for life but I told him that he had to take responsibility for his own actions and that his child deserved to have a father in her life.

This went on for a while when I told him that if he didn’t think his own child deserved a father then he didn’t deserve a father himself and I told him that he had to leave the house. He is 22 years old and has a decent job and plenty of friends so I wasn’t too worried about him. 

I have met my granddaughter and her family and have made some plans to sell my house and downsize to begin a college fund for her since my youngest child will go to college and my oldest has been saving up to move out. 

It has been about a month now and while I feel like I made the correct decision, I still feel terrible. I chose to end my relationship with my son, which hurts so much, since I have always felt closest with him throughout his life (he had the same interests that I had and was the most willing to spend time with me) I feel horrible that I raised a kid who was willing to not care about a human he helped create, I feel like i ruined any chance of a relationship between him and my youngest son, and I feel guilty since my wife has been crying a lot the last few weeks and I don’t know how to fix anything.



AITA for this? Was my reaction too strong?


Edit: He is also incredibly lackluster at paying his child support, he has to be told to do it and even then he is reluctant.

Edit 2: a lot of people are getting upset about my reaction to the youngest child, however my oldest and youngest both have been trying to get him to own up on his own for months before I found out

Edit 3: also I have seen my granddaughter more than once, selling my house is not a knee jerk reaction since I we have been think about it for over a month and still haven’t made ANYTHING official (and my wife and I came up with this idea together )",4084,10245,0.93

145,Not the A-hole,"Chris - my husband (31), Rory - father in law, Sean - my nephew (16), Tom - my brother (35)

I (30f) don't have a baby right now.

About 2 years ago I got pregnant and Chris and I told our families. Rory gave us a check for £1000. He said he wanted us to use it to buy baby stuff while the kid was young, and whatever was left over should be saved for when our child turns 18 and then given to them.

I miscarried shortly after, and we tried to give Rory the money back, but he asked if we were planning on trying again, to which we replied that we wouldn't be any time soon, but someday definitely. He said to keep the money, put it in a savings account and keep adding to it for when we did have a baby.

Chris and I tried to put in about £10 a week between us, which is doable for high school teachers. We missed a couple of weeks but there's about £2500 in there right now, and we've never taken out of it. In 2 years the only people who have put money in this account are me, Chris and Rory.

Both myself and Chris have been to therapy, and we agreed to try again about 6 months ago, and I'm now pregnant again, at 4 months. We told our families today and Rory and my mother in law are both really happy for us, as are my parents.

Tom, however, looked a bit sad. I asked if I could speak to him off to one side. In the conversation that ensued Tom said that he had actually been hoping to ask me about the baby fund. Tom and his wife are both on living wage, meaning they earn slightly less than us, as they had Sean at the age where they would have gone to uni, so it's important to them that Sean gets to go. Sean is 16, but plans to go to uni in a couple of years.

Tom and his wife are concerned that if Sean got a job to save up it would affect his grades and they don't have money to spare, so before Tom knew I was pregnant he was basically hoping he could ask me to transfer the current contents of the baby fund over to Sean, and keep giving Sean the money that would otherwise go in the baby fund, as he worries Sean will not be able to afford uni otherwise. If I were to agree to this and keep doing it until he finished uni, I could restart the baby fund when the baby I'm currently carrying is about 5 years old.

I told Tom I wasn't comfortable with that for several reasons, the main ones being that at most a third of it is actually my money, that the money is meant for my baby, and that the money was also meant to be used when the baby was due to get baby stuff, which we'd struggle to afford otherwise on teacher's wages. I said I'd be willing to work something out, and that with the pregnancy Chris is gradually taking on more housework, so maybe if Sean wanted to come over and do the garden or help with chores I could pay him out of my money (not the baby fund), but Tom says that Sean can't be distracted from his studies. I said that while I love my nephew I'm just not comfortable giving money meant for my child to Sean.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: my family side with Tom, as the baby isn't born yet and I have time to rebuild the fund. Chris and Rory side with me in that they money, as far as they're concerned, is for their child/grandchild, but Rory also said ""do what you think is best"". Mother in law wants to keep the peace, but the initial money was just as much her idea as Rory's.

Jenny and I are good friends and I don’t see her as competition, but I just want my wedding to be about me and Matt, not about Matt and Mark or about Matt, Me, Mark and Jenny.

My wife is awesome. 

I have aspii syndrome. 

I work 9-15 hours a day as an electrician. Depends on the day. 

I have two kids. 


So I'm an electrician. Not just any electrician, but a solar electrician. I work in the hot sun anywhere from 9 to 15 hours a day and average 55 hours a week. Im also the fleet manager for my company so i work from home as well. 

My wife is more than a little irritated at me because I leave at 5:45 am and get back around 7PM almost every day. Sometimes later. But she's also irritated because I can get my fill of social interaction just by being in the same room as my family. I don't actively seek out affection, but I'm not averse to it. My two daughters come to me to color or play catch or whatever else until about 8pm when their bed time is. Then my wife goes out and goes to a movie or pokemon go or craft things or whatever else. I stay home and watch YouTube on my couch until I have the energy to get to my bed. 

I have a few quirks that come with my aspii, including that I focus on things im doing intensely and everything falls to the side to be forgotten. Most often this is household chores. I am always willing to help but i need to be asked because i literally don't see the things that need to be done. 

AITA for not being able to help my wife without being asked?

Edit: getting a lot of im the ass. Which is fair, but i also feel like people don't understand n.y struggle with aspii very well. I'll try to explain better.

Every task is hard for me to overcome by myself. It's not by choice but every day is a struggle for me in this regard.

Edit 2: Aspi syndrome is a mild form of Aspergers. For those not in the know.

Michelle is extremely messy, but she's still a sweet young lady. Sammy however, is rude to my kids as well as trying to steal from them, disrespectful, and does not listen to me or my wife. That wouldn't be a problem if Jen disciplined her kids, but she doesn't.

Anyways, yesterday my wife wanted me to go grocery shopping.

Also my kids and nieces refer to my sister's house as ""grandma's house"" since my mother lives there too, so I'll refer to it as that from now on)

So when my girls and I were about to leave, Sammy asks if they can also go to grandma's house. I say no, as I don't want them to cause trouble for my sister. So, Sammy starts to beg. This draws the attention of my son and Michelle, which makes them join into the ""fun"". I open the front door as Michelle, Sammy, and my son run to my car and crowd my car, looking VERY smug. I tell them to get inside, and they refuse, with Sammy stating they once I unlock the car doors, they will sit and not out of my car until they arrive at grandma's house. The younger ones follow their ringleader. 

I warn them one last time, get inside or be locked out. They refuse again, with the smuggest faces I have ever saw. So, I lock the front door. Then, going into my car, I unlock only the passenger seat, telling my daughters to get in to the back from there. Then once they are inside, I lock the car doors. The looks on their faces were PRICELESS. Before I go I text my wife not to unlock the door for 5 minutes, then I drive around my neighborhood making sure not to go by my house. After 5 minutes I drive back home, unlock the front door, and lectured them. Pretty much saying that they will be punished from now on, and that this behavior needs to end now. 

My wife is understandly mad. And Jen was napping during this event. Of course I told her, and she wasn't mad at all, surprisingly.

156,No A-holes here," My ex husband has been in prison for just under two years. We separated and divorced just prior to him going in for reasons related to his arrest.

We have a 6 year old daughter together. 

We grew up together in a small town and had an amazing relationship before things turned bad, so we have ALWAYS remained very friendly. While I have absolutely no desire to have any sort of romantic relationship with him again, I can’t picture my life without him being involved as Kid’s dad (obviously) and my friend. He calls \~nightly to say goodnight to Kid, and I take her to visit him every other week or so.  Keep in mind that ***I*** don’t talk to him on the phone often or for long (other than normal “how are you” stuff before handing the phone to Kid, and I never go visit him by myself. Our visits are centered 100% around Kid. 

He gets out of prison in less than a year. 

I’ve been dating BF for almost a year. Everything is going very well except recently he’s been vocal about him not liking that I visit my ex so often. He says he’s always been bothered by it but just now “feels we’re in a place where we can discuss these things.”

I explained to him what I wrote above and how he’s always going to be involved since he’s Kid’s dad. BF thinks my ex is a bad influence for Kid to be around. 

Kid’s never been exposed to the behavior that put my ex in prison, and he’s not a bad influence. If he was, I’d have rethought this well before BF voiced his opinion.

BF said he’s also bothered that I, personally, talk to my ex so much. We argued about it the night before we were supposed to visit my ex two weekends ago. I wanted to be really sensitive to BF’s point of view, so I canceled the trip.

We talked about it some more this week. BF hasn’t changed his mind. I’m still going to visit my ex this upcoming weekend because I don’t think it’s fair to stop seeing him, and I have zero desire to. 

BF told me I’m being selfish. 

I don’t think I am, but I feel really guilty for some reason :(

157,No A-holes here,"I live in the US, been married for 7 years to an american woman, and once a year we go to my country to visit.

It’s awesome, we have a great time, my family and friends are so happy we are there, and they all love my wife.

The thing is, I never get to relax and do nothing, cause there’s always some event for us to go or she wants to go explore and stuff, totally understandable. Also we always speak english because she doesn’t know my language

But at the same time, I would love to go and stay at my parents house for a week, do nothing, speak my language all the time and just enjoy that, maybe go to a friend’s house for some beer and videogames like the old days.

I told her that I want to take a week off from work and go home, that it’s almost 10 years that I haven’t been home by myself.

This won’t affect our vacation together, I will just take a random week off ( my work is really flexible).

I also said that I would obviously use my personal money ( we have a joint account and we both have personal savings accounts).

I asked her opinion and she did not like it at all. She asked if I dont like when she goes, and I said of course I do, and we will keep going together, but I would like to go once by myself just to relax and do nothing, speak my language, etc.

She got super offended, and said that she always invites me to go visit her family and that she doesn’t have the need to go alone. I said ok but still I would like to go home alone once, and that I would totally understand if she wanted to go see her family without me once in a while.

Also she said it’s a super long trip and she doesn’t understand why I dont want her company in such a long flight ( about 11 hours each way)

Eventually she said “ ok go” but I know she’s not 100%fine with it.

Am I being an asshole???",28,29,0.97

159,No A-holes here,"My wife and I have been married for 7 years. Wife is 31, I'm 32. We had a child who left us at 3 months old, and we've been on and off trying for a little over 5 years now. I say on and off because she has ovarian issues that require her to periodically use oral contraceptives for months at a time. 

The problem, aside from that we both want children very much and it's just...not happening, is that the nursery is still up in full. We have a very small (1,100 square feet) 3 bedroom house, and the even smaller other upstairs bedroom is her office. We have a basement, but it is not finished or able to be finished, and there's a lot of just..junk down there from the previous owners, her parents. If we had a mansion, this wouldn't be an issue.  

1. We have nowhere to have overnight guests besides a pullout couch. If the other bedroom was emptied out, we could at least get the full size bed that's currently in the basement in there, and have a decent guest room instead of a permanent shrine. The cats would likely also enjoy another room to go in, whereas now it's closed off. 

2. While most of our friends are very long term and have been around since before all of this, if we make new friends or a stranger comes over, having a full baby room and no sign of any baby doesn't look sad and mournful, it looks creepy and gets us first on the list of suspects if a pregnant woman goes missing.

I brought this up and she's very emotionally against it. She thinks that I don't think we will ever be able to have children and that I'm asking her to give up on the idea of kids by banishing the stuff to ""the place where dreams go to die"" AKA the basement. Apparently her own infertile adoptive parents put a cradle down there at one point after ""giving up"" although I have no idea where it is or why nothing has been touched in the basement for 50+ years. She also accused me of wanting to give the stuff to my sister in law, who is producing children at Duggar levels. 

I don't think that having more children will never happen, I've just accepted that it may be years, and that in the meantime, we should use the space to its fullest. We still have time before menopause, probably about a decade more, I don't know obviously. I don't feel the need to give the stuff away. If it will make her more comfortable to have it in the basement until WE die, I'm fine with that. It's a massive waste, but this isn't the thing to get all ""no waste"" about.

AITA for thinking this? I'd even be willing to pay for a storage locker if she's concerned about the basement being too sad and damp, I just think we desperately need more room in this house and can't just keep a shrine forever.",86,223,0.94
160,Not the A-hole,"So I’m a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I’m straight, I’m very feminine, and I just don’t like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I’m not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I’m dating a new guy in my life and I’ve been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn’t give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn’t shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn’t being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn’t understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I’d prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn’t need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I’m freaking out and it’s making me so anxious.
AITA for not shaving my legs for my job?

EDIT: So people giving my boss hate i understand but I’m not mad at him and don’t blame him. Im not sure but I feel like someone was in fact pressuring him to talk to me about this because he is a usually very chill and a nice guy who usually doesn’t even force dress code and stuff. But also I really have no clue what really brought this on all of a sudden since I’ve worked there 8 months with no incident.",1639,22588,0.87
161,Not the A-hole,"We went to a wedding out of town. When we go on vacation SIL takes advantage and relinquishes control of our nephew and pawns him off on us. Like he rides in the car with us, he stays in our hotel room, she gives him a bath in our bathroom, he eats all his meals sitting in between us. So I put my foot down and planned accordingly to avoid this. She was not happy about that. 

Our nephew is three and acts out A LOT. Temper tantrums, yelling because he can't have the phone/what he wants. It's frustrating to deal with, especially when we're on vacation. Ultimately it's her fault for not setting boundaries and being a better disciplinarian. She depends on my husband to do it when we're around. 

Before the ceremony, he ran and jumped around in church and wanted to play with my husband. I distracted my husband over to the bulletin board and told him ""Do not interact with him if he wants to play. Don't tell him to behave. His mother is here. He is not ours to discipline."" I purposefully sat in the pew behind her so he wouldn't try to come over to us and when he did I told him to go back to his mom. She did nothing the ease his behavior, and when he started to get fussy she gave him her phone.

During the reception, we all sat at the same table. He stood in between us and put his toy cars on our dinner plates. I took his cars off and told him to go sit with his mom. We went to the bar and he wanted to follow. I told him to go with his mom. We went to the dance floor and he followed, he held my husbands hand and jump around, after 2 songs I told him to go back to his mom. He cried, so she had to get up and dance with him to make him stop. He cried during dinner, the toast and the dancing. My MIL asked why he was crying and she pointed at us and said ""Because he wants to be with them but he can't."" This pissed me off. She shouldn't make us feel bad for trying to make her responsible for HER child.

Later on my husband told me that he asked our neice why her brother was crying and she said because he didn't nap and hadn't eaten. So, my SIL only said that to make us feel bad? 

I love my nephew but I want to set a presedent that she can't just sit back do nothing and expect us to do her role. She is perfectly able to play cars with him, dance, pay attention and discipline him, but chooses not to because she knows that my husband and I will eventually take over. It's very frustrating to see him act out because of her lack of discipline. It's exhausting being around him when he cries and whines because he didn't get his way. But it's equally exhausting trying to be a parent to a child that isn't mine. We both decided that we dont want kids yet because were not ready to divide our attention. We want to enjoy our early years of marriage, kid-free. That goes out the window when our nephew is around, because my SIL sees us as a temporary relief.",26,50,0.89
162,Asshole,"I know co parenting means parenting together but my ex Joel (29 male) can make it quite hard at times. Over the past few months I started a new relationship with Daniel (38 male) and it is one of the first serious relationships that I have had ever since Joel and I split up back when Howey was a year old. Ive always been very cautious with other men near Howey because I never felt comfortable with him meeting random guys. The very few guys that Howey(6 male) has met have been ""friends"" and there was never any kissing.

Joel never liked Daniel because of some substance abuse issues that Daniel struggles/struggled with. When I met Daniel it started as a casual thing and it slowly progressed into more serious territory. After a couple months of me getting to know him I knew I was comfortable with him being around my son. Joel was not happy because of his preconcieved notions about Daniel. I tried to explain to him that I was very capable of making the right desicions when it came to our child. He told Howey that he didnt want him going over to Daniels house which all it accomplished was making him feel guilty because he loves being at Daniels house. 

Every so often Howey and I will sleep over at Daniels. There is a guest room and thats usually where Howey sleeps but often times all three of us will sleep on the same bed. Howey is used to cosleeping with me when we are home since I live in a one bedroom. He will often move from the guest room to Daniels bed with us. Sometimes I bring him in myself because he sleeps in more with me in bed. We are always fully clothes and nothing sexual ever happens. Howey mentioned this to Joel (almost sure he was digging and asking) and he is less than happy. I tried to tell him what I just explained above but he says he doesnt care and that it makes him uncomfortable. I told him he had to suck it up because there isnt really much I can do about him crawling into bed with us in the middle of the night.

I also have full custody of Howey. We coparent and I let him see him every week and act like custody is split but on paper I have full custody because, ironically, Joel has had a drinking problem since we were teenagers and it eventually got him arrested. What I find even more hypocritical is the fact that Ive seen old pictures of him in bed with one of his girlfriends kissing her while Howey was next to them and it was obviously a ""we just woke up"" picture.

Last night Howey and I slept over Daniels and his guest room was occupied by his aunt so we all ended up sleeping in the same bed. Howey immidietly tells Joel before he has even fallen asleep. I wake up to a message of him upset. I approach the subject with Daniel and he tells me that Joel sent him a threathening message. So, Reddit, am I the asshole for letting my son sleep in bed with us? I really dont care about Joels opinion because it seems biased to me at least, but ethically I'm torn wether its the wrong thing to be doing in a more general sense.",283,96,0.82
163,Asshole,"Okay so stay with me. I’m 25 now and my older brother Chris got married when he was 27 to Taylor. Him and Taylor had a son the following year. 

They seemed to have a really good marriage but around when their son was 3, something happened. They spent a lot less time together and they eventually got a divorce. 

Well it came out that my brother confessed to Taylor that he was gay and had been “having feelings for another man.”

They divorced after this and my brother started a new relationship with this man. This was three years ago and now Chris is marrying this same guy.

The thing is, I’ve been witness to the devastation that this caused to his ex wife and son. He still is around for his son, but starting a life with a woman when he never was interested in women is something I’ll never understand. It’s not as if any of us would judge him for being gay. I’ve tried to help out with my nephew when I can so I’ve seen the confusion it’s caused him and the hurt it caused his ex, one of the kindest people I know.

I really don’t feel like celebrating the harm that he caused his family by going to his wedding.

164,Not the A-hole,"So I work in a mental hospital, and one of the patients has an African background and is very unwell. I found out today that the majority of my colleagues , also being from African Backgrounds , believe that patient has been cursed by 'Black Magic', and that this is the cause of his mental illness, with a few of them stating that it is the problem instead of mental illness. I, being English , so having no cultural belief in this sort of thing, and also having a psychology degree, could not believe that people working in a mental hospital with patients with diagnosable scientifically observable disorders, believed that this particular individuals issues were caused by magic. 

Whilst trying to be as sensitive as possible, understanding that different cultures have different beliefs, I managed to piss off a significant proportion of my co-workers in a discussion, who are now giving me the cold shoulder. 

One of my points was that human nature is to attempt to explain the unexplainable, which is why we had theories of a god making the sun go up and down thousands of years ago etc, and attributing mental illness to black magic is another case of this.

I explained how every symptom this individual presents with is accounted for in the diagnostic manual for their specific disorder. 

I was told that black magic exists , and that they have seen it with their own eyes, how I would only believe it if I experienced it, how powers were detailed in the Bible. That Christians brought these beliefs over to Africa way back when in the first place. 

The counter-argument that agitated me somewhat was when I was asked why the medication they are on appears to have no effect. I said somewhat snappily that this disorder is literally called 'treatment resistant [xyz].' 
I'm not one to lose my temper in discussion but this got quite heated at times. 

 I'm worried I came across as culturally insensitive, and a bit of a 'twat who knows a bit about psychology.' I'm trying to justify myself being somewhat cross over this because I am genuinely concerned that this belief will affect the care the patient receives. This wouldn't bother me too much usually , but I am fairly 'outnumbered' in terms of believers to non, and I'm trying to figure out whether I should bother to apologise or just hold my (in my head) rational beliefs and just move on. I'm not sure how I've managed to offend people via science. So AITA?",40,29,0.84
165,Asshole,"My son(28M) got married few months ago. His husband(22M) moved in with him. Doesn’t work, smokes weed, hangs out with his friends all day. All he does successfully is using my son’s credit card to buy ridiculous expensive clothes and whatever he wants. 

I visited him few days ago, he opened door. Holding a blunt of course. I asked where my son was coming home, he said he’d be kinda late. We started talking.

166,Not the A-hole,"Hello all, long time reader, first time writer.

My ex-wife divorced me a year ago after cheating on me with a longtime friend. We had been married for a while and it was not cool. She was pretty mean to me in the finalization of all the proceedings, but I didn't fight her on any issues because I was just trying to get it over with and ended up giving her everything she asked for financially and otherwise. I've moved on emotionally and am in a great place now.

She's a business owner and while we were married I routinely did the accounting and licensing work for it. This included annual business license applications, registration with the state for LLC status, and keeping the books. I transitioned all this to her as part of our separation and met with her multiple times after she left to go over basic tax procedure, filing processes, and other work.

We officially cut ties at the beginning of the year, but she never forwarded her mail. I received the renewal notice for her LLC in error and forwarded it to her. I explained that if she didn't renew it by the expiration date in the letter, her LLC would expire and she would risk losing the protection it offers with respect to personal liability.

In fact, I reminded her 3 times because I kept checking renewal status right up to the expiration date and noticed she hadn't done it.

She's kept running her business this whole time and didn't heed my multiple reminders the expiration would happen.

I now know that the state will dissolve her LLC next month if she does not pay because it has been in an expired state for so long. But I have made a point of not contacting her as a means of moving on. However, I don't think she's aware of what's happening. If she doesn't renew it, she will be fined and lose the legal protection of operating an LLC.

I'm not trying to get back at her by not saying anything. I just don't want to meddle, and tried long ago to accept that it is no longer my responsibility to look out for her and she is her own woman. However, I can't help but feel ethically compelled to let her know.

Am I an asshole for not contacting her, even though I know this information would help her?",30,54,0.9

168,,"Trying a rewrite with more info. 

Things we've disagreed on: 

Bedtime.  My granddaughter didn't have her own room.  She slept on a toddler bed in our room.  My daughter wanted lights off, no screens at 8p.  I refused.  I didn't let granddaughter have one, obviously, but I'd lay in my bed and watch Netflix on my laptop.  Because that was sometimes my only day off, I'd have to do my errands.  Sometimes we wouldn't even get home til 8 and we'd have to do bedtime routine, teeth, sometimes baths, ect.  There were more than a couple times that she was up significantly later than eight.

Food/drinks: I did all her rules surrounding these even though it required me to make a dinner for granddaughter, then two hours later make every one else a dinner because none of us wanted dinner at 5p.  

Punishments: I don't agree with how my daughter does punishments.  I feel like toddlers attention spans require immediate, short term punishments.  Usually time outs.  My daughter will take away outings or cartoons or something for long stretches.  If her mom gave the punishment already, I abide by it even though I disagree but I never make those punishments myself.  I also always say she was good (she almost always is) even when she's done something wrong because then my daughter wants to make a bigger punishment than what I already gave.

There are some things that annoy her. We have a huge claw foot tub.   At my house she takes two hours baths.  We have different bubbles.  A whole crate of bath toys.  I'll play music on my laptop and we do sing alongs while in the bath.  My daughter complains that she hates bath time at home and begs to go to Grandma's for baths, which is obviously not always possible.  Nor can my daughter dedicate two hours to a bath with an infant to care for.  

I don't think my daughter is unreasonable.  I think she's doing the best she can.  I compromise most of the time but some things I think are just silly, like making baths less fun.",159,131,0.9

I also work, have a volunteer job that takes up quite a few hours a week, and am 100% responsive for all things kids during the week. Life is hectic and cooking is usually on the bottom of my list of things to do.  I also hate cooking.  The children are fed but not with gourmet meals.  It usually just stuff I’ve tossed together or kid friendly food like chicken nuggets.  On the rare occasion I actually make a presentable meal, I will make enough for him too but that happens maybe once a month. He recently expressed it upsets him when he gets home at 8 or 9pm then has to make himself dinner.  We’ve tried those meal delivery service meals and pre-prepared meals from local deli but he says those are all too expensive (which really means he doesn’t want to spend money on them not that we can’t afford them). I suggested he meal prep on sundays for the week and he said we don’t have time for hours of meal prep (he’s right - kids have 3 different sports on Sundays in 3 different places all day long).  He thinks I am being unreasonable and should just start making nice meals daily.  My day goes from 7am until 9pm. The last thing I want to include is cooking a “real meal.”  AITA?

I’ve been asked multiple times for daily schedule so here’s a typical weekday:

5am get up and exercise / get dressed / make breakfast / pack school lunch

6:30am get kid 1 up, dressed, fed, and work on school stuff (he struggles academically so we do mini tutoring sessions in mornings to help him)

7:15am put him on the bus

7:20am wake up kid 2, get her dressed and fed, take her to daycare

8am-4pm work my job where I bring in 50% of the household income plus healthcare

4pm pick up kid 1 from aftercare and kid 2 from daycare

5pm-7pm sports, kid therapy, kid tutoring, kid shit, play with kids just depends on the day, try to shove food in their faces

7pm put kid 2 to bed

7:30pm kid 1 homework and play

8pm put kid 1 to bed

In there sprinkle the volunteer work which is running kid 1’s school’s pta and things like cleaning house / laundry / walking dogs / etc.

10pm go to bed after handling stuff


Husbands typical day:

7am wake up, get dressed

8am leave for work

7pm-8pm come home and complain about work. (Edit the complain part was supposed to be funny but obviously came across as bitter instead.  I will work on that too and appreciate him more for how hard he works.)

So my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


I don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


Well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


Well, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


Well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no.

He’s never physically harmed me although he punched the wall next to me one time and it really scared me because of possible PTSD from a traumatic childhood. Lately he seems to be focusing some of his delusions on me, he thinks I’m evil and a demon. I may have made things worse when I played a demon D&D character with him. 
It seems like he started seeing me as evil when I started taking a more active parenting role in his life (searching his room, putting in security cameras, grounding him from electronics, etc) and after I testified in court that he should remain hospitalized the last time he was involuntarily commuted. 

I know he will always struggle with his condition and I don’t want to come between him and his Mother  but I don’t feel safe with him in the house. He’s a big guy and if he ever decided to harm me physically I would be at his mercy. He’s never directly said he wants to hurt me but he talks about killing demons and thinks I’m a demon, so...
Right now he’s in the hospital and I sat his mother down and told her it’s him or me. He can’t stay with us when he is released. He has no other family and group homes in this state have a year long wait. He might end up on the street. Does that make me the asshole?

178,Not the A-hole,"I grew up in a commune. It's not something I talk about a lot unless it's with my friends. Not because it was bad; I had a very happy upbringing. But because it comes across as strange to many people.

But last weekend, I was going out and drinking with a group from work, and mentioned something about my ""fathers"". My coworker asked whether I have gay dads, and I said no, they were both straight. I grew up in communal living, and was raised by everyone in the community who wanted the role of parenting.

(Apologies if any of this is confusing, English is not my only language and also I know this topic is strange. I just really want input on whether I crossed a line, I think my life has given me different social norms than a lot of people.)

Anyway, my coworker asked me what I meant of that, and I told him that I had many people in the community who were my parents; there were about 50 people in the commune and 15 with parenting as one of their roles. They are parents to me just as much as my biologic mother and father. And I see the other children from the commune as almost my siblings.

My coworkers had a lot of questions about it, and seemed to see it as something I should have hated. Not having parents in the same way they did, bring brought up with 10 other children and teenagers. 

But I said, No, I loved it. I really meant it, it was wonderful growing up with so many supportive people and having the kind of network that a lot of people don't have in America. There are a lot of lonely people, people who are lonely except for their spouse who they might not even like, etc. I didn't think the nuclear family was the only option; it's possible to love more than one person as a partner if that's what everyone involved likes. And it's possible to love more than two people as parents. Hearts don't have to be small enough to only fit one love and two parents, I said.

And I had not meant that in a mean way, I was drunk and not thinking before I spoke, that's all. I had not been trying to call everyone small-hearts. But that's how a couple of the people I was with took it. They jumped into defending their relationship with their wives and children and saying that their children were loved and cared for and not lonely.

I just said that it's all ok, we have had different lives and I'm glad your life has made you happy. But please respect that my life has made me happy too.

And that was an uncomfortable silence afterwards.

AITA for telling my coworkers about the commune I grew up in, and why I was happy to be raised there and thought it had some advantages to the traditional American lifestyle?",21,50,0.93

So, it was my wedding anniversary a couple months ago. The anniversary this year fell on a weekday so i had work.

I am fortunate in the sense that I have flexibility in terms of my work hours so, knowing I'd be busy celebrating the anniversary with the SO 5 pm onwards, I decided to take off from work early around 3 pm instead of 5 pm to get a quick work out in.

My SO called me right before I was heading out for the gym and I, being the transparent partner that I am, told her about my plan.

She got upset that I was thinking about gym and working out on our wedding anniversary because I should be thinking of spending my free time with her.

181,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway though there's a good chance my sister will see this since she's on this sub all the time. I don't mind that, I do mind this bleeding into my regular reddit life. 

My family owns a very small ranch outside Taos, New Mexico. I love it here and don't ever want to leave. Since my parents are older they moved to a retirement home in Albuquerque and my sister moved away a long time ago also to Albuquerque. Though I don't own the property, me and my husband are the primary care takers and we also make most of our money stabling horses and growing organic produce. 

My sister bought a horse about 3 years ago and asked if she could board her at the family stables. I said of course. So basically the way it works is she gets free boarding and I send her a bill for the feed every month and to her absolute credit, she has always paid me on time and the full amount. However, after coming up maybe 3-4 times the first year, my sister hasn't seen the horse in about 2 years. 

Of course I've seen my sister since I got to Albuquerque every month at least to see my parents and basically our family's genetics have started to kick in (literally every woman who takes after my mom's side gains about 100-150lbs overnight when the hit 30, this is true for my grandma, my mom, my aunts, my cousins, etc... my dad's side which I seem to take after doesn't have this issue) So I've seen my sister gain this weight over the last two years since she last rode her horse. 

Well she showed up out of the blue on Saturday wanting to take her horse for a ride. The simple fact is, she's way too heavy. There's a specific formula regarding horse to rider weight ratio an my sisters horse really should max out at about 215lbs. My sister is well, well above that. Growing up where she did, she should know this so I'm not sure what it devolved into such a nasty fight but it did, complete with her picking up mud balls and smashing them into the upholstery of my truck's seats. 

She says I need to back off and not weight shame her and after all, the horse belongs to her and she pays for her to be fed every month. I told her I understood all this but I'm not going to let the horse suffer because the bills are paid. That's when the literal mud slinging started and she drove off and we've been exchanging nasty texts and emails ever since.

182,Not the A-hole,"A little over a year ago my sister transferred to a college out of state and dormed there away from home. A couple months in word got out that she had a boyfriend. I found out through mutual friends rather than her personally, which I thought was odd. When I talked to her I asked about him a little bit but she was always very secretive and wouldn’t tell me much about him other than his name, i also found that odd but I respect her privacy, so ya know.

A few months go down the road of me and my family being in the dark about him, I started to notice from her Instagram that she is going to a lot of extravagant places and doing some very expensive things, and wearing very nice name brand clothes. Our family doesn’t have money like that so I figured it was the boyfriend, then I saw he had bought her a dog and then later a pig(yeah, a fuckin pig). I showed this to my family and we all thought okay, wtf is going on. Who the hell is this guy?

After some pressure she finally revealed to us that this guy is well into his 50s, and that she’s been living with him in his house for the past few months. She showed us some pictures of them together, and the house they live in, and holy shit it’s huge. Idk what this guy does but he’s clearly loaded. My parents are pissed, obviously, that her boyfriend turned out to be our fathers age, and are not talking to her currently.

I’m trying to be accepting of her choices, moreso than my parents but honestly this situation just rubs me the wrong way. She told she is not going to be visiting home this year, and told me I should come down and see her, meet her boyfriend and such and so forth. I was open to the idea, until i was told I’d have to sleep at a hotel, because “men aren’t allowed to sleepover” at her boyfriends house. I mean, what the hell? That’s weird, right? I’m already creeped out and worried about this situation and that kinda drives it home. I told her I won’t be coming and that I’m pretty uncomfortable with her boyfriend in general.

Of course, she got upset and now thinks I’m just as bad as our parents. But honestly? My parents may have handled it wrong but they’re right. This “sugar daddy” guy is creepy, and honestly I kind of worry for her safety. But I know if I tell her that it’ll just make her more adamant about it, she’s stubborn like that.

183,Not the A-hole,"So I have no experience with this kind of stuff and since people are calling me an asshole i thought i should ask. 

&#x200B;

I'll preface this by saying me and my sister don't get along. We took two different paths in life and have far different views because of it. I went to college and got a fairly high paying job while she decided to move away and try acting after failing out.  

So my sister has 3 kids, all from different fathers. I'll give her credit, she is a good mother. She puts her kids first and is trying to give them all good lives. But she thinks that EVERYONE owes them. Despite being 30 she really cant hold down a job and expects everyone else to take care of her kids. She constantly uses my parents as free babysitting and daycare. She will often call them randomly to take care of them because she needs to work or is going out to party/hang out with friends. 

If my parents or other siblings refuse she throws a huge fit and tells them they OWE this to them and that they are blood. Now this is where I come in. My sister can barley make ends meet and often is """"""""""""borrowing"""""""""""" money from my parents or siblings. I have always refused to give her anything, time or money. Despite the fact i'm more well of than my siblings and parents i will never give her a cent. My sister will always shame me for this and say i'm inconsiderate and an ass. My parents and other siblings have never really given me crap about this as they don't want to cause any drama. That was until recently. 

Last week my sister found out she's pregnant again. She told everyone her sob story and started to break down to everyone that she couldn't afford another child but she would not abort or give it up. After this my sister began to call me multiple times telling me that she really needed help and started to beg for money. When I told her no she began to tell me that i'm an inconsiderate ass and that i've never cared about her or her children. after a 30 minute call of her berating me and then her calling all my siblings and parents to tell them I was an asshole she called me back saying that I should at least pay for a caretaker. I told her no again and before she could respond I said ""Don't even start about how I don't care. The truth is, i don't. I don't care about the mother of 3 bastards with a 4th on the way. If you really need help just have mom and dad raise your kids so you can go back to sitting on your ass collecting welfare"" before I hung up.

I go out of my way to get releases, even if only on retro stuff like laserdisc, to get the original theatrical soundtracks if I can. I collect old tech, gaming computer office etc, and display it in my China cabinet. I don't date much, occasionally I get a date but usually it doesn't proceed because I don't want to give up my 'childish' hobbies. Or so ive been given as the reason when I ask. Which Im fine with i like single life now and am in no hurry to leave it. I do go get a 1 nighter from time to time but eh I care about other things more.

Now I'm not some neckbeard, I have a full time job as a lead engineer. I've been with this company for nearly a decade, since I got out of uni. They've paid for my masters degree and PhD, so i do make a dang nice living and thanks to that I have zero debt other than my mortgage. I feel like I've got this adulting thing pretty much down for a 33 year old and am enjoying my life.

My (probably former by now...) best friend on the other hand disagres with me... She sees my hobbies as very childish and hasn't made an secret about it for the past few years. She keeps telling me that I need to let the kiddy shit go and find a wife since I"" already have the house and deft free life with a good job most people out age can only dream of and never will achieve. "" or that my childish antics are why I don't get relationships (which I've never complained about after I turned 20).

Lazt weekend we and other friends were at lunch and I was talking to her brother about skyrim vr and the new(ish) goofy movie bluray(fresh hd film scans, looks so Fuckin beautiful), since we are both into vr and Disney. I guess this upset her because she snapped at me and asked, rudely, when I was gonna finally grow up and ditch the cartoon and game shit and help a nice woman build a happy life. Since it was in the middle of my conversation I wasn't thinking and let slip what I've been thinking for a while but haven't said since I didn't want to hurt her..

187,Not the A-hole,"So I was flying to work for the week, and it's a short flight, 4 hours on a small commuter jet. I use miles to upgrade to first class so I can keep my backpack and CPAP machine with me in the overhead compartment. This bag is pretty small, about the size of a laptop case. My CPAP (breathing machine when you sleep) is super important to my safety. If it gets broken or lost, I'm screwed, can't sleep and could have serious medical consequences. Replacing parts would be nearly impossible at my destination. On top of that, the last time I flew, someone needed bag space overhead and the flight attendant moved it back and during the flight an old lady dropped it getting her bag out of the overhead, put it back, and didn't tell me until she was walking off the plane. Cost me $300 to replace the parts and the airline said it wasn't there fault a passenger dropped it. :-|

So I board the plane, put my backpack and CPAP case up top and sit down. It's important to know I'm in the front row so I can't put it under my seat.

As more people board the plane, and as the aircrew had said multiple times, the flight is full and large bags should go under the plane.

This man, sitting back in coach, wheels his huge carry on suitcase with him. He realizes he doesn't have space in the back as it's filling up, so he tries to jam it in my overhead because he sees it's only filled with my bags, and a couple purses from other passengers. The flight attendant sees this and proceeds to take my CPAP case (tagged with a special tag to indicate a medical device) and walk 10 feet down the aisle to put it somewhere else. She turns around and yells ""Who's bag is this?"" I say its mine. She says ""I'm putting it back in coach in row 12, you can get it after the people deplane when we land"". Now I'm pissed, and I tell her no, I want it above me, I don't want it broken, and I don't want it out of my sight. And I'd prefer she didn't handle it at all, it's a $3000 medical device I cannot risk being broken.

Now she's mad I pushed back on her, and tells me ""It's my job to move things around, I know what I'm doing"". I told her ""what happens if someone breaks it, or you break it? Are you going to replace it?"". ""Oh honey, I have plenty of insurnace"". The passengers around me see how distressed I'm getting and show her that it can fit in the overhead above me if she just turns it sideways. She does that and slams the overhead closed and walks off.

Now I look like a jerk for talking back to a flight attendant, but frankly I don't want my machine broken.

AITA?

188,Not the A-hole,"
I joined the military about ~3 years ago, and started paying for my sister's braces about 1.5 years in (2018). I was 20 at the time, she was 14, almost 15. I was paying $190 a month, which is a bit tight as an E3 with my own debts to worry about.

Her behavior had been getting worse in the last 1.5 years, and she's  constantly in trouble at home. She's been too focused on boys, grades were slipping, sneaking out to drink with friends, smoking weed, doing Adderall, etc. She's a good kid, but she's been acting up for a while now. I tried to be there for her and tell her there are more important things than boys and partying, and she'll end up stuck in our home town if she keeps fucking up her life. Last month, I reported her 20 yo ""boyfriend"" to the police for statutory issues (she's 16, age of consent in that state is 18). She called me, screaming all kinds of names at me and telling me that I'm wrong for what I did and ""it didn't matter if he was a predator, [they] were in love."" I'm stationed across the country so there's not much I can do.

I understand (to an extent) why she's acting out: we grew up in an abusive home, and she now lives with her aunt who is emotionally abusive and controlling. She's constantly under lockdown even when it's not her fault, I've seen it because our Aunt did that to me as well. She's not getting her emotional needs met.  Also, my Aunt won't let her get a job because she thinks she will be taxed on my sister's income, which I told both of them was bullshit according to the IRS.  My aunt didn't take it well, and blocked my number a few months ago. I've never had a good relationship with her and I guess that was it. She's been talking trash about me behind my back for months now.

All that to bring us to the current issue; I got fed up with the way they've both been treating me, so I'm no longer paying for my sister's braces, and I won't pay for them to be removed. My Aunt is very selfish, and can always come up with the money to go on frequent vacations and go out gambling, but can't pay for my sister's braces. She has good insurance through her new job so I figured she can find a way to get that covered. My Aunt and my sister are now both pissed at me. I'm tired of them spitting in my face while still taking my money; I've tried to be there for my sister and help her get her life together so she can move out and be independent, but nothing seems to work. So, AITA?

Edit: I have tried for the last 2 years to convince my Aunt to let me take custody of my sister. The military would give me dependent BAH to take care of her, plus I could put her on my insurance and get her braces covered there. They offer a lot of resources for dependents, which my Aunt knows about because I've explained it time and time again. Still, she refuses and my sister is afraid to speak out about the way my Aunt treats her and is afraid of what my Aunt would do if she asked to come live with me. I've been trying to help me but neither of them are doing anything to let me help.

Edit 2: I tried to call CPS when I lived there and nothing was done. Even if I call them now, my sister will not speak out about the way my Aunt treats her.

Edit 3: No, she will not be left with braces on forever. If you can't continue payment, the dentist removes them and you have to pay for removal. My Aunt has the money to get them removed. If you can't afford the removal, they set you up with a payment plan.",93,203,0.94
189,Not the A-hole,"When I was 7 months pregnant, we told my in-laws that if they planned to smoke marijuana in their house while we were there with the baby, we wouldn't visit them due to secondhand smoke exposure. My father-in-law (FIL), who is 77 years old and a chronic smoker due to pain, told us it was a myth and secondhand smoke exposure only pertained to cigarette smoke, and when we showed him a few articles linking secondhand marijuana smoke to traceable levels in children's urine, he said it was all just a ploy by the government to make it illegal again (paraphrasing). We told them again our position, but dropped it after that.

Now, baby is four months old. We have been to visit my parents twice in this time frame with the baby, but have not gone to my in-laws' house. We have met the in-laws at a neutral location (like a restaurant and my parents' backyard BBQ) so they can still have a relationship with our daughter, however my mother-in-law (MIL) has made it clear that she is pissed we won't come over to her house with the baby for a weekend visit like we will with my parents. We reminded her that as long as there is marijuana smoking in the house, we can't bring the baby around.

She said it isn't fair that she should be punished just because FIL smokes, but we have told them both that if he could use edibles for the weekend we visit or just smoke outside on the porch we could make an overnight trip happen. FIL has refused to use edibles because they don't get him high enough (his exact words) and has refused to smoke on the porch because ""my 77 year old ass shouldn't have to go outside to smoke pot because you're an over-bearing, paranoid woman"" (also his exact words). 

So we have stuck to our guns and have not gone to visit. MIL has told her entire family and co-workers (which are also like family since it's a small business in a small town) that we are denying her from seeing her only grandchild because I'm ""paranoid of a little pot"". Now, we are receiving phone calls, Facebook messages, and text messages from my husband's entire family as well as MIL's co-workers about what pieces of shit we are. MIL, FIL, and brother-in-law even attended the baby shower (which happened after she was born because I was in the hospital the entire third trimester of my pregnancy due to complications) without a gift or a card and refused to hold the baby, claiming that they ""wouldn't want to contaminate the princess with pot"".

I feel terrible. I am only trying to protect my daughter and go off the information that I have, and my husband is devastated that his family seems to be choosing drugs over their granddaughter. His family sees it as an attack on them, personally, and that I am just trying to keep their granddaughter from them.

So quick backstory. I had an infant son who was murdered by my husband. I don't wanna give away all the info but he is in prison.

A close friend and coworker of mine has been fighting for custody to get his son back from the mother who kidnapped him and took him across state lines. After years of going through the court system his son is finally coming home and I couldn't be happier for them. This man has done so much and jumped through every hoop and all his hard work is finally paying off. 

He was bragging about it at work and began showing me old pics and videos of his son and I began to breakdown. His son's blonde hair and blue eyes reminded me of the son I never got to see grow up and mature. This was also around what would have been my son's 10th birthday so I was feeling extra sensitive about everything. I started crying and excused myself to smoke a cigarette and try to settle my nerves. When I walked away with tears in my eyes I said to him, ""Please don't think I'm not happy for you cause I really am I just can't look at those pictures right now."" 

When I came back in he was being a bit short and cold with me. I could tell he was annoyed with me but I couldn't help that it set me off. He knows about what happened to my son and I tried to make it clear that I couldn't be happier for him but now things are a bit awkward. So..... AITA?

Dad didn't tell me to but he's been transparent with me about our financial state, which is basically that mum was the earner and before she left she did the bulk of the spending, so dad's money was their savings. She left a couple years ago and since then the savings have run out and dad's in overdraft. He said he's doing his best but he's spending more than he earns.

I asked to take a look at the budget, and his receipts, and we're spending way too much on food. Around £200 a week, give or take a score.

Sometimes they eat other meals, but at least 4 times a week we have to cook meals specifically for them while everyone else eats normally. There's also about £5 *a day* on bags of sweets, crisps, cakes, biscuits, stuff like that.

I sat with both of my younger brothers and dad and made a meal plan. With their help, I planned 30 days of meals, which included all of their favourites, and a large variety of meals that we all agree to. I did the same with the sweets/junk food.

I then broke the meal plan down to what ingredients we need for each meal and made a list of the first week of ingredients. I also added cereal, fruit, drinks and £5 of cakes, biscuits, crisps, sweets, all in multipacks. The multipacks totalled 5 cake bars, 5 packets of crisps, 11 bags of haribo, and tubes of bourbons, NICE biscuits, custard creams and malted milks. I said the multipacks were for the whole week, and if they couldn't make it last then I wouldn't replace them. The total cost was £86, versus the £200 dad usually spends per week.

I bought all of this on Saturday, with my money. Today is Tuesday. My brothers came to me saying all of the multipacks are gone so I need to replace them and tonight at dinner Bro1 wants pizza and Bro2 wants burgers. I said no. They've already had their favourites once this week and I said they had to make the multipacks last, it's not my fault they can't pace themselves and I'm not spending any more money on food this week.

Dad says that he will give me money to just go get them what they want, they're kids, it's just important they eat. I say that they will eat other food, they're just being picky. There is no reason for them to have this food specifically other than mum used to let them pick their own meals. Dad says I'm being an ass by not letting them just have what they want.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I want to say that there is no medical reason for this either. My boyfriend is autistic and there's certain foods he prefers and certain foods he straight up can't eat and if Bro1 or Bro2 had anything like that going on I'd bend over backwards to make sure they had their pizza/nuggets and burgers/hot dogs.

200,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

I’ve been dating a girl (we’ll call her Emily) for about 6 months now. We’re pretty serious and like each other a lot. We’re both 19.

About two years ago, my dad split up with my mum and has been dating around since, just testing the waters, which is fair.

However, I found out today that he has started to see the mum of Emily, and has been for a few weeks, and I’m fucking furious! He knew that it was her mum, and has still gone ahead with it. I’m so embarrassed by people thinking that I’m incestuous or shagging my stepsister, and think my dad has completely crossed the line here, and should have respected my relationship, but other adults are telling me that they’re older and can do what they want!

202,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I are atheist. Or I think we are. I don't know what term describes us but I've always used atheist. I firmly believe there is no God, my husband doesn't want to discount the possibility but admits it's unlikely. For what it's worth, my parents aren't in the picture but his are: they're nonpracticing Catholic.

We have a 3 year old. He and his family want to get him baptized and I'm against it. We're atheists, we don't follow any religion. His family understands this, is even accepting of it, but says it's not our place to choose how our child is raised.

They say we should do whatever we can do to enrich our child's life, which includes teaching them about religion or opening the door for religion if this is what our child wants to in the future. ""it's easier to get baptized now than find out \[the child\] wants to go to religious school later and can't because \[they're\] unbaptized"".

I am so vehemently against this, I'm putting my foot down. I don't want anything to do with anything religious. And I figured since my husband and I are both atheist, he'd have my back on this. He agrees with his parents. You can't just exclaim you're atheist, base your relationship on the shared ideal, then go back when it's inconvenient. It's all or nothing.

203,Not the A-hole,"I’ve known my friend Jack since we were in college, and we’re both in our late twenties now. We've always been close, we talk almost everyday and play badminton after work a couple of times a week with other friends. 

In May Jack started dating a girl named Dana. Jack often talked about her, but I didn’t meet her until last month because she’s doing her medical residency and doesn’t have a lot of free time. We didn’t really hit it off but she seemed nice enough. I didn’t see her again after that meeting but Jack would mention her from time to time. 

Then last weekend I was surprised to get a message from Dana. She said that for the past few weeks she and Jack have been arguing about the amount of time he spends talking to me, and asked me if I could distance myself from Jack while they try to work things out.

I talk to Jack for maybe three hours on days when we play (two hours in person and an hour of texting after the game) or we text for about two hours total on days when we don’t play, but I don’t think that’s an alarming amount of time to be talking to a close friend? And while it’s a simple thing to not to reply to Jack’s messages that much for the next few weeks, what am I supposed to do about badminton? Should I avoid Jack when we play or should I not go to the games at all?

I know that Dana just wants to work things out with Jack and thinks that me not being in the picture will help, that’s why she’s making this request. (Is she jealous of me? Does she just want more time with Jack? I have no idea.) But at the same time it doesn’t sit well with me that I have to adjust my social life to accommodate my friend and his girlfriend working out their issues. 

Part of me thinks I should just give this one to Dana because I really don’t want them to be fighting about me. But the other part feels that Jack is my friend here and not Dana, if he wants to talk to me and I want to reply to him then why shouldn't I, just because his girlfriend doesn’t want me to?",147,166,0.93

He went abroad for two weeks to Hong Kong for work and just kind of disappeared. He never came home. Or at least not until seven months later when he shows up like nothing has happened. He got caught up with some things and decided to live the carefree life in another country, working odd jobs, traveling, etc. A vagrant in every definition.

We've already decided not to get back together. I thought he was kidnapped or went missing for christ sake. I was single and didn't want him back. But that raised questions about the dog. I've cared for the dog for these seven months. I paid for its food, for grooming, vets. I had the dog more than he had at this point: the puppy was 5 months old but he only owned it for three weeks before his ""adventure"".

209,Not the A-hole,"  

Title is the short version, here’s the full story. My wife’s friend has been living in her mom’s house since the mother got married to a new husband and moved to his house, paying part of the mortgage to make it possible to not have to sell. A few months ago, the step-dad became rapidly sick and died. Now that she is without the supplemental income, the mother cannot afford to keep two homes, and will be “selling” the house to her son (wife’s friends brother), and needs to be moved out since he doesn’t want to share a home. When they spoke about this a few months ago, they talked about moving her in with us, even making up a chart of expenses and income (I notice it did not include the friend in any of the income). I honestly did not think anything of this since I really thought this would just be a bad idea that would fall to the wayside like so many others. Come time for the announcement of when she needs to be out by, and they are being serious. I had to tell my wife that I don’t want them moving in, for numerous reasons (I’ll specify below), and she has a meltdown. I ended up having to get family involved just to get her to understand exactly WHY this is a bad idea. My wife, ever the bleeding heart, eventually understands, but is still trying to help out however she can.

Here is where the problems come in, the friend had made absolutely no plans AT ALL to move anywhere else, because they assumed it was settled that they would live in our dining room. I can understand her being upset with me, but to be honest I never said yes to this, I simply humored their ideas (again, I never expected it to come to fruition). I should have shot this down in the beginning, and openly admit fault for having to bring this up closer to crunch time, but I was not looking to start an argument over what I thought to be an imaginary scenario.

As to why I don’t want this to happen, that requires a little bit of backstory. Two years ago we allowed my wife’s cousin to stay with us. It was originally communicated to me that it would only be for a few months and he would be paying us to offset the increase in utilities. That turned into a year-and-a-half and I saw no payment of anything. He occasionally would get groceries, but only what he liked while ignoring our preferences. He was also confrontational, stubborn, disrespectful to my parents, argumentative, and easily manipulated my wife in agreeing with him on anything. The electric bill doubled, the water bill tripled, and the added cost of him living there became such an issue that we were nearly foreclosed on due to not being able to keep up payments. Needless to say, this does not make me want to let anyone else in to mooch off of us. Adding four more bodies to the mix will mean even higher bills. That is only part of if though, and the character limit won’t let me go into detail.

Please, no judgement on the wife. She’s a bleeding heart and easily convinced to make bad choices when someone near her is in distress.",73,68,0.88
210,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé and I planned a month-long trip abroad this summer and needed to do something about our car. Family friend (Beth) of 20+ years wanted to borrow it in exchange for paying half of a 1-month garage bill (half of ~$500) because her son is in a psych hospital a few hours away, she visits him often but spends a lot on rentals. It seemed like a good deal and a nice thing to do for a close family friend. We left the car in the garage near her house (for her convenience, could have gotten a cheaper deal elsewhere) and we left on our trip. 

We don’t hear a word from her, so we assume all is well. She speaks to fiancé’s mom daily via text and sees her at least once a week. We get back from our trip and fiancé goes to get the car. Immediately he notices massive damage to the front and rear bumpers and a huge dent in the passenger side door. He calls her asking what happened and she says “Oh, you didn’t see my note?” Beth left a NOTE in the car which essentially said “Oops I got into 2 accidents, don’t worry I’ll pay the damages or your deductible, thanks for the car.” We were obviously taken aback and asked her why she didn’t say a word, to which she replied that she didn’t want to bother us on our vacation (during which we were completely reachable). 

The first accident (four days after we left) she was rear-ended in traffic, the other guy’s insurance is paying for that damage. The damage to the passenger door was caused when she hit a deer (10 days after the first accident), but there is no police report to verify this. We are concerned that our insurance will treat this as an at-fault accident, and we don’t want to submit a claim because our rates might go up. The damages are about $3700 in total. It would cost us $3000-6000 over time if our insurance went up 40-100% over the next 3 years (average rate increase). The insurance won’t give me specifics unless I submit a claim, but I don’t want to risk the premium increase. Had we known about the first accident we would have advised her to bring the car to the shop immediately instead of continuing to drive it. 

Beth says she doesn’t have the money for it. We say ok, give the shop the $2000 down payment for the parts and pay the rest when you have it. Nope, she can only afford $500, but if we foot the $1500 she can pay us back in 2-3 weeks. I say ok, if you sign a notarized promissory note which contains the amount you owe and how you are going to pay it back. Nope, she won’t sign anything. She has also been harassing the guys at the shop because of the price. We are probably going to have to take her to small claims court, which we really wanted to avoid.

Are we the assholes for not submitting the claim to our insurance? I know that I lent her the car and I am responsible for that decision, but I feel like we had no reason to believe that she would behave so irresponsibly and dishonestly.",32,46,0.92
211,Not the A-hole,"My friend and I, (25,F) found a two bedroom house and split everything 50/50. In time we both got boyfriends. Mine never really comes over to our house. Roommate's boyfriend is a disgusting human-being. Leaves trash and dishes lying around to get nasty and moldy, trashes the house, pees on the toilet seat and refuses to clean up after himself. I've been spending more and more time at my boyfriend's house so we decided to get a place together.

Roommate's whole attitude has changed since she started dating this guy. She used to be calm and level-headed but she's starting adopting her boyfriend's habit of getting angry and throwing tantrums when she doesn't get her way. And also adopting his nasty habits. Her room is disgusting, the bathroom is frequently disgusting, and she lets the kitchen overflow with her and her boyfriend's dishes. I've had to go out and buy my own dishes, cups, cutlery, cooking dishes, etch, because our other stuff has been ruined by the two. It's made living with her almost impossible, hence me spending less time

I mentioned to my landlord that I'd be moving because we were buying a place and he offered to sell the house I'd been renting to me. My boyfriend agreed so we put a down payment on the house and got the ball rolling. We sat roommate down and let her know we were buying the house but some changes would have to be made, regarding cleanliness and attitude. She flipped her lid and started screaming and carrying on about how we're discriminating against her because her boyfriend happens to be 1/2 hispanic, how we hate her, how we're trying to make her homeless, etc etc. We sat there and let her rant because trying to calm an irrationally angry person is mostly useless.

When she calmed down she said she was going to stay with her boyfriend for a while. She said she'd continue to honor her part of the rent but she didn't want to be around us. She said I was acting like a mother, telling her to clean her room, do the dishes, pick up after herself and she was sick it.

She was gone for several weeks and a couple days ago she sent me a text and told me she wasn't coming back, that she never really wants to see me anymore. She asked me to box up her things and put them outside, that they'd be coming by with a truck to get them. Begrudgingly my boyfriend and I spent the day packing her room and closet. It was mostly things like books, clothes, her TV and game equipment, because the house came with furniture.

We put everything on the curb as directed and went out for the day. Apparently while we were gone it rained. The Weather Channel gave a 30% chance of rain but it's been doing that all week with no sign of showers so I ignored it. I got a series of angry texts from her and the boyfriend because apparently it rained hair and all of her stuff got severely damaged. Apparently I should have put everything on the porch.

AITA here?

ETA: when I say porch it's not really so much a porch properly as it is stairs with a small landing under an aluminum shade. The landing is about 3 feet long by 2 feet wide in a straight line so there's not really even room for everything, half of her belongings would have still been totally exposed because they'd have to either be on the stairs on the walkaway surrounding the stairs. Not that it's an excuse or anything, just proper facts. Imagine the stair landing on the stairs that come with a trailer house.

INFO: her text message literally said leave everything on the curb because she didn't want to have to look for anything or go inside. So I did just that, left everything on the curb.",59,96,0.95
212,Asshole,"Background:

I live on the third floor of a small apartment building, and I keep a few bird feeders on my balcony. There is also a large tree right next to my balcony, which, recently, squirrels have been using to get to my bird seed.

Last week, the apartment gave me a notice about leaving out food for birds/wildlife. The notice stated that it was attracting ""rodents"" and that bird feeders were against apartment policy. I never saw anything about that when we toured or signed the lease, and other people in the complex keep bird feeders.

I wonder if my downstairs neighbor complained or something; he complained to me one day when I was sweeping that I was getting stuff on his balcony below. Since then, I have made a great effort not to get anything on his balcony when I'm cleaning out there, but the birds might still be dropping seeds or bothering him or something.

I really, really don't want to get rid of my bird feeders. Watching the birds brings me so much joy. I'm basically planning on moving them around to prevent seed from getting on the balcony below and switching to spicy bird seed to discourage the squirrels. 

So, am I a selfish asshole?

Edit: thanks everyone for the feedback!! I think I knew in my heart I was the asshole. The notice asked me to have the feeders down by next week, so I'll use that time to say my goodbyes to the birdies. Thanks everyone for knocking some sense into me!",35,29,0.89
213,Not the A-hole,"Background info: My sister has a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old. In January 2018, she told my family that she was pregnant with a third. She was over the moon, and she found out a few weeks later that the baby was going to be a boy. She publicly announced when she was 12 weeks pregnant, and miscarried in March at 14 weeks pregnant.

She was devastated by the loss. We arranged a full funeral, and she buried the remains in a cemetery. The headstone has the baby’s name and “birth date”, and she visits every week to put flowers on the grave. She joined a support group for parents who have lost a child.

In the last year and a half, all family events and celebrations have incorporated a celebration of her son’s “life”. We all visited the cemetery on his due date last September to commemorate him. At Thanksgiving and Christmas, she set aside a little plate of food for him at the table and we visited the grave after dinner. She posts pictures on Facebook all the time of her two living children next to the grave, and captions it “my three babies”.

His due date is coming up again this month, and she’s already organizing a celebration at the cemetery for his “first birthday”. I’ve dutifully gone along to all the other events, but this time I told her I wasn’t willing to go. I tried to be gentle, but I ended up telling her that I think she’s clinging to her grief and it isn’t healthy.

She’s incredibly angry at me. She’s accusing me of invalidating her grief, and that I never cared about her son anyway. She said that he’s her child and part of the family, and that she’s incredibly hurt that I don’t want to celebrate his life. She hasn’t spoken to me since I told her I wasn’t going.

I don’t know what to do. I care about her grief, and I get that having a miscarriage is a truly devastating event. But I also don’t want to spend the rest of my life having to pay homage to a dead “child” that was the size of an orange. I mean... at 14 weeks you don’t even need a surgical abortion, they’ll just let you take a pill and miscarry at home. I don’t want to have to go to a cemetery multiple times a year and listen to eulogies for a 14-week-old fetus for the rest of my life.

I also think this focus on the dead “sibling” has to be unhealthy for her two living children. I’m not going to tell her how to parent, but I also feel that I’m doing them a disservice by continuing to enable this kind of behavior. I don’t want every family celebration to be focused on their dead “brother”. She can do whatever she wants on the due date, but I don’t want to play a part in it.

AITA? I don’t want to hurt my sister, but I’m getting really concerned about how she’s grieving a year and a half later.

EDIT: Some people have written that I’m an asshole for what I’ve written here, particularly around how early the miscarriage was. I will not edit the post, but I hear you and will be more careful. Please be assured, though, that I have never said anything dismissive about it to my sister (unless you count the conversation I asked about as dismissive)

I’m enormously relieved that most people don’t think I’m an asshole. I certainly don’t want to be. But it’s not a situation I have a lot of prior experience with, and I’ve found it really difficult to navigate. So thank you for the input.",796,6437,0.97
214,Not the A-hole,"Two years ago, when I was 19, my widower father got remarried and bought a new house with his new wife. New wife, who seemed perfectly nice before the move, proceeded to get pretty control freak-y over the house.  Even though it was significantly larger than our old loft, with 5 bedrooms, sunroom, library, etc. etc., my brother and I, both in college and living at home while on break, no longer had rooms of our own. We would be allowed to ""visit"" as ""adult guests,"" but this accompanied by a whole host of rules for when and how long we would be there, when we could use the kitchen, etc., that had never been there before. Obviously not happy with any of this, but fine, I can deal.

But here's where the situation become untenable: a few months into their move to the new house, I discovered that she had decided that our beloved family cats would be permanently confined to the partially finished basement. She's obsessed with keeping the rest of the house spotless. Said cats  had always had the run of our old home (except kitchen counters) and slept with my dad, brother, or I every night. They are very snuggly, human-dependent cats. Now their only human contact would be the couple hours (at most) a day that my dad would spend down there.  My brother and I were horrified and tried to argue against this, to no avail. I've decided to take the cats with me as soon as I graduate and have a more stable living situation. In the meanwhile, for the past two years, my brother and I have been letting the cats out and hanging out with them upstairs every time we're visiting and our dad and his wife are out. Before they get back, we always put the cats back downstairs and use a lint roller wherever they were snuggling (mostly on top of us, lol) and just generally try to make sure there's no mess. This was all working pretty well, until my dad came home early one day and found me with a cat in my lap. It led to a massive fight, with lots of tears (mostly on my side). I ended up apologizing to keep the peace (and because I've always been a goody-two shoes daddy's girl, and don't really know how to deal with my first-ever major rule violation), but I was left feeling pretty upset and unsatisfied. They're acting like I'm a spoiled brat, but I feel like they're being pretty heartless towards my brother, my cats, and me.

Which of us is right here? AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: A little more info based on people's comments: 

No, neither my stepmom nor anyone else who spends time at the house has allergies, and she has never given it as a reason. It's exclusively because she wants the house spotless. To give you an idea of the kind of rules she has instituted, one of them is that no one can take sugar from the jar to put in their coffee, not because this has ever caused a mess before, but because she's worried about the potential for future mess. 

Also yes, I'm aware that this is their home and not mine (she's made that quite clear!) which is why, as previously mentioned, this is the only rule I've ever broken, even though I consider most of the others quite ridiculous as well. I'm fine with dealing with them when I'm the only one affected.

And no, I don't think that the way the cats are being treated is outright abuse, but how would you feel if you spent 8 happy years with plenty of sunshine, space to run around, and companionship, and then were suddenly confined to a much smaller dark and dusty space, and left alone for 22-24 hours most days?",38,34,0.91

216,Not the A-hole,"So my brother is 11 and we have different dads, different last names etc. My dad isnt in my life and never has been. Ive never met him. He held me when i was born then dipped. My mom married when i was in first grade and i got a brother and a sister. My brother is nearly 12 and he knows i dont like my stepdad and that we dont get along. He doesnt know we arent related. 

He knows we dont have the same last name and stuff but we just told him it was because our dad and my mom werent married when i was born. My brother and i are super close despite the 7 year age gap. He tells me everything. 

So one night in my room we were playing video games together and it got brought up in conversation. It rarely comes up so i told him i wanted to tell him something, that it was very important and that he couldn't tell anyone. I explained to him that he is my stepdad, and that ive never met my real dad. I explained to him we are still the same and still brother and sister and that it doesnt make a difference. He told me that all makes sense and he wouldnt tell anyone. 

It was all good and it felt good to tell him as i never talk about the situation to anyone. Yesterday i told my mom that i told him and she got livid. She told me it was not my place whatsoever, and that he was way to young to hear about that. She said i was completley out of line and its her job not mine. I told my mom that shes hardly told me anything about the other side of my family so thats not fair and he had a right to know. Its about me and not her. But shes so mad. Shes always been super sensitive on the topic of my dad and gets so emotional about it that i never ask anymore even though i strongly want to meet the other side of my family 

I havent talked to her about it but now that i think about it, it is her son and if she thinks he shouldn't have known then maybe he shouldnt have known. I think he is fine. He isnt scarred or sad or confused. I felt like he was plenty old and mature. We tell each other everything anyway. But did i go too far?

218,No A-holes here,"My daughter is 11, and I've been letting her become a bit more independent recently. Just little stuff, not hounding her so much about remembering to do homework, letting her go to the local deli unsupervised, things like that. I make sure that if she fails, the consequences aren't too drastic. Forget your homework and get in trouble? It sucks, but it's not end of the world and she can try harder next time.

I've also been talking to her about maintaining friendships without me helping out so much. In a couple of years she'll be in high school, and if she wants to keep all her old friends she'll have to put in some effort to stay in touch. Stuff like remembering birthdays and special dates. It's basic stuff, but it's important and easy to forget to do. My birthday was around a week ago, and I thought it would be an interesting challenge to see if she would remember. I want to make very clear, she knows when my birthday is, and I dropped a couple of reminders in the month leading up. Still, I didn't outright ask her when she wanted to go shopping for some presents, I just dropped the hints and left it up to her.

It was very obvious in the days leading up that she had forgotten, and I was super tempted to gently nudge her in the right direction. I decided however to let her forget, just so she could learn the lesson I had been trying to teach her. She quickly realized on the day when my brother called and wished me a happy birthday, and it hurt her quite a lot to know she had forgotten. There were tears involved and lots of hugging and apologies.

I've spoken to her now quite indepthly and made sure she knows that I'm not upset about it or angry with her, I was just trying to teach her about taking some initiative in her relationships. A large amount of me knows what I did was unconventional, but in the end it all worked out and it's unlikely she will forget another important birthday. But part of me thinks I might have been an asshole and should have just reminded her one more time. I mean, I knew she was going to forget and be upset yet I still let it happen.

219,Not the A-hole,"Hello, 

I'm from Europe & English is not my first language, so please no judgment on spelling.

This story is about a conflict between Me, my Brother and Sister are having now it all started a bit over a year ago, so some background on this:

I've come from A poor family, and although we were quite poor my parents were able to buy quite a large house and have 2 cars. While in HS & University I used to do some side jobs fixing cars & homes to earn some money to live. During that time I've acquired skills on how to do stuff and had bought a lot of tools. Since graduating I have worked hard on my career and bought a flat in a city near to my parents. My Father is on disability & my Mother is working on a minimum wage and needs a car to commute to work.

Fast forward to a year ago. My brother & sister have moved overseas for a better career. Since my parents were having a hard time with the little money they had, we had an agreement. Both my brother & my Sister would send about 100€ each month to my parents to make their life easier and I would do some upkeep on the house and help out with fixing cars. This was my offer as during this whole time I had quite a lot of expenses, and I thought that I'll save some money for Me & my Parents.

Over the last year, my siblings were paying to my parents. In total about 1500€ each. Over that time I've renovated a 15 sqm balcony (it was literally falling apart, and it took me 8 days to do), changed the floor & installed heated floor in the 15 sqm kitchen (4 days of work), before doing this stuff I've got a quote for them, and it was over 3000€ for work. Also done quite a lot of upkeep on the cars like changing oil, filters, brakes & other small stuff. 

Fast forward to this summer, my Brother & Sister returned to visit parents for the summer and complained to me that I have done nothing in the time and that I should pay my parents same amount as them.

AITA for declining to pay & saying that the work I've done is worth more than they paid?

Edit: I did not pay for any materials that were used to make those repairs, most of them were bought with the money my Brother & Sister paid, with permission from the parents",32,36,0.85

221,Not the A-hole,"On the weekend my parents went out to the liquor store to stock up on some wine and alcohol for the week. I went with my mom because I just finished my last university final exam of the semester on Friday so I was bored and didn’t have anything else to do lol. Anyways I’d had a rough semester but just found I passed (with at least a B) all my classes so I was damn proud. I decided to treat myself to a bottle of champagne ($22 for a 750mL so expensive but not terribly so). My mom took it from me at the checkout and said she would buy it for me and share it since I worked so hard this semester and I was pretty thankful and happy for that. 

Anyways we got home and she put the stuff my brother had asked her to get for him outside his door with a note saying how much everything was. When my brother later came up and saw us drinking champagne he asked if we could have some and my mom said well no it’s your sisters. He asked if I paid for it. I said no mom bought it as a treat for me after exams. He got really mad and asked why he had to pay mom back for alcohol when I didn’t and stormed off because I wouldn’t let him have champagne. 

I feel kind of bad, not for not letting him have champagne but for letting my mom pay for me, even if it was a treat. Should I have insisted I pay if I wasn’t gonna let him have any? AITA?

Edit: I don’t know if ages help but my brother is 30 and I’m 19. The drinking age in my country is 18 though so I legally could have just bought it myself.",48,74,0.86
222,Not the A-hole,"This is something i truely feel conflicted about and i really dont know if im being an asshole here. I apologize that this is so long but i feel like theres just alot of info i need to explain. Tldr at bottom.

My fiance has aspergers and because of this he has certain triggers on things that he cant handle that cause him alot of stress and anxeity and if things get severe enough he'll completely shut down and become despondent and closed off. Those episodes have happened a few times in the 2yrs we've been together.

He has to have things on a routine. He doesnt respond well to suprises and asks for notices if there is goinf to be company or some kind of big change going on, etc. If he is suprised by something he has to back off and go to our room or the computer room to take time to adjust to suprise before comming out and being social or w/e.

Well a few days to almost a week ago my brother and his 3 toddlers, all under the age of 5, have been staying with us and are supposed to be with us for about 2 weeks because he hasnt been working and hasnt been able to pay his rent.

I did NOT want him there and my fiance didnt either we made this very clear to my mother because my brother is not a good person to live with. He doesnt respect other peoples property or house rules, hes nasty dirty and leaves cigarette butts every where, and doesnt mind his kids, also fiance and brother dont get along anyway.

So theyve been there for several days now and my fiance has become increasingly agitated and annoyed to the point he doesnt even want me around him. When hes home he completely stonewalls and shuts down. He's been staying gone longer and longer until this morning everything comes to ahead. He's packed up all of his important belongings and told me that he cant stay here anymore that hes so agitated and stressed that he's even considering breaking up with me. He doesnt want to but thats where his head is at right now.

I understand and were going to discuss things at a later date. 

I go to my mom and brother and tell them whats happened. I said we both didnt want him there to begin with because of how he is and that its to much and everyone is stressed out and we're family, so imagine how he feels added with his autism on top of it. I said that if he winds up breaking up with me im moving out. I also said that if he decides not to move back in and wants the 2 of us to go somewhere on our own, im moving out.

My brother started cussing him and calling him every nasty name in the book, that we're family and family should help each other out. My mom is just making all about her and whats going to happen to her how can i threaten to leave her.

So AITA for choosing my fiance over family?

TL;DR: my fiance packed up and left to stay with friends because he's autistic and cant handle my brother and his 3toddlers staying with us for 2weeks and i am siding with him

EDIT INFO: We do live with my mom. Back in january she asked me and my fiance to move in with her in order to help her keep her home as she could no longer afford it on her own as the rent was raised to high. We all split the bills equally 3 ways.",187,713,0.93

225,META,"# 60 Minute Contest Mode is here to stay! 

We are happy to announce that after our several weeks of beta testing and internal discussions, we've decided to keep the 60 minute contest mode. [You guys voted as well](https://i.imgur.com/U1WPowH.png) and strongly supported this 60-minute mode. 

So if you're interested to read, we have a few FAQ below: 

**What is Contest Mode?**

> In short, when a thread is active in Contest Mode, it means the comments will be shown to you in a random order. You will also see that the score is hidden. The order is random every time, and random for everyone, and it will change each time you visit the thread. Contest Mode hides the popularity of each comment. 

> We are implementing a 60-Minute Contest Mode, meaning for the first 60 minutes after every thread is created, the thread will stay in Contest Mode. 

---

**Why does /r/AmItheAsshole use contest mode?**

> Reddit in general has the problem of rewarding people for commenting first. If you're first to a thread, you usually have a higher chance of being the top-voted comment. /r/AmItheAsshole uses top comments to assign thread judgment flairs (YTA, NTA, or other), as well as user flairs (your title ranking and points). As a result, people have been lurking on the New section of this subreddit and posting short replies. 

> We don't want to reward people just for posting first. We want to reward people who put effort and thought into their comments. A long comment isn't always better, but generally they can mean more. This doesn't mean we want to punish short comments; there are plenty of short comments that are perfect for the thread. We just want to make sure that our users upvote a comment for the right reasons, rather than just being first. 

> [We performed a beta test with some statistics](https://i.imgur.com/7Aa8cfp.png) and saw that there have been significant improvements to the overall commenting time. You now have a more equal chance of getting top comment, without having to constantly monitor threads. This doesn't solve the problem entirely, but we did what we could to mitigate it as much as possible. 

---

**Has Contest Mode improved the sub?** 

> In short, yes. We have seen an increase in overall comment activity, an improvement in comment quality, less 3-word comments, etc. Most people have expressed their love for this new mode. 

----

**Why can't I see replies in the first hour while browsing from my app?** 

> There is currently a known bug that affects Official Reddit App users only. When you click on a comment directly and it takes you to the thread, you cannot see the button for ""View All"". You are only able to see the comment you clicked on, and the thread where the comment is posted. 

> This issue lies with Reddit administrators - we have no control over the functionality of the Reddit App. Even moderators cannot see it. There is one workaround: See below: 

1. [You can see the bug here. I clicked on my own comment in the previous thread and I see nothing because of contest mode. I'm a mod too and even I can't see it.](https://i.imgur.com/iKIrVlQ.png) 
2. [When contest mode is no longer active (after 1 hour), everything is resolved](https://i.imgur.com/HrYjZg1.png) 
3. [To find a workaround, scroll to the thread (not the comment) and click on the OP's name](https://i.imgur.com/ELz9ItG.png)
4. [Finally, click on the thread from the OP's profile](https://i.imgur.com/Je1MHsN.png) 

> This is an annoying workaround, but the only known solution. We decided to keep contest mode despite this bug because it affects a small portion of people (Official Reddit App users only) and it only affects them for 1 hour. We also have seen no decrease in comment activity. 

> If this affects or annoys you, we do apologize. However, we think this change is important to the sub, so we hope you will work with us until Reddit fixes this bug.

227,Asshole,"I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

229,Asshole,"So my wife has a job right now she does not love, but does not necessarily hate either.  She is payed pretty well for it compared to the area and is taking advantage of the tuition reimbursement program while pursuing her masters degree.

A coworker of hers advised her to apply for a PRN position to supplement her income.  She currently works part time, so she has a few free days each week and was excited to pick up some extra shifts.  My wife went on the interview and everything went very well.

Yesterday she received a written offer for the job stating it was “PRN or part time”.  When she followed up with the recruiter, they told my wife that someone had recently been let go and they were desperately trying to fill the hole and wanted to bring her on for more than the previously discussed PRN role.  They offered her a nice pay bump over what she already makes, which is well above the average for our area as is.

I have always approached job offer as a business negotiation, so I advised my wife to tell them she already makes more money than that (when she doesn’t) and would need more in order to hop jobs.  Also, since she would need to pay back some of the tuition she has been reimbursed for, I told her to say she owes twice as much as she really does and that she needs that money in a sign-on bonus in order to get out of her current job.

My wife got pretty angry with me and said she wouldn’t do it and that I was a “terrible person” for telling he me to lie.  In my opinion, my wife was not actively trying to leave her current job, so she should be hardballing this new offer since she can easily walk away from it if they turn down what she asks for.

230,Not the A-hole,"I was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. At a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

As I was near, I rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

When she saw me coming near her she said “ don’t touch me I’m fine “, in a really agressive angry voice. 

I said ok, I just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied “ I dont need your help”, again super angry. 

I wasn’t the only one that got up and got closer to her, but I was the first one, cause I was sitting right by the restroom

Cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. Then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

She couldn’t help her alone, as the woman was quite big. So another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

The barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if I could help and I said “ I was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, I’m good”.

I kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

They all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

Am I the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

231,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because my bf is on reddit. On mobile, sorry for any formatting issues. 

About 3 years ago I was in a very short lived (3 months) relationship. I ended up breaking off the relationship and moving back to my hometown across the country. A year later I met my current bf who I have been dating for roughly 2 years and am very happy with. 

My ex boyfriend gave me a cute present before I left - a little glass heart bottle full of colorful origami stars he had made. He told me that every star had written inside it something he loved about me. I’ve always had horrible self esteem issues so this honestly meant a lot to me. I’ve never opened any of the stars to read them, I like to just look at the bottle and remind myself that it is full of reasons why someone loved me. To be clear there are no lingering feelings between me and my ex. We are still friendly with each other and keep in contact but are not close and do not talk regularly. My fondness of the bottle has naught to do with him and is purely about my own self confidence and the sentiment behind it. 

The reason I think I might be the AH is because I know if I found out my boyfriend kept something like this from his ex, I would be hurt. But I also know I am not a rational person (something I struggle with and have been working on) and I get upset easily. My bf is a very calm and rational person, and he has 0 jealousy issues. Again, the bottle’s importance to me has nothing to do with my ex and everything to do with reminding myself that I have value when I’m feeling down. My friend thinks I should just toss it because of who it came from but I haven’t been able to bring myself to get rid of it. 

AITA for keeping it? Should I just get rid of it? If I got rid of it WIBTA for reading the stars first?",42,39,0.9
232,Asshole," My mom is in her mid sixties while I’m in my late twenties. She and my dad didn’t have much growing up and when they had me and my sister, they spent what little they had to make sure we were taken care of. Even when things got better for us financially, she thought it was more sensible to save money for future needs than to splurge a bit and buy things for herself.

So now that I have a very stressful but well-paying job, I ‘spoil’ her by buying her things that I know she wants but never bought, such as fine jewelry. (She and my dad couldn’t even afford an engagement ring when they got together.) I have bought her several over the past few years; all of them are in the $3K-$7K range so they’re not the most expensive things, but my mom is always excited and happy to receive them. 

The last time I went home to visit her, my boyfriend came with me and was there when I gave my mom her third jewelry set. She was still excited and happy to receive it, but gently told me that going forward I should just save my money for my future family instead of buying her more jewelry. 

I assured her that I have separate budgets for my savings and for buying her jewelry. She said that she doesn’t want me to ‘waste’ more money on jewelry as the ones I bought for her are already enough, and it’s much more important save for the future. I answered that I don’t consider buying jewelry for her as wasting money since I know it makes her happy, and on the practical side, I’ll inherit the jewelry when she dies anyway. 

My mom laughed and said alright, and we went on with our day. But later that night when it was just me and my boyfriend, he told me that he was shocked that I would say something like that to my mom and that he doesn’t think I should say things like that again because it’s like telling my mother that I expect to ‘regain’ all the jewelry I gave to her when she dies. And that’s unfair because we don’t know what she might want to do with the jewelry, if she might want to give some to my sister or to my cousins. 

I told my boyfriend that knowing my mother, she would likely leave the jewelry to me and my sister, but if she also decides to give some to my cousins then I have no problem with that because they’re my sister and my cousins (who I am also very close to). I guess she could also donate all of them to charity if she wants, and I’d also have no problem with that. 

But realistically I just find it hard to believe that she would choose to leave the jewelry I gave her to people other than me and my sister. My mother’s whole life has been about working and saving money to make sure that she can provide the best life she can for us, I don’t see how or why that would change and she would decide to leave most of the thousands of dollars worth of jewelry I bought for her to other people. And that’s why I said that I’ll inherit the jewelry when she dies anyway.",44,39,0.76
233,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone!

So, me (M24) & my gf (F25) have been together for just over 3 years. We've been having sex using both condoms & the pill because we figured condoms long term probably aren't effective enough on their own, & i thought it would be unfair if she had to shoulder the whole burden of b.c. by herself (i know condoms are nothing compared to b.c. symptoms but it's the only thing i can really do)

So a couple of months ago she had been side effects from her pill that she'd never really had before, so i suggested that she could just stop it & i could have a vasectomy instead. I've talked about it a little with her before (not much though) but it has always been something in the back of my mind because it just seemed... easy to be honest.

She said she agreed with the stopping b.c. but she didn't want me to get a vasectomy. I asked her why (we've both said we're not really into kids) & she said she might change her mind about having a kid. I have already a BUNCH of stored sperm in a clinic (something personal happened a few years ago too much detail to go into but basically was told by doctors to store a bunch if i wanted any because it might not be fertile for long after) anyways, thankfully I'm still fertile & told her i could freeze even more so we could have plenty to work with but she was still adamant about me not getting it. It's even also sometimes reversible & even if all of that  failed we could still adopt a cute as hell kid. There's literally no reason i can see why & whenever i ask she just says she doesn't wanna regret letting me to do this

I know lots of people are probably thinking that i just cant be bothered to wear condoms anymore but thats really not it, 1. they don't even affect how sex feels that much & 2. it's more about me worrying about an accidental pregnancy. my gf has always been adamant she would have an abortion because she really doesn't want kids atm (which either way, keep it or not, i would obviously completely support btw) but i dont want her to have to go through that

Obviously im NOT just gonna sneak a quick snip & not tell her, but would i really be that much of an asshole if i just tell her that i'm just going to get it done end of story? I'd be heartbroken if that made her want to end our relationship (obviously i wouldn't hold it against her though because if it bothers her that much she's entitled to that) & i REALLY hope it doesn't but... I honestly just feel like a dog on a leash, but it really bugs me that she is not even considering what i want at all. Part of me thinks this might be about her maybe thinking that if i have it done i might be like less of a man or something, at the same time that just seems absolutely stupid, but honestly there is nothing else i can think of why it's bothering her so much i just wish she would talk to me.

235,Not the A-hole,"10 years ago I fostered a litter of kittens. After one had some health problems that required me to essentially hold him near constantly, I bonded with him and asked my mom if I could adopt him. She gave me a big speech about how it was MY cat and MY responsibility and that I would take him with me when I moved out to go to college. I agreed, and she later said she was going to keep a different kitten. I gave her the same speech that it was HER cat and HER responsibility etc. She agreed. 

&#x200B;

A year later I move out and she makes me take both cats. Nbd I'm still in the same town and I have the room and my roommates don't mind. I give her a little shit for making me take her cat too, as that wasn't the deal, but in the end I take both. Awhile later, due to outside circumstances, I end up moving out of town on short notice. After I quit my jobs, give up my room, and drop out of school I'm told suddenly that I can't bring one cat, much less two. I work it out with my mom and she agrees to take them until I can move to a new place in about a year (when the lease is up). In that year, I get engaged and move in with my husband, who LOVES cats but is allergic. He says he doesn't mind if we take my cat because he knows how much he means to me. We visit my mom and my husbands eyes are swollen shut and he's wheezing the whole time we're there, even in parts of the house the cat isn't allowed. He still wants to take my cat. We decide to move to a big enough place that the cat will have their own section of the house and he will have his so that he can still breathe in his own home. This is when my mom tells me I need to take both cats again. I tell her no, and that her cat is not my responsibility. She argues that they're siblings and they'll be miserable without each other. We fight about this for months, in the end she refuses to give me my cat unless I take hers too, so I take neither. 

&#x200B;

Awhile later we move across the country and into a small studio apartment. Her cat dies from a birth defect. She now wants me to take my cat back. However, now we no longer have the space for my cat, because we literally live in a single room studio, my husband would be swollen and wheezy all the time. We plan on moving soon with a friend, who isn't super into the idea of living with a cat but says it's fine if we want to bring him. At this point it's been 10 years, we live all the way across the country (my mom refuses to fly with the cat and wants us to drive all the way back to CA from VA to pick him up) my husband is allergic, I've now been away from my cat nearly three times as long as I had him and while I still miss him, the sting of not having him with me all the time has finally faded and I feel like I've moved on in a way. I don't think it's fair to have my husband in the same house as something he's that allergic to.  


AITA if I don't want to take my cat?

Edit: Thanks everyone for the comments, I'm reading all of them even if I dont respond. I'd just like to clear some stuff up that I covered in some comments but will post here to keep from repeating.

- My mom is a good pet owner, and has treated the cats wonderfully. They're spoiled to hell. The long hair is brushed frequently and I'm sent videos daily of him playing with my mom.

- I do financially support the cat(s). I pay ""child support"" and all vet bill(s) for both of them.

-  The first time I moved away without taking him. I had about two days warning before I would either be homeless with my cat, or move without him.

- My cat is currently healthy. He had some problems as a baby like many kittens do, but he has recovered fully and has not had any real health problems since.

-I did try to take my cat back after meeting my husband. We specifically got a place big enough for him. My mom refused to let me take him unless I took both, and there was already a cat (roommates) with us and it wasnt quite a big enough space for 3 cats.",62,96,0.87
236,Not the A-hole,"I (20F) have an older brother. He's 13 years older than me. My mother had him with her first husband, then divorced, met my dad when my brother was 6-7, and then they had me when he was 13-14. We all still live together.

My brother is kinda introverted and he doesn't speak to the rest of us much. He mostly talks to our mom. He has a few friends but doesn't go out much (like once a month maybe) and spends his time mostly playing starcraft, reading manga/comics, watching movies/shows/anime. He does have a job but only for a few months now (this used to be a problem in our home bc he was 30+ and unemployed, never did any chores or anything really, just sat in his room and played games).

Now we never really got along. Since I was a kid I was aware that his parents are divorced and tried to be his friend but it never worked. He's just a closed person. Our only interaction would be me trying to be nice and then him kicking me/tearing my stuff up and then laughing if I cry or something and at one point I just got tired if the whole thing and stopped having a reaction to his attempts to enrage me. Then one day I was applying for a scolarship and needed a document from him, my mom actually asked him for his ID (we only needed a copy) and he threw a fit and stopped talking to me.

I asked my friends for advice on how to stop this silence between us, but they started shouting at me (one of them has divorced parents) of how we are horrible towards him. How he doesn't have a family and I do, blah blah blah. 
I really dont feel like he is in any was having a horrible time here. My father maybe wasn't the best step dad but he tried a lot. We ALWAYS tried to make him feel included but he just doesn't want to be included. Same goes for his social interactions.. he's fine with havig just 3 friends. And like, I get it that some people might think there's something deeply wrong with him but I swear he is one very stable and happy person. He just doesn't need a lot for happiness. He just has a couple bad traits. Like he's very lazy and immature and kind of a mamma's boy. 

The point is that people are pressuring me into trying to build a relationship with him, and I would like for that to happen its just I don't want to do the work. I tried to befriend him for 17 years but he was always a stranger to me. If he decided to stop talking with me, he should break the silence.

I also wouldn't like him too close because I don't want him living with me one day. I dont want to be mom no. 2. If he showed that he can take care of himself (which he can, but doesn't want to) I would be totally fine. I just don't want to be taken advantage of.",29,96,0.89

I told my husband and he became furious. He just kept saying it's  a ""stupid idea"" that I'm not going to make any money, and that the work is ""beneath me."" Suddenly hes classist. 

He said he doesnt want me to deal with strangers at their homes. He also said that I will never succeed because I am not a professional. He said it would be different if I was doing this for years and decided to create my own business.

Occasionally we'll see each other in the hall or she'll pull me into her office to talk about family business and then pry into personal matters. I.E. dating and religion and then getting visibly and verbally upset when my answers aren't what she wants.  I've told her before that we can talk about these things when we're not at work, surrounded by co-workers and superiors.

This has moved on from just those matters now and has gone into commenting on my posture when I walk (walk with purpose, you look lazy...at 5 am.) and grabbing my stomach and telling me I'm getting fat in front of other co-workers.

Her friend, who lives in the same setup nearby, is over constantly. They wait until 9-10 PM to cook dinner and talk loudly throughout. The house is a square, there is no hallway, no way to get ""away"" from the kitchen noise. Kitchen and living room noise happens on the exact opposite side of the wall from my bed.

I sleep early to wake up and work out. (When I do so, I am hyper-aware of noise and light and try to sneak out since I know she's sleeping.) I've told her this, and asked her if she and her friend can strive to be quiet after 8 PM, since I usually go to bed around 8:45-9 PM. She says ""Yes, no problem"" but the next night they're slamming drawers in the kitchen at 10:45 PM again.

I've just checked my lease and *all* guests at any time are only allowed with permission of the other housemate and it explicitly says that sleep, privacy, and study time takes precedent over housemates having guests. I *could* simply tell her her friend is *never* welcome in the house, but I obviously don't want to be an unreasonable bitch about it.

241,Everyone Sucks,"First off, I'm heterosexual, but I am removing gender where possible to normalize/filter sexist or gender biased responses. We'll see how that works out.

First off, I'm very lucky. I know that. My 18 month old child is happy and healthy. While I'm in the process of starting not one but two technology start ups; both my mother and my mother in law have graciously offered to split babysitting for no charge until we enroll our child in daycare.

My partner, while claiming to be appreciative has taken to being quite a drill sergeant (imo) with how child care should be administered by both of the grandma's. There has been a fair share of arguing and contention at various points in the last 12 months over how our child should be fed, put to bed, play, you get the picture... I guess I'm a little bit more lax in that if our child is happy, healthy and fed, I'm generally not going to complain unless there's a risk of some form of danger.

Fast forward to this morning. My partner has a gripe with my mother over what time and how our child is being put to bed. As you can imagine, this is not the first time this is happening, and in the strictest interpretation (regardless of what they might be) my mother has actually been following the 'rules and guidelines' set out. When my mother walked through the door this morning, my partner decided to promptly yell ""hello"" (short and kurt) and within seconds then proceeded to yell and demand from another room about twenty feet away ""This evening when I get home, we (my mother and my partner) need to sit down and discuss (my child)'s sleeping methods and timing"".


Now, in my opinion, even if this grievance needed to be aired, it didn't need to be done in this fashion. Not in the second sentence communicated for the morning, not by yelling from one room to another, not to the person who is graciously taking care of our child for the rest of the day after a one hour commute each way without pay.

In turn, I quickly responded yelling back asking my partner ""When are you going to grow up!?"".

My partner is threatening to take our child and sleep at 'home' (parents house) tonight as a result. I think this is way overblown and my partner was way out of line and needed to be put in (their) place.

245,Not enough info,"I’m currently backpacking with my partner, and we got caught in a bit of a bind a few months ago. I contacted a lady who owned a hostel and she said we could move in and I could work to pay for our accommodation. It’s advertised as a Backpackers hostel, but really it’s a half way house. There are around 100 permanent residents, many of which have just gotten out of prison, and/or are full blown drug addicts. For the first three weeks, I worked every day without a day off. I’d clean toilets, showers, kitchens, rooms, and work on the reception every day. It’s very important to note that I was paid cash in hand weekly, WELL BELOW minimum wage. 

After three weeks, I asked her if I could have a few less shifts the following week so I could look for a job. She didn’t like this at all and her whole demeanour changed from that point on. She’d give me three or four shifts a week, if I was lucky. She’d shout at me or talk to me like a moron constantly. I could handle that. 


What I couldn’t handle, was the rampant taking and selling of hard drugs on the property, fist fights and parties til five in the morning, and the police showing up three times a week. I was a member of staff who would have to deal with it all. She didn’t live on the premises so it didn’t affect her. Her ex husband does, but he would shut his phone off and not answer his door if things escalated. Then, after having no sleep, I would have to clean shit stained toilets and clean crack spoons out of people’s rooms. I eventually asked to be taken off rooms altogether because I found heroin needles in someone’s sheets. She was livid I asked.


On Friday I quit. On Saturday night I watched a man shoot up ice in the car park. 



But Sunday was the last straw for me. A permanent resident was getting fucked up, fighting people all night and smashing the place up. I then found out that he’s had his baby locked in his room alone all weekend. I took the baby and changed her, fed her, and kept her company. She showed signs of severe neglect. Dad beat the fuck out of an old man and was arrested. The police took the baby at 4am. I find that she has not kicked him out. A month earlier, a troubled young woman accused another older member of staff of being excessively inappropriate with her. This is the second girl to do this in six months. This poor woman was served an eviction notice at seven the next morning, but she won’t kick out this crackhead? This member of staff is also still there, because “he works the hardest”. 


Yesterday my boyfriend and I packed our bags and left. We told no one and moved into a friends place. The issue is, we owe her rent ($300 approximately). AITA for making absolutely no attempt to pay this? I really don’t feel like she deserves it as she paid me so little, was so disgusting to people who didn’t do as she ordered, and it’s also partly a fuck you for everything she has or hasn’t done about all of these issues and more.",144,470,0.94
246,Not the A-hole,"My fiance (32m) and I are in the middle of planning our wedding and having some disagreements over who to invite. He has this large group of friends and all the girlfriends have gotten super close over time. We all make plans to go out together and have all been invited to other friends weddings. 

One girl in our group is with a guy we'll call Liam, Liam is a really nice guy, fun to be around but can sometimes be too much when drinking. Liam is with a girl we'll call Lucy. Lucy is a really toxic person, is horrible to Liam, constantly fights with friends when out and always starts drama with someone. At the moment Liam and Lucy are no longer together but no doubt will be back together as they do this all the time. As Lucy is currently single she expects all the girls to drop everything to be there with her to go drinking. Most of the couples have kids and obviously puts them before drinking. She gets mad when they wont go drinking, if they have plans with their partners and wont do something with her, if they have plans with work friends or anything else they may be doing that doesnt include her. She sends nasty voice messages and texts to whoever wont go somehwere with her. She has fought with all of us, has been thrown out of places for threatning to throw glasses at us and fighting with security.

I wouldn't personally consider her a friend, we dont talk outside the group, we have had past problems where shes insulted my mother and sisters. We see each other nearly everyday (we live in the same town and i work in the local shop) and we always blank each other. She will talk and text my partner, he does speak to her but only when he sees her outside.

255,Asshole,"My girlfriend wants me to go to a friends wedding with her but I don't want to go. I don't want to go because:

1. The wedding is 45 minutes away and my GF can't drive so I would have to meaning I can't drink. This wouldn't be a big deal but since I don't know anyone there I feel like it wouldn't be very fun sober.
2. It is on the 31st and she hasn't RSVP'd yet. I don't know much about weddings but I feel like we are too late at this point.
3. I work that day. She wants me to trade a shift which might be possible but I don't want to go through that effort.
4. When ever we hang out in a group setting (either with my friends or hers) she doesn't talk and just sits there quietly. This makes it awkward for me especially when I don't know anybody because she isn't talking and I don't want to talk to a bunch of people I don't know and will never see again.
5. Last year she came to a wedding with me and while I was trying to hang out with the people there she kept trying to get me to go hang out with her alone. I Obviously didn't want to do this as I went to the wedding to hang out with friends I hadn't seen in a while, but she just wanted to spent time with me alone. When she asked me to go she brought up how she went to a wedding with me and asked if I would have wanted to go alone and I said yes because I was going to the wedding to hang out with the people there and not her. I told her that she could go alone and that if she just wanted me to come so that we could hang out one on one there then I didn't want to do that

Edit: I just woke up and don't want to reply to every comment individually so here are my thoughts. I do like my girlfriend and enjoy spending time with her, just not in social settings with a lot of people (especially if I don't know any of them). I told her she should invite the bride and groom out to dinner in a few weeks if she really wants to spend time with them and I would be happy to go. She said she wanted me to go because she might not know anyone else there besides them, meaning we both won't know anyone there and we probably won't be able to see the bride and groom much, because thats what everyone else there is there to do. I talked to my GF and she said that everyone was just publicly invited over FB so there is no need to RSVP. The 45 minutes is far because the wedding is later 6-9pm, and I don't really like driving at night. Uber/Hotel is going to be pretty expensive, and a bus will probably take 2 hours. I am fine not drinking but In a social situation where everyone else is, and where I don't know anybody I am just going to be uncomfortable the whole time. And when I said my girlfriend doesn't talk at all, I meant she talks minimally. Like she will introduce me and say very little, which leads to people I don't know asking me a bunch of questions. And thats not really enjoyable to me.

In that time I've been paying all of the utilities alone of course, €340 a month. During this time I've had adverts online to attract potential housemates, advertising the price of their part of the rent, plus €100 for utilities. With 4 people this is enough for utilities, and to save a little for things like washing machine breaking. 

The first few months very few responses came, but I responded to all. However when the school year started coming to a close, more responses came but I haven't been particularly well about responding. So I definitely se it as my responsibility that there are no others to divide utilities with. My little brother died, so I've been a bit messy in my head when trying to deal with things like that.

258,No A-holes here,"So wife and I now have a beautiful baby boy who is now about 3 month's old.  My MIL came to stay with us for about eight weeks (minus a few days where she had to go out of town) when he was born as she lives in a different state.

So the MIL left about a week ago to go back home and with the baby now being older and generally getting easier to manage I thought that we could finally get some space.  But it turns out that my wife wants her mum to come back and spend another month  with us as she says it is too difficult to manage with baby.

In terms of house chores I generally do most of the cooking when i get home (fairly early on most weekdays - by 4pm) and am also happy to look after baby when I'm around.  I am also able to work from home once or twice a week.  We also have hired help to do all the house cleaning and laundry twice a week.  My wife is thus able to focus most of her time in managing the baby.  Our son is a generally happy baby (but does of course have the occasional difficult day).

AITA for not wanting MIL to come back at this point?  I suspect that my wife may be suffering with some PPD anxiety and so she thinks she thinks her mum staying with us is an absolute necessity.  I've suggested that she speaks to a therapist but she has dismissed the idea.

Edit for more clarity: The space that I want is not so much personal space for myself, but rather space for us to be a family - this is obviously a new chapter in our lives and I just feel like we don't get to have any significant time to ourselves as a 2 plus one.

Edit2:  Spoke with wife.  She says she doesn't think her anxiety levels are higher than what may be considered normal given the circumstances.  Ironically, the OB gave the wife a mild prescription for birth control at the 6 week visit - a different problem which the MIL probably solves by being around!

I live in New Zealand and of course we were all shocked by the Christchurch shootings. A few days later the head of my division at work announced she wanted to do a ""solidarity day"" and have all the female workers wear hijabs, something a lot of women were doing at the time, and have a picture taken of all the female workers wearing one. I didn't want to take part because I still don't like hijabs and think they go against my personal beliefs, think it would be inappropriate to wear a religious symbol of a religion I don't follow, and see it as pointless virtue signaling. Also many Muslim women who don't wear hijabs dislike this sort of thing and have been speaking against it.

So when she came around with a collection of hijabs asking what I'd like I flat out told her I wasn't going to wear one on that day. She asked why and I simply replied I wasn't comfortable doing so without giving reasons and that this can not be mandated under New Zealand law. She admitted she can't mandate me to do it but she really wanted as many people as possible in the picture to send a nice message, etc. I just told her I support the message trying to be sent but I am not comfortable wearing one. Despite this the day before she asked me again and I said no. On that day one of my coworkers asked me where my hijab was and I said I was refusing to wear it (she kind of shrugged and left it at that.) Finally my boss asked me if I would at least wear one for the picture. I still refused and kind of got a little snarky saying I'd actually keep working and was willing to pass up a free break.

Unfortunately, the public education system in the country that I live in is plagued with tons of nationalist propaganda. Neither my wife nor I felt comfortable putting our kids in a high school here, so we thought about putting them in a private school. Unfortunately the private schools in our area also have agendas that we disagree with. Most of them are run as religious fundamentalist schools and we didn't want our children to go to such schools.

We ended up finding some great private boarding schools overseas that are well-renowned for their education so we decided to send our kids there when they turned 13. It is certainly expensive but we thought the education would be worth it. Now, six years later our oldest child is graduating and going to a good university and our youngest is still in high school overseas. They love the country they go to school in and they also love the school itself. They come back home to visit us every year during the winter holiday season as well as over the summer.

I also invited this person I knew distantly from a uni event. We weren't close and I invited her as a way to get closer. 

Anyway, everyone who came was super chill and fun but this girl from the uni event started to get reallyyyy drunk. She was so drunk she started to be physically abusive without realising and nearly ripped my friends earrings out her ear. I was elsewhere and didn't notice but I got told later that people were trying to stop her from drinking but she kept going. 

She got more and more annoying, messy drunk and hitting/slapping people like it was a game. 

At 11pm, I wanted to go to the club so I asked everyone to go downstairs. Two of my guy friends had to drag her down because she was that drunk and a total mess, but I wasn't leaving her in the apartment because I didn't know her that well. The plan was to put her in a taxi and find out her address from her drivers license. 

When we got downstairs, we quickly realised no taxi driver would take her by herself and someone would have to go with her. She literally was limp and it looked like she had taken drugs too. 

She lived quite far and no one knew her except me so no one wanted to go with her in a taxi.  

This is where I stopped trying to be nice at all. It was my birthday party (and I'd never splurged on an apartment, drinks and food like this before) and I wanted to have a fun night out. I said fuck it and said I'm calling the police or hospital to deal with this mess. 

Some of my friends tried to talk me out of it but I didn't see any other solution besides my night being ruined. I saw a patrolling cop car and asked them to come over.

When they saw her, they were immediately like, 'what did she take? Please be honest'. But none of us knew. The police tried to make her stand or do anything, but in the end the ambulance came and took her away. 

My friends were crying, I was crying, the mood was killed. It was a mess. Luckily, a few of my friends were still willing to clubbing so once we got there, I forced myself to forget and have a good time. 

The next morning I texted her, 'are you okay? We were worried about you and had to call police blahblah'

She didn't reply saying she was sorry or anything and just said, 'You should have come to the hospital with me'

That's when I got mad because she made her own choices to drink/take whatever she took and fuck herself up. She isn't my responsibility. She probably got in trouble with parents as she still lived with them. 

I remember sending her a long text then blocking her. AITA?

Edit: some things for more context - we were NOT friends. Just met her like three times at other uni events. Also she knew she was a bad drunk. She was literally complaining to me that she got uninvited from a friends holiday get away because they told her she was hard to deal with when she drank. 

TDLR; person I knew from a uni event came to my bday, got drunk/took drugs (I dunno) and fucked herself up, I got sick of having to try and find her a way home so called the police/ambulance to help deal with it. She later sent me a text mad that I hadn't gone with her to the hospital.",42,99,0.93
275,Not the A-hole,"Due any day now to give birth to my son and my plan for my own announcement is to only post a few pictures of the baby and announce he is now here, a day or so after, as I don't feel it's safe to go into details on social media such as his full name, place of birth, birth day, birth weight etc etc. I know other people love doing this, but for the sake of my son's potential future identity, I don't want to give that level of information out.

The issue is I know my in laws are going to want to disclose all this information as they're going to think it's cute and nice and it is a ""normal"" thing to do - but I don't want all their friends and family and random people knowing everything about my son.

WIBTA to ask them to specifically not give all the information out and make their announcement as absent of info as mine will be? 

I'm not asking them to not announce at all, and I won't be asking them to not be able to post photos etc, it's literally just the info which later will be used for his identity or personally identifiable information. I'm also not asking them to not ever speak of the info, just not publicise this info on a public Facebook post.

For info - I work in security for a bank, so this sort of info and things are sensitive to me as I deal with the effects of fraud and identity theft on a daily basis so I am more touchy about it than the average person. I also hate Facebook and social media and don't use it myself as I don't like freely giving out information about my life etc.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the input and the NTA rating - I emailed the FIL/MIL and politely stated not to offer any metrics on social media but that anything else is fine and an announcement is also Ok with a photo. They think I'm being paranoid but also seem to understand (FIL hates social media as well) so that's fine.
I'd also like to say I'm very happy that people nowadays are understanding the dangers of over sharing and agree that kids deserve protection, and that it isn't an asshole move to do this.

Regarding the paranoid comments - I agree on the surface it sounds tin foil hat, but as mentioned I work in the security industry so it's an occupational hazard to be weary of disclosure of information moreso than the average person. Not to argue, but just want to point out, companies like Cambridge Analytica exist, and the data scraping will be kept for years, and soon it won't be the data of a newborn but the data of an adult applying for credit cards using information such as their full name... place of birth... mothers maiden name... etc.
And the risk isn't my family or high school friends, it's the platform itself data mining, hence why I have no problem with email or other forms of communication.

Also comment regarding birth weight - it's not that I particularly think this should be kept a secret it's more of the fact I'm just asking outright for -no- metric to be disclosed at all, aside his first name.",28,59,0.9

277,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway b/c friends know my username.

I'm a lady in my early 30s. I have younger siblings but we are within 4 years of each other so I didn't help with baby stuff (or if I did I don't remember.) No kids for me as of now, but between friends, acquaintances, and current/former coworkers, I know seven pregnant ladies. One of which is my best friend of 20 years ""Lana"" who is due in early December.

Full disclosure: babies kind of terrify me. They are tiny and fragile and can't communicate and I'm always terrified of breaking them. Especially when they're newborns and they're extra small. Everyone says ""oh it'll be different when it's your own"" but again, none of these babies are mine.

Lana and I were talking the other day and she was telling me things about being pregnant I didn't know. I offhandedly mention I don't even know how to change a diaper. She says oh, I'll teach you. I say hmm no thanks. Oh no it'll be so easy! I can show you! No thank you I don't want to learn. She goes, not even for **my** baby? I say yes and she gets upset. How am I going to babysit for her and her husband if I don't know how to change a diaper? Um...I don't WANT to babysit. Again, not even for **my** baby? I remind her newborns/infants make me crazy nervous and I would not want to be completely alone and responsible for one. She gets even more upset saying I'm going to have to learn sometime if I have kids and she trusts me and she's going to need help etc. etc.

I told her I'm willing to help to the best of my abilities. I will come over with food, help clean, do laundry, run to the store, etc; whatever I can and I know she trusts me as a person but I am not the right person to watch an infant, I know nothing about their care and even if I did, I would not be comfortable. She said maybe I should leave, and we haven't really talked since.

I talked to some friends, and they were a little divided. Some say I was honest & upfront and they'd appreciate that, and others say I should just suck it up and learn how now because I'll need to eventually and I know so many pregnant ladies so I'll be able to help them too and I can't expect to just do the fun baby stuff. I feel bad because I know Lana's probably feeling a bit lost (both her parents have passed and her in-laws live across country) and I'll support her how I can but not in this way.

 So, AITA for not wanting to learn to change diapers for other peoples' kids?",265,451,0.95
278,Asshole,"This is SO stupid imo, but here we are. My older sister dated a kid her senior year of high school who gifted her a hand made blanket, it’s super nice and warm and doesn’t have their initials on it or anything. They broke up pretty badly, but that was literally 5 years ago, and they were in high school so how bad could it have really been? Well, now I’m moved out, and recently my parents gifted me a bunch of stuff they don’t need, either to keep or donate, since I live in a city and have better access to a donation center. The blanket was included, and honestly it’s such a nice blanket that I kept it as a throw for my living room in colder months. My sister visited me last week and in typical dramatic fashion, went white as a ghost when she saw it and asked what it was doing there, and when I explained that I just happened to like the blanket, she demanded that I throw it out and put it away while she’s there. We argued about the stupid blanket, and she cried, so I ended up just putting it away. I have no intentions of throwing it out, it’s just a freakin blanket. AITA?",105,73,0.89
279,Not the A-hole,"OK. So, not a great title but idk how to word this. 
I am currently planning a big party for my mom's 50th birthday. I have poured my heart into this event. My mom has not had a birthday party since she was 15. Shes been going through a rough time lately, and I reeeeeeaaaaaaaally want this party to be perfect. 
So, problem is, I have a cousin (*Joe*) who has been openly gay for like 10 years, and has recently started dating a very lovely gentleman (*Greg*). My grandmother has never fully accepted that Joe is gay, and has been very dramatic about the boyfriend. Recently, at a family get together, Joe ran his hands through Greg's hair and kissed him, in full view of the family. It was not performative, it was not drawn out, just a quick kiss, almost nobody even noticed(they where off to the side, not actively participating  in the convo or anything). Well, Grandma noticed and is extremely upset. She has told everyone that she will only come to the party if Greg is not there. The whole family agrees, and is saying that it was disrespectful for them to kiss in front of everyone, and that he shouldn't bring Greg, out of respect for our grandmother. 100% if Joe was in a straight relationship and they kissed in the same manner, it would be a non issue, as the whole fam is very affectionate and all about pda. This is ONLY because Greg is a man, and it is a gay relationship. 
She has yet to broach the subject to me directly, but when she does Im going to tell her to not come. I refuse to rescind Greg's invitation, just because my grandmother (and a handful of other relatives honestly) are bigots. 
ALSO, I found out last week that my 13yo sister is bi and has a secret girlfriend, and I never ever ever want her to feel like she has to hide that from family, and I want her to know that I will ALWAYS defend her, and that part of her, especially with our family.
I genuinely love my grandmother. I want her to be there. I want that for her, and moreso I know that it will break my mom's heart if she doesn't come, but I just can't bring myself to compromise my morals on this.
I refuse to treat my cousins sexual orientation (or my sisters) as something shameful or secret, that should be hidden to protect someone's delicate sensibilities. 
So, WIBTA for not uninviting my cousin's boyfriend?
ETA: I'm not un-inviting my grandmother, I intend on telling her that Im not going to rescind Greg's invitation, even if that means she won't be there.
As far as my mom, she's on the fence and has ultimately left the decision to me.
Also, not that it matters, but I am an adult woman lol.",165,296,0.93
280,Not the A-hole,"4 months into dating \[25M\] ""Shane"", I \[29F\] got us into a major car accident.  In his family's car.  NYE, us+friends drove to Maine, *slept early*, woke up @3, to hike to the first point that sees sunlight in the US.  It was brutal, colder than predicted, muscles exhausted by the end.   I started the driving around 11:00am after we got coffee and rested, and I was wide awake, but while they slept, I started to warm up.  My eyes got heavy. I looked for miles for an exit, in no man's land.  I snapped to, when I hit right rumble strip.  I turned back onto the road, but the back end swung out. We were on ice. I overcorrected. We spun left across all lanes, flipped over rails into a ditch.  We're lucky it wasn't hundreds of feet into a gorge to die.

Totaled a 2007 Rav4, at the time worth a generous $8k, but no one was hurt.  My passengers awoke, unaware of what happened.  Could've lied right there.  But no, I called Shane's parents to tell them what happened, that I was responsible, I was tired, lost control on ice, no one had a scratch and we're all safe, and ask if there was anything I could do/call.  They refused to speak to me (I get it).

They're either silent or screaming.  I understood, at first.  Over the years, they never developed any more mature of a response. They weren't as concerned with our safety, as the loss of the car (4 adults w/ 5 cars..). I, a new student, offered $5k, to bridge what I assumed would be a low insurance payout + 1.5k deductible, estimated loss I felt they shouldn't have to incur, plus some. Offered the use of my own new car, and without asking my friends found comparable cars, newer and in better condition than the OG, for less than the insurance $. They wanted no contact, and $10k from either me or Shane (""it doesn't matter who pays, but if she won't, you will""). Shane makes a 1/5 my pay, and can't afford 10k. They made Shane monkey-in-the-middle for > a year.  Today, I'm never spoken to, and if I speak in what seems like group talk, I've been yelled at (""No one spoke to you"").  I politely excuse myself, or wait a bit and go home.  I don't assert myself, or give any more fuel, and am always soft, kind, and helpful with chores/work.

I recently decided: 1) I'm not going to pay.  At the end of the day it won't satisfy them.  2) If Shane decides to pay, that's his decision to cave, and I won't help him.  3) I don't really want to be near them - it fills me with self-hate.  If I go home to see my family in CT, I'm no longer visiting his family, like he visits mine.  I don't want to experience the ""big moments"" in life, since this family will be a part of them (wedding, kids, etc).  Shane wants me to bear it and show up, even if it never stops.  He wants me to be a part of the family, and I should give them **even more** of a chance.  I don't feel I should be obligated to spend any more time with them, since I've given them years to be decent.

I crashed their car.  AITA, to Shane or them, for 1) not wanting more than min contact, & 2) not paying what I originally offered?

&#x200B;

edited to clarify:

* they did have insurance which payed an estimated 6 - 7k.  Exact numbers are unknown, this info is second-hand from ""Shane"".
* Also to add a PSA that couldn't fit in the OG post: The Maine cops told us that people out of state don't realize that extreme cold exposure may make you feel awake one minute, and extremely tired once the body begins to warm up.  *Please rest and warm up before driving, especially after cold exposure*, no matter how much/well you slept the night prior.  Learn from my mistake.  Not knowing is not an excuse, and ITA and should have better prepared.  (Oh, also? Those pull offs between directions on highway, where only cops are allowed?  Cops say: Just pull over there and sleep.  Pull over ANYWHERE that's safe, and sleep, even if not normally allowed, if you can't make it to an exit.  We'd rather knock on your door and wake you up, and hear you say you all were doing the best you could to be safe, than respond to your crash a few minutes later.  Thought that was super helpful.  Obviously do not abuse it/rely on it and under-prepare/etc.)
* The 5k I offered was assumed calculus, well before we knew what insurance would pay, given my own knowledge of my own insurance deductible, and an assumption insurance might undercut the value of the car a bit.  I made what I assumed to be a generous round to 5k from maybe 2.5 or 3, because I felt like a complete asshole.
* The 10k requested was not in addition to the 5k I offered, and not to replace insurance but to supplement it, so they could get a new car with about $16-17k.
* The lack of contact desired, and in question, is such that I don't want to be around them, at all, unless absolutely required, ex. if we were all attending a family wedding/funeral, that sort of thing.  I won't be extra and refuse to speak with them if we come into contact, and will still be polite.
* Shane is woefully ignorant to what is ""normal"" and not.  He grew up with parents who react like this, remember.  My own running calculus about the relationship is definitely playing in the back of my mind, and even though I have appreciated those extra inputs/insights (ty), the meat of the question is if ITA for wanting to cut his parents off to bare minimums, and no longer maintain my $$ offer.",48,35,0.89
281,No A-holes here,"To give context, she started the conversation with claiming to be fat, with bold, italic and underlined text. I responded by saying something along the lines of ""no, you see yourself very differently than everyone else"". She understood this as me calling her fat and asked ""so you think I'm fat?"", I answered with ""no, I think you're just a lil bit chubby, which i think looks very cute"". She got very upset about my response, I don't know what I should have said and I feel terrible.

In my head ""a lil bit chubby"" is the perfect way to describe her body which I do really think is cute and absolutely stunning, but she sees the word chubby as a cute version of fat. I don't see it like that, I tried explaining that to her but she won't have it. She thinks that I see har as fat when I really don't.

Am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: Alright so based on your responses I'm not a major asshole but I definitely made a asshole-y mistake that I should have seen coming by using the word chubby instead of something more tactful and thought out.

283,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend's best friend \[23F\] is currently engaged and getting married soon to a man\[24\] in the US Army. I've hung out with the best friend a handful of times, but have only met the fiance once on his military leave. I would consider both of them friendly acquaintances at best, but was invited to the wedding as the bestfriend's boyfriend. They have been together over 6 years.

My girlfriend recently told me in complete confidence that her best friend cheated on her (now) fiance.. Multiple times with Multiple people. It was a few years ago and she regrets it, but it happened nonetheless.

I was horrified. I asked my girlfriend if her best friend has any intention to tell this man the truth before they get married. The best friend has no intention of revealing that she cheated on him years ago. They will go through with the marriage.

I was disgusted and lost all respect for the best friend in a second's time. I promised my girlfriend that I wouldn't say anything, but I told my girlfriend that I couldn't watch a man unknowingly get married to someone who cheated on him.

Even though I only met him once.

Even though I formally accepted the wedding invitation.

Even though the bride's best friend needs a date to the wedding.. I would not go to that wedding.

My girlfriend is upset because I made a commitment to go to the wedding and said that I barely knew the couple anyways. My girlfriend tells me I should go to support her and that she needs someone to be there with her.

Should I let go of other people's drama and focus on supporting the only person I actually care about in this conundrum?

284,Not the A-hole,"So I love going tubing and some friends wanted to join me and have a camping trip as well. I am usually an easy going person and a friend of mine kind of took the lead on planning the activities. Three people traveled in my van and one person drove themselves. 

Get there Friday, tube Saturday, leave Sunday. 

I told my friend to rent herself a sturdy tube, instead they chose a cheap pool toy to float the river. It sank half way down the river. I told my friend we should rent an extra tube for the ice chest and dry stuff, the pool toy they brought to hold the ice chest would not make it. It did not. I barely saved the bags from the rocks. My phone was destroyed as the bag was water resistant and not water proof. 

Yeah I was a little dumb to bring it on the river, that is my own fault. 

I told the group not to keep the tubes tied together, my friend insisted to tie everyone together and we nearly got hurt when we crashed the first two times before I convinced them to untie the tubes.

I was burned, tired, my phone was dead, we were out of food, ice, basically eberything. It was 100 degrees outside at 8Pm. It was time to go home. I was ready. My friend agreed at first but defended the other two because they were drunk and wanted to party.  The other two people didn't want to leave and my friend said I was selfish for wanting to go home. 

I was sober. 

All weekend I shut my mouth to this nonsense instead of taking control of the situation. I should have simply floated by myself, I should have had my own shit under control, and I was the driver and I should have a say when it's time to leave. 

One person suggested I should go sleep off my attitude in the car. Another says I'm selfish. They wouldn't be able to load all their stuff in the other car. 

I tell them simply load all the stuff they don't need tonight in my car and I'll drop it off when they get home. I was leaving. They refused to do it. 

I told them again, I'm leaving, it's time to go, get last chance to load up. They refused. I left them. It was a five hour drive back home. 

No one has spoken to me since except my friend telling me I need to drive to their house and drop off whatever was in my car, some sodas, a couple towels, a pair of shoes, I think a flashlight.  

I told them no, I offered to do that and more than that and they refused. Pick it up yourself. 

Next time I'm going tubing by myself.

AITA?

Edit

There was a second car they got home fine. I left.

I did get an extra tube but not an extra ice chest tube.

so this is when the incident happened. 

I had a old friend back from when I was in primary school come and visit, we got to chatting and he mentioned my parents and asked how they were doing, I explained that they died.

less racists in this world, that's a good thing.

287,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. I know how this sounds, but hear me out. I have this friend, I’ll call her T that had gastric bypass surgery about 2 years ago. She’s been pretty discreet about the surgery and has only been open about it with family and close friends. I completely understand her wanting to be private about it even though it’s pretty obvious, as she lost quite a bit of weight in a really short amount of time. So here’s where the trouble is, recently T has made some pretty rude comments about a friend of mine (that she is not close with, but knows through mutual friends) who got a boob job. She was basically making fun of her and calling her shallow for getting plastic surgery in front of a group of people that didn’t even know this girl. After quite a few of these comments, I finally chimed in and said something to the extent of “shouldn’t you be the last person judging someone else for getting a surgery that altered their appearance?” I didn’t even say what the surgery was, but again to those who knew her before the surgery, it’s pretty obvious what I was taking about. She got very quiet and blew off my comment, but then later on in private said that it was fucked up of me to say that and that she had her surgery for “health reasons.” Mind you, she has had a range of health issues since her surgery due to her not complying with proper diet/exercise/avoiding alcohol etc. so it’s kind of a stretch for her to say that the ONLY reason she got her surgery was to be healthier. I think it’s great she had the surgery, regardless of her motivation to do so, and I’m glad she is happier with herself, but I don’t think it’s fair to criticize other people for electing to get surgery that will also make them happier with their body.

290,Not the A-hole,"So my family has had the same cleaning lady for most of my life, she is a lovely Ukranian lady named Lana and my family has a really great relationship with her, and we have met her kids a couple of times growing up. Her daughter did some artwork for my brother's room and we have gone to a couple of her gallery shows and even bought a painting that's in the basement. Every year we exchange Christmas cookies and cards, I would say that we are friendlier/closer than most people are with their cleaning lady?

Recently I graduated from my Undergrad and have moved back home to my parent's place because I am doing my Masters and pretty much the only school that has the pretty specific program is in one of the most expensive cities in Canada (Toronto) and it would be really hard for me to find my own place for a reasonable price and I don't want to risk living with strangers I found online after a really bad experience. But my parents live just outside the city and have graciously allowed me to move back in and save up.

When I first moved home in May, I was chatting with Lana while she was cleaning and she started talking about how she feels so bad that going to school didn't work out for me and that I can't support myself alone. I was a little taken aback, but I explained the situation. She smiled and gave me a sort of patronizing ""I'm sure sweetie"" and we went our separate ways.

Since then every time I've been home while she's been working she has said the same sort of thing and has also started talking about her son more. She told me all about his job as an electrician and all that. I thought she was just bragging, but then she started talking about how he's single and asking me about who I'm dating. For the first couple weeks I just dodged the questions and made excuses, but after almost 3 months I finally just told her straight up that I don't want to date her son, I'm not interested and I'd like her to drop the subject.

She got pretty offended and started saying things like ""oh you don't think he's good enough for you"" and implying that I'm being classist because he is only an electrician. She was really huffy and I didn't know what to say. I'm worried that I wounded our family's relationship with her.

I told my mother what happened and she said that I just should have agreed to meet him for drinks or something. But I just don't feel like it would be a good idea? It would definitely be weird to date the son of a family employee?

I got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. The rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. So essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (I slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but I mean going out alone without third wheel).

I decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and I confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. I guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me I should probably talk to him because I felt she was lying. So I went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

Straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as I was. Except she lied and said I purposely told her I couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". This isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and I never insinuated I wouldn't get a hotel room. She told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. They had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. A lot more than she did with me. I felt heartbroken, still do but I'm feeling better. On this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. He does really like her, I'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, She never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, I told him he could have her.

So yeah. In essence, she lied a lot. She told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. Was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. She told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. She told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while I was also there. It's shit.

Shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. Turns out I am really fucking stupid however I'm working on it and you can bet I won't make the same mistake again.

Thank you to everyone who commented and helped me decide what to do",193,14437,0.95
293,Not the A-hole,"Some background: my grandmother and I were extremely close growing up. She’s like a second mother to me and I love her more than almost every other person on this planet. She’s been supportive my whole life and I’m incredibly grateful. 
One thing I’m grateful for is she shares a similar relationship with my daughter. My mom warned me when I was pregnant she would be invasive and overbearing, but my relationship with my grandmother had always been a point of contention between them. I didn’t doubt my mom, but I accepted it because obviously I love them both. 

In the last year she has been so far up my ass about my daughter I can’t stand it. It’s overwhelming. I feel like I’m being parented in parenting. She has been invasive and overbearing, but she respects me and doesn’t go over my head - but she’s CONSTANTLY texting me about my daughter. It’s all day. I’m not exaggerating when I say I receive anywhere between 10-20 texts a day asking everything about her, how she’s doing, if I’m going to a certain school function (bc if I “can’t” she will,) etc. I text her more than anyone in my contacts and I’m tired of it because it’s always questions about my child. I feel like we don’t even have a relationship outside of my daughter anymore. 

She does so much for us. She babysits for free at least once a week, and pays for her tuition to a wonderful school (our public schools here are abysmal.) She has every right to be very involved but am I wrong for asking her to tone it down? 
I just texted her how I felt, asking her to hear me out and she hasn’t responded. I feel terrible.

ETA: when I say grandmother - she is not a retired woman knitting at home with no other hobbies or interests. She’s a boss ass bitch who has a thriving career and an ambitious, cutthroat attitude and I love her for it. But it plays into the overwhelming/intimidation factor heavily.
ETAA: I’ve commented several times we’ve had “boundary” discussions in person. Each time she takes it well but this continues.",35,94,0.93
294,Not the A-hole,"I want to know if I was TA, but I also want to know where you think my tolerance level should be for stuff like this. So I'm giving a lot of background. 

**Back story**      

There's a public park and two schools within a 5 block radius of my house. The park has occasional problems with students going there after dark to hang out and get high. It sometimes requires police intervention.

I have a vacant lot across the street. The people who own the lot are good about keeping it mowed and clean. It's sometimes used as a hangout spot for teens but not very often. If there are kids/teens hanging out over there, I don't bother them. 

One of my neighbors has quite a few visitors. They usually have a regular thing every Friday night, and more rarely at other times during the weekend. Their visitors almost always park in front of my house. Not because it's the only place to park. The whole block is 90% empty. I don't really know why they do that, they just do. I don't care, although I do get low-key annoyed when they dump trash in my yard.

**To the incident**     

Last night, Sunday--or rather very early Monday morning about 12:30am--I get woken up by noises from my yard. There's a car parked in front of my house. It's got at least 3, maybe more, people in it. They have the music cranked up and they are talking and laughing.

My first thought is that it's people from the party neighbor's house leaving. I give them 5 minutes or so to crank up the car and leave so I can get back to sleep. They don't leave.

I know the car wasn't there before 10pm. So it showed up sometime in the last 2-3 hours, which would make it possibly too late to be visiting my neighbors. especially on a Sunday night, but what do I know?

I start to wonder WTF they are doing, so I'm looking out the window. I see them walking around the car, opening and rummaging in the trunk. First I think they have a flat tire or something, but they keep opening and closing the trunk, in between getting back in the car, cranking up the music, playing on their phones, and generally being loud.

Over the course of 30 minutes, they made three trips to the trunk.

I just want to get the fuck back to sleep. It's now 1am and they show no signs of leaving.

I go downstairs and look up the non-emergency number for the police. I tell them there are some people parked in front of my house, being loud and noisy. I don't know who they are, and they don't look like they are leaving any time soon. Could they drive by and check on them?

I did turn on the light to look up the phone number. Dunno if that's why, but the car--still with the music cranked--left about 5 minutes later. The police rolled through about 5 minutes after that.

So, AITA for calling the police? They were on a public street. Should I have just sucked it up? Turned on my lights and waited another 10-15 minutes to see if that made them leave before I called? Did I waste the cop's time? Where do you think it gets to the level when I should call the police?",59,98,0.9
295,Not the A-hole,"Round One backstory:

After my father passed away, I assisted my 65 year old bariatric mother with getting her estate in order. She lives 900 miles away so this was no easy feat. The plan was to get her consolidated as best as possible and move her to my city. She would have money leftover from the house sale to float herself for quite a while, not to mention the benefits she receives from the government and my fathers retirement. After getting all of her possessions minimized and the house listed, we had success getting the house sold in just a few weeks. Meanwhile, I was preparing for my mothers arrival 900 miles away by getting an apartment in order and starting to accumulate furniture, etc. for her.

The week of closing of the house, without telling me, she went ahead and purchased a townhome in the city she is currently living in and proceeded to take her new minimized life a few blocks away from where we did a bunch of hard work. I was very upset that she did this and there was some resentment, but I had to get over that because she is my mother. Not to mention she spent 10's of thousands of dollars enabling my siblings drug/alcohol/jail issues. That is a whole story in itself. Getting over that has taken a couple years, if I'm really truly even over it.

Where we are now:

Fast forward 3 years, she claims she is running out of money and is now requesting to do the process all over again, this time the request is for my family (myself, spouse, and child) to purchase a new house with the intention of having space for her. The current house we live in would not work for her as the only bedrooms are upstairs and her weight will not allow her to climb stairs. I love the house I am currently in and do not see any benefit from uprooting ourselves for the sake of my mom's happiness. Not to mention she anticipates this being her final household, which will prohibit my family from making any significant changes as long as she is still alive.

AITA for not wanting to do this to my family? AITA for not wanting to put myself through this whole process again? I really do not know how to handle this where everyone walks away happy with the outcome

EDIT: She would contribute financially as much as she can as long as she can.",38,159,0.94
296,Asshole,"So when someone does something that annoys me I tell them. For example my dad likes to yell through my open window to say hi to me. I told him I don't like it cause I have to pause everything I'm doing and yell back to figure out what he said; I also have anxiety and tend to be paranoid and him yelling though my window feels kinda invasive. When I told him this he got upset and told my brother. They said that doing this is petty and immature. I don't think there's anything wrong with pointing out behavior that I find annoying. AITA

297,Not the A-hole,"I’m sorry I’m on mobile. 

I work at a family owned resort on a lake in Wisconsin. It’s a relatively small town the population is about 500 people

Anyway, at this resort I do a lot of the behind the scenes work like bar cleaning, etc. I prefer to do tasks like this because I have severe generalized anxiety and so I try to steer clear of working with the public and specificity dealing with cash because sometimes when I panic (even over little stuff) I shut down and can’t think anything.  To further minimize my interaction with costumers I try to clean the bar very early in the morning like 4 or 5am so no one will knock on the door and ask me for things like bait/drinks/food/etc. 

For the first time all summer I didn’t end up getting into the bar until 7:30 am on Monday morning(he’s fine with this I just have to have the bar cleaned by 10am). It was about 8:30 am and this 40 ish guy walks up to the door and knocks on it as I’m finishing up. 

I reluctantly open the door and go “Hi, I’m so sorry but the bar and bait shop don’t open until 10 am.”

He says, “Oh I think I left my sweater here last night.” 

I say, “Oh yeah I found one, wait here I’ll grab it for you.”

He then follows directly behind me the 30 feet to the coat rack and I grab it and hand it to him. 

“Here is this it?”

 “Yeah this is it. Could I get some beer and bait?” He says. 

“I’m sorry I don’t really work much behind the bar. I don’t even know how to use the cash register.”

“Well is there anyone around you could get to help me?”

“No sir, the owner is asleep upstairs, I would have to walk into his personal bedroom and wake him up. I’m so sorry but you’ll have to come back at 10.” 

“You’re fucking kidding me? Can you tell me how much it is for the bait and beer and you don’t need to give me any change.”

“I’m sorry, I wish I could do that for you but all the beer is different prices and I’m not sure how he prices the minnows/etc. And I really don’t want to over charge you.” 

“This is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced at an establishment like this. Normally shitholes in the country try to keep the tourists happy! I guess not this place!” He says. 

I keep apologizing as I’m trying to lead him back toward the door but he keeps stopping to bitch some more. 

“Why do you guys even have a bait shop if it’s not open for the prime time for fishermen?”

“I don’t know sir, I’m new here (I’m not). Like I said before I’m super sorry for any inconvenience.” 

He finally steps into the door frame
“Well I don’t know if I’ll be returning when you open or not.”

“Oh yeah I totally understand that. I hope you have a good rest of your day.” Then I practically shut and locked the door on his heels...

298,Not the A-hole,"I am recently engaged (27F) (Yay!). My parents divorced when I was younger, my Dad (58M) remarried to ""Jolene"" (53F) around 11 years ago. While my Dad and I have issues, we are currently on the upswing. The wedding is a huge part of that.

&#x200B;

Jolene and I were once friends, but our relationship changed drastically when I was 18yo and leaving for college. There was drama about college and who was paying (my Dad didn't want to), and it ended with my Dad's wife taking several actions that really hurt me:

1. Refusing to come to weekly dinners with me & Dad for months, despite always having attended before. She also did not attend my high school graduation for similar reasons.
2. Refusing to acknowledge my existence when we were alone from 18-24yo. If we were alone in a room together, she wouldn’t respond to any questions, look at me, etc. I was really hurt by this. I only recently talked to Dad about it, but nothing came of it. I tried talking to her privately about it, but she pretended she didn't hear me.
3. Talking a TON of smack about me to my Dad's family.

&#x200B;

Jolene and I have never addressed any of this. I tried to when I was younger, but I was 18yo and really unsure how to handle this behavior. Now, we are polite and I am always kind to her. I see her at dinners at my Dad's, but we are not close. We don't text or talk outside the presence of others.

&#x200B;

This engagement and wedding is now bringing things to the surface. Jolene is acting like we are BEST friends, we have ALWAYS gotten along and she simply MUST be involved (""The bride's mother, mother in law, and stepmother are invited to EVERYTHING. . ."" is an actual quote). I'm not trying to be a total jerk, and I am discussing the wedding with her, but she keeps pushing for things (for example, she wanted to go dress shopping with me) that are just not reflective of our relationship and make me feel gross- like I'm adding to her fake fantasy of us being ""besties"" that she wants only for appearances.

&#x200B;

This brings me to the wedding ceremony. It will not be in a church, but we are incorporating a unity candle from my wonderful fiance's parents' (still together) ceremony. Traditionally, the parents of the bride and groom go up and light the candle with the newlyweds. I only want my Dad, Mom, and ILs to light the candle with me and my fiance.

&#x200B;

For some reason, the prospect of her standing up there and lighting the candle with us makes my skin crawl. It just feels so disingenuous to include her in this manner.

&#x200B;

I am involving her in other ways- Jolene will walk down the aisle with my grandpop (he needs some help walking), and I'm inviting some of Jolene's family to the wedding upon her request. But I KNOW this is going to get push back and I need to decide if I'm being a jerk.

299,No A-holes here,"Some context here - I'm a full time university student, and I occasionally do volunteer work. My grandmother got diagnosed with terminal leukemia last year, and spent about four months hospitalised, with an awful immune system. I would visit her every day, and sometimes between classes, and tried to study in the hospital room. I didn't particularly like being there, obviously, but I love my grandmother dearly. However, both my social life and GPA suffered. 

Since then, she has been discharged, and stays at home, with the exception of her monthly chemotherapy sessions. If I don't visit her every day, quite literally, she gets upset, and asks about me (by name specially), as I'm her favourite grandson. 

So, WBITA if I tell her that although I love her, I do also need to maintain my GPA, and sometimes hang out with friends, but I would be more than happy to call her every day?

301,No A-holes here,"My neighborhood had a party the other night. We started our festivities in the afternoon with apps/drinks that different houses put out for everyone. As a group of about 30 people, we walked through the neighborhood trying each of the different items. By the time we were done visiting each house, we all had a decent start on our alcohol for the night.

The party moved to one of my neighbors' house (""The Johnsons"") where we had a potluck and plenty more drinks. I can hold my liquor, but I didn't really want to face the effects of heavy drinking the next morning, so I took it easy for the rest of the night. I'll admit I was a little buzzed, but by no means plastered and certainly not fuzzy enough to mistake what I saw that night.

One of my neighbors (35M), ""Dave"", was getting along quite well with one of my new neighbors (\~30F), ""Rachel"". Rachel moved in earlier this summer, and I hadn't really had a chance to meet her yet. That night was the first time I introduced myself, and that was pretty much the extent of our conversation.

As the night went on, I noticed that Dave and Rachel were almost inseparable. They were making each other drinks, laughing, and talking for hours. At one point, they excused themselves from the party to go ""get more mix"" from Rachel's house. Here's where it's important to mention that Dave is married and has two little kids. Dave's wife, ""Carol"" (35F), was back home with their kids, and I didn't see her stop by the party once.

Dave and Rachel came back from her house about 30 minutes later (it shouldn't have taken that long to grab some margarita mix) and were still in remarkably cheery moods. The conspiracy was still just floating around my mind without much evidence to ground it. Then, a few more drinks later, Dave and Rachel entered the Johnsons' swimming pool together. There were a few other neighbors in the pool too, but they were just talking to one another in between sips of the drinks in their hands. I had just went to grab another beer from the bar when I turned to see Dave and Rachel embracing in the pool. They were in their swimsuits and had their arms tightly wrapped around each other. They then took turns leaning into one another, pushing themselves underwater (basically on top of each other). As far as I can tell, they never technically kissed or anything (above water), but their seesaw routine seemed awfully suspicious from my perspective. Nobody else seemed to notice them in the pool, or if they did, they weren't cognitive enough to think twice about it. I finished that last beer, thanked everyone for a fun night, and went home.

Here is my question again: AITA if I don't tell my neighbor about what I witnessed that night? To me, nothing seems totally concrete, and I'd hate to cause any kind of turmoil between Dave and Carol simply because I misunderstood things thanks to some alcohol. Still, how Dave and Rachel were treating each other looked so beyond friendly that it almost had to have been cheating.",36,111,0.96

304,Not the A-hole,"My sister and I went speed-dating at this cool local bar that had a big upstairs room used for private events like this. The bar and restrooms were downstairs. There were about 20 women, each was seated at her own small numbered table throughout the room and the men rotated through the tables. Each ""date"" lasted 7 minutes and then a bell would ring and the men would move to the next table. 

Halfway through, we had a 20-minute break, and almost everyone went downstairs to use the bathroom, grab a drink, and stand up around the bar to mingle and chat. I happened to be in the middle of a pretty intense text argument with my brother, who had been staying with me recently after his relationship broke up. We have always gotten along really well and this was the first time in our adult lives we had argued. I was absorbed in our text conversation so I opted to stay seated at my table upstairs and use my break time to text him. 

After a couple minutes, the man slated to sit at my table next came and sat down with me. I was kind of surprised because everyone else was chatting downstairs and I was clearly engrossed in my phone, not giving off any kind of ""I'm open to talk"" vibes. I smiled as he sat down, gestured at my phone, and said ""Sorry, I'm in the middle of something I have to handle right now."" Then I proceeded to ignore him for the rest of the break and continued texting. I will add that he was quite unattractive and I had zero desire to talk to him at all. (Edit: Yes, if he had been attractive and had good energy I most likely would have put my phone away earlier and talked to him. Maybe that makes me a bad person but it's the truth.)

When the bell rang, I put away my phone and focused on my date. I smiled and apologized again, saying that I had something I had to take care of. To my surprise, he just stared grumpily off to the side and said, ""No, no, don't put your phone away, just stay on it."" I sort of laughed and said, ""You don't want to talk? Let's talk!"" He just sullenly ignored me, so I shrugged, pulled my phone out again and continued texting my brother during our 7-min ""date"". 

Some of my friends think that I was being an asshole by ignoring him, since he's a human being and it was just a few minutes of talking, and I went out to socialize and meet men. I contend that the whole point of speed-dating is that I only want to talk to these guys for 7 minutes and he had no right to plop himself down into my space and basically demand I give him my attention for an extra fifteen minutes during my break time. Break time which I am free to use however I want. My sister theorized that based on his looks, he's probably been getting rejected and ignored by conventionally-attractive women like me for his whole life and probably has a lot of pent-up resentment and anger.

Edit for clarity: I'm not telling them to never feed my daughter fast food again. Perfectly acceptable when she visits my parents (regardless how i feel about it).

Yesterday morning i get a text from my step-dad asking about my daughter (8 y/o). He wanted to know if she wanted a happy meal. I politely declined, then mentioned that we (daughter, SO & myself) are trying to eat healthier. 

A little background: i recently got released from prison after 2.5 years.  My parents had my daughter part time while i was incarcerated and it was a regular ritual for my step-dad to take my daughter to a drive thru when they had her. 

Since I've been home I've been struggling with my daughter's eating habits. She's now an extremely picky eater. Before I got locked up she would eat almost anything I put in front of her. Most nights I cook, and we try to make it as fresh & organic as budget allows for. 

So I just got a call from my mom telling me how inconsiderate & rude I was for not letting my step-dad bring my daughter fast food. I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to snub him and that i am genuinely appreciative that he will just call out of the blue thinking of my little girl. That all fell on deaf ears and kept coming back to the ""we don't eat that here"" comment (not at all how i said it, but essentially the truth. I spent years eating garbage food & I'm genuinely trying to be more conscious of what we put in our meals). So people of reddit AITA?",55,162,0.93
306,Asshole,"My husband and I have a 4 year old daughter. We both work, so during the days we have a nanny come in. We still wanted to prioritize family time though.

I have been feeling really drained recently, missing the hobbies I did before we had our daughter. Back then; I'd do kickboxing right after work on Mondays and Wednesdays, and yoga right after work on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

And I realized I could still swing it, potentially.

My time away from home, work and commute combined, is 8:00 am - 4:30 pm. 

My husband is away from 8:00 am - 7:00 pm because he works longer hours and had a longer commute.

If I started going back to working out, I'd still be able to make it home before 6 or 7 every day, and still be able to spend time as a whole family. To be honest, when I have been getting home at 4:30 every day, and taking over from our nanny, all I've wanted to do was zone out. 

So I mentioned to my husband that I was gonna offer our nanny more hours during the week, so I could get to the gym. He went ""ok"" but didn't seem to be thinking about details, and he didn't ask any more questions.

So, for the last few weeks, I've been having our nanny stay till 6:30 every weekday, she's happy to have the extra hours and I'm enjoying getting back to my workouts. Plus I use Friday evening to do some grocery shopping alone because it's a lot easier than doing it with a kid in tow. 

I was casually taking to my husband about our monthly budget, which I manage because I'm better with cash, and how I was offsetting the cost of having our nanny stay an extra 10 hours a week. I had stopped going out for lunch as often, and I'd replaced some of our usual purchases (soap, TP, detergent, shampoo, etc) with bulk purchases online.

And my husband was like ""What, 10 hours? You said you were just going out to the gym sometime"". So I explained my schedule, and he wasn't happy with it. He said he didn't want to be the type of parents who push their kid off on a nanny all the time. Work is one thing, but going out for hours everyday after work was another.

I told him about how it made me much more refreshed and happy, the time I all home. So while I'm decreasing the time I'm home a little, I'm really increasing quality time with my family. Because I feel energized rather than drained. I didn't realize how much I missed working out regularly until I got back to it.

My husband thinks I'm being selfish; he doesn't like that I want so much time to recharge from family time. He thinks it should be fulfilling, not draining. 

And I'm honestly happy it is for him. But I'm an introvert, I like being able to spend some time just focusing on my workout and letting go of stress. And I really don't want to give it up, now that I've been doing it for a few weeks.

I am furious and he can’t understand why. His reasoning is: It’s his vacation and he should be able to do what he wants with it. 

Note: These holidays do not include all the week nights (1 per week) and weekends (at least 1 per weekend) that he spends golfing with the same guys. When he’s actually home, he just lays on the couch watching TV or sleeping while I  entertain our child. I feel like I’m totally being taken advantage of here. AITA?

313,Not the A-hole,"I have 3 siblings. I have a pretty close bond to everyone but my sister. My sister has always been unnecessarily cruel towards me. E.g. she would often try to get my girlfriends to break up with me by telling false stories, she would steal my stuff and either destory or ruin (put it in the toilet, burn it, that sort of thing) them, etc.

My parents never really cared, since it was just ""tough love"". 

My family is quite influential and successful, and the connections they have has made us all quite successful. My sister is quite a lot less, since she dropped out of school so she has no formal education, only experience.

My sister got her (according to her) dream job. She got a trial period at the workplace, currently shes under a 2 month contract, and she was supposed to get a new contract near the end. Lets call her boss Dyke.

Dyke is a pretty high up guy in the company, and he has a lot of power. He was the one that employed my sister. I went to uni with Dyke, and we are pretty close.

I was having a lunch with Dyke, where he mentioned that she [my sister] was doing ""poorer than optimal, but she will surely pickup the pace"". I asked Dyke if he was gonna offer her a new contract, and he hesitated but ended up saying ""sure, she is your sister after all"". At this point I told him that shes an ass and if she wasn't doing well, then he shouldn't continue her contract.

She was informed a few days after that her contract would not be renewed, and she could start looking for other jobs ASAP. She instantly called me and told her to make Dyke change his mind. I told her no, and I wasn't gonna carry her through her life. My parents then started pestering me that I should just do it, and that I should do it for family. 

Today my parents and my sister showed up at my door, and basically confronted me. It turned into a heated discussion, which ended in me telling them that I got her fired in the first place, and if it wasn't for me she wouldn't even have gotten that job. I shut the door and went back to being with my fiancée. 

My parents have been spamming me with messages, calls, even an email on my work email. My other siblings seem to agree that I shouldn't tell Dyke to renew her contract, although that I was a bit tough and didn't need to tell her that I was responsible for getting her fired.

I agree it was an assholey move, but they showed up at my door basically yelling at me, so I feel like its only natural that I come back with an aggressive tone. I don't feel bad at all for my sister, but I'm not completely sure if I'm an asshole or not.",100,61,0.85
314,Not the A-hole,"I (F21) stay at my mom’s house during college breaks. My mom and I don’t have a great relationship, but we are slowly working on it. My mom is extremely successful and she worked her way to that spot. She was a dental hygienist for a long time and she finally decided to go back to college to be a Nurse Practitioner. She now makes more money than she ever had. 

Background: There is this stupid, idiot man baby that pretty much uses her. He’s(M55) the same age as my mom (F55) and they apparently dated like 15 years ago. My mom was super in love with him. He broke up with her after dating for a couple of years to be with someone younger. Anyways this dumb bitch came back into my mom’s life like 5 years ago. He messaged her out of the blue and asked her if he could store his belongings in her basement. My mom agreed and so it began. She started to fall for him again, but he didn’t feel that way. I think they mess around, but he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with her. 

This man is so mean to my mom. I would be sitting in the living room and can hear him screaming at my mom through the phone. He would cuss her out and insult her all the time. It’s really concerning. I told her I don’t want him coming around here because I don’t feel safe around someone who loses their temper so easily like that. I told her multiple times he sounds like an ass, but she always defend him saying he has a bipolar disorder and she wants to be there for him. 

I might be an asshole here, but I started to read their text messages. I don’t know, I was so worried about her and I wanted to see if there was proof of him being an ass. There definitely is. He manipulates my mom. He makes her buy him groceries every week, he begs her to gamble and make bets with HER money for him, if she doesn’t want to do something, he guilt trips her by saying “don’t ever call me again then if you can’t help me”, and calls her all kind of mean names. It’s so upsetting and it pisses me off how he treats her. 

Recently he got her to buy a 2nd house so they can fix it up and resell up. At first she was hesitant to do that, but he guilt tripped her to do it. He’ll say things like “I guess you don’t care about me” or “never talk to me again then” and it pisses me off. I’ve even blocked him a few months ago on her phone, but she flipped out on me. 

I have his number and I want to send the nastiest text message to him. He deserves it. He’s hurting my mom and I tried talking to her and my sister multiple times about it. He’s using her and she is too in love with him to notice. I hate it. This might ruin our relationship, but WIBTA if I rip his ass to shreds?",54,42,0.82

317,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway to doubly make sure this can't get back to my family. 

For some background, my niece will be 16 in September. My brother and his ex divorced about 2 years ago but she's in the military and while they share custody they decided it would be best for the kids to live full time with him since he has better access to schools, family and stability. I am very close to both my niblings. I'm 24 for reference. 

A week or so ago my brother found my niece's ""sex diary"" and snooped. He took pics and sent them to me and honestly, having a been a teenage girl it wasn't too bad. It was pretty normal stuff like she'd had a kissing contest with her friends and she had won by kissing 24 guys in a week. She's done oral sex and really wants to get on the pill. I guess the most ""troubling"" thing to my brother was that she seems to have a fixation with older guys (to me this is totally normal since teen guys sucked) and would ""do anything"" for a 29 year old military pilot she met while visiting her mom this summer. 

My brother asked me to talk with her but not reveal that he (I guess we) had snooped. I wasn't sure how to get her to open up so I invited her over for a sleepover and I opened up first by asking her if she wanted to read my old teen diary for the ""cringe"" factor. She did. The stuff I had written down was very similar to hers (I had a massive crush on my swim coach, and loved having my boobs felt up was what I wrote most about). She actually then showed me her diary (which I didn't reveal I read most of). This actually led us to have a nice discussion that these were just her inner thoughts, she would never really try to sleep with an older guy and finally if she ever wanted to get on birth control I would help her out. In my mind it was a great and productive conversation. 

Well being the teenager she is, she went home and was being a little shit to my brother and for whatever reason she revealed that I had shown her my diary and wanted to sleep with our junior swim coach. My brother took this completely the wrong way and called me furious that I had shown her my diary to give her ""permission"" to do the things I did when I was a teen. I tried to explain to him that I was glad to help but he put me in a really rough spot by talking to her while protecting the fact that he snooped so I did the best I could. he said ""no you acted like an fucking asshole"" and hung up on me and won't answer calls.

318,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I, plus some of my friends from work, were hanging out an this vintage car race that was being hosted in a local park. Just sitting on a hill, drinking sangria, and watching the cars go by. It was a pretty chill day, we're all nerdy engineers, nobody was getting wild. I was sitting on the drink cooler and I was pouring out more when anyone asked.

My coworker brought his wife, who I hadn't met before. I'll call her Bailey. She was pregnant, like obviously so. 

Anyway we were all hanging out for a while and Bailey asked me if I'd pour her a sangria. I got her one without thinking. Like I literally wasn't thinking about her being pregnant, I was just like ""alright she wants a drink"" and I gave her one.

My boyfriend came over after that and quietly asked me what I was thinking, giving her a generous pour of sangria. And I was like ""I made that to share with everyone, don't be stingy."" At that point, I didn't realize what he was getting at, I thought he was just annoyed I was giving too much away to someone we hardly know.

He goes ""I'm not being Stingy! She's pregnant!"" And then I understood. But I still thought that wasn't really our business. And my mom always had an occasional wine or beer on the weekends when she was pregnant with my siblings and I, and it was fine.

My boyfriend was like ""A big cup of this is more than a glass of wine or beer"" and I shushed him, I didn't want to make a scene about it. So far, nobody had noticed our conversation and I wanted to keep it that way.

After the day out, though, my boyfriend was upset with me for being so unobservant and oblivious; an argument that has honestly come up before.

321,Not the A-hole,"Hey guys, throwaway cuz some of my family knows my reddit and they're already mad at me.


So it was my birthday recently and any time someone has a birthday, we have a family dinner the week of. I had my family dinner the other night. For some context, there are a couple vegans in my family, and I am a huge meat eater (so much so that there's hardly any veggies in my fridge). I've also eaten vegan dishes on their birthdays before. 


For my birthday dinner, I chose this steak house that I love but don't normally go to because it's a bit pricey. It has a huge variety of vegan options as well as a really nice salad bar. Tbh I really would of liked barbeque as well, but figured there's not really meat free options for bbq and I wanted them to at least have some options that weren't meat. Well I told my parents where I chose so they could let the others know, and pretty much none of them wanted that. Even though it has vegan options, they didn't want somewhere that served mostly meat, and we had someone visiting from out of country who wanted mexican (which we're known for). 


Basically almost everyone wanted mexican or something similar with more vegan options, but I really absolutely wanted either steak or bbq. Even though they begged me to change I kept saying sorry I really only want one of these two places. Eventually pretty much everyone decided they didn't want to go if I wasn't going to budge on where we eat, and I ended up only having dinner with my close immediate family. 


Now everyone's mad at me for ruining our get together and being unwilling to accommodate them, and none of them will even talk to me. I just absolutely did not want any of the things they wanted and it was my birthday dinner, I don't get to eat out often. AITA for not just going where they wanted?",737,2922,0.96
322,Not the A-hole,"Hey, first post and gonna try to make it brief.

I live on a small farm owned by my in-laws, and we have a neighbor who just built a house that backs to our property. 

They have a largish dog, it's a doodle of some sort like a golden doodle or labradoodle. It's fairly young and super rambunctious. 
It keeps getting on our property and has harassed our livestock and also had a standoff with me and my own dog(my dog was leashed) a few months back because the doodle dog slips right through our barbed wire fence, the neighbors have no fence of their own and lets the dog wander around then they get home. When they're not home it's penned so at least there's that.

My landlords and husband just tell me to shoot it and carry a gun, I don't want to carry a loaded pistol just to take a freaking walk with my dog, and I already carry pepperspray.

I've called the sheriff before and he said I was within my rights to have them go make a warning and possible citation, but I wanted my landlord to see if he would call the neighbor and if they could do something about it first.

It got a little better for a few months, but it's gotten bad again and I've recently caught him in the pasture a few more times. 

I do have their number but I have never talked to them about their dog because they have lied to my landlord about leashing, penning, training the dog and when it came through the fence and tried to attack me they told my landlord they would come apologize to me and never did.
I have nothing neighborly to say to them.
I don't want to have to shoot someone's pet, but I do want them to see how serious this is.

So WIBTA if I called animal control the next time I see their dog without confronting or warning them myself? I feel like a narc. 
Thanks

Edit: hey guys wanna make a quick edit to clarify something. Last night I saw the dog in our pasture and I told my landlord, he kind of gave me a ""dogs will be dogs"" thing because he is a good ole country boy, and suggested I either shoot the neighbors dog or let my own dog fight it off. I told him right then I would no longer be calling him when I see the dog, but to have him warn the neighbors that next time I will just call the sheriff.

Later on, I called the place and told them we had a amazing time but the one dish was a bit salty. I was frank and told them I didn’t expect anything. I just wanted them to know since it was a new item and maybe change how it was cooked in the future so it wasn’t as salty. They called back and kept insisting to give me a refund. I said no but they eventually just added a discount off gameplay for next time to my membership number (they looked this up from my cell phone number that I called on).

I’m a massive stoner been smoking pretty much everyday for the past 4 years, but I hate my house smelling like weed, it’s one of those smells that lingers for ages and makes everything near it smell too. When I smoke I do so in the bathroom in my house as it’s well ventilated with a fan and  keeps the smell in the bathroom, which goes away when I leave the fan on.
The other day though I had cleaned my house, no weed stuff in site and my bedroom was smelling so strongly of weed I got confused and than saw someone outside my window having a joint. Just a little info, my bedroom window is broken and doesn’t shut correctly at the top so there’s a constant draft into the room, which was what was carrying the smell in the room too.
I went out and asked them politely to not smoke outside my window, explained the broken window, and they were nice about it, apologised, and moved. I know I’m overthinking but I feel like a hypocrite since I do smoke inside the bathroom of the house I was trying to stop them getting smoke into. Was I wrong to ask them to move?

330,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together 20 months. He speaks only Russian with his family, as it’s their first language. However they have all been fluent in English for 13+ years. I, on the other hand, only know English and some ASL. 

My boyfriend and his parents used to often speak only Russian around me. They would sometimes comment on how I looked uncomfortable and make small jokes out of it (“don’t worry you’ll get used to it!”, “it would be easier if you learned Russian”). Since then I’ve voiced to my boyfriend that I’d really like for them to speak English if we’re all spending time together. For the most part that’s how it’s been lately. I don’t mind if they speak Russian when I’m nearby if it’s just smalltalk, but I get upset when they only speak Russian when we’re all having meals, out spending time together, etc. 

Today my boyfriend and I spoke about this again, and he said that he thinks it’s crappy of me that I haven’t learned Russian since the 20 months we’ve been dating. I’ve learned small conversational phrases, and I also know the alphabet, but he says it’s crappy I haven’t been serious about learning their language. 

I reminded him that I’ve begged him to teach me Russian for months and he refused to. I also can’t put all of my time and energy into self teaching a language, because I’m a full time college student and I also have a job. He says I should put more effort into trying to learn his family’s language, but I think knowing simple phrases is fine for right now. My priority is college, not learning Russian. I also feel like if he’s refused to teach me that he has no right to complain about this. 

It isn’t a huge issue, but I’m wondering if I am an asshole for not learning Russian, since we have been together for a decent amount of time. I know how important it is for him, and if we date long term and there’s a possibility of a future together (I’m 19, so I’m not thinking that far ahead right now) then of course I will invest myself in learning it. But right now it isn’t a priority. AITA?

ETA: Not sure if this is relevant or not, but I did try for two semesters to take a Russian course. My university doesn’t offer it but we have a neighboring school that does. The classes filled up both times (students of that school get priority). So while I haven’t put in a huge amount of effort, I’ve tried alternatives to self teaching.

2nd ETA: Totally slipped my mind, but we live in America, not Russia. His family moved from Estonia in 2003 or 2004.

**3rd ETA: I didnt expect this to gain traction, honestly. I do want to clarify some points: I *have* tried to learn the language. I see a few people saying i’m TA for not trying. For about 15 months I tried to self teach, and I was killing my self over not being able to pick anything up. It didn’t help that my boyfriend didn’t help. The past 5ih months I haven’t tried at all, and that’s what prompted this post.**

**Secondly, I see a kind of split response on me wishing they spoke english during group activities. They’re all about as fluent as me. They’ve spoken english for 13+ years. If they weren’t fully fluent I would *not* feel uncomfortable for them to speak Russian, because I would understand why they did. I also understand that they prefer to speak their mother tongue, and I respect that. I have never demanded that they speak English, I’ve only told my boyfriend it makes me uncomfortable. I have social anxiety and feeling left out for extended periods of times makes me really anxious. I was also raised in the south, so my parents have always thought me about hospitality to guests, and excluding them is something I would never do. But again, it’s mostly because it makes me feel anxious/forgotten. I hope this clears some things up.**

331,Asshole,"My 14 year old daughter and I generally have a good relationship, she's well behaved, does well in school and has a good social life. Growing up, both her mother and I were very much of the belief that she should always be playing some sort of sport, tennis, netball, gymnastics, she tried out a bit of everything. She never really found something that she loved, and so now that she is in highschool and has a few more excuses for not wanting to play sports, e.g. homework and social stuff, I've been less strict on making sure she is involved with physical activity.

The past few months I've noticed her just generally moving about less. She walks to and from the bus each day, and does PE at school for under 2 hours a week, so she's not getting nearly the recommended amount of exercise for a kid her age. I've started requiring her to do a bit of exercise each day, not a lot, 10-30 minutes is all. It can be pushups alone in her room, yoga, or if I'm going running I'll drag her kicking and screaming for a few kilometers. Literally anything to just get her off her butt for a bit.

I've made sure she understands I'm not doing it to make her lose weight, or for some reason related to that. I purely just want her being physically healthy, as well as socially and mentally.

Most of the time after a bit of grumbling she does some exercise, but occasionally she outright refuses. I've yet to punish her for refusing, although I definitely give her the old two thumbs down when she does. If she was refusing to do her homework, something I consider equally as important, I would have no problem forcing her to do it, but something is irking me about the general idea of forcing her to exercise when she doesn't want to.

332,Not the A-hole,"Hey all ! Finally decided to write this post after a slight discussion on another subreddit. 

I’m (22F) Asian, and we value filial piety quite a bit. However, my family is ... a little bit toxic. A little bit of background, I was a late bloomer in terms of my academics (basically did badly in school till I was 18 where I decided to take studying seriously and managed to enter a local university). As a result, my family often called me names (ie stupid, retarded, autistic etc etc) as well as belittling everything I do. My nickname at home is literally “ stupid kid “. My sister will text me something along the lines of “ hey stupid kid, want dinner tonight? “. The final straw was when my sister shared on Facebook about how stupid I’m because I failed to be accepted into a graduation program at Oxford University. She shared something along the lines of “ Some people are born stupid. Some people should know their limits. Imagine applying to a top university when you are so stupid. Pitiful! “ and my entire immediate family liked the post, some even using the “ Haha “ option. 

So, I have decided to ghost them after graduation. I will still provide monthly allowances to my parents (a common thing in my country) but I don’t plan to talk to them or meet them anymore. 

The thing is, they aren’t exactly abusive family members. They provided me a roof to live under and the basic necessities to survive. Part of me feels like I am being a special, sensitive snowflake while another part of me feels like my anger and hatred is well justified. So, WIBTA if I ghost them and cut off communications?


Edit: Thank you to everybody who has replied and made me realise that my anger and hatred is justified. I read through every one of your comments and you guys have really opened my eyes. To answer some of the questions below:

1. Yes, I have talked to them about it but they brushed it off saying that it was just '' fun and games '' to them. In fact, after bringing it up, they started to call me things like ''sensitive'' and ''crybaby''. That kinda stopped all attempts at me trying to talk it out. The only person who really put in effort to stop the insults was my dad. 

2. It was not only my sisters (I have 3) but my mom and relatives as well. However, it is fair to say that my sisters are the biggest contributors, for sure. 

For those who suggested I do not give any money to them, I am afraid I cannot bring myself to do that. They are, after all, my parents (I will not be giving any money to my sisters). Despite how they are, I was brought up to love them and I believe whatever success I have achieved today are partly due to them. I will however, take the advice you guys have given me and cut off communications with them, unless necessary (ie medical emergencies). After reading all of your comments and with the help of a friend, I have made arrangements for me to move out around the start of next year. So, thank you, all of you, for helping!

Last month she came into work visibly distraught which prompted many people to check up on her, including our supervisors and people from the other teams. We learned that she was getting divorced and our supervisors decided to give her two days off since she was not in a good state to work and it would make everyone distracted. Once she came back, people once again went to check on her and this was when trouble started.

Any sort of conversation with her ended up becoming a conversation about her divorce. You asked for information? Here it is! Also, did you know my husband has been cheating on me and I had to find that out myself? You asked for the time? It's 13pm, which seems like the perfect time to talk about how I'm so strong and brave to even be here without crying! You want a pen? Oh let me tell you about how things are being difficult for my kid who cries asking where daddy is. This happened multiple times, even with people from the other teams. Now I don't know how they felt about it but I know how I felt and I felt fucking annoyed. It all came down last week when we had a deadline to meet and we needed a documment that she was supposed to have given to us already but hadn't. Not only that, but she was late and no one could get ahold of her.

After a lot of calls, coworker just walks into the office 50 minutes late without a care in the world. When we asked about it she said her son was having a hard time with the divorce and she had to do something about it so she took him out for breakfast. Since I just wanted to wrap stuff up so I asked her to give the documment and moved away. Then, she came up to me to apologize and proceeded to start yet another rant about how hard things are for her right now and so on. So I told her to stop, I told her to stop talking about her divorce all the time, I told her that we're not a therapy group for her, I told her that her personal life was not our business and that if she wanted help she should talk to her friends and family. I told her she had been awful to work with ever since that day she came back. This was her cue to start bawling her eyes out as loud as she could.

Everyone heard it, including our supervisors. They asked to talk to us in private, I told them what had happened while she just sat there crying nonstop. They asked everyone about their experiences with her and if they would like to report which I don't know if anyone did. Then, I got a warning for my behavior while she got suspended for a week.

335,Not the A-hole,"So I sat at the table with my mum (I am 16) and the head waiter gave me the menu list and then went away right after, I knew already what to order so I just said sorry and called him but he had already went to do something else. Seemed kinda rude, but I don't care.

So he comes back, asks what I want to order and I say: ""For me a cheeseburger"", I don't remember if I said thanks, but I probably did, pretend like I didn't anyways because I don't remember.

Then I say: ""And also a bottle of water"", dude looked at me and said ""P...p...pl..."" I looked at him and I didn't know what the fuck he wanted at the beginning but when I realised it was too awkward already and he made me feel like a fucking child so I just stared blankly and didn't say anything. Then he said ""Please"" to which I responded ""Oh I am sorry I forgot"".

He goes away and my mother is filled with rage and anger, he calls the waiter and tells him that it was rude to tell me to say please but the waiter then said something about not wanting to be shamed by a boy or something like that but I remember he said something about me being a boy.

I kept saying sorry while my mother and the waiter were talking cause I wanted it to end as soon as possible but it finished with the waiter just going away in a really civic and professional manner.

I usually treat waiters in a really civic manner and always say ""thanks"", ""sorry"" or give them the plates when they cannot reach them. AITA for not saying please?

E: forgot to say that the waiter asked me what I wanted to order before I said ""A cheeseburger"".

E2: said ""for me a cheeseburger"" and not ""a cheeseburger""

E3: removed the word retarded",82,137,0.89
336,No A-holes here,"Alright, long story short. 

I woke up this morning with the girl and we started talking. Somehow my ex got brought up and I was reminded that I tried to see a marriage counselor with my ex. I told my current girlfriend that my ex was upset that the counselor didn't see things her way. I then paraphrased my next statement as if I was talking to my ex, ""Baby, we can't just quit counseling because you don't like the counselor. Find a different one and we'll try again."" 

My current girlfriend then asked me if I had used ""baby"" as a pet name for my ex. When I said that I had she got up and walked to the the bathroom and said, ""Well don't ever call me baby again"" and shut the door that she normally leaves open. 

Am I the asshole fore using ""baby"" on every girl I date? My thought is that ""baby"" very common pet name and not specific to one person so I shouldn't be upset. But if I used a specific pet name for a specific ex then that would be unacceptable and I would understand the frustration.

Edit: FWIW, This is the first time something like this has been brought up and I agreed not to call her ""baby"" anymore. This has not been an ongoing issue.",49,38,0.86

338,Everyone Sucks,"This happened over a decade ago when I was 12/13 years old. 

I used to walk home from middle school every single day. Not out of necessity, but because it made me feel independent and I liked talking to my friends. Accompanying me every day was a close buddy of mine who walked home out of necessity - he couldn't get a ride home most days. Bit of a wild kid but harmless.

While walking home one day, we were going down a quarter mile stretch of a residential area. It got a good amount of traffic after school so cars would drive by pretty slowly. A minivan pulled up with a mom and two kids younger than us, a daughter younger by a year and son maybe in 2nd or 3rd grade. Windows rolled down. 

My friend, trying to be funny I guess, asked if we could get a ride. They said no. He flipped the middle finger at them. They flipped it back and drove off. 

Over the course of the next two weeks, they would drive past us on that same stretch of road with the windows rolled down, every single day. The kids would laugh at us for walking home and flip the middle finger at us. Obviously the mother encouraged it since she made a point to slow down next to us and then speed off. 

Gotta admit it was funny at first but after the third time it got pretty old. I wanted to figure out a way to get them to stop.

My buddy always had a pack of Kool-Aid or Capri sun to drink on the walk home from school so I had a lightbulb moment and decided a plan at lunch time. The next day while walking home I grabbed his Kool-Aid pouch, stuck the straw in, and as they drove by I aimed towards the window and fired a huge shot of Kool-Aid straight into the open passenger side window where the daughter sat. 

The goal was to get it in the girl's mouth while she was laughing at us because that would be pretty funny, but it missed and went all over the dashboard. It must have been about half of the pouch.

The mom slammed on her brakes, jumped out of the car and screamed at me. My buddy ran off down the street and waited for me near his house. I guess he felt bad for running off or just wanted to hear what happened. The mom told me she'd call the cops if we ever did that again and all that jive.

They never harassed us again after this.

Let me be clear that I think the mom is a definite ass hole for what she was doing. And my buddy is definitely an ass hole for flipping them off and running away when the Kool-Aid happened.

AITA for squirting Kool-Aid in this woman's minivan?",49,194,0.92

340,Not the A-hole,"So my older sister is a medical doctor and I am really proud of her. My parents wanted me to go into that however it is a very competitive area, my A Levels did not stack up and UKCAT (UKCAT is like an IQ test of some sorts that tests your problem solving) was not good enough. Universities did not want me. Fair enough that was in the past, I've gotten over it.

The reason my older sister got into med school was purely because she got invited into a programme that allows you to get into a certain med school at lower grade boundaries and they ignore the UKCAT results. My A Levels were better than hers and my UKCAT were also better. She only got into that med school and nowhere else.

So my younger sister is going through the same process now, doing her A Levels and UKCAT and she also asks me for advice for her personal statement and I give her ideas. My older sister shoots me down and said that only her opinion counts as she is the only one who got into med school. (It was 10 years since she last applied to med school so I think I can say that some of the points may have changed since then).

What I also noticed is that she says some really offhanded comments like ""This is what you get for messing about. A shit prospect."" Or talk about other people degrees like ""This is what a 2:2 degree gets you, a dead-end job.""

Thing is she didn't get a first, only a 2:1 in her degree I think and that she always say this kind of shit. I just straight up told her ""I don't care if you were the only one who got into med school as you only got in because of an hand out and it does not count.""

I am not saying her hard work is for nothing during her medical degree and when she also became a doctor, i'm proud of her for accomplishing that however she has no right to say that about anyone else.

She is angry at me and rightfully so as I called her degree a hand out but she doesn't have the right to dismiss what people are saying or to say shit about people just because their life strayed a bit.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: People are saying that I am just jealous. I am not, I am happy for her. I wouldn't have said that at all if she didn't keep on belittling everyone who isn't a doctor. She says offhand comments about close family members. Singles me out and calls me an idiot. If you think no one would snap after such belittlement, then you guys are just push overs.

Also I was calling her admission into med school a hand out. That is what I meant. Because ultimately it is what it is. She got into that position because of circumstances. If she didn't have those circumstances, they would have instantly rejected her. People have parents divorced just to get accepted into that programme. Her staying in med school and graduating which took a lot of hard work and time. I am proud of her for that. 

She is my sister and I love her however I just can't stand this constant belittlement.",211,904,0.92

342,Not the A-hole,"My sister has never put much thought into how she’s going to afford to be alive. She doesn’t have ambition.  
 
Ever since she was little, when asked what she wants to be, she’d jokingly answer that her plan is to be a stay at home mom. She’s still saying it, but now she isn’t joking.  
 
She doesn’t even have that much experience with kids! She’s never baby sat. 
 
Recently she’s been telling family members she’s going to nursing school which is amazing! I wanted to talk to about it and praise her.
 
I visited home last weekend (she still lives with my parents) and asked her what her plans are — in a sisterly way not in a “this is a setup to lecture you way”. She said she’s been lying to the the family and that she plans to keep working her minimum wage job until she meets a man she wants to settle down with. From there the conversation went like this: 
 
Me (irritated): there are no Prince Charming in real life, Rosie 
 
Rosie (irritates): yea ... I know ... I’m not looking for a Prince Charming. I want to find a man to raise up.
 
Me: but you are. You want someone to come take over your life because you don’t have the motivation to do better on your own. If your whole life’s goal is to find a man to love you, it’s going to push you into the arms of the wrong kind of man. Also, how are you gonna “raise up” a man if you can’t even raise yourself up? Do you want to be like mom? 
 
Rosie: no! I’m not going to be like mom! I’m going to do it better! I saw what she did and now I can do better! 
 
Me: well do better but improving yourself before you get knocked up. You don’t remember but from 8 until 13 I watched you and (brother) every night while mom partied until 3 because she got pregnant too early, didn’t have time for herself, and resented us. That’s going to be you.  
 
My sister was crying at this point said fuck you, and left.

343,Not the A-hole,"UPDATE: Idk if you just edit and put the update or what but here goes. After reading all of your comments, though I couldn’t reply to all of them, and taking them into careful consideration I have uninvited my “friends”. Coincidentally, something important with school came up (for those that may want to know what, I’ve been working with the school newspaper for about a year and I’ve been offered a higher position and was asked to man the booth at the club fair tomorrow morning) so I have blamed the last minute cancellation on that. I will not let them come over in the future and will keep a watchful eye for people that attempt to do the same thing. Thank you, reddit! :)


In my first semester at college, my roommate was the partying type and ended up dropping out by the end of the semester but we’re still friends and she comes to stay with me sometimes to go to our parties and whatnot. 

I (18F) pretty recently got a new apartment near my college. It’s been rough making ends meet financially in my own place for the first time but it’s getting easier. 

When my friend comes, she usually brings one or two of her friends to crash for the night but they almost always end up staying longer. This is fine by me most of the time because I enjoy the company. I try to be a good host and offer to cook meals and some small snacks. However, they usually go over board while raiding my kitchen when I’m not there to supervise and I wake up to lots of my food being made and my drinks being drank. 

I understand that they’re guests in my house and they need to eat/drink and whatever but the last time they came in late July, it started to kind of be an issue. They would help themselves without asking me to my keuring coffee cup things, any and all snacks they could find, water bottles, pasta, you name it. They’re also the kind to do something without asking and then say something about it later, like “I took this, hope you don’t mind”.

Soon after their last visit, I went on a vacation for a couple weeks to see my parents and left my kitchen in it’s barren state. My parents, as they usually do before each semester, pooled together some money to give me for groceries. The food that I buy is supposed to last me for a good while into the semester so that I don’t have to worry about it. My kitchen is full of food, drinks, snacks, beer. All things appetizing to a college age person. 

Last night my friend texted me and asked if she could crash at my place tomorrow (tonight) because there’s a party tonight, and I said yes as long as they bring their own food and alcohol, etc. However, I would not put it above these friends to steal my beer and some snacks while I’m asleep because they think I won’t care or notice. (Inb4, “your friends suck, don’t invite them over” we’re way past that, I said they could already) I’m all for sharing but I don’t want them taking the food that was specifically bought for me so that I don’t have to worry about scraping up the little money that I have to eat. 

WIBTA for putting a padlock on my fridge and locking it up while I can’t directly watch what they might take?

Edit: A lot of people are commenting that I should just talk to them and tell them to not take it, but my point here is that I’m worried that they will anyway because they think I won’t notice or care.

Edit again: blows my mind how many people can’t understand that I’ve told them to not eat my food. They agreed, but the issue here is that I’m worried they will ANYWAY despite me expressing my concerns.",364,1418,0.93

345,Not the A-hole,"I've (M34) been working at the same office for about five years. My co-workers are mostly married women my age. There are no other men at the office, except for a much younger intern.

I've been in a relationship with my partner (M39) for eight years. We don't tend to share private information at work. Well, my partner has a co-worker and former college classmate he's particularly close to, so I know he's only told him about us.

On the other hand, I don't like or trust my co-workers or superior enough to share the details of my relationship, especially the gay part. The problem is I work in a very small environment and my co-workers talk about their marriages and kids every time they're on a break.

So yeah, I eventually grew tired of their questions and made up a woman ""Angela"" that I swap for my partner in such conversations. I still try to participate as little as possible, but when it becomes unavoidable, having an imaginary female partner seems convenient.

My question is, do you think I'm morally an asshole for doing this?

My partner knows, he thinks it's funny and we often joke about what ""Angela"" has been up to, or me cheating on him with ""Angela"". But when I recently told my brother the story, he thought it was immature and thought I should simply tell my co-workers nothing or tell them the truth.

346,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé (25) and I (23) have his little brothers (9 & 10) staying with us for a week. Fiancé has taken a weeks holiday to do this. He didn't really check it over with me, but I don't mind. I love these kids and I've known them for over 8 years. When we did talk, my only comments were that, because I was still going to be working for 4 days of the trip, my fiancé would have to take on majority of the housework, organise food shopping BEFORE they got here and arrange for us all to do some trips and activities on the days I'm off work. No doubt the rest of the time they'll all be sat playing computer games.

I was at work yesterday but woke up early to do some extra housework so my fiancé wouldn't have to do as much but before I left I told him to finish the washing up and put dishes away and to make sure he went shopping as it was Sunday and the shops close at 4. 

I got home at about 6.30pm and the kitchen is a mess, the washing up hasn't been finished and there are discarded coats, shoes, amazon boxes and computers on the floor. I think ""oh well, they must have been busy spending time together and it's not much washing up"".

I ask what we're having for tea, my fiancé says ""I haven't been yet. But it's ok. Lidl doesn't close til 8"". I tell him he's wrong, its Sunday so everywhere closes at 4. ""Oh, well we'll probably have something in the freezer""... We don't. I've been working all weekend so haven't had time to do the shopping. I told you before and you said you'd do it.

I ended up finding an off licence about a 15 minute walk away that was still open. My fiancé hadn't walked the dog, so I took my fiancés card to pay. £25 for some chicken nuggets, potato waffles, a bottle of pop, some snacks for the (very hungry) kids and a couple of cans of beer.

We get home and fiancé tells me he'll move the computers whilst I cook. Nope. Not happening. You had all day to do it I'm going to sit on my ass with a beer and spend some time with the kids.

I went to bed around 11pm, leaving my fiancé and the boys playing computer games. At 3am him and the kids are still awake and fiancé is planning on sleeping on the floor in there. Fine, as long as you wake up first thing to get stuff for breakfasts and sort the pets.

It's now 12.30pm, I've been awake since 8 and begrudgingly sorted the pets. The kids have both just woke up, hungry but there's nothing in and my fiancé is still fast asleep.

I plan to get the kids to try and wake him up but if he doesnt, I'm taking my fiancés card and taking the kids out to get something to eat in the town centre. But I'm going to refuse any and all responsibility from here on out. I'm not going shopping, I will only do my share of housework, I will only walk the dog on my days off/the evening, I won't make plans but if none are made, I'll do my own thing because I don't want to spend my time off sat in the house whilst everyone plays on computer games.

348,Asshole,"No disclaimers, no apologies, let’s get right into it. 

I’m one of those parents who got their 10 year old a phone mainly for stuff like getting a hold of her after school in case pickup plans change and other emergencies. 

Her dad and I are separated and I am married to her stepdad which is all fine, it’s amicable. I have her weekdays and he has her every weekend. 

Predictably, my daughter uses her phone a lot, mainly for YouTube - she doesn’t have any kind of social media - and texting her one other friend who has a phone. Her usage has been a little over the top, I rarely see her without the thing in her hand but one of the reasons I am feeling like IWBTA for restricting her use is because she uses it to communicate with her dad. 

A lot. 

He texts her constantly and vice versa and calls her in the morning and at night and they’re on the phone for 30 mins to 2 hours on average. This is constantly interfering with stuff like trying to get her off to school on time, getting her to eat dinner, bed etc. I’ve talked to her dad about it and asked him only to call at certain times and to try not to keep her on the phone for too long for those reasons, but there are other reasons I am concerned. 

Despite our separation and the fact she spends the week with me and weekends with him, my daughter has always been more attached to her dad. Like, slept in bed with him til she was about 7, wouldn’t sleep on her own at his place unless he camped out on the floor, that kind of stuff. It got better between 8 years old and now, but then I got her the phone and while I have no problem her using it to keep in touch with him I’m concerned about the over-attachment again. 

I totally get that it’s normal for kids of separated parents to have separation anxiety and all kinds of fixation issues and what not but I’m concerned that getting the phone has made it worse again. So WIBTA for restricting her phone use, including telling her she can’t stay on the phone for hours with her dad? Or is this normal and am I overreacting? I know I am probably TA for getting her a phone in the first place and not anticipating these kinds of problems, but I’d love some perspective.",84,52,0.8
349,Asshole,"My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

We’re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

350,No A-holes here,"[UPDATE] 
8 months ago my GF (Mary) of 9 years informed me that she wished to help pay for her sister's(Emma) ongoing cancer treatment. I'm not a controlling/heartless individual, I let my Mary know that I find it incredibly noble that she wants to take on that responsibility & would be happy to cover more of the bills we share (we have been living together for about 6 years & have two wonderful children) to allow her to do so. Fast forward to present day & Emma's condition has taken a toll for the worse, the doctors' opinions on her current state are that she will likely not last another 6 months, but they informed us that she qualifies for an experimental treatment that could possibly slow or even stop the cancer currently ravaging her body, something I initially felt was fantastic news,sadly this is where my personal dilemma begins. This potentially life saving treatment is incredibly costly, so costly infact Mary has no way of affording it & her sisters insurance will not even entertain the idea of funding experimental treatment. Mary recently came to me & asked me to please help her fund the procedure, she knows that I have a bit of an inheritance from my grandfather's passing & a savings account I have paid into since I was 18. Without divulging the full extent of my saving or the cost of the treatment I can say my savings are at a low seven figure sum & that I would be left with about 10% of it after funding the treatment. I can honestly say I panicked when she asked me, maybe it makes me selfish but I had no desire to give up that amount of money to help Emma, quite frankly I'm not even fond of Emma she was never kind to me before growing sick & strongly opposed to my relationship with Mary ,but I understand how much she means to Mary & that they share a very deep & loving sisterly bond so I did my best to get along with her & even help Mary in supporting her to an extent. I told Mary I needed time to think & that perhaps I could help her setup a GoFundMe, but she seemed to know immediately what that meant, in our 9 years together I don't think I've ever seen her look at me like that, with such a combination of hurt & loathing. I genuinely don't know what to do Reddit, I feel terrible that Mary is suffering, but these savings are something I worked almost my entire life to accrue, despite my inheritance most of the money in that account is money I worked like a dog to collect. I skipped fancy meals, didn't vacation, worked multiple jobs with long hours & spent as sparingly as possible with the dream of retiring young & being able to provide for myself & my family while doing so ,Mary of course being included in that dream. I'm not ready or willing to start over so that MAYBE Emma will survive, I fear I may lose Mary over this & I feel disgusted with myself for putting a price tag on a human life, but I just can't do it. AITA

TLDR: My girlfriend of 9 years wants me to fund an extremely expensive experimental treatment that may save her sisters life but would cost me nearly my entire life savings.

Update for clarification: The cost of treatment is an accumaltive number that factors in more than just the cost of the drug (which I would be required to pay for), such as additional medical care, relocation & taking over the full cost of her sisters current treatment as her sister was receiving treatment in the Dominican Republic as a low income citizen & would need to move to Mexico.

UPDATE: I just wanted to thank everyone, regardless of your opinion, for taking the time to read my post & offer your perspective. To all the survivors out their reading this, to those who have lost someone, thank you a million times for sharing your stories with me. I received many questions & unfortunately I don't have all the answers, I created a list of questions I could find after reading, what was honestly a staggering amount of messages for me. I didn't think this would catch any real form of attention & expected it to be buried within a day, but I digress.

I will answer the questions to the best of my ability & with as much transparency possible ,while still maintaining anonymity.

1. Emma's condition is a form of melanoma, she is currently Stage 4.
2. The treatment they are hoping to pursue is cryo-immunotherapy, the doctor in the Dominican Republic referred to it as ""experimental & relatively new unproven method"".
3. The reason the cost is so high is due to the fact that if Emma moved I would take over paying ALL aspects of her treatment. That would include her medications, all testing, physician pay, housing/relocation & based on the timeline a live in caretaker for hospice care.
4. Emma & Mary have very little living family left & what little does remain is in no financial condition to donate such large sums.
5.Friends will no longer donate funds, this is not a new condition for Emma, as I stated in the original post my wife started handling payments 8 months ago ,but before that Emma had already received various donations when the cancer was not so advanced.
6. The hospitals being used in both the Dominican Republic & Mexico have good reputations from what I could gather.
7. I at this point cannot prove or disprove that this is a scam, unscrupulous people are everywhere & as one redditor  put it ""the doctor may have drank the Kool-Aid"".
8. The choice to not get married was Mary's, she has a very negative view on it due to a complex personal history that I don't feel is my place to speak further on.
9. I am not ludicrously wealthy, I have a decent job & save heavily. I have been doing so for more than 20 years.
10. I have since spoken to Mary, she is upset ,but following the numerous bits of advice generously offered here, I believe I have bypassed a worse scenerio. She is upset , she is hurting, but she agrees that our childrens well being should go first. She is staying at her sisters side & has asked for some space while she goes over her feelings.
11. I have spoken to Emma, she has told me that I am a monster & that I will burn in hell for taking even a 1% chance from her. If I where religious I'd likely agree. 
12. This isn't about the money , this is about security. I grew up very poor, my father was our sole provider & he lost his ability to pursue his career of choice very early-on due to an illness. I watched my father work himself to death, I honestly believe if we had more money at the time my father would still be with us.

I hope this provides closure for some of you, thank you for restoring a bit of my faith in humanity everyone.",1188,3150,0.97
351,Not the A-hole,"I (34F) own a house. Recently my aunt (52F) needed a place to stay after her divorce and asked me if she could for a few weeks. I apologized and said I couldn't do that (the real reason is that we aren't close and the few times a year I see her she acts all annoying about my tattoos and piercings) but my mum talked me into it so I agreed she could stay for a month.

About my house. I normally live alone and the house is pretty messy. Nothing like hoarders but dishes piled up in the sink, toilet and shower don't get cleaned that often, stuff gets left out. Kinda gross but whatever it's my damn house and I don't really mind the mess. When talking to my aunt I explained this and she seemed to not really care.

Now she's been here for a few days and already she's been a bit of a nuisance. Generally kind of nosy and criticizing things about my house and how I dress (like shit, but again, its my house and if i want to look ""trashy"" or not wear a bra then I will). When she does I just kinda say ""oh yep"" and disengage from her.

Today she knocked on my door and asked when I was going to clean the place as it's a ""pigsty"". I said I wasn't planning on it. She didn't really like that and started listing off all the stuff wrong with my house so I just said ""ok"" and closed the door and went back to what I was doing. Later I went out of my room to fix dinner and she left the guest room to start hovering over me in the kitchen and pointing out all the messes that I don't care about. I was getting real pissed by this point and said ""look you're staying here as a guest and you're not paying rent or anything to me. I'm only letting you stay here because my mum doesn't want you to struggle so if you don't like the mess either clean it yourself or move out.""

She backed off after that but later that night I got a text from my mum imploring me to be more patient since aunt's going through a rough time. I asked why she couldn't just stay with her but she said there's not enough room... her house is bigger than mine and the only other person she's living with is her husband. I'm kind of really annoyed with both my mum and aunt right now, am I justified or am I just being a cranky bitch?",33,45,0.96
352,Everyone Sucks,"tl;dr at end.

My fiance and I are traveling Europe, and are currently in the French Riviera.

Last night was our last night there, and my fiance and I decided to go out for one last French meal before we left, and decided on a restaurant that looked promising.

All of the nearby restaurants were rather busy, and this one was no exception, though there were a few free tables. We sat at a table, and were greeted by a server a few minutes later to inform us that the restaurant was busy, and we'd likely be waiting about 30 minutes, up to an hour maximum, to be served our food. We said we didn't mind waiting.

Timeline:

15 min: My fiance politely waves to a server, who in turn waves back and then walks away

20 min: I manage to get the attention of another server as she passes by. My fiance asks for some water for us, in French. We are told this is not possible, as we are not being served yet.

30 min: We get the menus, and order a couple of glasses of wine, a share plate, and our entrees. Two new tables of guests arrive.

45 min: We receive our water and wine. So do the two newer tables.

1h 15 min: We receive our share plate (6 escargot). One of the newer tables has already been served their entire meal, and is getting ready to leave.

1h 30 min: The other newer table receives their food. Servers tell us that our food is ""coming"", but when we ask about the wait, we are told the kitchen is busy.

1h 45 min: We are asked if we would like more water or wine. I ask bluntly ""where's our food?"". We are told that we were warned about the kitchen being busy. We reminded her of what the estimated wait time, including the ""maximum"", to which she says that she isn't in the kitchen, and how is she to know.

2h: Our mains arrive. A small bowl each of mixed vegetables, a small piece of steak for my fiance, and seven small pieces of duck for me.

My fiance asks to speak to a manager. The server says she is the manager. They discuss the wait times. I chime in when the server lies about the service thus far. The manager asks us what we think they should do about it. My fiance says that if anything like this happened in her restaurant (she's a server), that there would be compensation to the guest.

This continues for a few minutes until a man comes out and takes our plates away, telling us to get out and never come back. Angrily, I go to pay for the wine and escargot. They tell us to keep our change, and that we're the only people to ever have a problem with the service.

As we start to leave, he calls us English-speakers and flips us off.

The dirty looks from the other guests and the unanimous decision from the staff suggests that we were in the wrong, but I disagree. So reddit, especially European redditors, are we the asshole tourists?

tl;dr: Waited two hours for our food at a restaurant while others were served. Complained to the manager and were kicked out.",114,138,0.96

354,Asshole,"So the situation is that I, a collage student living in a dorm 20 eu miles away, have a single mother that decided to help her former pupil find a property in our hopeless housing market. He stays in her house until he finds somewhere to move out.

I found out about this a few months ago and I didn't think much of it, she have helped former students earlier so it's not something new. What's different is that this pupil is older than me, and I'm not living with my mother like I did when we were a foster home for people my age.

So now during at the end of summer I got the chance to go home and stay with my mother for a week, but I also had to accept that there suddenly was an middle-aged man living in the house too. 

We don't have any out-house, so the 'tenant' lives in a room next to mine.

I can't help it, but I feel a *strong* and unjustified dislike for him. It's the kind of dislike where you don't want to accept anything he offers, for example he bought breakfast bread for all of us, but I felt a real conflict bordering on disgust before taking a loaf.

The thing that makes me so conflicted is that he is a damned chill dude, he continually offers me a job in his carpentry firm, he tries to be engaged in my interests in a non-patronizing way. 

The fact that he tries his best to create a positive relationship between us, and my feeling that I'm upset at what's essentially my mothers concern, is making me uncertain. It feels like I'm trying to control my mothers life and decide what she is and isn't allowed to do, as if I seeing him as a sexual threat or something. My inherent dislike for a man that needs help also makes it feel like I'm unfair.

It all makes me feel like I Am The Asshole.",72,67,0.82

358,Not the A-hole,"I don't know how to handle this one.

I'm going to start this off with this - I'm a feminist. I believe women when they come forward with allegations of abuse. I believe that the ""false accusation"" narrative is mostly fabricated by Red Pill assholes. 

So anyway, my ex and I were pretty sexually adventurous and decided to start a Pornhub channel. We uploaded maybe a half dozen videos before deciding that it wasn't worth it. We never deleted the channel. 

After our split, I get an email from my ex (we remained amicable) asking if I had the login info to the channel and if I could take down the videos. I immediately did this, sending her screenshots as proof.

A few weeks later, our amicable friendship went south when she saw me on Tinder. I woke up one morning to about a dozen messages from friends asking, ""what the fuck is wrong with you.""

By the time I was able to get a straight answer, I'd learned that my ex had accused me of uploading the videos without her consent, and that she never knew about the Pornhub channel. 

This went down about a year ago. I've moved on. I'm really hurt about the friends that I lost, but I really didn't have much evidence - of so I thought.

I stumbled across an old Google Drive the other day. In that Google Drive were the images that PornHub requires to be uploaded for verification. Very clearly there are photos of her, myself, and both of us together holding ""PORNHUB.COM"" signs. In the same folder are photos of both of our Identifications. 

Furthermore, I have the emails where she specifically asked me to take down the porn we'd uploaded, which indicates she was fully aware of what was happening. 

So Reddit... WIBTA for using this evidence to clear my name? Or do I just move on and eat the loss of friends/reputation? I feel like it's been so long that I'd look petty. I also feel like coming forward like this could discourage other, legitimate victims of revenge porn from speaking up.

359,Asshole,"I own a pub/bar one of many in this highly populated part of my city. So, far too often people lose their phones when they have been drinking and it's up to me and my employees to collect them at the end of a night or to hold onto them if they have been turned in. There is almost a bucket full of them at this current time and more every day. 

Today, a young girl came in to explain she'd lost her phone and has been in contact with one of my girls (Emily) who said she'd put the phone aside for the girl to retrieve it. She gave a description of the phone and we brought it from the safe where Emily had been keeping it for her. I gave the phone to the girl, she unlocked it and began to check the messages she had missed and thanked me. 

I told her that ""people come in here with their thousand dollar phones (it was an iPhone X) lose them, and are quite lucky that my girls go to all the trouble to find their contact information and pass the message along to them that their phone was found at my pub."" I told her that ""due to all the effort that Emily went through you have to give us $20 so that I can pass it along to her. That's the deal."" It's a $1000 phone I'm saving her so $20 should be nothing really. 

She laughed and said ""so long as you actually give it to her and keep it for yourself."" I don't like to have my integrity questioned however I told her I am the owner of the pub I really don't need another $20. It's for my employee who was kind enough to take care of the phone and notify the girl her phone was left at my pub. 

She asked if there's a local ATM and I pointed to the one near the door and after a moment's hesitation she went to the ATM and withdrew the $20 and gave it to me before thanking me and leaving. 

Her boyfriend beside her appeared quite suspicious/critical of me once I demanded the $20 and I saw him talking in her ear when they were walking toward the ATM and due to this I decided I'll check with the people of Reddit.

360,Not the A-hole," My husband and I have been married for about 2 years, with him proposing about 3 years ago. After we got engaged, a couple of people suggested I get my engagement ring insured. Husband bought the ring from a well-known chain jewelry store and has a warranty on it that covers damages but it wouldn’t be covered in the event that it was lost or stolen. I considered getting the ring itself insured but our renter’s insurance covers up to a couple of thousand dollars in jewelry so I figured additional insurance would only be worth it if the ring was valued well over that amount. Now I had an idea what the ring costs just from owning jewelry all my life and didn’t think it was more than that, but just to be sure I looked up the ring on the jewelry chain’s website rather than bring it to be appraised. I was right that our renter’s insurance was enough to cover the cost of the ring if it was stolen so I left it at that. 

Well a few weeks ago my SIL (husband’s sister) gets engaged to her long-time boyfriend and he proposes with a massive diamond that his whole family is still talking about. It is a beautiful ring and I told her and her fiancé that when they showed us at dinner. 

My husband immediately got defensive and started to say that even though my ring is smaller, he still paid a lot of money for it. I said I know and I love it and me complimenting his sister’s ring was not a knock against my own ring. 

For whatever reason, on our way home, he tells me he paid X amount of dollars for the ring and that’s all he could afford. But I know for a fact that’s not what he paid because I had previously looked it up. In fact, he more than doubled the actual price of the ring. I asked him if that was truly what he paid and he questioned why I was asking and I told him how I had looked into the price of the ring after he initially gave it to me for insurance purposes and it was listed at half that amount online. 

He then started saying well actually it wasn’t X amount, it was maybe Y amount, but really maybe Z amount on sale, etc. I just kind of nodded and decided to move on because it was clear he was lying and the price doesn’t matter to me and I didn't want to make him feel bad. He then angrily demanded to know why I looked up the price in the first place. I again explained about the insurance and told him that if I did get it insured, I would have had to have it appraised anyway and would know the cost. 

He’s still upset with me for doing this and thinks I think the ring is cheap and only looked it up to prove how cheap it was. This, of course, is not true, I love my ring and have always said so, but my husband is very annoyed I ""went out of my way"" to find the cost. 

So AITA for looking up the price of my engagement ring and then calling out my husband’s lie about how much it costs? Should I have just let him lie about it so he wouldn't feel embarrassed?",90,393,0.94
361,Not the A-hole,"My dog died and I decided I didn’t want to have pets again, at least not any time soon.  I loved that dog but she was really high maintenance and had a lot of issues.  My family and friends knew that I didn’t want another pet, but they all chipped in together to get me a puppy... from a backyard puppy mill.  They kept saying things like “your next dog won’t be like your last one”, and “don’t give up on all animals, they need you and it’s not fair to the ones who have done nothing wrong”, and “you’ll get a new dog and realize how silly you’re being” and other really patronizing things. 

No surprise, this puppy mill doesn’t give refunds on “returns” and so my family and friends would be out the $$ they paid for the dog.  I told them repeatedly I didn’t want a dog and so I feel like their “gift” was really disrespectful, and on top of all of it, reprehensible because it was from an irresponsible breeder.

The dog is currently at my house and has been there for about a week.  My mother in particular has been laying on the guilt thick- that I’m an ahole for not appreciating a gift (one that I will have to look after for 12+ years), that if I get rid of the dog that I’m punishing it for something that isn’t its fault, that I have room at my house for the dog so there’s no reason I can’t keep it, that it’s already bonded with me, etc. She of course finds the idea of taking the dog herself to be a “slap in the face”, and thinks that trying to give it to someone else is disrespectful.  The other friends I’ve talked to about it agree with my mom, stating mostly that it’s not the dog’s fault and it’s not fair to abandon it now that it has a “fur-ever” home.  

Is there any way I can rehome this dog without being the ahole?

My wife and I are considered lower middle class and have three children 24,16 and 11. Three years ago, our oldest came out to us as transgender. We told her we would help in any way to ease her transition. She said she had everything covered since she already finished school, moved out of our home, working a decent job and had considerable savings. She had already spoken to her insurance company about coverage, seen a doctor about starting HRT and was seeing a therapist. I felt she had things in order, but my wife had the foresight to start putting money aside for my daughter, so we could help reduce any future costs.

Two years ago, my daughter moved to a more friendly LGBTQ+ city for better job opportunities and to have a more expanded community. Last year, she opened a second Instagram account and would post about expensive trips she was taking with her boyfriend and friends. My wife and I grew suspicious and asked about how she was paying for the trips. She explained she saved for the trips and her boyfriend was helping to pay. Since she is an adult, we didn’t dig deeper.

A week ago, my daughter came home for my 50th birthday and told us that she was ready to start scheduling her surgeries. Insurance will cover bottom surgery. However certain ones like, breast augmentation and surgery to gain a feminine face and body are considered cosmetic and are not covered.

When asked about how she attended to pay for these, she said that she wanted us to pay for everything.

My wife told her about the money that was set aside which amounts to about $4000. My daughter said she needed over $40 grand for the surgeries and possibly more to cover her living expenses, since she won’t be working while she recovers. We asked about the money she saved. She lied and said it wasn’t enough. When pushed more, she broke down and admitted that she had no more saving and that she was in debt. The city she moved to had a higher cost of living then she expected, plus the trips she took were financed by her savings, credit cards and payday loans.

I told her we were not in a position to give her $40 grand, but the money that was saved could go towards her debt. She cried and reiterated she needed the full $40 grand or she would never be a real woman. My wife and I tried to come up with reasonable solutions, but my daughter kept insisting for the full amount. At some point, my wife told her that she was being selfish for not thinking about her siblings who still need our support. The two argued and my daughter eventually stormed out of the house.

Now I’m at a crossroads, I am considering getting a second job to help my daughter and so she doesn’t do anything she’ll regret, but then again, I feel that she needs to learn my wife and I can’t fix everything. AITA

In the span of a month he went from telling me he loved me and wanting to work on our problems - which to be honest were totally fixable with a little effort from both sides - to ignoring me for days on end, canceling our date nights and finally dumping me via text message at work. Long story short, it has been the most horribly painful experience of my life.

Six days later he debuted a new girl at an event with all our friends. She had given him her number in front of me a month prior, and I hadn't thought twice about it because she knew we were a couple and I trusted him.

When I let his parents know we weren't together anymore (he didn't tell them!) they had expressed a desire to keep in touch anyway. I had hesitantly agreed, thinking maybe I could get to a place of friendship with my ex and it wouldn't feel weird to hear from his parents every now and then.

But my sister become addicted to her's like CRAZY addicted she would be on it constantly and would absolutely lose her mind and act like her life is over if she doesn't have it.

Now I love my sister but she not the most behaved or patient person her attitude has caused her a lot of problems and really took a toll on her relationship with me and our other siblings.

Now a few months ago she broke her computer charger and being the sweet sister I am I let her borrow it and for almost a year we shared it.

IT WAS HELL!!!

She was mean, demanding,and selfish but I kept giving it to her and yes it was bad but it got worst when she BROKE her computer. 

Like I said I never used it so the entire summer she's used it and it was okay because I never wanted it. 

Now we're here and I'm back to school and my entire algebra class is completely paperless so I need my computer 24/7 because I really suck at algebra.

Now my sister has been the worst throwing tantrums, crying, screaming, call me names, and just been unbearable. She also so rude to me if I'm using it or if I forget to charge it.

Now my parents just makes me give it to her anyways despite how she treats me so I've been thinking that I should take my charger to school with me that way to can't use it when I'm not home.

(I do a lot of after-school stuff so I'm home pretty late)

then I would do my homework which takes me hours which means he also can't use it

367,Everyone Sucks,"Background: My parents have a long history of oversharing their kids’ information.  Some were egregious: when my older sister started menstruating, they called a bunch of relatives and told them.  Some were just annoying: I was on a stressful work trip in a city 2 hours from where my mom’s cousin lives and mom made a point of calling to tell her, which meant I had to field calls and texts to explain why it wasn’t possible for me to go meet up with them in person during the 30 hr trip even though it was “so close”.  I still hear about how I came so near where they live but didn’t take time to go see them and it’s been 2 years!  

Currently: I recently bought a condo which is my first non-rental home as an adult.  I covered the down payment myself and have been financially independent since I was 24.  I did rely heavily on my parents during the closing process for advice on the paperwork, going over the inspection, and general knowledge of how things work when you are buying a home. I went for a visit and walked in to hearing my dad talking to his brother and he goes ahead and lays out how much my condo cost, how much of a down payment I made, how much my monthly mortgage will be, and what my condo fees will be.  I got angry and made a wtf? face while he was on the phone and once he had hung up, demanded to know why he was telling people this information.  My dad got really angry too and snapped back that I’m stupid for being upset about him sharing publicly available information with his own brother. Then stormed off muttering about how I have no values or sense of what it means to be family. 

I complained to my sister about it and with no hesitation, she told me I was unreasonable and that I had made a fuss over nothing.  I felt strongly in the moment and even now when I’m calm that my privacy was being infringed on, but it seems I’m the only one in my immediate family who thinks that.  Am I really the asshole here?

Update: Thanks for the feedback.  Many of you said that I shouldn’t have let them get so involved and I totally agree. At the time, I caved because my Parents were already so angry because they found out I was looking for a condo and made an offer without telling them.  There were tears and yelling from them and when dad demanded to see the papers, I wussed out and justified it by telling myself that at least I’d be able to avoid a big mistake if he is looking things over too.

So about a year ago my wife’s sister found out that she couldn’t carry a child to term due to various medical complications. Because of this, she wants my wife to carry her and her husband’s child because she cannot. This makes me extremely uncomfortable for various reasons, and is a deal breaker for me and told her I would consider ending the relationship if she went through with it. Not only would I be with my wife for the entire nine months of the pregnancy, but I fear that my wife will also have an attachment to another family’s child in the process. 

I would assume that her sisters friends would be willing to carry the child, but we haven’t asked yet. There are likely other options other than my wife carrying her sisters child to term, and my wife feels that I’m being unreasonable for not wanting her to carry her sister and husband’s child. In addition to the possible complications that come with my wife going through childbirth and being a surrogate, would I be the asshole for not wanting to let her have the baby and wanting to end the relationship if she did?

373,Not the A-hole,"Not a long story but there’s an outdoor outlet mall near my house and I usually bring my dog there during the summer. Dogs are allowed at the mall if they’re on a leash and don’t go inside the store.

He’s very anxious and I’m trying to acclimate him around people. I thought this was a good way since he’s on the leash near me and there’s usually a ton of people walking around. 

Usually I’ll sit on the bench and let him sit on the ground and just let him chill out and watch people go by.  People do go up to me and ask if they can pet him and I say that he’s anxious so he’ll probably bark at them. Most people understand this and they will either walk away or crouch down and let him sniff their hand. 

Today was particularly busy since it’s back to school season. I see a parent and her child is running around bumping into people and the mom is just on her phone not caring and letting her kid (probably around 6/7) run around crazy. Anyway this kid comes charging at my dog and it surprises him and repeatedly barks at the kid. The kid gets scared, falls over and starts to cry. 

The mom finally pays attention to her kid and realized he was crying. She says “Control your stupid dog, look what it did to my kid” and she is just yelling at me calling me irresponsible and stupid. And then she says “You need to train effing your dog” and she’s just keeps getting mad, yelling and cursing at me while her kid is throwing a fit. 

At this point I’m fuming and I finally get a word in and say “You should really pay attention to your kid instead of your phone, this wouldn’t have happened if you actually paid attention and didn’t let him run around like crazy “ This made her even mad and said “I can let my kid do what ever I want I’m his mother” to that I said “Well he’s my dog and he was sitting here calmly until your son spooked him, you should really teach your kids some manners.” Anyway at this point she’s calling me names and yelling at me so I said fuck you have a nice day and walked away. 

My mom saw the whole thing and told me I should’ve just apologized to her. But honestly I don’t think I was in the wrong since my dog and I were just minding our own business.

377,Not the A-hole,"This happened about a year ago.  I (24m) had a friend (25f) who'd confided in me that she was aromantic. After getting closer for several months, she one day told me that she had a crush on me, and that her feelings for me were the first time she'd had romantic feelings for a person, ever. I was in a long term relationship at the time, which she knew about, so I just kinda tried to be supportive and told her I didn't reciprocate but was glad that she felt she could trust me enough to tell me. And while it was a complete shock at the time, it wasn't necessarily a huge deal.
But then after she told me that, she started acting differently around me. She would message me constantly, huge messages, would put her hand or arm on me and hug me all the time in person, being insistent that she had to help me when anything was wrong, even when my problems had nothing to do with her. At the time I felt like she was acting as if she was my girlfriend, or something.
So I guess her acting this way made me feel more uncomfortable about her having feelings for me, cause I was in a relationship and not interested in her that way, so I kinda pulled back and tried to distance myself from her, spend less time together, reply to her messages less frequently and just generally kinda minimise our relationship, which I know must have sucked for her given how she felt.

Yesterday I was at the mall and Olivia saw me and came to me. She was really mad that I was trying to ""steal Sam back"" and that I should stay out of their relationship. Basically not take backsides on past relationships . She was also furious that the grandma had given me the family engagement ring instead of her. I was stunned. I didn't know the ring was an engagement ring. But I told her I wouldn't stop contact unless the wish came from him and that goes also for the ring. I made it clear that I have no feelings for Sam.

Now reflecting I think I might be over stepping.
AITA?

Edit : I think I have to make this clear.
The will was written in 2017. 2 years after our separation. Grandma and I kept in touch through the years I just avoided Sam. I knew she was sick and would pass.
I say she is my grandma because she raised us. We have single moms and ""Lydia,"" adopted us into the family when I was born.

Also I didn't know the Ring was an ""engagement"" ring, because the ring of Lydia's late husband is in Sam's mom's possession. As far as I know it was just a fancy ring that Lydia wanted to give to me.",138,251,0.91

We live in a rural area; the next shelter is 2 hours away.

In mid-July, the shelter had an outdoor event with adoptable pets. We completed a paper application for a cat. We were verbally asked which cat we wanted, and we pointed to 3 adults; one was Bob. The volunteers told us our application would be reviewed and the manager would contact us.

We didn't receive a call or email by July 31, so we visited the shelter. Bob was still there; we asked the shelter manager about him. She asked if we'd completed an application, and we said yes, a paper one at the outdoor event. She said she'd review it and get back to us.

August 5: still nothing. We sent a Facebook message. Facebook marked it ""seen,"" but nobody replied. We went to the shelter again on August 10 and asked a shelter worker if we could adopt Bob. She said the manager was out of town, so we'd have to wait until August 13, but yes, Bob was ABSOLUTELY still available. August 13, still nothing. I called. They told us to fill out the online application. So we filled it out, and again, nothing; I had to call the next day. The receptionist told us the manager was reviewing it and would call us back.

An hour before closing, they still hadn't contacted us, so we went there. We asked about Bob, and we were told that he'd already been adopted as of August 9.  We were clearly shocked and explained how often we'd contacted the shelter about our application, but the manager was EXTREMELY curt to us and didn't even apologize for the mix-up. 15 minutes later, they posted a picture of Bob with his new family on Facebook, which just hurt as even more, as we'd already started bonding with him.

Later, I sent a Facebook message expressing how discouraged we were by the adoption process and the lack of communication among the shelter workers. I also pointed out that other adoptions were CLEARLY being finalized in a week, and I provided a timeline of our attempt to adopt Bob. The manager admitted that her workers had been seeing Facebook messages and not responding, but she did not address any of the very obvious miscommunication happening in the shelter, and her response was really defensive. Again, no apology or attempt to match us up with another pet. We told the shelter to shred our paperwork, and we refuse to donate to them again or adopt through them.

The thing is...I announced this all on Facebook and copied the messages. I changed the names, but it's not hard to figure out which shelter it is if you live out here. It has persuaded a lot of our friends to stop donating. And while the manager is a jerk, I feel awful for the animals who might benefit from those donations; none of this is their fault. The shelter receives also receives grants and makes a BUNDLE boarding dogs, BUT our friends on the BOD have said they will specifically refuse to increase the shelter's funding until they change the management.",44,66,0.86

381,Not the A-hole,"My sister (17) is a strong believer that you shouldn’t talk to people of the opposite sex, shouldn’t date, kiss/hug/have a sexual relationship outside marriage, etc. Which is fine, whatever, it’s your beliefs.

The other day she found out my (15f) friend (also 15f) was dating someone, and she started yelling at me about how I shouldn’t associate myself with her. She does this stuff ALLLLL the time, and also is incredibly rude against girls who date in general. Anyways, I used her computer (because I had to fill out a time-sensitive form and my computer was dead, would have never used it otherwise) and opened it up to find a chat with a guy who seemed to be older than her (judging by his profile picture). I feel bad for even looking because the convos were absolutely disgusting to see, she was literally talking about doing everything she constantly rallied against, in extreme detail. I quickly shut the computer off and told my parents, because in that moment I saw it as my sister talking to some older stranger. My parents exploded and grounded my sister for 6 months, disabled her phone, etc. they also found out it was a 26 year old man she was talking to. My sister started saying she was doing a “social experiment” (???) which sounded like such a lie and my parents found that the convo had been going on for a YEAR. Now, she won’t talk to me, except to curse at me for getting her grounded, and the real kicker is she won’t work on her college applications anymore because in her words, “we want to see her fail and be miserable, so [she’s] going to do just that”.

383,Asshole,"Hey everyone,

F23. My identical twin sister (also F23 just in case someone doesn't get it) just got married to (M25). My sister is a very religious Catholic and therefore, among other things, doesn't believe in birth control. My brother-in-law does support birth control but has conceded to the wishes of my sister.

Anyways, my Sister at 23 is really young and is not done her schooling. I am horribly concerned for her, feeling that not using birth control will ruin her life. My sister simply responded that they will use 'natural family planning' and 'pulling out' and will just have very little sexual activity for the next two years till she finishes her studies. I think that she is just making her husband and herself miserable, and is honestly not being fair to him. Besides, I love my sister and want to help her. So I have been attempting to convince her on a very regular (around weekly) basis to use birth control based on its merits. My sister however has just been getting annoyed, saying that I am attempting to interfere in a very personal manner.  However, I feel like I am just trying to stop her from making a horribly stupid lifestyle decision, which would very easily ruin her career, and even her marriage.

384,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have been together for 10 years and we come from completely different backgrounds. I (38M) was very fortunate to have grown up in a rather wealthy home, my parents gave me every opportunity to be successful but also at the same time made me work for what I had. I was never directly given anything just b/c I wanted it. For example, they bought me my first car but had to keep my grades up, do house chores, etc. They also paid for my college but again had to keep my grades up or else I was paying the tuition myself. Fast forward to today I am myself a rather successful professional who works as a healthcare consultant and makes enough money to support my family (2 children), I own several properties around the globe and have built up a significant financial portfolio. None of which was provided or funded by my parents. 

My wife's side is completely different. My wife grew up in a modest home but her parents supported her as best as they could. They were very loose with their money (when they were able to make it), were ""free thinkers"" / hippies and were / are never good at saving money. I'm not saying they are bad people, they are very family oriented and would give the shirt off their back to anyone. My wife was not as fortunate I was and had to pay her way for everything including college (after we married I paid off the rest of her college loan). 

Even with these differences my wife and I are very happy, I am over the moon in love with her and our family is generally very happy i.e we don't have any marital problems and are very active with our children.

My mother in-laws mother (wife's grandmother) recently past away (about a year ago) and left her estate split between my MIL and her two siblings. She ended up walking away with a little over $90k. At the time I mentioned to my MIL that it would be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor so that she could start a retirement fund. That was the last I spoke to her about it b/c my wife has told me in the past to try and not to discuss finances with her because it makes her uncomfortable as she is aware of my success. 

But to make an already long story shorter I come to find out a few weeks ago that the majority of the funds she received are gone and MIL has spoken to my wife about needing some major repairs on her car, house and other miscellaneous items. My wife discussed it with me and I am having a real hard time with just handing over the money even though I could. My parents brought me up to appreciate the things I have, have worked very hard for my savings / life style and appreciate the value of a dollar whereas it is fairly obvious my MIL does not. I feel like just having over the money would be opening the ""floodgates"".

AITA for not wanting to help?

Edit #1: lots of people have been asking what she did with $90k in one year. From what I have been told, a lot of it was given to my wife's brother and to MIL husband's family (wife's parents are divorced). IMO the individuals receiving a portion of the MIL inheritance are just as bad with money as she is. The MIL husband's family didn't even know my MIL mother either, which I found odd. MIL is a few years away from retirement eligibility so I'm not sure why she didn't plan more thoroughly. I get that she seemed to spread the wealth as some people have pointed out, but IMO this money could have really helped her in her later years when she isn't making a paycheck.

Edit #2: many of you are really taking a hard stance that I was super privileged and is the only reason why I have money. I acknowledge that I was given a major head start where my parents provided an environment for me to not have to work 60hrs a week on top of going to school, etc. Please understand I get where you are coming from. But there are plenty of privileged individuals out there who turn into total a POS even when their parents given them everything and are a drain on society. There is also the reverse ever people who were forced to put in the extra effort and are quite successful. There is a certain about of drive required in someone to want to succeed. I don't want it to seem like I don't have compassion for all walks of life b/c I do. I frequently give back to our community (financially and voluntarily) and do support reputable charities. There is only so much I can cover through an internet forum, please understand that I only listed a few examples and does not paint the entire picture. But I will never Apologize for how my parents raised me. I may have had it easier then most, but I also had to put in the work including a lot of manual labor (growing up on a farm) which can be looked at as working (IMHO).

Edit #3: my wife and I are together on this decision. We are married so whatever we make together financially is both of ours. She understands this is a sensitive subject and we both want to be there for family but where I am hung up on this is many of the items she needs assistance on are things that didn't just pop up over night. For example, she needs a new roof... It could have been fixed when she had the money to do so. Why am I on the hook for that?",100,170,0.94

386,Not the A-hole,"A while ago, a 3 month old kitten appeared in my aunts front yard. My aunt keeps her outside, but cares for her- feeding her, playing with her, grooming her. She even named her. Well, when the cat was about 6 months old, my aunt noticed that the cat was getting very chunky. She took the cat to the spca, where they confirmed that she was pregnant. They offered to terminate the pregnancy and spay her, but my aunt thought the kittens “deserved a chance to live”, and so they let her carry out her pregnancy. 

About 2 months ago, the cat gave birth in the front yard. The kitties were healthy at first, except for one who had perpetual eye booger’s. We thought nothing of it- until almost all the kittens were adopted, and the remaining 3 now had eyeboogers, as well- and  the kitten who had it since birth could no longer open her  eyes due to all the crust. We realized this wasn’t normal, but my aunt wasn’t willing to do anything about it, saying that since it wasn’t really her cat, it wasn’t her responsibility. We made up a story about another aunts coworkers wanting all three, and we took them to the vet. The vet confirmed that they had an extremely viral virus similar to herpes, and it had turned into a nasty respiratory infection for all three kittens. If we had waited a day longer, the original sick kitten likely would have succumbed to her illness- and the other two cats weren’t far behind. 

Well, another aunt of mine nursed the three kittens back to health. They are now healthy and strong- we kept one and gave one to my brother, and the other to a coworker of mine who we know will take good care of the kitten. We thought we had done the right thing. However, my other aunt who “takes care” of the cat called to tell us that the cat was pregnant, AGAIN. We told her to take her to the spca to get the cats pregnancy terminated and to finally get her spayed. The SPCA will do it for free as the cat is stray, and then return the cat back to her neighborhood. But my aunt refuses, again, to “kill”the babies. The cat herself is a baby, and the first litter almost killed her because she’s so small. I would not be surprised if she had major complications with this litter. 

Well, today me and my brother got to talking, and we hatched up a plan to come get the cat while my aunt is out and take her to the SPCA to get fixed. It’s not that we want to terminate the kittens- but again, this litter might damn near kill the cat. And to top that off, if she did have the litter, it would just be a repeat. The kittens would get sick, and my aunt would do nothing about it.

A few months ago a buddy of mine and I were in the same town for a convention. I messaged him and asked if he was interested in meeting up to play poker at the local casino, since I was often seeing him post on social media about weekly games. He let me know that cash was a bit tight at the moment, so I offered to lend him a buy-in ($300), to which he agreed and mentioned that he would pay me back $50 bucks or so at a time when he can. While I've been friends with this person for a few years, I know that he is not the most reliable person. Because of this, I mentioned multiple times that I'd want the payment within 6 months and to at least keep me in the loop if there were issues with paying it back.

We're currently 4 months later and I've received $15 and have been mostly ghosted except when I message him directly (multiple times) looking for an update. At this point I doubt I'll see another penny of this money.

Recently I received an invitation to his wedding. I am trying to make it as I have been friends with him, and his fiance, for years at this point, but because of short notice and work reasons, I'm likely going to miss it. Regardless, I'm considering including in my RSVP - No, that the remainder of the debt is their wedding present from me. While I don't think it's necessary for me to even gift them anything if I don't attend the wedding, it also feels a bit cheap to gift back his own money.

We're both very close with my parents and they have an open-door policy for their home.. we can just show up and let ourselves in anytime without notice. We never really use that, but they've made it well known they don't care. They also let themselves into our house as well and we generally don't care about this, either. 





My Fiance' and I were away for the weekend and I had asked my mom to come over once a day to feed the cats. My parents were also having my grandma up to visit (who I see once every few years) and my aunt (who I haven't seen since I was 5). During one day that she was over to feed the cats she took it upon herself to give my grandma and aunt a tour of our entire house. The bedrooms, the office, the backyard, everything. I had no idea she'd do this, and if I did I frankly would have tidied up quite a bit more. I had my weed and bong sitting on the office desk for all to see (legal here, but still a heavy stigma and my family are all quite conservative).




She told us very non-nonchalantly like it wasn't a big deal when we were over for dinner tonight to visit with my aunt and grandma. I didn't say anything at the time, but we both feel quite upset that she did this without even giving us a heads up or asking permission. I'm hesitant to say anything because she's quite sensitive and easy to upset, however I feel like this boundary needs to be set so it doesn't happen again.

392,Not the A-hole,"So I've been working on a campaign most of the summer and invited a few of my friends to be players in it. I mainly asked people that I'm currently in a campaign with and two friends outside of it. The one friend asked if her husband could join and I said sure since he never played before and was really excited.

This is my first time DMing a game and I'm pretty nervous about it. When my friend and her husband came over to make characters, I found him very intimidating. I'd only hung out with him two times before, but it was mainly me and my friend talking and my boyfriend and her husband talking so we never really interacted one on one. Anyways, he was trying to tell my friend that based on who she chose to play that she would need to be ready to kill people when she designed her character to be someone to heal others. He also said that his character was going to do three things, sexually harass his wife's character, drink, and kill people. Those things really threw me off because my campaign isn't going to have a focus on killing and who says their character is going to sexually harass another character? This whole thing, mixed with how intimidating he was made me extra nervous.

The next two days I felt so panicked about the whole thing because of how nervous I was about not only DMing for the first time, but him joining. Before he joined i wasn't as nervous because I'm more comfortable with my other players and know they'll be patient and supportive while I figure things out.

I ended up telling my friend that I felt really nervous about it and that I felt intimidated by her husband, she is aware that he is intimidating because of his job and talks to him about it. I also told her that I'd feel more comfortable starting off with people I've played with before and am more familiar with, but that once I'm more confident that her husband is more than welcome to join.

I met a woman at a young adults group last year who has cerebral palsy. I sat next to her and we made small talk. The conversations were always dominated by her and I mostly sat there and listened to her, but I just knew she had a disability and I needed to be friendly.

She soon asked for my number and added me on Facebook. I quickly found the way she acts on Facebook really annoying. Long paragraphs complaining about her injuries, how employers won't hire her, how she keeps losing her jobs because she keeps trying to do sports and getting injured, how she has no friends, 
breaking up with her boyfriend over and over. Mostly I felt uncomfortable with her posting about her boyfriends sexual health. One time she went live while they were having an argument, hiding her phone so it only showed her. He doesn't have Facebook and doesn't see the things she posts.

I've stopped following her on Facebook so I don't see her posts anymore. I don't respond to her texts anymore either. I feel really bad, but also I feel like she's a very negative person and I know if I tried developing a friendship with her, it wouldn't be genuine and I would feel completely drained.

I wouldn't tolerate all the vague-booking and drama if it were anybody else, but I feel really conflicted because she has cerebral palsy and she didn't choose to have that. I don't want to judge her based on her disability. But also, having a disability isn't an excuse for being an asshole I think. 

Everyone in the group is super nice to her, as much as they can be, but it feels disingenuous a lot of the time. I wonder if everyone feels they HAVE to be her friend because she has a disability and it would be an asshole move not to. I feel like I'm not being nice enough and like I’m being the asshole.

My girlfriend (27) is notorious for being late to almost everything. Hell, she was late to her own party recently. I've told her multiple times how annoying it is to always be late to things. I've tried many times to try to get her hurry but it's just not catching on.

Today we're having a double date of sorts with one of her friends and their partners. We had just over 2 hours (for her) to get ready so I decided to take a nap. I wake up to find that she was watching a TV show instead of getting ready. She was JUST putting on her makeup, which I'm sure you all know can take sometime. Mind you, we had about 10 minutes left before we had to rush out. She missed that time limit by another 10, so I passive-aggressively decided to take my time and made sure we missed a couple busses. Afterwards, I told her that I I was frustrated with being late again and her response was that she was ready before me. In return I told her that I was purposely making us even more late so we miss some of the movie. This upset her some, close to being in the verge of tears (which isn't hard for her to do. She's quite fragile). I told her that I'm not sorry for calling her out on her bs. Now shes sitting beside me, pissed off and quietly texting whom I presume is the friend that we're meeting. The movie has started and at this rate we'll have missed about half and hour.

My sister and her husband are both amazing parents. They really are. But they've gotten into the habit of referring to their youngest as the dumb one (pretty sure it was started by my sister who has a tendency to take little things she finds funny a bit too far). It's not a constant thing but they've definitely made enough comments that the immediate family has noticed.  

A has always been pretty smart and advanced for her age. Like they're already talking about maybe skipping a grade. The baby will do stupid baby stuff (try to eat stuff she shouldn't, get stuck between stuff while crawling around, get confused by something) and they'll both kind of laugh and roll their eyes. Sometimes they'll say something like ""Oh B, at least you're pretty!"" or ""Yeah doesn't look like B is gonna be the sharpest tool in the shed...""

I 100% think that they mean nothing by this and don't even realize what they're doing but I know that I need to bring it up so they notice and stop.

We're not really ones to be blunt open in my family so I figured the best way to bring it up would be an ""offhand"" joke. Like my sister says something to B like ""You might not be that smart but that's okay!"" and then I lightly say something along the lines of ""B, you tell mommy that if she keeps talking like that she's gonna kill your self esteem and you're gonna end up on a stripper pole lol""

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for your advice 

I was hanging out with my sister tonight which is why I made the post. I had decided to not day anything unless the subject came up and of course it did. 

My sister made a comment about B trying to crawl inti a cabinet and not realizing she was too big HAHAHHAHA *eye roll*

I avoided the ""stripper"" comment but kept with the light, jokey vibe and was like ""oh poor B. You guys are gonna kill her self esteem if you keep calling her stupid.""

Sister said that they have NEVER actually called her stupid. Which got a blank stare from me cuz come on. You know what you're doing. 

She said it was just fun because B can be silly and chill while A never was and was always so serious. Met with another blank stare cuz cmon. Calling your baby silly and saying 'welp. At least Cs get degrees!!"" are two very different things. 

We transitioned into a different subject and I was kind of surprised with how quickly she blew it over but I blame it on her having a long day with the kiddos. She's the kind of person that worries over every little thing so I assume this will hit her and churn until she knocks it off.

399,No A-holes here,"So my 15 year old daughter was a vegetarian for a few months, then started eating meat again. She went to summer camp and when she got home last week, told us she was a vegetarian again.

Now, I was a vegetarian for over a decade and I love to cook. Our family is nutrition conscious, we eat virtually no fast food, and my kids have always been exposed to a wide range of cuisines. I don't mind a culinary challenge, and I'd like to pay forward how awesome my mom was when I was a vegetarian teen. My daughter, however, is rather picky. She dislikes most cooked vegetables, for example, which makes it hard to cook nutritious meals for her. When I can, I substitute vegetarian options in our meals (black beans instead of meat for tacos yesterday) but her fussiness makes it exasperating. I'm dreading shopping for lunch food for the coming school year. (She doesn't like peanut butter sandwiches, yogurt, granola bars...)

If left to her own devices, I think she'd survive on nothing but pasta, ice cream, and cucumbers. I want her to be healthy and have well-balanced meals, but I'm tired of coming up with a vegetarian friendly meal only to have her wrinkle her nose at it. I keep salad kits in the fridge for her and some packets of Trader Joe's Indian dishes in the pantry. When I ask her what she'd like from the store, she just shrugs. AITA if I give her a grocery allowance and tell her that at this point she's responsible for feeding herself if she can't/won't eat what I've prepared?

ETA: She is not bratty about this. She'll sit at the table with the family, thank me for the meal, then say ""I don't care for any."" She's not demanding, but as her mom I worry about her health.

 talked to my daughter about my concerns/frustrations, and she agreed that she has been unreasonable. I have dozens of cookbooks, so she's decided to sit down with them and a stack of Post-Its to let me know what she'd like to try. She said her main issue is laziness, not a desire to eat less. She says that if she doesn't like something she'll grab a bowl of cereal later, which fills her up. We talked about why that is a shitty idea. I hinted at the idea of calorie restriction and she said no, she likes her size and strength and knows that not eating fucks up your cognitive abilities. Plus she said she likes food.

We went over the kinds of ingredients she'd like to have in the house, and we were both surprised by the diversity of it. I showed her some meal prep techniques, like batch-freezing, chopping vegetables, etc. and told her to text me when we're out of things she likes instead of bitching that we have nothing to eat.

We celebrated by making some really delicious spinach-mushroom-mozzarella wraps. Thanks, everyone!",422,3612,0.97
400,Not the A-hole,"So, a year ago I got my lovable bundle of joy, Lola. She's a pug and honestly, she's my best friend. I take her everywhere and she absolutely loves me. Because of money issues, I haven't had her fixed yet. It isn't a big deal, so I've just been putting it off. My boyfriend has a male pug who isn't fixed as well. 

My Grandma seems to take this as me wanting to breed her, which is NOT tha case. Everytime I see or talk to her, that's all she talks about. 'when are you breeding your pug?' 'Can I have a puppy when you breed your pug??' and every time, I give her a straightforward no. I explain that the risks are just too great, and frankly, Lola and I BOTH don't need that stress! This has gotten to the point where she has attempted to contact my boyfriend via Facebook about breeding our pugs.

So last week, she comes to me in a fit. She's given away her older bishon (My grandpa's dog, he's passed.) and tells me that I HAVE to breed my dog because now she is lonely. This woman is 87 years old, so I just sort of snap. I tell her that it was a stupid thing to do and that even if I did breed Lola, which I never would! She wouldn't get one of her puppies. I ask her if she's REALLY ready to take on a puppy at her age, she hangs up on me and calls my dad, who in turn, yells at me about being insensitive. 

I seriously don't think I was being insensitive! Although I do feel REALLY bad about snapping at her. So, AITA?

401,Asshole,"This is gonna be complicated. I am 17, my girlfriend just turned 16. I live a few hours away. My girlfriend isn’t out, but for months had planned on coming out to her family at her birthday party. Here’s where it gets weird, for months, she had told me it’d be best if I wasn’t there. I get it, emotions are running high and it might be weird to have me there when they didn’t even know she’s gay. However, her mom is organizing the party, and knows me as a close friend of her daughters, so she sent me an invitation. I decided to come, not as her girlfriend but as a friend, to surprise her. It’s not like her parents have no idea who I am. I forgot that my gf tracks my location, so before I arrived, she saw me close by and Apparently had a melt down at her party about it. She called and screamed at me for trying to take attention away from her at her party, that I was trying to forcefully out her and whatnot. Well, her dad overheard, and now she’s out. Her parents aren’t so bad, they’re pretty accepting, but she’s still sooooo angry and blames me. I don’t know what to do... AITA?

402,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because some of my friends know my main account.

Before I get into the current issue I wanted to give some background about myself. I have had issues with sleep my entire life. I have pretty bad anxiety around going to sleep if I know I'm going to be woken up or if I have to wake up early to the point where I won't sleep at all and I function terribly on low sleep. This isn't bad if I'm at home the next day but it really affects me at work. I've tried therapy but it hasn't helped and I've tried sleeping pills but they make me feel just as bad as if I hadn't had sleep at all.

When my wife and I first discussed children she was really on board with having them. I wanted kids too but was worried about how it would affect my sleep. After a bunch of discussion she said she would be willing to do nighttime duty permanently as she's a much better sleeper and can pretty much nap on demand. 

When we got around to trying for kids I brought this up again and she said she was still committed to doing nighttime feeds/changes and letting me sleep through the night. I offered to do the weekend night feeds and also do most of the housework to let her rest.

Once we had our child we stuck to this and it worked pretty well. On weekday nights I would go to bed and she would do the night feed. On weekend nights she would go to bed early and I would stay awake and do the first night feed then go to bed and she would get up in the morning. I also do 95% of housework and cook dinner most days. I take our child at night and let her nap. She also has a year off work so can rest as much as she can during the day. We're at about month 3.

However in the past few weeks she has started getting really upset, saying I'm not pulling my weight and how exhausted she is, that I'm an asshole for not helping her more at night. I tried to do a couple of weekday nights but it has resulted in me barely being able to function at work and getting asked about my performance.

I reminded my wife about our deal around sleeping hours but she's saying it doesn't mean anything now and I need to help out more, this ended in a big argument where I said I can't help out on weekday nights because I'm worried about losing my job, she blew up at me and called me a lazy asshole.

403,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone! 

I’m really on the fence on this one and I would love to hear opinions on both sides. 

I’ve been looking into getting tear trough fillers for a while. For those who don’t know, these are temporary fillers that last 12-14 months. I would be getting them in my under eye hollows, where you usually get those ‘undereye bags’. 

This area is something I’m pretty self concious about. I have very deep hollows, to the point where when I smile in photos my eyes are kind of swallowed up by them.  Fillers in this area are super effective, and my thinking is that while I already like the way I look, I would want to try out filling them and looking my best. 

The problem is that I think I’ve internalized a lot of shame (and maybe some misogyny) about ‘plastic surgery’, or just altering one’s appearance for vanity. I feel guilty for even considering this, even though I would support anyone else making the decision for themselves. 

Because of these feelings, I kind of want to get the fillers and just not tell anyone. I’m doing it for me, and I don’t want the judgement of my family or friends. It’s hard to think of telling my boyfriend because I know he would hit me with a talk about how I’m beautiful as I am, I don’t need it, I shouldn’t be spending money on it, etc. Even though I know that he would ultimately be supportive, I just don’t want to go through the conversation. Also, I just don’t want to have someone else know about it. 

What does everyone think? Would this be an asshole thing to do?

Thank you everyone!",37,35,0.84
404,Asshole,"I (21 M) have this cousin, “Taylor” (20F). She is really Christian and she’s considers herself an “anti-abortion activist.” I don’t really care about political stuff, but she’s rude to me all the time because I’m not Christian and so we have some bad blood. 

This summer, I’ve had to see her every week when I go to my grandma’s to help her take out her trash cans and other household stuff (Taylor lives with my grandma). Taylor told me that she is planning to go to law school, and that she wants to try to make abortion illegal for her career. She isn’t a good student — she hadn’t even heard of the LSAT before I told her — and she doesn’t have a solid plan for how she’s going to “make abortion illegal.” 

I told her it was a dumbass idea, and she should stay in the Major she’s currently in (nursing). She started crying and wouldn’t talk to me for the rest of the time I was at my grandma’s. My grandma was also mad, and she said I was pushing my godless agenda on Taylor. She said that next time I came over, she would invite her minister to drop by and talk to me about it. I don’t want to see her minister, and I told her I would leave and stop helping her if she did that.

405,Not the A-hole,"So, basically my gf is very active in social media, posting about her life in general and, of course, our relationship, so naturally whenever we have an argument she goes on sharing stuff, personal stuff  about the misunderstanding and about me, specifically. She doesn't exactly puts my name on it, but the message is very clear, calling on my specifical insecurities and weaknesses, to put an example.

407,Not the A-hole,"Just to be clear, I didn't *actually* do anything to the cake. But I'll just start from the very beginning I guess.

Growing up my brother and I would play pranks on each other. I say each other, he would prank me. Relentlessly. Any of you who are younger siblings will know that there will be that one particular moment that often comes up even as you get older that ""Hey, remember when..."" story they'll retell to cackle at something devilish they did to you as a child.

Our story was about a jar of cookies.

Grandpa was an amazing baker and he made me a batch of cookies for my birthday (9th birthday I believe) which he'd seal in an air tight glass box for me. I don't know how, or when, but my brother got ahold of this box and proceeded to, well, fart in it. Then sealed it back up. On my birthday he handed me the cookie box and said *""Grandpa put some extra stank into this batch.""* I didn't know what he meant in the moment, I was too excited to try what looked like delicious cookies. I opened the glass lid and got blasted in the face by the stench of stale ass, then immediately threw up in the jar, all over the cookies. A tale my brother has told repeatedly to his delight since.

Fast forward to now. My brother's wedding day.

This wasn't a thought out plan, I hadn't been scheming over it, it was spur of the moment. My brother had refold the story yet again at his bachelor party three days prior to embarrass me and I guess the story was just fresh in my mind. Ceremony is over, all went well and onto the reception. They're posing for photos before cutting the cake, and I don't know why it came to me, but I just leaned over to my brother as his wife was about to take a bite and said ""I put some extra stank into the cake.""

I thought he'd laugh. He did not. With the reflexes of a mother leaping across to rescue her newborn from something dangerous, he slapped the cake out of her hands. There were some gasps, some laughs, no one really knew what was going on. Me included. He whispered in her ear, she looked me in the eyes for a good five to ten seconds. Then just started to cry.

She runs off, everyone is confused, then my brother confronts me. He thought I did a *shit* in the cake as revenge for the cookies. I told him I didn't and it was just a dumb joke, but he was too mad to listen. She told her bridesmaids I did a shit in the cake. Sure enough, soon everyone thinks I shit in the cake. I was too embarrassed to protest so I just went home.

It's been a week and I've not spoken to them (nor anyone else from the wedding barring my wife) and I keep feeling guilty, even though I didn't actually do anything.

Am I the asshole?

**EDIT:** I'd have liked to have responded individually, but this received a bit more attention than expected! Thank you for all the responses, of all kinds. The only person I could really discuss this with so far was my wife, who of course will always be on my side. I couldn't tell friends in case they jumped to the same irrational outcome as my brother, so I didn't really know if I was the asshole or not. As relieved as I am that the majority here agree I wasn't in the wrong, I do still take on board the criticism from the other side. It was probably a very poorly timed moment to make that joke, but like I said I didn't scheme away at doing this it was impulsive, however I have to take ownership of my actions none the less.

A few of you have said you'd be interested in an update. I'm unsure on the sub's rules regarding this, but I am going to try and speak with my brother tomorrow after work so I will post something if allowed once we have spoken and have, hopefully, smoothed things out.

409,Not the A-hole,"My fiance (29m) proposed to me (24f) a few weeks ago. We've been together 5 years. He didn't have a ring, and I told him I didn't need one, but the wedding ring was important to me.

Earlier he showed me a ring online and asked me what I thought of it as an engagement ring, even though I thought we were in agreement about not doing engagement rings. It was also not really my style, just sort of large and chunky with brightly coloured gems.

I told him, gently, that I didn't really like it. He asked why not and I explained that I'd prefer something smaller and thinner and said that this one was just a bit... much. Plus it cost over 3 grand and I'd be afraid to wear it in case something happened to it, and I went on to say that it felt unnecessarily extravagant, especially as we'll be paying for the wedding rings still plus the actual wedding itself.

I think it's just how we were raised. My family is working class and struggled to put food on the table, while his are upper middle class and money has never really been an issue for him, especially as he currently earns more than I do and has an allowance.

The ring would be bought entirely with his money, and he really likes it, and I did kind of tear it apart, but then he said ""it's fine, I can return it"". So it looks like he's already bought and paid for this ring. Which I've just torn apart. I wasn't exactly ruthless but I did say why I didn't like it and in great detail. He's now not speaking to me and is clearly upset and I feel like an arsehole.

Am I?

Edit: I didn't know until after I was done dragging the ring that he'd bought it, the open dislike of the ring ceased before I knew he'd bought it.

I’m confused and he says it again pointing at the Starbucks tea I’m holding. He then asks my wife and I to leave and won’t let me proceed with ordering. He claims we should have known no outside food was allowed in, and says we’re not welcome.

412,No A-holes here,"I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don’t know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

Recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we’ve hosted them in the past when they’ve visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

This weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn’t pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

Once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here’s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn’t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn’t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn’t allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn’t say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

I guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should’ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT for added info: 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There’s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad’s first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I’m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he’s the generation after mine in our family tree and it’s less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it’s not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don’t care, and my family’s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it’s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don’t know how after this situation). 

2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he’s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son’s safety. I didn’t know how he would react and followed my cousin’s lead, but wasn’t about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. I don’t know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don’t want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we’ve both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",2782,28138,0.93

414,No A-holes here,"I am a 22-year-old male and I am about to run a Dungeons and Dragons campaign.

I've been working on this campaign for weeks for 6 people with lots of plot-lines, prophecies, etc. I've prepared a lot -- I bought six sets of dice for each player, six folders of matching color, got six laminated copies of the rules (since a few of them are new-comers), and have even worked into the game a ""Prophecy of Six"" which was catered directly to the heroes and the way they made them.

Just this morning, one of the people I've brought on (Kyle) asked if we should invite our third friend, Miles.

Miles is 22 as well and he, Kyle, and I actually lived together in college. Miles and I are friends, but we've definitely had rough patches.

Very long story short, Miles and I were both in an activist organization for years together and I recently got promoted to the president of our district. This summer, he's been ignoring my emails to him. When I texted him just to check-in, he said he left the organization completely and he was going to send out a mass email to let everyone know. I told him that he should have let me know sooner, as I was the head. He sent a follow-up email with profanity, spelling errors, and emojis. This isn't the first time Miles has done something like this.

But back to the table-top RPG.

Miles has been trying to play DnD for years. Kyle, Miles, and I played in college. We had a pretty good time and got together for probably about 5 sessions.

 Since then, Kyle and I found another group with Kyle's girlfriend and her friends. I only played with them once or twice, but Miles was pissed when he learned we had played without him.

For a party, we did a quick one-shot as a surprise for him and he seemed to have fun. That was in April.

Now, this game got together because of a post I made on social media and I included the people who responded, plus two other people who have told me for the past year that they would play DnD if they had the group. Miles was not one of them.

I am prepared to play the game without Miles. Kyle says I'm being butt-hurt about what happened with the organization. He insists that there's room in the campaign for Miles. Kyle said that Miles clearly wants to play and we've already hurt his feelings by playing without him before. And that we're both going to look like massive dicks to Miles if we go ahead and play without him again.

My reasoning is: I've already prepared a game for six, Miles had the opportunity to say he wanted to play on social media weeks ago, and, frankly, dude is a flake. Also, 7 people is a big group for one campaign.

So, WIBTA and, if I am the asshole, what should I do?

TL;DR: Miles and I are friends with some issues. I'm DMing a campaign. Third friend, Kyle, wants Miles in the game and that the reason I'm not inviting Miles is that I'm butthurt. While at first, it was a mistake, I do think Miles irresponsible and I've already set up most of the campaign to fit six people, not seven.

416,No A-holes here,"No argument here but just wondering if I should make a change.  I have a dog who is now about a year and a half old and is VERY social.  We live in a walkable neighborhood (Brooklyn) and he has WAY more friends than I do.  The friend who works at the ramen shop, the friend who works at the dry cleaner, the friend who works at the pizza place... he will stop outside stores looking for his friends and if they're not busy, they'll pet him and say hi.  No treats required, he just loves checking in on his friends.  

There's an auto body shop right on our corner so we walk by it every single day.  And every single day, the man who works there will feed him dog treats and fuss over him and they are also best friends.  (I'm pretty sure this guy feeds treats to every dog that walks by his shop)  Here's the thing:  1) This guy speaks very little English so we don't communicate very well (he's an old dude who speaks... Polish or Ukranian or something like that) and 2) My dog doesn't like his treats!  He takes them politely and holds them in his mouth but mostly just wants to wag his tail and get pets.  Then when we walk away he spits out the treats and I pick them up.  This guy seems to LOVE feeding him the treats, though, and will even insist on giving me a handful more treats every time I leave, and will not take no for an answer.  I leave the treats in the dog's bowl and sometimes he'll eat a few, but mostly he's just not fond of them.  This is probably because my dog is super spoiled with expensive soft smelly treats, and this guy gives him basically milkbones, so they don't rate.

Now I'm NOT gonna tell this guy ""don't give my dog those cheap treats, they aren't good enough for him,"" because then I would clearly be TA.  And I have tried telling him the truth, which is ""you don't need to give him treats, he would love to just get pets,"" but he either doesn't believe me, doesn't understand me, or really wants to keep giving treats.

418,Not the A-hole,"This is not my story, it's about a friend of mine who does not have a Reddit account. I don't know if it's valid to post it.

I  have a close friend, whose father got her mom pregnant, and then  basically forgot about them. The guy had 4 kids with 4 different women,  and got married 3 times (the only one he did not marry was the mom of my  friend).

During her first 20 or  so years on earth, her father only met her twice (once was on her 11th  birthday and he had forgot about it, it was just a coincidence) and he  did not pay any alimony for her, no rent support, not sending groceries  once in a while, nothing at all.

When  she was in her early twenties, one of her half-brothers was diagnosed  with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and he needed marrow transplants and blood  donations for the treatment. The issue was that the only close relative  with the same blood type was her, so she was the best possible donor.  Now, after all these years, her father looked for her, and told her that  her brother needed her help. So, she went overseas to the hospital  where his brother was being treated **(the  treatment cost millions of dollars, and he paid for it, which meant  that the guy was not exactly poor and could have supported her, at least  financially),** and did everything that was asked from her to  help her brother recover, she did not attend university for a year, she  took care of her brother, but unfortunately the kid died. She did this  out of human decency, not expecting any kind of money or retribution.

After  all this, her father paid the remaining tuition towards her university  degree (3 years or so), and told her that he would pay for any  additional education that she wanted to get. So, 8 years later, he paid  for her Masters program tuition fee (I think it's a 4-digit figure, it's  in Europe). **During the last decade, they have only talked twice or thrice a year (Birthdays and New Year's eve)**

Now,  her father and all his family are going on a cruise, and they did not  invite her. They planned everything in April, they leave next week, and  yesterday her older brother told her ""Hey, we are going on a cruise with  my dad, and we are making a homage for him. Could you please write a  letter to him thanking him for being such a good father and for all he  has done for us?""

She told me that  she didn't have any kind of inspiration (of course) and asked me to help her  writing the letter. I told her that I would not do it, because her  father does not deserve any kind of homage or letter from her. Her  answer was that she does not want to behave like  an asshole with her dad and brother, and that her dad paid for her tertiary education.

I was suprised at first,  so I asked him why would he give it away.  He said that he wanted to pass it down. I was kinda hurt, beacuse if he wanted to pass it down, why wouldn't he give it to me, his only child? 
I later asked him about it, and he said he gave it to my bf, because he was male,  so he assumed he would like it. 

This made me furious. This is very sexist and bigoted in my opinion. It is also very unfair to me.   I was always interested in cars, while my boyfriend doesn't care about them.

Also,  it isn't like my dad wanted to help my boyfriend out financially by giving him a car. He makes well over 200k a year,  and has no student loans,  and could easily afford a Mustang if he wanted to. 

 It isn't about the car.: I am planning to work in the same field as he does,  and I am confident I will be able to buy a my dream car after a few years of saving up. It isn't like I'm upset because I wanted to have a good car out of my budget,  but didn't get it. 

It is about the sexism.  It hurts me that he chose a man who he only saw on 6 occasions  over me,  his own child all because of some stupid gender stereotype. I always knew he was sexist,  and he said far more sexist things in the past,  but for some reason this is way more hurtful.

I never expected him to give it to me, of course and if he gave it to my uncle,  for example,  I wouldn't even question it. But teh way he gave it to a person he knows almost nothing about all because he is male is annoying.",74,242,0.89

421,Not the A-hole,"This probably sounds horrible, but I think a bit of context *might* help?. That, or I'm just an asshole. 


I've (18F) kind of been slowly cutting ties with her (26F) lately. Mostly because she doesn't have a job and expects me to cover everything when we do something, and she's generally just not really fun to hang out with anymore. 
I'm not mad that she is with someone else now, I'm actually really happy for her. It's just that her new relationship is kind of creepy to me.
She's starting dating this girl from Canada online for a while now. Say what you will about LDRs, but they seem happy. Nothing wrong with that.
The creepy part has to deal with them both being into really kinky crap. That's not a problem in itself either, as I am the same way, but they are WAY to public with their sex lives. They post 24/7 about that sort of thing on Facebook (where their families can see, bte). Again, nothing wrong with that, inherently. It just gets really annoying really fast.
Everytime I get to hang out with her, she's always commenting about what her and her girlfriend have been doing and stuff, and again, in a moderate sense, that's ok, but it's all the time.
I probably seem like an asshole, but the reason why I won't go to DnD with her anymore is because she's bringing her girlfriend. As in, she's setting up a laptop so that she can play. While we were together, she constantly made comments about our sex lives while were playing DnD, which I hated. Don't involve people in kinky stuff unless they want to be involved. 
I just know they will be making those comments during the DnD sesh. Am I an asshole for avoiding her because of that? 

TL;DR : Ex-girlfriend is shameless about kinky shit, kind of creeps me out and gets cringworthy",17,81,0.91

She would normally come home and still talk about work with the little hours she have left to relax before going to bed and doing it all over again the following day.

This morning is anniversary morning and we haven’t “done it” for so long due to a condition she had which she’s barely recovering from. We planned to try this morning after two months of no intimacy. I’ve been on edge for not getting any for so long and I am super excited for this morning. 

I woke up early af and prepared some flowers and breakfast in bed. After some cuddling, we were finally starting to get into it. In the middle of fore play, she suddenly paused and started telling me about a patient she had to deal with last night at work and blah blah blah blah. I had to cut her off because I was annoyed and I said “Omg stfu, I don’t wanna hear it. Can we talk about something else for once!?! We’re about to make love for fucks sake!” 

Long story short she got emotional and started crying. She said that I’m the only one she can vent to and wtf was she supposed to do. I told her there’s a time and place for that shit. I don’t mind her venting and I’m willing to listen but I get sick of it too! Can’t she give me a break? Or am I just an asshole?

Let me know if you guys think I should apologize. The whole day is ruined.

UPDATE: I sincerely apologized for my behavior after an hour of not talking to each other. I explained where I was coming from and that we need to figure out her work life balance situation. I let her marinate that in her thoughts for about 15 minutes then she came around all super sweet and we ended up getting it on as planned. Thanks everyone for the advice. I did realized that I am also an asshole.

For those of you who are saying that I’m only thinking about my dick even though she might be scared or still hurting, I can assure you that is not the case. I love her and I wouldn’t do anything to harm her. I was just snapped out of frustration from constant bombardment of work related crap that I have no clue about in the first place.

EDIT: I just want you guys to understand that I’m not a monster who’s just using her for sex. Her and I mutually scheduled that time to try again after two months of healing. My point is at that time I was excited because I haven’t had any for so long, I just wanted the focus on me and her. But it’s all fixed anyway so we’re good.",261,1228,0.9

I (27 F) am currently 3 month pregnant and in my family it is tradition that a baby shower is thrown at 3 Months, so me and my husband (29 M) are getting ready to throw a baby shower for me.  The thing is that I don't really want my SIL to come because plenty of times in the past, she made a show about her infertility issues. 

When I first announced that I was pregnant during a family dinner at his side, everything was fine.  I was aware of SIL's personal issue but I didn't think that it required me to go speak to her privately or anything. When his relatives started to ask about baby gender and such, she bursted out crying and started to talk about how she wanted a child but couldn't have one ect.  I felt so bad but my husband assured me that it wasn't my fault and that it was just a rough moment for her. I understood and always tried to not mention my pregnancy around her. But then it was like the moment that anyone asked ""hows the kicker?"" or "" congrats on the baby! "" she would suddenly burst in tears again. I felt bad for thinking like this at first but I noticed a pattern where she would be perfectly fine with a single person asking me about baby names, but as soon as more people started to ask things, she sudden felt off. 

Because of this I had a talk with my husband and explained that I don't think it would be a good idea to invite SIL to the babyshower and how she always had a show when there was a bunch of people. Husband said he understood but that I should talk to SIL first. A few days I asked SIL if I could talk to her in person and we met up in a cafe and I explained my concerns by saying ""I know your fertility is a really sensitive issue, and I'm going to have a babyshower soon and you always get uncomfortable and cry, and I don't think it's a good idea you come since you always cry at the end"". She got angry and blew up at me saying that I was being a ""pregnant bitch"" and that I was being ""an insensitive bitch"". I tried to explain that I meant no harm but she cursed me off and has now told the family (her side)  what happened. I felt fucking awful 

They're not mad at me but think I should just apologize to SIL and stop talking about my pregnancy around her and should have a different idea than a babyshower, the thing is that I don't mind apologizing (I didn't mean to make her feel bad) but I don't want my change my babyshower to another kind of event.

426,Asshole,"I got married a couple months ago and have moved in with my husband and his daughter.  I already met his fifteen year old daughter about two years ago, we already have a relationship. She was a bit hesitant at first, but I think it's gotten better as time went on. My stepdaughter has recently gone back to school, and she has a habit of leaving her school stuff everywhere. Even though she has a desk in her room, she'll sometimes choose to do her homework in the kitchen or the living room, and she'll leave all her books and papers in that location. I've asked her to please pick up after herself, to not just leave her things everywhere, but then she'll claim that she's not done with what she's doing, and she's going to come back to it later. It seems like this is what she's always done, as my husband doesn't have a problem with it.  Anyway, I was cleaning the house the other day, and, like always, my stepdaughter's school work, along with some of her other stuff like makeup and hair accessories, were out in the open. I wanted to wipe down the tables, so I gathered her stuff, put them in her room, and went back to cleaning. When she got back home, she started freaking out about her stuff being gone. I told her that her stuff was in her room, and then she started freaking out about how everything was moved from position, and she claimed she had everything set out the way she wanted, and that it was going to take her forever to get everything back the way it was. My husband said he doesn't blame me, but said that when he cleans, he usually just cleans around her stuff, or waits until she's done, but I feel like I'm just being forced to work around her schedule. I know that I'm the new person in the house, and maybe I should not rock the boat and just do things the way they've always been done as that obviously worked for them, but at the same time, I don't want to constantly be walking on eggshells and not allowed to move stuff.

428,Not the A-hole,"I am getting married to Blake, the man of my dreams in two weeks time and it will be a beach wedding. A disagreement with my mum about the wedding spiralled out of control and I ended up threatening to take her off the guest list. 

My mum is a fashionista. Never anything less than immaculately dressed even at home. I inherited this from her too. I dress my best just to take the bins out, something Blake finds hilarious, but there is one area mum and me disagree on: shoes. 

I can't stand wearing heels. I like to think I'm fit but I can't wear heels for more than half an hour without kicking them off, and as such I haven't worn them for over 10 years. Mum, on the other hand, wears them 24/7, to the extent that she has shortened tendons and can't walk in flat shoes at all. She wears heels all the time including at home, and in the rare moments she doesn't she still walks in that tiptoe position. 

I have lots of cute flat shoes, and even though I always dress immaculately mum frequently voices her opinion that ''no outfit reaches it's full potential without heels''. 

Blake and I are open minded, and we put on the invitations that people can wear whatever they want. Formal, informal or anything in between. He dresses in quite a ''smart scruffy'' way, so for the wedding will be wearing a suit and t shirt combo. I'm going full princess, and actually spent a lot to get a tailored wedding dress from a quite well known designer which is so beautiful. 

I also decided that since it was the beach I would go barefoot. I thought the unconventional aspect of it would pair well with Blake's unusual suit style. I told mum this and she was against it. She was already convinced I would wear white heels to go with the dress. I tried to remind her that I don't like heels but she insisted that flats wouldn't work with such a gorgeous dress. When I told her over the phone that I was ditching shoes entirely she said a barefoot bride looks ''tacky''. This debate turned into a full argument when mum said that being barefoot in such a beautiful dress would make me look like ''an idiot'' and that it would look like I spent so much on the dress that I couldn't afford shoes. This made me cry and I told mum that if she didn't want to see me in the dress without heels then I can take her off the guest list. She got extremely offended and ended the call. 

I got calls from both my dad and my sister later in the day, saying that mum has been crying at the thought of being kicked out of her own daughter's wedding. She says she was trying to help me have the perfect day. I'd never seriously consider banning her it was just to get her to stop talking about heels.

430,Not the A-hole,"My (23f) best friend since high school, who we’ll call Kaitlyn (also 23f), asked me to be her maid of honor. I made plans for her bridal shower and bachelorette party, Throughout the process I had involved her family to make sure the theme and decorations matched what Kaitlyn wanted. I discussed the budget ahead of time with the bridal party. Her aunt and stepmom had mentioned they would pay me later and to front the bill for decorations and venue. I have known them since I was 13 so I trusted them and agreed. 

Kaitlyn had also been involved with some of the planning, but most of it was a surprise. She wanted to set the date and gave me color ideas, also she had given me the contacts for invitations. After she ok’d the date I sent the invites out. 

A week later I get a weird vibe from my friend and her family. Her aunt and stepmom kept procrastinating paying me back and her mom kept private messaging me asking what is wrong with kaitlyn. 

When I reach out to my friend she explains that 3 months ago she met a guy in a bar and has been sleeping with him ever since. Her aunt and stepmom were with her at the time and even encouraged her to leave with the guy. To put this in perspective, she had been having this relationship with another guy 4 months after being proposed to, and all the while giving me ideas and dates for the wedding shower.

After telling me about this, she finally calls off the wedding. At this point I had paid 800$ for the bridesmaid dress she picked, 500$ deposit for the venue of the wedding shower, 200$ on decorations, and 100$ deposit for bachelorette party venue totaling 3600$. Her aunt and stepmom said they refused to pay because the wedding was canceled. Our other mutual friends and the now ex-fiancé paid me back.

I wanted to be supportive because we had been friends for a long time but it was really frustrating that, despite knowing she was going to cancel the wedding she let me pay for everything. And her aunts at the time of deciding the budget knew she had slept with another guy and let me front everything. I asked my friend if she would pay me back some of the cost. When I asked Kaitlyn she said she understood and it was no problem, she would pay me back as soon as she could afford it.

A couple months go by and I stop hearing from her. I see on Facebook she has a new group of friends and she’s been traveling a lot with them. I talked to some mutual friends and I heard Kaitlyn was saying it was ridiculous I would ask for money back and I shouldn’t have agreed to be a maid of honor if money was so tight. But I probably wouldn’t have even asked if she at least apologized to me or kept me in the loop to prevent me from some of the costs. I feel like this has really ruined our friendship, we haven’t spoken in months and when I reach out to her she ignores my calls. AITA for wanting the money back?",167,1589,0.97

433,Asshole,"Using an alt because I don't want any inkling of my own personal beliefs (which can probably be found on my reg account) to get into this post. My wife and I are having a major disagreement about what to do and the word ""asshole"" has come up more than one time on both our parts. So here I am. 

Every year one for the past 10 of either my wife's siblings or mine has hosted a ""sibling BBQ"" some weekend in August. It started off as a way to just get to know each other since we are all family now but's it morphed into an actual event where some years T-shirts are made, cousins are now invited, we've had a band, rented a hall when it's too hot. It's a really fun day. This is our year to host. 

I have a younger sister who is just a political firebrand, whatever her politics may be, she can't help but turn just about any discussion into a political one. And it always goes one way, she steers the conversation to what she wants to talk about, she starts to lecture, she starts to get angry, she starts to get personal and she gets insulting and usually storms off. Especially with how divided things are, she gets so amped up and can't control herself. 

My sister is currently in a town about 4 hours away. I thought we could bypass her lectures this year as she wouldn't be willing to make the drive. Well she just texted me that she has some dates confused and she wanted to make sure sibling BBQ is happening today because if it is, she'll get on the road. 

I haven't responded yet. I want to just respond and tell her ""no sorry, not today"" and by the time she starts to see that family posting on social media that it is actually happening it will be too late for her to drive down. I would much rather deal with the fall out of lying to her than having to save her from getting punched in the face when she starts screaming that a cousin is a fascist or a cuck (again, whatever her politics may be). 

My wife says this a major assholish thing to do. I say the bigger assholish thing is to let her come and ruin everyone else's fun.

So my job is to train, and house sit dogs while my clients are away on vacation, work trips or what-have-you. 
I get a job with this ansi german shepherd, and a woman who I'd only ever met with alone. She supposedly had a husband on a business trip but a I'd never seen him.As far as I knew those were all the occupants of the home. 
I agreed to stay for three nights while she and her husband were out. First two nights went by no problem, but today I got back to the house midday for a lunch break and I noticed a car missing from the drive way. I figured it belonged to family living near by she'd told me about, and they picked it up. I left and came back that evening and the car was back.. I went inside and everything seemed untouched, but as I was passing the hall I heard music from a phone from one of the rooms that was locked. I immediately texted the home owner asking if there was anyone else there and she didnt text back. Fast forward 20 minutes and I'm changing in my room, I look out the window and see a whole ass dude on the phone. I stepped out of sight, got dressed and told the home owner I was not comfortable staying there with a man she had n o t told me about staying there too. I collected my belongings, reported the incident to the company I work for, and headed to a different appointment. 
She later called me and bombarded me with texts telling me she d i d in fact tell me she was renting the room, and I was being incredibly unprofessional, irresponsible, and cold. 
I figure I was with the dog for about 2 and a half hours before I crated him and left. I even offered to stay the night if she could assure he wouldn't be there, or that I come back early next morning to check in on the dog. She refused both, saying the man lived there she wasnt going to ask him to leave, and the time I proposed to see the dog again (10am) was too late. 
I feel like I did everything I should have within my comfort boundaries. I do not ever remember her explicitly telling me that a renter would be there, or me explicitly agreeing to stay with someone else there. I feel the need to share this because I feel like I'm being emotionally exploited. I do feel really bad for the dog, but it's not okay with me that I stay there with someone else I don't know also living in the home. Why can't he let the dog out? What do you think? 
Am I an asshole?

Edit: 
Some people are asking about the contract. So the contract I'd had with the woman was very basic, could easily be modified at anytime.

440,Not the A-hole,"The ring in question is Timeless Elegance (rose gold) from a popular jewelry brand, in case you guys want to see it. 

I bought my ring one year ago as an accessory ring (the stone is cubic zirconia). I wore it a few times at work when it complemented my outfit, maybe six or seven times at most as I have other jewelry that I am more fond of and wear more often. 

Then two months ago my co-worker Emily got engaged, and her ring is the same Timeless Elegance ring I bought as an accessory. I didn't say anything and just congratulated her on her engagement. Honestly I was surprised her fiance proposed to her with a $100 ring, but maybe it had a special meaning for them and I know the fact that her future husband gave it to her makes it priceless for her.

Last Friday I wore an outfit that I thought would look well with my Timeless Elegance ring, so I decided to wear it on the middle finger of my right hand. I knew that Emily would be wearing her engagement ring, but I thought, she knows that her ring is sold across hundreds of stores and has been purchased by probably thousands of people, so if she has no problem with wearing a ring like that, then I don't think she would have a problem with seeing someone wearing the same ring. 

Unfortunately she did. When she saw that I was wearing the same ring she pulled me aside and asked what the hell I was thinking wearing the same ring, was I trying to make her feel that her engagement ring is just an accessory?

I told her I'm not trying to make her feel anything by wearing my ring that I bought way before she had hers, and I that I'm sure her ring is priceless because her fiance gave it to her, but I think that she's not in a position to tell me that I can't wear something I own just because she owns something similar.

She had some choice words for me and has not talked to me since. But she has been telling our co-workers that I am bullying her and making her feel that her engagement ring is just an accessory. Some have taken her side and said I should have avoided wearing that ring in the office, while some think that if she has an issue with having a 'common' ring then she should take it up to her fiance and not the other people who have the same ring.

441,Asshole,"My little sister (13) moved in with me around 6 months ago due to some issues surrounding our mother, and I was basically put in charge of her. It's my responsibility to discipline her and stuff like that, for all intents and purposes I'm her ""father"". So far she has been excellent, her behaviour has vastly improved, her grades are better and she's in a much better place. She has always been a ferocious reader, and for her birthday I bought her a Kindle and set her loose on it. I monitor her internet and computer usage pretty closely (she knows I do this and is mostly ok with it), but I never bothered to check what books she read.

Recently we were talking about her latest reads, and some of the books she was reading were not at all age appropriate. I started going through her Kindle library and removed some other books that I thought were inappropriate, the only ones that really come to memory was a book called 'One Child' by Torey Hayden, there were a few war-related books that didn't seem appropriate for her to be reading quite yet. 'Generation Kill' for instance, I won't let her watch the show or read the book no matter how great they are, some of the language in it is just filthy. All Quiet on the Western Front was another I deleted from her device.

She has not been appreciative of my actions, but she doesn't seem to be going out of her way to read them behind my back.

I don't have a problem with limiting what she reads and does online, but banning books just feels different. These are well regarded pieces of work, some of which she will probably read as a part of her school curriculum, yet I'm telling her she can't read them. Still, a large part of me feels I'm doing the right thing and making sure she is mature and old enough before reading some pretty heavy stuff. Am I being an asshole?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My 13yo sister wants to read some books that are not typically read at such a young age, I think she shouldn't and have banned her from reading them. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Please don't ban me mods, I swear the Big Brother thing was a coincidence.

Final edit: I don't know if this is standard practice, but I think I want to summarize what I learned. I've been slowly reading all 500 comments, and I was definitely off base with banning most of the books I did. I should've opened up a conversation with her instead of blocking her out. So, the books are unbanned for now. 'One Child' in particular has a very graphic scene in it, and I think I'll make sure I'm fully available for support if she does decide to read it one day, it fucked me up for a bit when I read it.

I'm surprised at the number of people that took offense at me monitoring and blocking her from the internet though, I hope people can understand that the internet and books are different mediums. Just because I'm going to allow her to read whatever books she wants, that doesn't mean she gets to, or should be able to absorb all the self-published filth deep in the depths of the net.",577,751,0.87

443,Not the A-hole,"Saved up & bought 2nd row tickets right behind the dugout for a baseball game last night where my favorite team happened to be in town on my birthday weekend.  As I’ve always done since I was a kid I picked up a bag of peanuts at the concession stand to snack on - a tradition my dad got me started on that I really enjoy.

As I settle in and open up my bag the guy in front of me starts pitching a fit about his kid having a peanut allergy.  Sorry guy, I’ll be sure not to throw any shells on the ground or anything like that.  Nope, he wants me to either put them away or move somewhere else.  Told him flat out that wasn’t happening.  The mother was trying to calm him down and assure him it would be fine, but he wasn’t having it and kept insisting if the smell was in the air the kid was going to get sick.  I wasn’t budging, so father of the year goes & gets the usher.

Now here’s the thing:  I understand allergies.  I have a nephew with a peanut allergy.  But it’s because of this that when I’ve taken him to ballgames I’ve been sure to get seats in the peanut free section the stadium has.  I did my due diligence and research beforehand and learned that there are no peanut products sold or allowed in this section, and that it is cleaned thoroughly after each game to be extra cautious.

So here comes the usher and still I wasn’t giving in, asked about the peanut free area and why they weren’t sitting there - usher decides to push back and insist that either I put them away or leave.

I’m sorry, but this is complete nonsense and I made sure to let them know about it.  Yes I get it’s a damn bag of peanuts and yes I understand liability and not wanting a sick kid but that’s not the point!  There is a designated area specifically to avoid these types of situations, why not move them there?  Selfish dad very obviously cared more about sitting in the front row than he did about doing the right thing by his kid - he knew the peanut free area existed and chose not to sit there, then expects everyone else to accommodate and make it about him.

In the end I put the peanuts away and life moved on but I was and still am super pissed about how selfish this guy was being.

So AITA for wanting to eat my peanuts in a public place when a father chose to put his allergic kid in potential danger rather then taking advantage of the peanut free area they provide?",494,2478,0.95

446,Not the A-hole,"Made a throwaway for reasons. But to preface, me and my girlfriend, who I will call C, have been together roughly 6 years at this point and are at the point marriage and kids is just around the corner after we are finished getting our degrees. We have had a pretty solid relationship to the point that I already call her mom ""mom"" and she is already loved and accepted by my family as well. Everyone jokes around about ""how long til y'all are married yet?"" 

So she has this friend she had grown up with til she was around 10 give or take a year or two and had been pretty close with him on and off as a family friend we will call him J. Well, I already had some suspicion about this summer such as her suddenly being busy when I was supposed to come visit or her suddenly going out of town. She had told me a few times she was planning on going and visiting a friend she had made in her sorority like group who we will call E which she actually did so my suspicion lessened over a month or so and everything seemed very normal and happy. I spent this past weekend helping her move across town closer to her University and spent a good majority of two days doing so. 

So the reason I made this post is I had to help set up her WiFi at her new place and it required having the Mac address of each device added. No big deal. Well when she let me add her phone I couldn't help but notice she had fucking tinder downloaded dead center of a bunch of other apps on her phone. So it was very obvious she wasn't trying to hide anything. And since that rose my suspicion higher than it's ever been, she had left her phone in the bathroom when I went to take a shower this morning and we are very open and neither one of us get mad if the other needs to use the others phone for texting and calling people. So I locked the door and went through her texts and found that not only had she been texting her friend J for around 5 months as far as I could tell. Not only had she been texting him, she had been texting her best friend E as well and the texts read as if I was Cs ex and we haven't been together for years. Yet I've even met E at a party and was introduced to her as Cs boyfriend. 

So the main question is, AITA for looking at my girlfriend's texts to see she's been cheating and sleeping with her ""friend"" for months and has been telling her best friend the entire time as if I don't exist. 

I really am lost for what to do here. I haven't confronted her about it yet, I've been taking my time processing everything so I don't explode and behave irrationally. I just really don't know how to take the news. 

TL;DR- looked at my girlfriend of 6 years' phone and found out she had been hooking up with some guy from her childhood all summer and acts with her best friend as if I don't exist in her life, yet is as close as ever with me and keeps me involved in family matters and what not.",37,44,0.82
447,Not the A-hole,"So I'm 18, friend is M20 (""Stu"") - we're both in a pretty weird social circle where nobody really grows up. The problem is that I *am* growing up - I've gotten a job, live on my own and honestly - I think I'm doing better than the rest of the group.

This has caused friction with my buddy, who - despite graduating high school with good grades (I didn't graduate at all) has never had a job, nor seems to be looking for one. He doesn't have the best finances, and loves clothes, tattoos and especially drinking.

The problem started when my best friend was going back to school after working a job she hates, Stu immediately called her ungrateful for turning down a job, and was salty that she, a non-drinker, wouldn't waste her time going drinking like he does. Stu has no ambition for anything, and is the definition of Tall Poppy Syndrome.

He apparently asked her about my finances, assuming that my parents pay for my shit and that my apartment isn't mine. He says that since ""he won't go out and drink/eat/buy shit"", that must mean that I'm flat broke and living off my moms. 

He finished his shit with saying ""guess rich kids flock together"", since both me and my other friend are rich - given we're both 18 working our first jobs. So I met up with him, asking what the fuck his deal was. 

He tried mocking me for ""being upset"", and I just kinda let him have it. I flat out told him that, yes, I'm richer than him, and will probably continue to be, since I don't spend my money on useless shit and drinking. I told him to get an actual job before talking about other people's finances and asked him to fuck off.

He kinda sulked away, texting me afterward in all caps telling me how I'm this huge dick who's picking on unemployed people, and that the rest of the friend group hates me because apparently I think I'm better than them, and don't ""help them out?"", whatever that means. It ended with me just telling him once again to fuck off, and blocking his ass.

The issue lies in that this has been my second-closest friend for over 2 years. And I'm not sure I went overboard, but I've been getting increasingly sick of his lack of ambition, and his shitty remarks.

There's this big chain cafe where it's common for people to go eat and then camp at to study or do work. When I go I usually stay through 2 full meals (not only just ordering a coffee and getting free refills and mooch their wifi all day), and inbetween those meals I stay there and study, getting refills on coffee and buying snacks sometimes. One lunch was particularly busy, and this cafe had no free seats. Two workers were loudly complaining to each other about all these people who are just taking up the seats and not even eating. It was noon...I ate breakfast there, and I was about to buy lunch there too after I finished reading my section. But it just made me feel really bad since they were standing next to me while saying that even though half of the seats were taken up by people also not eating but drinking coffee and doing their work (it's pretty big inside).

450,Not the A-hole,"So a little backstory: I am 15 yrs old and I watch some anime. Last week me, my brother and my mum were watching a movie where there was a mention about anime(it was a negative opinion). I said that anime isn’t even that bad. My mum responded that how she hates those “chinese-cartoons” because it’s only for kids and everyone is shouting in it and how annoying it is and she doesn’t understand how can kids watch it. I said that not all animes are for kids and it can be much better than a normal series. She replied by saying that I am wrong and how she can’t understand why am I liking it.

Fast forward to yesterday, I was watching Attack on Titan on my PC, an anime that has some brutality(and It’s R rated if I’m right). My mum saw my screen and started ranting about how I shouldn’t watch this because it’s too brutal for me. I responded by saying:
“But Mum, its just a chinese-kids show where everyone is shouting, and it’s only for kids so there is nothing wrong about watching it”. Then my mum became angry and grounded me for the day.

451,Not the A-hole,"This is the background to the prank:

When my brother was getting ready for his Bar Mitzvah, my dad went way overboard with the guest list. The first draft of the list included ""Bob"" a man my brother and I never heard of. It turned out that Bob was our aunt's (by marriage) late mother's widower. None of us had ever met Bob, and we had only met my aunt's mother a couple of times, so we convinced my dad not to invite Bob.

Bob became a family joke after that. We would joke about inviting Bob to parties because he's our favorite relative, or saying things like how popular an event was and that even Uncle Bob was there. This joke still comes up from time to time, and we made the joke when planning my brother's wedding. My brother said Uncle Bob had to be invited because he was my brother's favorite uncle. It's a dumb joke, but it always made my family laugh.

As a joke during the wedding, I signed the guest book ""It was a pleasure attending your wedding. I wish you every happiness. Sincerely, Uncle Bob."" I wasn't sure if my sister-in-law knew about Bob but I figured either my brother would explain it and she would find it funny too, or she would just think Bob was a distant relative and not care.

Several weeks after the wedding, my parents and I got an angry text from my brother demanding to know who had written Bob's message in the guest book. I admitted to it, and he said he and my sister-in-law were really mad at me for ruining the guest book with a joke. I said I wasn't trying to ruin the book, and that I thought my brother liked the Bob joke. He said he did like the joke, but that it was only appropriate to talk about it, not to wreck the guest book. 

I did apologize because I don't want a fight, but I was curious if other people thought I was an asshole. I honestly never thought anyone would be offended, because anyone who saw the message would either get the reference or not notice anything unusual. I didn't think I would be ruining the guest book.",302,1732,0.96
452,Asshole,"I don’t know if it’s just hormones making me crazy or if my concerns are reasonable so guys please tell me what you honestly think.

I’m currently 4 months pregnant with my first child. The pregnancy is accidental and the father is one of my good friends. Abortion is not an option for me and he respects that. We are on the same page about making the best of the situation, and our priority is ensuring that we can be the best parents to our child even if we’re not together. Our families are supportive of us and are excited about the prospect of a grandchild, as none of our parents are grandparents yet.

My pregnancy has not been the easiest and I recently moved in with my child’s father (I’ll call him Lance) so someone can stay with me most of the time (he works from home). We’ve been getting along well, but sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable when Lance tells me about the girls he’s talking to on Bumble. 

For the record, I don’t think he’s doing it with the intention of being rude to me. I think it’s just a habit that he’s used to - as I said, Lance and I are good friends and in the past we would always talk about the people we like or we’re seeing – maybe he just doesn’t think that anything would change now that we have a baby on the way. I get where he’s coming from and I know he still has a life to live outside of being a father to our child, but reasonably or unreasonably I feel uncomfortable that he is looking for a romantic relationship now when I think that our attention should be focused on preparing for our baby (converting a room into his nursery if we continue to live in Lance's apartment, learning how to change diapers/bathe a baby, etc). 

I’ve been thinking about asking Lance if he can hold off dating until our baby is about six months old.  I think that by that time we would have adjusted to having a baby and can have time for dating. At least that’s the timeline I’m thinking for myself, though I understand that my decisions for myself shouldn’t also automatically apply to Lance.

453,,"# TITLE EDIT: AITA For asking not to be paired with a disable person anymore

^(I realised the stupidity of the grammar mistake in title too late)

Please read the full post before jumping to conclusions.

This happened a couple of years ago, and for some reason the thought suddenly occured to me that I could have potentially been TA in this situation.

When I was in 8th grade, we were assigned ""buddies"" in my class, and we would basically sit at the same desk, do classwork, activities, etc together.  Note that the process of getting assigned a buddy was completely random.

The buddy that I was assigned/assigned to was disabled. He was abnormally huge and had learning disabilities, low functioning autism, etc. Just generally cognitively impaired, and he had a teacher aide. That's fine, all well and good.

After a term or two, I got sick of it, and couldn't deal with him anymore. I had to stay during lunchtimes to help him with his work, spend extra time trying to explain things to him etc. My grades started to go down because during assessments, he would constantly distract me and make annoying humming sounds. Oh and, he had a weird obsession with headbutts.

I decided to go tell my parents to do something about it, because I couldn't bear it anymore. I was so fucking sick of that fucking bastard pulling me down in class and making me miss out on spending time with my friends and just being a normal fucking kid. That cunt robbed me of most of my year, the last year I could goddamn spend with my friends as I was going to another highschool, in another city.

Anyways, enough venting.  My parents talked to the teacher over the phone and the next day my teacher came up to me and said how I should've come to her directly and that I need to learn to be more patient with people, etc etc. I then got paired with a friend, thank goodness for that, but every once in a while, the teacher aide would make some snide comment about me being heartless.

I couldn't care less, because I got pulled out of the Gifted & Talented Educational Program due to my slipping grades. Shortly after, I got back in and everything was fine.

AITA?

&#x200B;

\--

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all your replies so far, I'd like apologize for my vent, I shouldn't have done that and it was cruel and unnecessary.  I said it out of pure spite and anger. Things from the past sometimes get to me and I'm definitely an asshole for thatAnd where I live (Australia), the words ""cunt"" & ""bastard"" isn't seen as much of a big deal.

I'd also like to amend ""a week or two"" to a term or two (a term being 4 months), I wrote week on accident.

EDIT2: For those calling me ""abelist"", after googling that term:

&#x200B;

>The discrimination and social prejudice against people with disabilities or who are perceived to have disabilities. **Ableism** characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non-disabled

Suffice it to say I do NOT consider people with disabilities inferior, nor do I have a social prejudice against them AND I have not discriminated against disabled people.  Please stop straw-manning me, and don't use terms you can't put into context.

457,Not the A-hole,"Ok this is the worst. I’m losing sleep over this.

I’m getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn’t know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century’s mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I’m so happy my brother found a great guy. But it’s kind of a secret, as he hasn’t told my family he is gay.

I’ve been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won’t accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn’t accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that’s his decision not mine, so for now he won’t say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don’t think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don’t want to get the attention away from my fiancée, that’s her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it’s a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it’s because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can’t do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn’t even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said “ dont worry, going alone”. I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don’t seem to know what’s happening because they didn’t say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fiancée, couldn’t keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won’t be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn’t matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don’t want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. Literally every other day of my life I will support my brother’s decision to come out. Even at the wedding, I would obviously defend him. But the point is, NOT AT THE WEDDING.

462,Not the A-hole,"So to keep this brief, me and my husband are currently living with his sister, the sisters bf, their kids, my mother in law, other sister in law, and technically the other sils by. 

Since I don’t work at the moment I offered to watch my SILs kids for her when she’s at work and her bf sleep during the day (he works third shift and is up in the afternoons). At first this wasn’t a problem, until it became me watching them when they’re smoking pot (no problem with smoking if you do it responsibly), or just too lazy to do it themselves. The other day my sil messaged me asking me to get her kids ready for a doctors appointment because she forgot, lo and behold she’s in her room relaxing in bed the whole time. 

Last week my husband had to spend part of his gas money he needs to get to work on diapers for the kids, meaning he almost wasn’t able to get to work for the rest of the week, but she had paid for pot for her and her bf for the week. This is about the millionth time she’s done this, too. She blows her money on pot and then begs family members for money because she “works so hard to provide for them and just can’t make ends meet”.

The kicker is that my bil’s baby mother did the same exact thing and they’ve ridiculed her day in and day out for being such a shitty mother and how no one should ever do that to their kids, but my sil is blood so apparently all morals go out the window. 

Here’s one scenario from less than a month ago: The sil smoked before me and the other sil and her bf had to go help my husband with a flat tire, she knows she gets sleepy when she smokes, but said she was fine to watch them before we left. We were gone about an hour and a half, we all came home to find the youngest of the two kids naked, spraying water, all over the kitchen (everything was soaked and he nearly shorted the power in the kitchen) with dried blood all over himself. We look for his mother and she was passed out, we tried multiple times to wake her up and told her, that he had blood on him, but she refused to get up and kept going back to sleep. 

So I had to not only figure out where this kid was bleeding from, I gave both him and his brother a bath, got them changed, and helped put them to bed. All while my sil was asleep. I checked her room and he had gotten into a box that had shampoo in it, amongst other dangerous items, and found a kitchen knife on the floor. Everyone was absolutely disgusted with her, but as soon as she woke up the next day and started joking about it everyone magically forgave her. 

Am I the asshole for being upset and feeling taken advantage of?

Addie (my wife) and I decided to have children. After months of trying Addie finally got pregnant. Everything was great until about 4 months into the pregnancy and we lost the baby due to complications. It was rough but we powered through it. I took us a long time but eventually we were ready to have kids again. So we started trying again this year. We were trying for a long time and actually went to the doctor a couple of times to check our fertility and everything was fine. 

Addie came up to me today and told me she was pregnant. She told me she’s been pregnant since June. She told me she didn’t want me to know because she was worried I’d leave her if we had another miscarriage. Which I wouldn’t! I was extremely supportive and helpful after the death of our first child. She also told me that she didn’t want to let me down again. 

I’m both extremely happy and really distraught by this news. I’m really happy because I’m going to be a Father! But I’m also really sad that my wife thinks I’d leave her if she had another miscarriage. I told her I was upset she lied to me about it (she took weekly pregnancy tests and said they were negative). She sorta apologized but not really. She told me that if there was another miscarriage then she didn’t want me to have to live through it.

Info: I’m going to set up a couples therapy session soon and probably get her to go first to meet him/her first.

Additional Info:

Talked with Addie about how i think therapy would be a good thing for us both. She didn’t want to at first but I eventually convinced her to go. I found a few pretty good couples therapists in the area. Hopefully we can start soon. 

I also told her that her lying to me upset me and she told me her reasoning again that she didn’t want to hurt me but I still told her that hurt. I told her I should have known the same time she did. She did not feel that way to day the least.

As usual I was hanging out with my cousins for the time that were here and like good grandchildren we were giving our grandparents tech support. My grandfather called me and my cousin to help him out with youtube because apparently youtube wasn't giving him the recommendations he wanted. The videos being recommended to him included nudity could've been considered softcore porn. My cousin and I looked at it and assumed that it was probably an accident and he probably clicked something by mistake. We cleared out those explicit recommendations and handed him back his phone. A few days later my grandfather calls us both again and said the same thing happened again. We knew that youtube recommended videos based on what you were watching and there were quite a lot of explicit videos again. We once again thought maybe it was a mistake and cleared them out. Then the reunion ended and me and my cousin brushed it off and my grandfather never asked me again. 

Fast forward to yesterday and my grandfather asked me to take a look at his iPad because his iCloud wasn't syncing. So I took a look. By mistake I opened up safari instead of opening settings and the page was on a porn site in incognito mode. Ironically he and my grandmother regularly give me and my cousins talks about porn and how we shouldn't watch it. Our family is very conservative and would definitely not be happy if they found out that my granddad was watching porn.

468,No A-holes here,"I was taking an acting class a couple of weeks ago. The age range was 11-17, the majority of people were 12 or 13 but the youngest was 10. On one of the days the teacher asked the assistant leaders (aged 18 or so) to run drama games while he stepped out.

We started to play a game called airplane, people got a character or trait assigned to them and had to act it out for someone to guess. A new group of people go up and one of the assistant leaders gives one of the boys “OCD” as a trait. He goes about the typical ‘overly neat, straightening everything’ schtick.

I pulled the assistant teacher aside after the game and told her I didn’t really like that she gave him that trait, it didn’t seem appropriate for our class or really in general.

She told me that she has OCD and she wanted to see if he would ‘get it right’. (He was 13, I don’t really see any possibility of him ‘getting it right’)I told her I still didn’t think it was appropriate and that maybe she should save her dark humour for people a bit older/not in a class setting.

However I brought up the engagement ring and said we should sell it and split the proceeds between us because the break up was mutual, we were miserable together and this money will help us with start up costs of being single again.

However my ex is of the opinion that because the ring has served its purpose she gets to keep it despite the fact it was my investment. I'm of the opinion that because the ring is conditional on being married, I am entitled to receive the ring back in full but am happy to meet her half way.

473,Asshole,"For context, the abuser is a former best friend and roommate of mine, whom I have known since middle school. He has verbally abused every single girlfriend he has ever had, whether it be by fat-shaming them, manipulating them, gaslighting them, etc.. I also watched him try to strong-arm one of them into having children with him, and she told me that he tried to put his unprotected penis into her without consent.  He is a known narcissist, a professional victim, and an incredibly toxic person. I kicked him out of my house a year ago because his personality, his lack of cleanliness, and his inability to take criticism made my life miserable.

I have seen recently, via an MMO (that we both play and I see him in) that this guy has begun to date another woman. I don't know her, but I have the means of contacting her (she also plays this MMO). I want to warn her that she is dating someone who WILL inevitably begin to behave as I described above, if he hasn't already. However, I have been no contact him ever since he left my house, and I don't want to risk bringing his negativity into my life. WIBTA if I don't warn her about him, or am I better off just leaving it alone? This is a rather large moral dilemma for me, because I don't want him to hurt another woman like the ones that came before. I have known all of his girlfriends, as I am friends with many of them, and I have seen the damage he has done to their lives.

474,No A-holes here,"My friend Louie (35M) and I (31M) have wanted to be filmmakers since we were teenagers. So after years of sweat and tears, he tries to get a production company to pick up his main project. No luck. I know why— it's just not very good, & that's after years of constructive feedback. I admit I was never super hard on him, since even a little bit of criticism sent him hurling down a path of self-hate.

Eventually, he releases the project independently. He has a big release party and his friends and family post glowing reviews of it online. He waits for sales, recognition. Nothing. He's devastated but since everyone's still encouraging him, he throws himself into another project, which isn't much better. I encourage him half-heartedly, b/c I feel he could be using that energy to find something he's actually good at. But I'm afraid to be the one to tell him the hard truth.

So I write an anonymous review instead. I'm not brutal, but I tell the truth: his project is unoriginal, not very well-written, and often made me tune out as a viewer. Then I soften the blow by saying that I was still interested enough to watch another project by the filmmaker, should he release another.

Louie contacts me after the review is posted in incoherent tears. I try to point out the positive aspects of the review. He wasn't comforted at all. He also started wondering if someone he knew wrote it, and started listening possible enemies (ex girlfriends, etc). He never suspected me at all--not once.

I felt so, so dirty. But I still didn't tell him I wrote it. I figured--it's a single review. It'll blow over. And then, out of guilt, I wrote a glowing review with my name on it, so he wouldn't suspect that me & Harsh Critic were the same person.

Years have passed. We're still close. We've been in each other's weddings, for crying out loud.

And he still. Brings. Up. The review. He describes the review as one of the most traumatizing things that ever happened to him. He's also mostly convinced it was written by one of his exes, a theory I discouraged, but that he clings to. Also, he changes what the review said, remembering it to be way worse than it was. I can't correct him very strongly without fear of inciting suspicion.

He's since tried other projects, all unsuccessful, and I still support him, while gently encouraging other passions, which he dismisses. The other wrench in this whole muck? I've...actually made it as a filmmaker. To the point where my name is getting slow but steady recognition. He's been nothing but supportive and happy for me, but I know he's trying not to be jealous, and I don't blame him.

And he still brings up the review.

If Louie knew I wrote it, it would almost certainly end our friendship. The disparity in our levels of success are bad enough, but if he found out that I'm behind the most traumatizing feedback he's ever gotten?

AND that I semi-actively deceived him about it for years?

We'd be done. AITA for not telling him?

&#x200B;

INFO EDIT: First, thanks for the gold? I'm confused about why I got it--I don't feel like a hero here, but someone felt nice, so that's cool.

I appreciate all the takes I've gotten on here. I'm duty-bound to clarify something: Louie is NOT some narcissist who thinks his work is flawless. At least, I don't think so. He's one of the nicest guys I know. The true problem is that, especially after the failure of his first project, criticism HURLS his self-esteem straight into the toilet, no matter how gently or kindly people put it, and makes him have emotional breakdowns and identity crises. People, including me, have consistently tried to help him out and give him constructive feedback over the years, but he lacks the skillset to fix what the largest problems are, even when those problems are pointed out to him.

A few people have asked what my motivations were for posting the review. I've given it a lot of thought now, and I think my thought-process was this:

1. If I tell him anonymously that his film isn't good, he drops into a depression spiral, but possibly realizes that his skillset isn't suited to his ambitions (and maybe finds a more fulfilling career).
2. If I tell him directly that his film isn't good, he drops into a depression spiral, possibly realizes that his skillset isn't suited to his ambitions...and I lose a friend.
3. If I don't say anything, he STILL drops into a depression spiral, but only after a long, expensive road of more rejections and wasted time and resources, during which time he could have been obtaining a more useful skillset and better career.

But I still posted that glowing review to comfort him and to cover my ass, which doesn't help any of the outcomes above. So that was counterproductive, and makes me at least partially an asshole.",263,1791,0.97

477,No A-holes here,"I've seen a lot of narc mom validation posts on here...and I hope this isn't one.

I had my twins when I was 17. I dropped out of school and moved in with a friend who was helping me support them-no rent. I got a job, earned my GED, and over the next few years I started college and got another job to pay for it. For most of their early childhood, I worked two or three jobs and took classes at a community college. Some bad events took place at my friend's house and I was forced to move into an apartment. Good news? A classmate with a boy my girls' age was looking for a place, so we became roommates and kinda co-parents. Worked great, we lived together until I was almost out of uni.

Still working two jobs, I usually had night and early morning shifts and she had day shifts. Someone was always with the kids, and when she started working more we got a babysitter. At this point we were still very poor-we wore bras and underwear with holes in them because we didn't have money for new ones. She got engaged, moved in with the guy, and I was forced to find a cheaper apartment I could make on my own. I graduated, got work as a bookkeeper in a legal office, and started earning enough to confidently stay afloat and afford a reliable babysitter. We stayed in the apartment until my kids had moved out and I saved enough to move to a house in a small town (years later).

Now, my girls are posting mean spirited comments on FB and complementing each other. One will post something about 'I didn't know how poor I was until I realized how big a yard can be' and the other one will say 'I always knew, other kids with competent mothers had huge backyards and we had an apartment'. Complaining about yards, being 'raised by babysitters', always moving...I got sick of it. I replied on one of their posts saying they always had a safe home with food and at least one adult around to protect them which is more than other children and they shouldn't be whining like this when they were competently cared for. My daughter deleted it, and some friends have pointed out that growing up poor still isn't easy and they were likely bullied and felt some uncertainty for the future. I've been told a good mother would let them vent now so they can come to terms with their past. While I see the reason, I also feel calling me incompetent as a mother is mean and uncalled for.

Edit: I should have put this in long before now, but the ""bad events"" at my friend's place had nothing to do with my kids. My friend's parents had serious health and financial problems and could no longer house me for free. The rent they needed to supplement lost income was too high, so I had to leave so they could rent to someone else.

Also, thanks to everyone who left advice. I was expecting a lot of YTA, but I was surprised by the direction they're taking. It's opening my eyes to this, and I know I have to actually talk to my children about this. I'll try and handle it better than I have so far.

One of things my husband is mad about is me faking being nauseous when we go to his sisters. His sister is lovely but her kids are a nightmare. My husband knows this. Her kids will go through my bag, scream at you, everything. One of the main things is one of them was grabbing onto my top/belly and jumping trying to sit on me? I was furious. But his sister did not do anything and only sat them down at their little table and my husband brushed it off. Ever since then, I’ve been making excuses like I feel sick or I can’t be in a car right now, or be really emotional on purpose, so that I don’t have to go to his sisters every week. 
 
My husband doesn’t see the problem, he doesn’t accept me not wanting to go. So these excuses is a way for me not to go.

Another thing he’s mad about is me skipping queues a lot. I do take advantage of it, i’m not going to lie. But he’s very embarrassed by it. No one has seem to have had a problem with it and I’ve only started doing it recently. For example, the post office queue was really long, and I pretended I had to pee but I really had to post this letter. So I skipped maybe like a half hour queue.

480,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: I’ve begged him to come with me**

I’ve always loved Korean BBQ. My SO is not a huge meat eater so he’s never seen the hype. For two years I’ve begged him to come with me to eat there and he’s always turned me down, made excuses or straight up told me he couldn’t fathom eating that much meat. On another note I asked him to come home early tonight because I wanted to spend some time with him before going to sleep because we have a 2 month old LO. He said he wouldn’t be long as he was just going for a quick smoke with him. TURNS OUT, he went to the Korean BBQ place I’ve been begging him to go to with his FRIEND. Yet acts like the victim because I’m mad and think it’s unfair that he did that as well as the fact that he will be coming home very late tonight. 

So am I crazy here? AITA?

EDIT PT2: 
I wanted to specify that yesterday was his last day at his restaurant job. He finally got off and came home asking if he could go to his friend’s house to hang out and smoke for a bit to which I replied with “sure! But could you please come home a little earlier? I’d like to spend time with you” he said “yeah babe it shouldn’t be too long just dabbing it up with him it’s not like we’re watching a movie or anything” he packed his dab stuff, kissed me goodbye and left. 
Now what supposedly happened is his friend suggested going out to at eat at this KBBQ place I love I’ve been there before but he hasn’t. I’ve been dying for him to come with me because I knew he’d love it but that’s beside the point (I was right btw)
My SO said if he couldn’t come up with a different idea in the next 5mins then he’d be cool with going (he was also really high at that point which he doesn’t really do unless he’s with this friend) 
At around 11:25pm he texts me asking that his friend suggested KBBQ and if he should go but I was asleep. 
I wake up at 12:33AM to find out that he’s already there eating with his friend and I got really upset because I wanted him to come with me for HIS first time which lead to a huge argument and he saying “don’t break my heart by arguing please, I didn’t know this would make you so angry” and that’s all the details. 
He ended up leaving the restaurant around 1:35am and going back to his friend’s place where he figured since I was so pissed off at him that he’d stick around and have a beer. I woke up at 2:30am again and noticed he was still gone to which he finally arrived at 3:05am. 
When seeing how angry and hurt I was he apologized profusely and said he’d make it up to me by taking me whenever we wanted whenever we had a chance (I also have a son (8M) from a previous relationship who was asleep too so it gets really hard to find time for date nights.

485,Not the A-hole,"I'm the owner of a small business working with consumer chemicals if that isn't vague enough. Up until two months ago, I was the only employee because I couldn't really afford to hire up until recently. After working things out, I had enough to hire two part time employees, the only help I really needed as I was still the only full time employee.

So I interviewed and got a dozen or so applicants. I hired two people, a man (late 30s) and a younger woman (mid 20s). Everything was peachy: we all gelled together real well, that is until my employee announced she was 5 weeks pregnant.

As bad as it sounds, I had to let her go. If she stayed with us much longer, she'd be out of the 3mo probationary period where I could let her go without reason. After this time, she's entitled to maternity benefits, which in my area come out of the business (correct me if I'm wrong in assuming government subsidizes it elsewhere).

Not only that, but after the probationary period, I have to make reasonable adjustments to my building to make it accessible/comfortable for a pregnant woman. My company deals in chemicals, oftentimes hazardous chemicals. Things a pregnant woman shouldn't even be near, even with protective clothing. The only way I could adjust her job to meet those criteria is something like doing deliveries/pickups, invoicing, general clerical work, etc, which is not something I need as I'm capable of doing it myself on off days.

I let her go because it's a headache just to manage this. I lose hands in my work, I become more liable, etc. Basically her job becomes redundant if I need to make those changes. The jobs I filled were very specific and anything outside of that job is unnecessary salary given out.

Was I the asshole here? This is still fairly fresh. If it changes anything, I did write very good reference for her and even contacted some other people in my industry who might need more clerical work. I'm a very small player in my industry when some of my competitors could find a use for her when I could not.

Apologies for my English if it's not correct.

edit: I am not in the US. Over here, there are protections for employees after 3 months but before this, you really can let them go for any reasons. For no reason if you want, even. You can't discriminate but herein is reason for AITA thread.

Pregnant women get paid leave for a period proportional to how long they've worked. It doesn't matter how long they've been working, it's always proportional to how long, although I think there's a limit. With me, my accountant says she would have received 3 months paid leave after working the year or so with me.

I was mostly worried about how her job would change. Lots of chemicals, using ladders, standing, etc which if she requested alterations to make it easier for her, I really couldn't come up with an alternate job for her. I needed the two people help, and if one is not able to work to the fullest extent, I'd need to hire a third just to take over her duties. The three months maternity is a big deal, yes, but not an immediate issue.

I am a small company, either a salary being paid out for a job not being done or the need to hire a third to pick up the slack I just cannot afford.

She is a good employee which is why I referred her to some of my competitors who have more flexibility.",1294,2975,0.92

She told me that her dad would get really angry and break her & her siblings’ toys, not even just when he was mad at them, but generally angry. She said her mom would get upset with her when she was very young (younger than 10) and refuses to speak to her for a month. Her parents didn’t let her leave the house or hang out with friends. Her dad once left her birthday party and refused to talk to her for weeks, because she brought a male friend to it. She concluded all of this with “But ya know, they did it all because they loved me.”

I said “Yeah, no, all of that sounds pretty emotionally manipulative and abusive. They shouldn’t have treated you that way. That isn’t love. I’m not doubting they loved you, but you don’t treat people you love that way.” She got upset and said I shouldn’t say that. I said it reminded me of my own home, minus I was allowed to go out and date because my parents didn’t really want me around obviously. She said that I was just too sensitive to it and I needed to let it go.

I was on the beach laying out getting a tan.  I was laying on my stomach.  I untied my bikini top so I would avoid getting tan lines, but I had my towel under me and around me so there was absolutely NO boobs showing whatsoever.  I even had my boyfriend look to make sure.

Now I'm laying there for maybe a half hour, 45 minutes when this family sets up chairs behind me and a woman comes over to me.  She immediately starts yelling at me and demanding, ""This is a public beach and you need to put your top back on because my kids see your exposed back and that is inappropriate!!  They pointed it out and I don't want them seeing it!""  I'm dumbfounded by this b/c I was here first, there was PLENTY of other spots on the beach that they could set up on if they found my back ""offensive,"" AND I wasn't showing anything.  *IF* I had tied the top on, it would have been a tiny string line...and that was somehow less offensive???  I said as much to this random woman who then becomes irate that I would not tie my top back on and how could I feel comfortable showing it all off like that, etc, etc, she started repeating herself so I kind of just blocked it out.  I told her I wasn't moving, nor was I tying my top.

So this woman yanks her chair up and places it about 2 feet in front of me I guess to block my back from the view of her kids.  She then proceeds to mutter more, but I just laughed and put headphones in.

Thinking back on it now that I'm a mother myself, I wonder if I was an asshole here?  I mean, if I saw something I didn't want my kids to see, I would avoid it, not confront it....But then again, it WAS a public beach, so I was I being disrespectful by untying those ties?  AITA?

I made a shrug gesture and mouthed something like ""sorry I'm not allowed to let you in"".

In just a few minutes the man comes into my daughter's classroom (his kid is in the same class), and he starts loudly yelling at me demanding to know why I didn't let him in. Not wanting to be part of an argument in the class I asked him to come to the hallway where I explained why I had not let him enter. I then went back to the room, without entertaining anything further from him.

Fast forward to today. My daughters have become friends with his daughters and have been going over to their house to play, as they live about 500 feet from us. My daughters have been gone for a while, and the door bell rings, it's the guy and my youngest. I make small talk and ask him if the girls are being good etc. He tells me my daughter needs her water bottle so I go fill it up. When I get back he says: ""so if you saw me at the school doors would you let me in now?""

I didn't respond, just gave my daughter her water and asked him when my girls should come home. He then launches into yelling at me right in front of my 6-year old. Once he says ""fucking"", I tell him to go into the driveway so we can talk. I say ""don't use language like that in front of my kids, to which he responds ""I don't care you fucking dick"" which my across the street neighbor hears and he starts running over. Yelling neighbor then leaves.

I have seen this guy on several occasions hit and kick cars when they are even partially blocking his driveway. He screams and yells at the drivers.

I have prohibited my kids from playing with his kids, they and my wife say it's not fair, but I think this guy might be dangerous, AITA?",128,1501,0.97

496,Not the A-hole,"I frequently watch shows and movies (on our dvr) with one of my parents.

we are fairly close, and we watch things often.
But ever since we got a DVR ( year old ), this parent pauses movies and shows an INSANE amount.

Interesting facts about an actor? -> pause the show and explain it for 5-10 minutes

Small minute detail that is clearly irrelevant to the story (color of the vehicle, computer used in the story, etc) -> pause the show.

Fast running scene where an object is passed that they can’t identify ? -> pause the movie, put it in slow motion until they can identify the item.

(And my biggest complaint) a MAJOR event in the movie happens -> PAUSE THE MOVIE AND RE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT WE BOTH JUST WATCHED.

Recently, they paused the movie and re explained a recent event that just occurred. I stated “I know, we just watched it, please press play”, but they just kept explaining it “just to be sure I understood” for literally 15 minutes.


My biggest issue with this is the time: it turns a 2 hour movie into a 3-4 hour movie. It drains all my time, and I can’t even finish the shows on busy days.

I exploded: 

Said something to the effect of: “I hate when you do this. I keep telling you I understand what fucking happened. Yet you keep explaining it no matter how kindly I ask you to move forward.  I don’t care what the actors recent TMZ highlights said. And I don’t have time to watch for 5 minutes a run scene on slow motion to find out the color of the mailbox.
You are being an ass and ignoring every single time I ask you to press play. And you treat me like a brain dead moron and act like I can’t comprehend what I just watched, I’m done watching things with you until you change this.”

I’ve tried so many times to phrase this in a kind manner. But it never changes no matter how many times they acknowledge it. 

I really do feel bad after the fact, but I don’t know another solution. The only thing I can think of would be to take the controller when we are watching shows.

Edit: I did gradually increase how insistent I was pressing the issue. Clearly stating that I was not okay with what was going on , and felt disrespected from it. None of that ever changed the behavior.",22,60,0.9

A disclaimer or possible important info...I used to drink a lot and she drank a lot and did some other heavy partying. We still drink occasionally.

For example, saying she was at a gfs house but she ended up being at some dudes house at like 11 at night having drinks. When confronted she said it’s blah blah from work and he’s just a friend like a little bother I knew if I told you you’d be upset or not think it was cool in the first place. 

Another example she lied to me about getting some money from an ex that still would be with her and going to his house.

Another ex on fb text her and was saying like “thinking about you” and she was like “I should have married you”

Another was her texting dudes heart emojis when they were saying things basically about wanting her or to be with her and saying “next time I see you”

Another was her explaining to a dude she kind of maybe messed with or did when we were coming back from our vacation to meet for lunch.

These were texts that were while we getting along not fighting arguing whatever.

There’s a million more examples but now the current one....

Somebody at work said to her she smelled good and gave her his number and said to call him. She came home and told me. I looked at our cell phone records a couple days later and she was texting him. I said I thought that was inappropriate considering his known intentions and she went into the same as always “you’re spying on me, you’re insecure, blah blah blah”

I explained to her that she almost sets people on fire for LOOKING at me and if it was reversed it would be crazy.

I would never do anything like that no woman gets my number if they’re interested in me. And she could always look at my phone. Even though she has gotten mad for example of a lady screwing up a pool shot gif from reddit she swore was someone I knew.

Out of nowhere this gust of wind came and lifted her skirt for maybe 2 seconds. Long enough for me to see it.

I wasn’t staring or anything, it’s just that I was maybe 10 feet behind her and it happened so fast that before I realized what was happening it was over.

She tried to cover her ass with her hands but didn’t really help. So she looked back at me with this embarassed smile and I pretended nothing happened. 

We got to the corner, so now we’re side by side, waiting for the light to change, and  she looked at me and was kinda laughing, kinda embarassed, so when the light turned green for us to cross, I said: if it makes you feel any better, that was the highlight of my week.

She started laughing and said “ thank you”, then I said have a good day, she said you too and I started walking in front of her. Then  I pretended to cover my ass, just like she did, and I looked back and she was laughing her ass off. I waved good bye and she said bye, with a smile on her face. I went my way, she went hers

I told what happened to some friends I met after that, and I got a divided response. Some thought it was funny/cute/nice, trying to make her feel better, and some said I was totally off limits/ disrespectful 

The way I see it, it all has to do with her response. She laughed and smiled and kept talking in a very nice way, she didn’t look offended or groced out, so the way I see it , it wasn’t offensive to her.

And I only said something because she seemed very approachable and friendly, making eye contact. If she didnt look at me or seemed disturbed, I wouldn’t have said anything

509,Not the A-hole,"**Alright, this needs a bit of background:**

So, I'm 16 and have been working behind scenes in our school plays for over 5 years. I mainly design lighting for the play and run it on the night (much like making a PowerPoint) along will doing sound-engineering. While running the shows, I work under the supervision of a teacher who has a background in this kind of thing. I'm there to manage problems, run the show, and supervise other techies. 

The particular show in question was an end-of-year play for 9-11 year-olds (year 6 in the UK) and I was running sound while looking after the guy running lighting. As the sound guy, I have to play sound effects and manage microphone levels for the actors.

**What happened on the night:**

On the last night of the play, disaster struck. 

One of the wireless microphones for a lead character stopped transmitting audio. We have a checklist we follow in these situations, but nothing I did made any difference. Shortly after, I called my superior to check out the problem, but even they could not figure it out. 

We tried everything we could, short of going and checking the microphone. And this is where the problem arose: the character was on stage for the whole play. 

After consulting with the director of the play, we decided the best course of action was to carry on without the mic. While this affected the actor's performance, they realised the problem and starting shouting their lines. By the end of the performance, I was very tired from the stress.

**The Incident:**

After the show finished, I was congratulating the team when a male audience member arrived at our control box (a little room at the very back of the hall where we work) asking what happened with the actor's microphone. 

At first, I believed he was a sound-engineer himself. He asked which one of us was in charge of sound, and after I told him it was me, he started blaming me for the microphone failure. 

He started calmly, but got reasonably aggressive when I tried to explain what had happened. After all the stress I'd been under, I eventually cracked and started shouting and swearing at him to leave. 

Only after another adult intervened did he pull away from the argument. I later learned he was the father of the actor and that he had been to complain to the technical director and Headmaster about my behaviour.

**Why I'm conflicted:**

Many of the people around me have different opinions on my behaviour that night, which has made me question whether I acted reasonably. I truly understand the impact caused to the actor caused by the techincal problem, and I understand that the parent was angry, and I also see that I could have reacted differently. 

But I fail to see why the responsibility should be pinned on me.

**Conclusion:**

I really need some closure on this. Whether you conclude I am the Asshole or not, I value your opinion. So Reddit, AITA? (Sorry for the long read)",27,27,0.83

512,Not the A-hole,"A bit of a back story: Now my wife(37) and sister (30) have had a rocky relationship since they first met almost 10 years ago.  She sees my sister as the favorite one because my mom pretty much does a lot for her and pays some of her bills (she stopped that now that my sister is working).  The tipping point was when my mom took out a loan to pay for my sister’s wedding photos which turned out to be over $5k whereas for our wedding, I didn’t ask for any support.  My sister sees my wife as a controlling person who tries to force her ways onto the family.

In 2014, the military shipped us to AZ where I separated and we as a family settled down there.  However, in 2016, I took a job in LA.  My schedule gives me the opportunity to work 8 days on and 6 days off.  During the 8 days, I stay with my mom on the 6 days off, I go to AZ and be with my wife and kids.

Last year, my sister (30) threw a birthday party for my son (8).  She went all out on the party.  However, my son was having a “rough” day.  Nothing was really going his way and he had a bit of a melt down.  In passing, I told my sister “I think puberty is coming soon.”  Where she responded “I think you kid is autistic.”  

Well, when I told my wife about what my sister said, she was having none of it!  But instead of confronting my sister, she decided it was best that “we” (as a family) cut all ties with my sister.  Which means, whenever I am in LA, I am not to speak to her or visit her until my sister formally apologizes to her and me for her comment.  But my wife’s condition of apology is for my sister (and her husband) to come to our home in AZ, spend the weekend with us and give us a deep hearted apology...it hasn’t happen and will probably never happen.

My wife has done this before.  She had a friend that who she asked if she can share some Turkish ingredients with her.  The friend said no.  Thinking how petty it was, my wife cut her off...it took the friend 3 years to call and apologize for that.

So...my wife tells me that whenever I’m in CA, I am pretty much forbidden to talk to my sister.  Well, I have see my sister a few times and when my wife found out...all hell broke loose at home!  She goes off on me about how disrespectful I am towards her, how disrespectful my sister is towards our son and her, the list goes on and on.

I do limit my contact with my sister when I’m in CA which is pretty easy and hard at the same time.  

Well, my sister is having a baby shower (her first).  The invite was sent to my wife and I, but she said she will absolutely not attend and then says “and you wont either!”  The baby shower is during work time in LA.  WIBTA if I don’t go?

513,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I hired a photographer for our wedding for $2,000, and we were eagerly awaiting our photos. Fairly recently I was contacted by the photographer, apologizing profusely, and telling me he’s not going to be able to get us the photos due to a fire that ravaged his entire house.

I snooped on his social media profiles to double-check that this was true and not just an excuse, and it is; he posted pictures of the burnt-down house. He also posted that he has homeowner’s insurance that will cover it, and has posted some pics of him staying at his sister’s, so fortunately he isn’t on the street or totally screwed. Still a pretty shitty situation, though.

Here’s the catch, though: he’s only offering us a 90% refund ($1800) instead of the full $2000 one. He says the differential is due to the “huge amount of time he put into editing, the 5 hours he spent shooting at the wedding, and the hour-and-a-half round trip he drove to shoot.” So that’s $200 we’re out.

I’m not trying to sound too selfish or entitled, but while I think it’s all well and good he put all that work into it, all that doesn’t really benefit us if we’re not getting a single photo out of it, and I don’t see why we owe him anything. It’s sad and not his fault (IDK, maybe he could have saved an extra hard drive somewhere not his house), but we’re not getting our long-awaited & treasured pics, and I feel we deserve the full refund.

I’ve demanded the full refund, and he’s stood very firm that he’s only giving the 90% one. I am prepared to take him to small claims or request a chargeback if he doesn’t back down. AITA?",1761,6090,0.93

If I try to stand up to her, she gets aggressive, and is not afraid to get somewhat violent. She also blames me for basically everything wrong in her life (mostly because my parents helping me a little bit with college stopped her from going to a specific private K-12 school she wanted to attend). And this isn't to the level of normal sibling fights. No, if I try to ignore her comments, she will literally keep going for HOURS until I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

Because she makes me miserable, bullies me constantly, and always finds a reason to talk trash about me or embarrass me, I told her and my parents that, at the moment, I can't see myself letting her be my maid of honor one day.

523,Asshole,"I'm not sure where to start so I will lay out the facts. I apologize for the disorganized thoughts.

&#x200B;

I am 23 and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree. Currently, I am doing an internship that will turn into a job that pays $15 an hour (we live in Northern California) in two weeks. The pay is pretty low for a new grad and there are no benefits, but it will eventually lead into a slightly higher paying job with benefits after 6 months to a year. The job is also only about 30 hours a week which is okay with me because I will also be taking classes to continue my education. Another fact is that I am diabetic, so I pay an extra $400+ a month for medical insurance and supplies. After paying my bills each month I will not have a ton of money left over.

&#x200B;

My mom wants to teach me some responsibility by asking me to pay rent now that I am not a full-time student. $250 per month. Yes, I know that is ludicrously low, but at least hear all the details. I am trying to save up my money for graduate school which will cost me about $100k in tuition over two years, and that is not even factoring in food, rent, and other costs of living. I could use this $250 a month to put towards my future costs. I feel I NEED this money, while my mom does not. She is quite literally a multi-millionaire. Again she is wanting to teach me responsibility by making me take on my own finances (something I am fine with), but also make me pay rent to live in her house which is also the house I've lived in my entire life. I am not sure if it matters, but the house is in a middle-class neighborhood and we have always lived pretty frugally despite having money.

&#x200B;

Some other details to include are that every since high school I have been in charge of paying for my own hobbies and activities. My parents have financially supported me through my recent graduation. They paid for my tuition, food, medical insurance, diabetes supplies, car insurance (but not gas/maintenance), and possibly more.

&#x200B;

I am open to doing additional work around the house/for my mom instead of paying rent. This would mean work that I don't already do such as chores, cleaning etc., although I am not sure how much time I would have for that. Basically I am open to anything, but prefer to not pay actual money to my (wonderful) multi-millionaire mother.

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole for not wanting to pay her $250 in rent every month?

I felt bad so I did but it only lasted 2 more weeks because I realized I could never trust her again. Fast forward two months and I receive a text from her claiming that she found out she was pregnant shortly after we broke up but she had already got an abortion. IN THE SAME TEXT. She said that she was scared of being a single mom, since I didn't wanna be with her, and panicked. She apologized for not consulting with me first but she told me she needed my emotional support thru this time. Being livid that she didn't even ask me beforehand, I told her to fuck off. So she became spiteful and proceeded to tell all of my friends and family that not only did I know she was pregnant, but I also pressured her into the abortion. I know I don't deserve this but I can't help but think that if I  had just forgiven her right away for not consulting me and gave her emotional support, this wildfire would not have spread like this. Like I know she's still a POS for lying, but I feel like I could've prevented this by being the bigger person.

527,Not the A-hole,"The situation is basically the title.

My bf \[M27\] and I \[F25\] have been dating almost 3 years and are now talking seriously about marriage. He is a huge petrol head and love cars and motorcycles. Hes been riding since he was 16 and I truly believe his is a skilled rider. I don't personally ride but have been on the back of his bike a couple times. To be clear he has a sports bike that he goes way too fast on.

&#x200B;

The problem with his riding is that sometimes he wont wear all of his gear. For example, he wouldn't wear his jacket on a super hot day. This has always been an argument for us and whenever I see him not wearing it, I confront him. He admits that it's a stupid thing to do but he will still sometimes do it.

&#x200B;

Recently I did some self reflecting and decided I wouldn't be able to marry him and have a family if he didn't take his safety more seriously. I worry about him a lot when hes out riding and Im tired of nagging him about wearing his gear. So I told him that my condition for marriage would be that he promises to always wear ALL of his gear. And if for some reason he cant, he drives his car instead. When I say ALL, I mean: helmet, jacket (with armour in it), gloves, padded pants, motorcycle shoes, and turtle shell backpack with the neck brace. He owns all this stuff already so there's no expectation for him to buy anything.

&#x200B;

My side of the bargain is that if he does this I promise to always accept his riding. Its inherently dangerous, I know, but its his passion and I would not discourage him. He accepted this and admitted that hes been dumb not to do so in the past. His career depends on his body so if he were even to break a leg it could really set him back or even ruin him.

&#x200B;

I told my friend about this a couple days ago and he said that I was being super controlling. That I basically gave him an ultimatum and he only accepted because I manipulated him. I was shocked but heard him out and now I am having second thoughts about it. Maybe I was too harsh and unrealistic. I do believe that this arrangement is good for us. It does take a lot of stress and worry off my back, but maybe it puts more on his?

&#x200B;

So I am asking, am I the asshole for making my boyfriend agree to this in order for us to continue our relationship?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Told boyfriend to wear all his gear at all times or I wont marry him.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I would like to be clear that I didnt just tell him, ""wear the gear or we're done"". I told him my feelings, fears and concerns then told him what I wanted. Looking though the post, I see its not clear, but we did have a long calm discussion about it.",129,196,0.92

She had a really emotional day and I let her go home early as we had her scheduled to go out of town tomorrow for a week of training and I wanted her to take a day to relax before she had to go.

This morning the store owner and I were reviewing numbers and realized that this saleswoman is underperforming in many different areas. So the owner told me he was going to cancel her training reservations because he doesn’t want her to go train in another department when she isn’t strong in the showroom yet. On top of that she is very timid and I was instructed to let her know that if she doesn’t improve her numbers in a reasonable amount of time (30-60 days) we will have to part ways.

535,Not the A-hole,"My 21st birthday was on Wednesday and I took the day off to have a beach day with my friends. The day was fun, we went swimming and day drinking, and that's why it's so unfortunate what had happened.

Two of my friends are a gay couple and honestly fight often, especially when drinking, and a fight broke out. They began throwing food in the restaurant, yelling and cursing. This got us kicked out. They then begin physically fighting once we get to the car and throw food on the car seats. The restaurant security calls the police. Our DD, who didn't know the couple well, gets fed up with their bullshit and also calls the police on his own table! The cops show up and we have to explain to them what happened, there is a lot of drunk crying bullshit blah blah blah.

Our DD then ditches us over an hour away on the island. Luckily, the police let us go without writing anyone up.

The fight was really disorienting and overwhelming, especially because I was drinking myself and did not feel comfortable talking to cops (I wouldn't sober).

We uber home and when we get back, one kept yelling at ME saying it was ""all my fucking boyfriend's fault (he is referring to the DD, who I no longer am friends with, and was NEVER romantically involved with)""; I felt like he was blaming me for what had happened because I invited him and I kept telling him to stop calling the DD my boyfriend. He also complains about how HE had a bad time and never wanted to go! He was only concerned with his experience when he and his boyfriend ruined my birthday.

They did not apologize until very late the next day after one of our friends urged them to. I told them it wasn't cool and that I needed space. We were to have a house party on Friday, but I said that I didn't want to be around them when they were drinking and told the people I invited to celebrate my birthday that it was off.

They have the fucking party anyways. They bought me a cake and decorated our house, which was nice. I feel like a bitch for not appreciating it, but I cannot ignore my feelings. They just party a few days later like nothing happened. It also no longer felt like the party was for me, it was obviously just an excuse to drink, and while the cake was nice, I did not want to be around them drinking. It was also mostly their friends that they told to come despite my wishes, so I did not have a good time and went to bed early after blowing out the candles. I feel horrible, because I should have been celebrating, and some people even commented on how visibly miserable I looked, but I was not in the party mood.

**Tl;dr: My friends got the cops called on them for fighting during my birthday dinner. They eventually apologize and throw the birthday party I planned and cancelled b/c I didn't want to drink with them in our house. AITA for not appreciating the party and not forgiving them now?**",33,68,0.85

539,Asshole,"I've had this argument with my boyfriend repeatedly, just now again, because we came across the person at the heart of it. He thinks I'm in the wrong, I think he's not looking at my side of things at all. 

So here's what happened. 

A few years ago, while trying to reconnect with a friend I hadn't seen in years, I was invited to her house to eat.

I had told her that I was on a very strict low-fat, no carbs diet, with absolutely NO cheating - that I knew for a fact that if i cheated even once I would lose my footing and all would be lost - and would be glad to either bring something, eat before or if nothing was possible, we could just do something other than have a meal together.

I also had a very strict (and rigid) schedule to follow. To note, I have quite severe ADHD (the kind that plays on impulse control) and that was how I was able to manage it. 

I was on that diet for more than 8 months, had lost around 60kg at that point and had never cheated, not even once, and never diverted from my schedule, it kept me safe and doing what I needed to do. 

Thing is, when i got to her house - after 30 minutes of speed walking, tired and hungry - I found out she had invited someone else, some random friend I had nothing in common with but who just happened to have lived in the same country where I'm from, and they talked for hours with my being quite uncomfortable before she served food (this was maybe 4 hours past when I would usually eat) and she served us pasta with pesto.. nothing I could eat. When I asked if she had anything else, carrots or cucumber, anything, something I could eat, she brushed my concerns aside and said ""oh just eat it, one time won't hurt"".

So I caved, my stomach had been growling for hours at that point and I ate the food in front of me. I remember thinking after ""oh wow, this is how it feels to feel full, I'd forgotten"" and that was it for my diet. I tried to get back to it, but had very severe binge eating episodes instead and have not, ever, been able to get back to it. 

I blame her for what happened. I think a friend wouldn't do that to a friend.

My boyfriend thinks that since I put the food in my mouth, it's my fault and that I have no right to be mad at her for it.

What do you think? AITA or is she?  or is he?

&#x200B;

TLDR; ""Friend"" invited me to her house, ignored my dietary restrictions ( **after saying she would accommodate them** ) and served me food I couldn't eat. I ate it and it screwed up my diet. I still feel raw about it but my bf thinks I should take responsibility for it and not be mad at her.

&nbsp;

**Edit for the YTA clan:**

Okay, I hear you.

If you're an addict and someone puts drugs in your face, it's on you, and you alone, to walk away. No matter the situation.

Why do you think that's ok behavior on her part though?

&nbsp;


**Edit for the ESH and NTA :**

Thanks for at least looking at my side of things!

What I take from what you said was that I should've protected myself better and not entrusted another person with something so important. 

I wish I had known this beforehand. 

I shouldn't have done such a crazy unsustainable diet in the first place or at least found a way to make it more flexible. 

Thing is, I do have an eating disorder and even if you think it was completely insane, that diet was keeping me on track because it avoided all possible trigger foods, and, since my body was in ketosis, there were very little physical cravings as long as I ate my regular meals. 

In normal situations - read when I wasn't starving - I was able to sit and chat with my roommates while they baked cookies and not even be tempted to take a single bite.

It's because my resolve was so strong, I think, that I let myself believe that what she said was true and that cheating once didn't matter, that tomorrow I could go back as if nothing had happened.

Except I couldn't. 

What I wasn't able to regain was the unbreakable mindset I had: that I could do it, that it would be okay, that I got to decide what and when I ate and in what quantity.

That belief shattered and sent me in an ED spiral of death. Admittedly probably more because of the days that followed than because of that day, but still.

Maybe I'm fooling myself and I was doomed to fail, she just gave me a little nudge. But it really doesn't feel like it.

It felt like I was just happily doing my thing and someone came along and brutally shoved me off the path I was on.",283,522,0.85

542,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend (22) has a T-shirt from high school that he’s rediscovered after finding it while moving a couple weeks ago. It features the senior photo of his high school friend, roughly the size of a greeting card on a plain white background. Note: the friend is very much alive and well, so it’s not some kind of tribute to his memory or anything like that.

He’s worn this shirt maybe 3-4 times since then, without washing it. The first couple of times it was amusing, and we were just lounging around the house or going on errands so I really didn’t care. I have my fair share of dumb t-shirts that I wear casually so it’s not like I’m too concerned with being “presentable” all the time. The only time I made a comment about it was when we were making out at one point and I couldn’t keep a straight face with some kid with a glazed over, soul eroding stare inches below my face.

Last night we saw a movie and he wore it to the theatre (I was in jean shorts and a nice-ish top). I just rolled my eyes before we left and made some comment along the lines of “are ya really gonna wear that”. He said “Yes. Why, what’s wrong with it?” I think he was genuinely confused why it might be weird so I let it slide. We’re on a college campus so it’s not like the bar for what you should and shouldn’t wear is set super high. Whatever, I just laughed it off.

This morning, we’re at his place getting ready to go to the grocery store. He wants to wear the shirt *again*. I’m miffed for 2 reasons: one, he has plenty of other t shirts he can wear that are either clean (or at least haven’t been worn multiple times all week). Two, and most importantly...I’m tired of having to look at this guy’s face. I mean, it would be fucking weird if it was any random person’s face at this point, but this picture in particular is...not flattering. Purposely so. Hence why a bunch of 18 year olds thought it would be funny to make a shirt out of it, I’m guessing (the guy who’s face is on the shirt made them so it’s not like he wasn’t in on it). This (https://m.imgur.com/gallery/sy6xRGF) is the picture in question.

So Reddit, AITA for wanting my boyfriend to wear a different shirt today?

As she got sicker I went from babysitting to full time live in nanny.  I didn't really know the guy until his wife got really sick.  He worked all the time so most my interactions were with his wife.  When she got sick he changed, he stated coming home at 5 everyday and would work from home if he needed to.

Fast forward, I'm still the nanny.  I love his kids, 3 & 5, and he's become a great dad.  As I said he's home at 5, has dinner with us, spends time with his kids then sometimes works from home in the evening after they are in bed.  We talk more not just about the kids, we talk about each other's day.  Sometimes we watch a show on TV together after the kids are in bed.  I find myself wanting to cuddle with him but I don't.

1. I have a horrible sinus infection at the time of this and couldn’t smell ANYTHING. I just got started on antibiotics and steroids to try to bring my sense of smell back. Luckily the treatments are working and I can now smell strong odors again, and my prognosis is good! 
2. Switching each other’s loads to the dryer if we need the washer is a standard thing for us. It was discussed when we first got our washer and dryer that if you leave your shit in there, it is at the mercy of whiever needs it next. We each have baskets in the laundry area for loads to come out of the dryer if someone needs the dryer as well. We work opposite shifts so laudry overlaps happen. No previous issues.

I put my clothes in to wash and go inside (washer/dryer is in the garage). About an hour later when I go to switch my clothes to the dryer she comes in from the garage and yells at me, asking why I put her clothes in the dryer. We switch each others laundry loads all the time, so I was confused as to what she was upset about. She then tells me that the laundry in the washer was full of mildew since she washed it three days ago, and how could I think it was okay to dry clothes full of mildew. For one, I can’t smell. For two, I had no idea they had been there for three days. My feelings are that if you leave your shit in the washer to get full of mildew, that’s on you. Not on the person who needs to use the washer. She says I should have just rewashed her stuff before I washed mine. But again... I couldn’t smell the mildew. I didn’t know.

Me and my friends (about 12 of us) go on a yearly holiday for about a week and a bit every year, we rent a house and just get loose, heaps of fun. Anyway the only bad thing that's happened, and really the only bad thing that has happened in my group of about 7 years, is last time, they shaved my head. Now I'm a male but had been growing out my hair for about 14 months, I had had a very short generic haircut for most of my life and decided I wanted to get long hair, my hair is very curly so I went through quite a painful awkward stage of afro (I was affectionately called jewfro for a while) and eventually it got long enough where it hanged and looked good, I loved it, I fucking loved the hair that I had, and from the title you know where this is going.

So one fateful night on our trip, about 3 boys fucking shaved it with a buzz shaver. I was very drunk and passed out, they were quite drunk too and they shaved about 3 fat strips off before I woke up, but it was a write off.

I sprinted to the bathroom to look at the damage and it was not salvageable, I got really confused and just kept asking them why, I didn't even get mad or yell I was just sad. They had realised they fucked up at this point and were apologising heavily but I didn't care, few others head the commotion and came down and saw what happened and they were just shocked, everyone knew how much I cared about it.

So while we were all sure they were assholes for doing it, and the boys who did it showed a lot of remorse, I just decided there was no argument to be had, shaved the rest off and tried to continue the trip as normal. 

After the trip finished, we got our bond back, and since I bankrolled the trip (we rotate yearly) I gave back the bond to everyone except those 3, and they were livid. About half the group was on my side, saying that they took over a year's work from me, the other half were saying you can't just steal money for that.

Now that our yearly trip is coming back up, everyone has remembered the money and they are demanding to get it back, most of my friends now are saying to just give the money but I honestly don't want to, I'm currently STILL in an awkward phase of hair and I've had to go through it all again, I liked it so much when it was long that I decided to grow it again. So would I be TA if I didn't give them their money back?

I'm 18 in 2 days (Monday the 19th of August) and while I didn't have any concrete plans, I'd hoped to go get dinner with my friends and boyfriend and maybe see a movie. I also have to go into uni some time in the next few days to get ready for first year and I have a full time (seasonal) summer job, where getting time off is tricky as it's meant to be for the summer holidays.

My family never really have holidays, we just sort of take a break over summer as Mum and Dad struggle to get time off.

Today Mum told me we were going to go see my grandparents for today and tomorrow and I had both days off so I agreed and packed a change of clothes, and me, my brothers, my sister, mum and dad all got on a train to London Blackfriars, which we do normally, as to get to nan and grandads we have to go there and then get a connection.

We got to Blackfriars and I started heading over to the platform we normally get our connection to nan and grandad's from but Mum stopped me, and the family as one told me we were going to Brighton for a week for my 18th. The following dialogue ensued (this is all paraphrased as I don't really remember the exact words)

Me: While I appreciate the gesture, I have to work and go to uni and was hoping to stay home for my birthday.

Dad: Well, what do you want us to do? We're here now.

Me: I can look after myself so I'll go home and you lot can go to Brighton and have a nice week

Mum: But this is for your birthday!

Me: No one told me!

Mum: It was a surprise! We thought you'd be grateful!

Me: I'm really sorry but I have no interest in going to Brighton, and even if I wanted to, I still don't have the time to take a week off.

Dad: This is stupid. We've booked the train tickets, we've reserved the hotel, we're going.

Me: Okay, have fun without me.

I then went and purchased a ticket home. I had some time to kill so I went to McDonalds and my family had gone off somewhere so I assumed they got the train to Brighton. I've got on the train home and they've come onto the train and sat with me and they're telling me I'm an arsehole and being ungrateful and I've ruined the holiday for everyone because it was for my birthday, so they felt they couldn't go without me, plus they said they couldn't go on a family holiday without me.

Mum asked me to go on the hotel website and cancel their booking (they got all their money back) and it doesn't look like they've put down money for anything otherwise. Mum and Dad both rang work and cancelled their time off. I know I was ungrateful but I really don't have the time, and I have no interest in going to Brighton whatsoever, IDK why they thought I'd want to go. I had no notice, I didn't even have a week's worth of stuff, just what I'm wearing now, another shirt and pants and my laptop, although Mum says she packed me my books for next year and some more clothes in her suitcase, which I'd have known if I'd let them finish explaining.

During one of said breaks I was with another woman, Annie, who obviously didn't work out, and Jane and I got back together, and have been going strong for just over 3 years.

Asshole situation: I have numerous female friends, the majority of whom are in stable, long term relationships, about half of whom I was in relationships with, of varying degrees of seriousness, but nothing lasting more than a year or so. 

A few weeks ago, one of my exes, who I am on very good terms with had a baby with her husband, and I sent a baby gift basket with towels, soaps, cloths, clothes, etc. Jane had a problem with this, saying ""any woman you've had sex with can't be your friend and I don't want them in our life.""

This is an ongoing problem, considering that my most recent ex, Annie (broken up 4 years ago) and I are great friends, but I am not allowed to even mention her name, or even a similar one, considering that my ex feels I left her for her. This is in no way true, Jane broke up with me, and Annie happened to be there and we started dating 4 days later. Annie lives 2,500 miles away and doesn't know this, but I keep our friendship hidden and private, because Jane will fly off the handle at the very mention of her name. 

Also, I am not a jealous person, I have told Jane multiple times that she should keep her male friends, and go do things with her friend group that she used to do, but once we got serious, she cut all contact with her male friends, and expects me to do the same with my female ones. 

I put my foot down last night and told Jane that my friends are very dear to me, both male and female, and that if she doesn't trust me, then she shouldn't be with me, and in my whole life, across multiple girlfriends, I've never once cheated, and she knows this. 

She called my mom on me, and my sister, and everyone is telling me I'm wrong, and that my fiancee is the best thing that ever happened to me, and to keep the peace I should acquiesce.

My motto was always, “It’s just hair, it’ll grow back.” My cosmetologist older sister gave me a major complex about my hair when I was younger resulting in me HATING my hair (I suffer from extreme childhood ptsd).


About 7 years ago I had a little cousin diagnosed with a rare cancer. She was 14 and afraid of loosing her hair to chemo. At the time my hair was just shy of my shoulders (the longest I ever let it get), and I promised to shave my head when she lost her hair. I did just that. Unfortunately she lost her battle after 14 months. That entire time I kept my hair short like hers. When she passed I decided to grow my hair out to donate in her memory. I’ve been growing it since and it’s half way down my back now.

Now that it’s years later and my hair is long enough to donate I’ve grown quite attached to it. Everyone knows why I decided to grow it out, though. My mom frequently asks when I’ll cut it to donate it. I’ve never been attached to my hair before because of my sister and the residual guilt is killing me.

Would I be an asshole if I kept my hair?

UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment and vote. I have read everyone’s responses and  learned a lot! Thank you so much for all of the suggestions. I didn’t even know that a lot of places aren’t taking hair donations anymore. I don’t really have money but I do have time, so I am going to find a way to donate that in lieu of the hair for now. I think/hope the people around me will understand that. I think it was mostly myself making me feel guilty about it. I genuinely thought I was being an asshole for changing my mind.",127,886,0.94

559,Not the A-hole,"Our office have a pantry with a good variety of food, from coffee and tea mix to cookies and biscuits to instant noodles. They are free for all and we are allowed to help ourselves, but it is basic decency to only take what we need.


I am the one in charge of topping up the pantry when the stocks are low. I would visit a supermarket nearby, grab whatever on sale, pay them with my own money, carry them back to the office, fill a claim form with the receipt, unpack them and put them neatly into their respective areas in the pantry.


The food in the pantry have recently been cleared much faster than before and as a result the top up frequency has increased too, that means more trips to the supermarket. I decided to keep an eye on it and very soon found the source of that fast clearance.


A colleague in her late 20s has been living on the food in the pantry. She would eat the biscuits and coffee for breakfast, instant noodles for lunch and bring home some others for dinner. When I asked her about this, she said that since it's free she could save money for food by taking from the pantry. I told her that her action is not only poor etiquette, it is also unhealthy to live purely on processed food near expiry date(thus on sale). She got defensive and told me to mind my own business. 


I want to report this to the higher ups, maybe get her to be the one topping up the pantry stock instead of me. But I wonder if it would get her into trouble, WIBTA if I do that?",30,41,0.81

I cant stand having food or drinks near expensive electronics, and the last 2 times I told her that it's not ok and not to do it. I came home last night to a dirty paper plate with pretzels on it on top of the laptop. So I changed the password and the lock screen to say ""Dont have food or drinks around the laptop. Password will be changed back in 7 days"" and went to bed (working 3rd shift lately).

Girlfriend woke up to play games on it and is doing that immature get-counter-mad thing. Made a big deal that she did all my laundry yesterday (which she does because she doesnt pay 1/2 of what she should in rent) and if I dont want her using my laptop I should just say so.

563,Asshole,"I'm 21 years old, and my sister and my niece are both 12. They both are in the same class at school, and so when my sister was performing a part for a school play, my niece was as well. The night before the play which I had planned and worked around my schooling to attend, my sister asked me not to come. I get it, she's nervous and embarrassed, but it hurt my feelings a bit. Still, I wanted to go and see my niece sing and act, and she wanted me to come watch as well. Her parents (my brother and SIL) couldn't make it (or didn't want to make it most likely), so I thought it was important that at least someone was there for her.

It was shockingly good, I don't just mean to imply I thought it would be bad, I want to say it outright. I was expecting it to be a train-wreck, but all the kids were a solid C to B-. After it was done I went to congratulate my niece on her performance, introduce myself to her teacher (not single and not interested in men, damn), and ""borrow"" some biscuits they had set up backstage. I saw my sister, and I gave her a nod hello and didn't say anything else to her the whole time.

It's been a couple of days, and she's been even moodier than normal to me, and I'm probably going to apologize to her for ignoring her. However, I want to know if it was actually an asshole move. My view is that she asked me not to come, but I still had to go no matter what because I wanted to watch my niece, so I did my best to avoid her and not embarrass her. AITA?

Edit: idk if anyone is still reading this, but I apologized to my sister this morning, and she started crying. I think I was more hurtful to her than I imagined, and certainly more than I intended. This thread has also made me realize I've been assholeish in other ways to her, I'll work on it. 

I'm not apologizing for hitting on their teacher though, she's a babe, and both my niece and sister have said as such and have heavily implied in the past they think it would be ok if I shot my shot, although they didn't exactly use that term.",272,1235,0.93

566,Asshole,"First, coming up with the money for the present isn't an issue. I can comfortably come up with it. However, they've insisted to all attending the wedding that they do not want gifts but money instead. I'm not a fan of the idea, I think it's greedy.. However that is not the reason I don't want to give them $200 (100 from myself, 100 on my wife's behalf.

We ended up renting tuxedos (not suits despite some input from everyone else). The bill for the rental (for one night) is 250. To me that's a lot of money to toss out the window for one night, even if it's a wedding. Now they're asking all the groomsmen to take the Friday off before the wedding, to go golfing before the rehearsal that is on the Saturday. One weeks notice has been given, which is kind of a pain for everyone in the group. (let it be known I had Friday off regardless, so it doesnt impact me but the rest of the groomsmen were ""instructed"" to take a sick day. 

So a loss of a day's pay, loss of a sick day as none of the group get paid for their sick days, and $250 dollars for a tux rental... Is that good enough or Aita?

I asked him what was wrong and he said it was inconsiderate of me to have complained about being hungry and then gotten food when he obviously would have been hungry and not allowed to eat, especially because it smelled so strong in the car.

573,Asshole,"The context of this is important

My fiance was married two years ago, and tragically her husband died from colon cancer. She very much loved, and still loves him. She has worked with her therapist and grief support group and has come a long way in recovering, but of course he will always be a part her.


I did not know her husband, but I have been there to support her through much grief. Her friends, family, and work family (she works in the medical field) did know him and support her now, and both of them when he was living. /context 


A couple days ago, I was having digestive issues. I went to urgent care to get it looked at, and for formality purposes they transferred me to ER. Everything was fine that they could see, but this absolutely terrified her. She could hardly speak to me all day. It was like ptsd, and it took all day for her to be ok. I tried to comfort her, but there's not much I could do. 


Now to the point. Last night while talking with her, she casually mentioned that she was talking with her colleague (a doctor) when I was in ER, and he said ""Wow you're like a cancer sniffing dog"" which she found funny. 

I didn't. 

I have no idea why, but it really upset me. I like self depricating humor, am generally easy going, but it upset me. I didn't get angry, but came across as disappointed and hurt. I stayed to myself the rest of the night (which are the few precious hours we have together) , and near the end she was crying and confused. I didn't acknowledge it. I just explained that it upset me, and I don't have a logical explanation as to why. 

It made me try to get to the deeper reason of why it offended me. Was it because it was a joke at my expense from someone I don't know? Maybe a subconscious fear that I do have cancer? Was it jealousy she found comfort in someone else (another man who she is very close with) when she could hardly speak to me? The doctor I should mention was incredibly helpful and thoughtful to her and her husband as he was dying. I don't really know him though. 


I still don't know. I'm also constantly switching between whether I am being insensitive to her and her past, whether my feelings are justified, and feeling if I did comfort her for me being upset, that it would invalidate my feeling. 


Writing this out it all seems so petty. I know everything will be fine, and we will eventually talk about it. In the meantime I also want to make sure I'm not being an irreversible asshole.",22,38,0.85
574,Not the A-hole,"So let’s start this off with I know a license could come in handy and is really important for some people, like if someone needs to go to the hospital. It could also be a really freeing feeling and all of that is great and I probably should just get it for the sake but I know I would never drive.

So reasons I don’t want to get my license.
1. I had terrible claustrophobia, if I sometimes was in a car when I was little I would just start screaming and crying until I got to feel the ground again. This ofc got better with age but I am still suffering because my parents thought I was just being dramatic and it went untreated. I now still get panic attacks if the subway stops or start crying if I cannot unlock the bathroom door. Cars are my biggest trigger and I just don’t enjoy it at all. I know if I got my license I would hate driving and never would want to.

2. I live right outside my countries biggest city, there is amazing public transport and it is so much cheaper having a month ticket than gas. I don’t mind public transport one bit. 

3. If I got my license my mom would use me as her private chauffeur. She has been talking about it for years how I will pick her up at 12 pm at the metro when she is out (she is usually out multiple times a week), or I can drive her home from anywhere and I can go to grocery store all the time. I just don’t want to do that, I really appreciate her driving me from place to place time to time. When I went to dance she would drive me once every 3 weeks and she picks me up sometimes at the metro but it is super rarely as I am completely fine with bus. I only ask if there has been accident or it would take me so much longer to take public transport and I have something I need to do. I am a full time high school student, my last year so I will have little free time to pick her up and I will work out 3-6 times a week. I really don’t want to be a personal chauffeur on my free time. 

I 99% will probably just get my license but I am really not looking forward to it. Would it be an asshole move to say I won’t get my license if I have to drive my mom around all the time? (ofc I will do it occasionally, but I don’t want to do it multiple times a week each week)",20,40,0.86

So my 15 y/o daughter is grounded for reasons that aren't important here, for added context I am a SAHD.

When my wife got home from work she was upset that I took her out while she was on punishment without first discussing it with my wife. She says that we are supposed to be a team when it comes to discipline and that this should've been a decision we made together.

His dad died, mom got diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, a brother got into a really bad car accident that has him confined to a wheelchair for the time being, and a sister had a stillbirth. Seriously, if he needed a year to write a novel about, this would be it. He also lost his job but he managed to find an even better job so our marriage and his new job have been the only two bright spots in his year.

It's Day 1 in Manhattan and we're taking a walk through Greenwich Village. We're about to cross the street when we notice a little crowd on the corner across the street. Lo and behold, it's his favorite actor and his wife and they're talking and taking selfies with a few people. However, I can see they'd rather not be doing this, they're just being polite. The wife especially seems eager to get away.

My husband loves this guy, seen him in everything. Gets excited when something he's in comes on TV. The definition of a fan-girl. I don't have a problem with it, it's actually really cute. Naturally he wants to go over and say hello and thank you for giving him something to enjoy, etc.

I told him no, said it would be rude to go disturb them. He insisted we go and talk to them since everyone else was so they probably wouldn't mind one more person. I kind of grabbed him by the wrist like a four year old and jerked him down the street in the opposite direction. He got really angry, said that it not only embarrassing and unacceptable of me to drag him off like that, but he was also incredibly hurt because I know how much he loves this actor and when would he ever have a chance to meet him again? I told him to give the guy his privacy and go watch a movie don't try and stalk him through the streets of New York. He told me I was being rude and it wouldn't take more than a minute to say hello, thanks, and get a photo. I told him that going up to celebrities in the street when they aren't working or in some kind of professional capacity is weird and really rude.

I’ve been the only one financially supporting us since he lost his job and it’s been really really stressful, especially since I detest my job and am miserable at it but I can’t afford to find a new one and take the pay cut right now.
Money was becoming increasingly tight as time went on. He applied for unemployment a few weeks ago finally, but still hasn’t gotten any money from them. And he just got a job offer from the one place he applied to and starts in September.

The main issue/fight:
This guy is addicted to his energy drinks, he’ll have 4-6 per day and buys them two at a time from the gas station. He would just take my card from my wallet and my car without asking and go buy some and/or snacks. It got to the point where that was too much and I asked him (multiple times) to stop. I couldn’t afford it. Couldn’t even afford the gas he was using. I had to start hiding my wallet from him.
Now he will be starting a new job soon, he’ll still get the backpay from those few weeks of unemployment whenever it goes through, and I was forced to work a buttload of overtime at my shitty job this past couple weeks and will be getting a pretty hefty paycheck next Friday.
I’ve been really extra depressed lately, mostly due to the financial stress and hating my job, so I bought a PC game ($30) on my CREDIT CARD to give me something to keep my mind off things. Then I MENTIONED to him that I wanted to buy a cheap new PC because right now I just have a shitty old laptop.

I have $300 from that already, and I’d need $130 more out of my checking account to purchase all the computer parts. And again, I haven’t bought it yet, I was asking what he thought about it.

His response was salty as fuck and he bitched me out for wanting to spend MY money on ME (now that I can finally afford to) but not wanting to give him $15 every single day for energy drinks anymore.. when all he’s been doing is staying at home and sleeping all day.

590,Not the A-hole,"This is a bit of a long explanation. Essentially, I’m transgender, and my family, sister included, hasn’t taken that well. I came out years ago, while still in high school, but my family reacted badly and it was kinda pushed under the rug.

Fast forward to a year ago. I’m an adult, not living at home anymore, I’ve been completely out and transitioning for a few years. I visit home for a while and notice that my family, including my sister, is trying their best to act as though nothing has happened in the past few years. I try to brush it off because I still love them as family and hope that one day they’ll come around.

My sister announces that she and her long-time boyfriend are getting married. Awesome, they seem good for each other. She takes me aside late one night and tells me that she talked it over with the groom and neither of them want me at the wedding. Well, this hurts an awful lot, but I’m still hopeful that things will eventually turn around. I try to be respectful, and accept their decision. I want the best for them either way, and I want them both to have as good a wedding as they can. If that means I’m not there, and that’ll actually make them happier, then so be it.

About a week or two later my mother is speaking to me about the wedding and is asking some probing questions of me and I respond that I’m not going because my sister and her fiancé explicitly didn’t invite me. While my mother is also quite upset with my transgender identity, she now becomes upset with my sister for not inviting me.

A few days later my sister contacts me, saying that our mother spoke to her and convinced her that she does want me at her wedding, but to come as my pre-transition self. I’m more than a little surprised, and try to politely decline—I’m not willing to pretend nothing happened over the past few years, nor am I prepared to convincingly maintain the deception. Finally, I state that I was sorry if our mother had put pressure on her, and that I want her wedding to be how she wants it, not as our mother says. My sister became defensive, saying she wanted me at her wedding all along, and that our mother didn’t do anything. I insist that I don’t feel comfortable with the arrangement. She claims it will ruin her wedding if I’m not there.

Since then, I’ve been continuously reminded of the invitation offer by both my mother and my sister. I gave my final refusal, and the wedding has been over for quite some time, but I’ve been feeling guilty. Could I have handled it better, or should I have attended the wedding anyway?",62,275,0.92

592,Not the A-hole,"I’m about a week away from giving birth and I have mentioned to my family that I don’t want pictures of my son’s face on Instagram or Facebook. I used to have both active social media accounts but I stopped using them after my father passed away in February 2018. They gave me too much anxiety and since I stopped using them I wouldn’t even be able to see the photos people post. One of my aunts said to me the family “deserves” to see him, but isn’t that what texting is for? I don’t think I am being unreasonable at all, if anyone would like to meet my child they are more than welcome to come visit or text or FaceTime. I’m just not comfortable with putting his face out there for everyone to see. I don’t feel like everyone on IG or Facebook “deserves “ to see him. Am I being too protective and over bearing about this?",117,375,0.93
593,Asshole,"Literally just happened minutes ago and now she's not talking to me.

Girl and I bought a Wii-u yesterday to play some Legend of Zelda games that came out on the Wii and the u. The console came with Mario Cart 8 as the store selling the console had a vast surplus of the game. Girlfriend and her brother and niece were playing Mario Cart that night and having fun together.

Fast forward to today. We both sit down to play after a long day and I suggest we play Mario Cart since I haven't played in years. 

I stole the first race from her (she was in 1st for 95% of that race), just barely lost to her in the second race. All is well, and we're having fun.

Third race rolls around, and she and I are struggling for the lead. She was better toward the beginning of the track and would pull ahead, but there was a shortcut I kept nailing to get in front of her.

These whole three races I'd been getting shit for items, but at the very end of this track I picked up a triple red turtle shell (think homing missiles) as I was pulling ahead of her. We were at the very end and I thought, ""What the hell, I'm in first and it's the end of the race, it's not like I can use these items anyway."" So I unload them behind me, right where my gf was driving. She got hit by all three and ended up coming in third instead of second.

She's now mad because she thinks it was unnecessary and unfair.

I realize this is a pretty unorthodox question, I'm just not sure if I was in the wrong here.",119,306,0.87
594,No A-holes here,"So me and my girlfriend have been together for 3 years and we both loved thia cartoon called ""Steven Universe"". Although it's a cartoon it gets really deep sometimes. 

So on an episode there was a song called ""Here Comes a Thought"" and it became our song especially the part that goes ""Take a moment to think of just flexibility, love, and trust"". It was sung by the character that represents a strong relationship by fusion. (Would take to long to explain what this relationship is and why it's strong and what fusion is.)

So I thought about a ring that represented what that character stood for. I had the ring custom made The ring had 3 gems a ruby, sapphire, and amethyst. (I didn't know garnet could come in purple, I didn't get the show wrong, shut up about it)  Red and blue, and purple to show the connection of the two.

So when I proposed at first she was so excited and she said yes on her way home we started talking about the ring.

First she said ""I love it but why did you choose it.""

I explained it to her and she said

""So you bought me a ring based of a cartoon""

I was shocked by this we had always watched the show together and loved the song I mentioned earlier. I thought that instead of getting some bland expensive clear rock I would get something that meant something, or so I thought. 

I asked her ""But I thought you loved the show, it always meant more to us than just another tv program.""

She said ""yah but why would you buy something so important based off it""

Once we got home I had to go on a drive only and think. 

So am i the asshole for buying a ring based off a kid's show.


Edit: Alright so we talked about the ring then we talked more about life and what we would do after getting married. This made of realize we're not ready to be married. That we both need time to ourselves. So... we broke up. Not because of the ring but because we realized we weren't for each. I know that kind of came out left field but that's what it is.",1116,5941,0.95
595,Asshole,"Every Friday, me and my friends go out to eat dinner. Afterwards, we always stop by the next door Starbucks to get four cups of whipped cream. It started as a joke based off the fact that I discovered that cups of whip cream are free, and my friends wanted me to prove it. For clarification, they’re the smallest size cups available, and they don’t take up much time. We only go when it’s uncrowded so as not to take time away from actual customers. After the first few times, we did start tipping them about a dollar or more every time. 

After a few months, I noticed that one particular barista began to seem annoyed by my weekly visits. He didn’t say anything about it, and didn’t seem to bothered, so I thought nothing of it. I didn’t see him for a few weeks after that and I kind of forgot all about him. 

However, when I went in today, he was there at the counter. He made a face and said “really? Every Friday? Are these just for you?” I explained that these were for my friends who wait outside, because they don’t want to take up too much space. He said, “fine, but this is the last time. After today, I don’t want to see you in here again.” I said okay and left with the cups, after still tipping him. 

I felt bad about it afterwards, but I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. Am I the asshole?

TLDR: every week I get four child size cups of whipped cream from Starbucks and still tip, and one of the baristas got fed up and told me I can’t order there anymore.",127,127,0.86
596,Not the A-hole,"so I've been wanting a dog for years now and had been saving up for one, amazingly as a surprise gift my family pitched in and got me 900$ for a dog and the rest (if there is any) can be spent on dog stuff. 

I went to our local SPCA and spotted this puppy (no photos as I'm still in the process of getting him) he is half pitbull. 

my mum (who came with me) automatically told me that I cant get a pitbull and that I needed to pick a different dog, I objected and said that it's my money (it's even in my bank account) and I'll be buying him. we had pretty big argument over it and she was incredibly mad that I would not just pick another dog. 

mum told my family who are now incredibly mad at me and I've been told that if I get the dog my neices and nephews are never coming to visit as they worry about the dog. 

I've decided to go and get the dog but I feel like complete shit and really just need outsider opinion if getting this puppy is actually a good idea.

597,Not the A-hole," I work in a nursing home/ assisted living/ independent living biking . I mainly do housekeeping. Sometimes I do reception and activities. I am not a nurse. My boss is aware I have been dealing with health issues for over a year. She knew this before becoming my boss. I had the start of cervical cancer and went through several biopsies, Pap smears and a surgery that burned off the bad bad tissue called a leep. I have been having normal screens since the leep but my doctor feels it necessary to do a biopsy as soon as possible. She doesn’t feel I’m in danger but gynecological guidelines suggest a repeat biopsy to check the deeper tissue. It’s next Tuesday and if I rescheduled I couldn’t be seen until 2020. 

they fired two people in April. We are struggling to replace them. Another coworker is on maternity leave. One just quit. I have been coming in early, on my days off, staying late and switching units to accommodate staffing needs. I told my boss two weeks in advance I need pto for that day. She approved it, but asked me if I was willing to work the day after which is my normally scheduled day off. I said no. 

Biopsies are normally no big deal. My doctor recommends I don’t lift for up to 72 hours after. I told my boss I had someone willing to cover my Thursday so I could rest after the procedure Tuesday. We lift heavy mattresses, move furniture, dust, bend all day which is the last thing I want to do after having a biopsy on my cervix. the girl bailed on me after saying she would cover my shift. My boss won’t allow me to have that time off because she doesn’t want to ask other people to switch days off, units or help a little more that day.  I feel it’s a little hypocritical because she asks me to all the time and I routinely work 8 days in a row to help her out.  Sometimes I clean 18 units a day with another woman. 

The girl who said she would cover just told me to call out. I’m seriously considering doing it so I can rest like the doctor recommends. Last biopsy and leep I was back at work the day after and it fucked my body up for months after. I feel guilty knowing they are short staffed but at the same time I also need to care for me and it’s not like I’m in a crucial area that will jeopardize patients health or safety.",27,38,0.94
598,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR FIL’s girlfriend is trying to invite herself to another family event she hasn’t been invited to. 
Okay y’all buckle up. So I’ve ranted in JustNoMIL about my FIL’s crazy girlfriend and how she’s weirdly obsessed with my daughter. Not suuuuper pertinent info but it does give some backstory on my feelings for her. I made this account to rant about her because my other reddit is the same name as all of my other social media. 

Anyways me and my fiancé recently got engaged in June and have been planning for our wedding early next year. My mom is paying for our venue but when we approached my fiancé’s parents about contributing his dad said he “would see if it fit into the budget” for him to contribute. That’s fine, he’s not obligated to help pay for our wedding because it’s OUR responsibility. 

Except since this talk (3 weeks ago) he’s bought tickets to 6 different concerts, two of which are out of state, and booked a trip out of the country for a few weeks after our wedding. This sounds petty BUT I’m not mad that that’s how he’s choosing to spend his money, I’m mad that he didn’t just straight up tell us he didn’t want to help pay for our wedding and made it out to seem like he was low on money. 

So fast forward to now, my in laws have been divorced for 5 years now. they still talk and see each other almost every single day, but they both have significant others now. MIL lives with her BF and FIL’s GF lives in a city about 30 minutes away so he spends almost every weekend there with her.  

As I stated before, she’s kind of a nightmare. We had a birthday party for my daughter in November which she invited herself to and it was a freaking nightmare. My fiancé and I decided not to invite either of his parents significant others to the party, but FIL told us that MIL had said that his girlfriend could come in so we let her. That’s not actually how things happened but that’s a whole other story. My MIL had an anxiety attack and left the party early just because they were in the same room. 

Now, she’s trying to pull the same thing with our wedding. Fiancé and again said no significant others because his parents will be spending most of the day together and both SO’s will be jealous. Well he went to FIL with this and he said we should invite both of them and see what happens. 

Uh no. 

MIL’s SO will be respectful and not accept because he knows that that’s a line he doesn’t personally want to cross and he respects FIL’s position in MIL’s life. FIL’s girlfriend however.... I know that she would probably accept and I don’t wanna have to worry about that all day on MY wedding day. I’m so scared that my MIL will want to leave early or she’ll cause other issues during the day. And it’s pissing me off that FIL had no interest with our wedding until we said his GF couldn’t come. 

AITA for not letting FIL’s girlfriend come to our wedding?",48,29,0.83
599,Not the A-hole,"Disclaimer - this happened a couple of years ago, but I'm still thinking about it because basically all of my friends thought I was TA and that I shouldn't have said anything. 

Basically, part of the core curriculum at my university involved taking one science class, so a lot of people who weren't particularly fond of science related material all were in the same class together.

The first exam of the semester was particularly difficult, for me despite the fact that I studied a week leading up to the test, during the exam I knew I wasn't going to do well, and that was the general feeling throughout the room. 

Halfway through the test I noticed a girl was on her phone and looking at the slides the professor gave us to study and copying down charts, and graphs. 

I told the professor what I saw when I turned my test in, and she was livid to say the least. 

I never saw that girl in class again, I wasn't sure if she was asked not to come back or dropped the class after the professor talked to her. I had to do a statement for the school's honor council, and it was my word against hers so she wasn't kicked out of school for it. 

But I heard through her friends that were still in the class that whoever turned her in was a b\*\*\*, that they should have honored the 'unspoken code between students' not to narc... etc. 

My own friends also thought I shouldn't have said anything because she had to drop the class and I may have messed up her schedule to graduate on time, basically saying that I messed with her life because she had to go through the honor council and could have gotten kicked out of our university. 

But I think she did it to herself by cheating, if she had just failed with the rest of the class she would have been fine! The professor told us after we got the results that she was going to drop the lowest scoring test from our final grade, and made the first test particularly hard to scare us (only two people got As, a handful got Bs, and the rest got Cs and Ds). 

Was I TA for telling my professor what I saw?",84,73,0.9
600,Not the A-hole,"At my restaurant, there is a manager-in-training (MIT) who has been at our location for about a month now. We normally get along fine and will occasionally make chummy conversation. 

Today his training was to follow a server and learn what they do. He shadowed me for 20 minutes and I walked him through what I was doing. At one point, he was watching me enter information into our computer so I had my little notebook on the counter open. He laughed at how sloppy my notebook was so I explained that was writing in the margins because I only had like 10 blank pages left and I wanted to make sure I optimized each page.

Cut to the end of the day.

I was closing so it was only my general manager, the MIT, and I. My manager was on the floor and I was doing my final paperwork with the MIT.  He handed me my money and said I owed $4 to the restaurant.

Right after he tells me that, he reached into the apron I’m wearing, grabs my notebook, throws it in the thrash, and tells me to buy a new one.

A few things about this: this was a nice notebook and I am a female wearing an apron around my waist. Not to be dramatic but I was not okay with how close his hand was to my lady bits.

I immediately snapped and was loudly telling this MIT how rude and disrespectful that was. I took his $4 and threw it in the trash too. 


Since my actual manager heard all of this and came to calm me down. I plan on apologizing to him for not handling this with tact and because I may have overreacted.

I could have easily retrieved the notebook from the mostly empty trash. But I was too angry and felt so dehumanized.

Right before we were leaving, one my best friend's texted me ""bet 20$ on 32!!"" (this is for roulette in case you don't know) because he saw my instagram story at the casino. I took this as a friendly suggestion and thought oh, maybe it will be good luck. in no way did the text suggest, I make the bet FOR him, but just as a suggestion. the exact text was ""bet 20$ on 32!!"".

Anyway, I make the bet and somehow, win... the prize is hundreds of dollars, over $500. Anyway, right away, nothing to hide, I text my friend OMG IT WON!!!"" and hes like omg thats amazing... blah blah blah and I said thank you for the tip, you're good luck.

Anyway, I thought that was the end of it, and in my mind, I planned to buy him dinner or something next time I saw him, but I've heard from multiple friends that he has been bad mouthing me behind my back that he expected I would offer him half. he's been saying I am selfish and the only reason I won is because of him (true). he has not said ANYTHING to me, but multiple people in our friend group told me he's upset about it.

In the time she’s been gone, one of my seniors has been clashing with me and I haven’t really had any way to mediate it since she’s our only manager. It’s been making me fairly stressed and upset, so instead of ignoring recruiters on LinkedIn like I usually do, I ended up talking to them.

I’ve gotten an offer for a job with a 15% pay raise, better benefits, and better work life balance - the caveat is that they want me to start in September instead of late October like I hoped for, so right before Q4. For context, Q4 is when our team is the absolute business and swamped with work, and I’m one of the most reliable/top performers on the team, which is fairly small. My absence would make the busiest time of year extra busy for the whole team.

My mom wasn’t awesome growing up, but she is trying really hard now. She has her flaws, but we talk weekly and get along pretty well now. However, about 6 months ago, I noticed an odor when I was around her. I kept quiet about it for a while, but it was persistent, so I finally mentioned it to my sister when she was home from out of state. She said she thought the odor was related to my mom’s car, like mildew or something, so I let it go. For a while, I didn’t notice it, but I wasn’t around her for long periods either. Then, I started to notice it again. It’s not like BO. It’s more of a heavy smell. I don’t know how to describe it. Anyway, my sister and my dad, who lives in the same house as my mom, didn’t mention it and I’ve never had a super keen sense of smell, so I dismissed it. Then, I got a call from one of her coworkers. My mom has been at the same place of employment for 50 (yes 50!) years, so I know most of her coworkers. She asked if I’d noticed an odor coming from my mom and went on to say that some days it was unbearable and she wanted me to approach my mom about it because no one wanted to embarrass her at work. 

I called my dad and sister and told them what was up, then went to my parents’ home to talk to her about it. I tried to be as delicate as possible, but she flipped. She screamed over and over that she doesn’t have an odor and the people at her work are out to get her and she must have said “I’m fine” 100 times. It was so tense she threatened to leave her own house. I begged her to just have a check up, but she has a real phobia of doctors and flat out refused. 

In the midst of all this, my sister was pregnant and has since had her baby. My mom has cataracts and, as a result, doesn’t drive long distances. This means, it was on me to take her to a baby shower in my sister’s state and to take my mom to the hospital when the baby was born. Both times, in the car and in the rooms, her stench was nauseating. 

I want my mom to be healthy, but her denial is infuriating. At this point, I’ve refused to drive her to see her grandchild until she takes care of a problem that she won’t even acknowledge. In truth, I’m embarrassed for her and embarrassed by her. AITA?

Edit: The smell, to me, is medical. It’s not body odor and it’s not exactly like infection. Best case it’s bladder incontinence, as the smell is not always evident, but her unwillingness to address it is causing an ongoing issue. Mom is nearing 70.

Edit 2:  I appreciate all the suggestions related to what might be going on with my mom. She is really petite, so I don’t think it’s anything related to weight. I’m going to her house later to check the washer and foods and vitamins. I hope it’s something small that I can take care of, even without her knowing, although I know it’s most likely medical.

This year though, he came over with his mother for a few days. We live in a pretty rural area and their time was limited so we all decide to stay at his parents which is in a major city.


A few weeks prior to this, I was cleaning out my room at my parents and found two folders filled with Pokémon cards. I probably started this collection in 1999 and knowing that my partner's son likes Pokémon, asks him if its ok to give them to him when he's here. He loves the idea.

Yesterday, after we had a lovely day together, we gave him the folders and although it was from both of us, it was mentioned that it was my collection and I became super cool to a 7 year old. He's obsessed and literally tries to take the folder into the bath with him. His mum also loves the present. She has asked us in the past not to buy him expensive presents as it isn't how she's raising him and we've respected that.

Later on, his auntie comes by with a huge present for him - a very expensive radio controlled car. It's great but it's not holding a candle to the Pokémon cards.

608,Not the A-hole,"This has been weighing heavily on my heart for some time, please please be respectful towards the situation. This is absolutely not a validation post, I’m legitimately torn about what to do.

My (27F) bf (24M) have been together for 2 years and he has a 12 year old dog that he’s had since he was just a boy. This dog is his absolute best friend, and he very clearly loves her deeply.

The entire time we’ve been together, the dog has never been healthy. She is just absolutely miserable and sad. She has lumps all over, which we have been told are not cancerous, but one is the size of a grapefruit by her ribs that continues to grow. I have asked the vet if the lumps could still cause her pain and they said that it could if they were growing against sensitive areas or pushing on something internally. She has bald patches, whimpers all the time, limps, shakes, pants, goes to the bathroom regularly in the house, and just in general looks to be in pain, but when we’ve taken her to the vet, she becomes very stoic and they can’t find anything “wrong” with her. We’ve taken her multiple times within the last 2 years and have spent about $1,000 in testing each time, only to be told that she is an old pupper.

My bf hears this from the vet, and that’s what he’s running with. He’s in complete denial, and he’s even admitted that he is just terrified of loosing her. When he looks at her, he looks like he wants to cry. When she has accidents in the house, he gets very quiet and sits away from everyone and mindlessly scrolls his phone.

We’ve had the talk about her being in pain, and he’s made it very clear that he would NEVER put her down. He knows he couldn’t handle it. He has plans for a funeral in place if she dies (like family and friends, ceremony, etc. It seems a little over the top, but like I said, she’s his best friend). I’m doing all I can to be respectful of his wishes, and do what I can do make her comfortable and cared for.

So, here’s where the dilemma comes in, everyone who sees the dog asks why we are allowing her to suffer. Everyone. Friends, family, even neighbors have voiced concerns about us keeping the dog alive. I’ve been called every name in the book, have been called cruel, cold hearted, and vindictive for wanting to keep her alive when she is so obviously in pain. When I try to tell people that it’s not my dog and I’m respecting my bf’s wishes, they tell me I have to convince him or take her in myself to just get it done. 

Considering that this has been going on for 2 very long years, it’s impossible to tell how much longer the dog will suffer before she passes of natural causes. I love my bf, and I respect that this is a horrible situation and decision, but I have so many sources around me telling me that I need to be the strong one and make this decision for him because he can’t do it himself. AITA for refusing to put my bf’s dog down?

TLDR: My bf’s dog is sick and he wants her to die naturally, although she has been truly suffering for 2 years. IATA for not putting her down?",54,43,0.9

610,Not the A-hole,"Look, I get it. I sound like an asshole, but here's the thing: I inherited a beautiful classic vintage leather purse from my mother. I was raised vegetarian but become vegan in my early adulthood because I really did not see a need for animal products in my life at all. 

But this purse. This bag has a very recognizable silhouette, and it's absolutely beautiful and functional, and most importantly, it was a staple of my late mother's wardrobe for *decades.* 

She wore this bag throughout my childhood, and it's the most precious material connection I have to her just because it was so present for my entire life with her. I am delighted to carry it everyday and have this part of her with me. 

However, like I said, it's an extremely recognizable bag. If you know enough about fashion, you know the brand, and you know that it's leather. I don't believe the brand has ever released a faux leather bag and certainly didn't when my mother bought this one. It's not hard to tell that I'm a hypocritical vegan carrying a leather bag. 

But really, that doesn't come up a lot. I'm not terribly vocal about my veganism. Until recently, the dissonance has not come up. 

I recently was invited to the home of a friend of friend for a small group who get together on occasion to cook and learn and share vegan recipes. I figured it would be great way to expand my cooking skills within the limits of veganism so I was excited. However, one woman there (someone neither nor my friend knew prior) absolutely cornered me about the bag. I tried to explain that it was my mother's and that I don't otherwise partake in using animal products. 

Well, she told the host who flipped shit. It turned into a rant about people who explore veganism as a fad diet, continue to support industries that are abusive, etc. 

I apologized and left. Sure, I'll never be returning there regardless of my judgement, but my friend is now upset with me. She knows about it being my mother's bag and she's never had an issue with it before, but now she tells me she thinks it's disgusting and that I am being shitty for using it.

I don't know, I mean this bag has more sentimental value than anything else I own, and the animal died for this bag before I was born. 

I never thought about it too much before. I don't know what to do, as many of friends are vegans and are friendly with the people at the get-together. AITA? 


tl;dr I am a vegan who hangs around another vegans frequently, but I carry my late mother's vintage leather purse",796,2218,0.93
611,Not the A-hole,"  So for my 16th birthday my parents took me to The smoky mountains in Tennessee. This is 4 hours away from us. For my birthday my parents suprised me by taking me there and i appreciate it, but the thing is I hate it there. I went there when i was younger and enjoyed it so they think i still enjoy it.  The only thing i asked for was to go out and eat with my family.  I wanted to chill out on my birthday and grind some R6 ranked with my bois. Also wanted to play some games with my family.
  
  So when we arrive there, my dad hated our cabin. Cars were zooming by our street. We also brought our dogs and there was no grass for them to pee/poop. So my parents start complaining about the cabin and i quickly throw out my opinion. Mom gets pissed and say i wasnt raised like this. I felt selfish but i did not want to be there. This is friday and we were going to stay there for the weekend and then school monday.
 
 It ends up that i have the descion whether we stay for 2 days or leave now. I asked if we could just stay for one night and they say no. So i say we should leave and now we are on our way back home. Mom and sis aee pissed. I feel horrible and selfish, also fell kinda like a spoiled brat, but dont know if im an asshole. If you have any questions id love to answer.

Our oldest passed away about 14 months ago. It was very unexpected and it’s been ineffably difficult, especially for his younger siblings. Our son was a lot of things but he was a very loving and playful big brother and I can’t express how much he meant to them. He was 15 years old.

Anyway, our son was a very gifted athlete and inherited a love of baseball from his maternal grandmother. That old woman can hardly remember our names anymore but she still remembers and loves her Cardinals. 

Our oldest wanted to play for that team, like I’m sure millions of kids do, as a way of making his grandma proud and we supported his athletic pursuit. 

He had a few cherished possessions and they included his baseball glove, bat, as well as a collection of hats and sunglasses. 

In unfortunately spend a lot of time away from home because of work and after this last year I thought they would like to have something that belonged to their brother that they could always keep with them.

So today I gave them these items. For the first time since he passed, they seemed happy. They clung to those items. 

Now, I thought this was okay. Over the last year we left his room the same and it’s been common for one or more of us to just spend hours sitting in that room. 

My wife did not react well when she learned what I’d done. She stomped into their rooms where they had the items and took them back to our son’s room and demanded that no one ever take anything from his room ever again. She was screaming at these kids as if they’d done something horrible.

So this made me angry. I addressed it with her privately in our room. I was angry about how she reacted to the kids and she was mad because she des what I did as going behind her back and taking items from our son.

It wasn’t a pretty argument and culminated with me saying that this is what our son would have wanted and as much as it hurt, we have to be their parents now. 

Now it’s been quiet all day and I’m sitting here wondering what on earth to do",46,200,0.96

614,Asshole,"I(44M) have 16 year old son.He’s a moody teenager now of course. 

When summer break started he went to a party, and came home absolutely wasted. I grounded him for a week, turned wifi off. He didn’t care about it at all. He just laid in bed all day and I had to bring food to him and he wouldn’t even eat it. He has been like that for whole summer. I ask for his help sometimes, he always says he’s doing something, or he’s tired. My wife asked him to clean the room multiple times, it’s a huge mess, he said he would and he never does. He also locks the door all the time and if I need to talk to him, give him food or get something I have to stand there and knock for 15 minutes. 

I got fed up yesterday and took his door down. No reaction to that either. I told him to get up and clean his room. He told me to leave him alone. I took his phone and left the room. My wife agrees with me, but I talked to my sister (she lives next to us, we’re close) and she says I’m being harsh.

Update:he wouldn’t talk to me, I didn’t want to fight with him, I told him I’d put his door back up. I talked to one of his close friends. He told me that they were together whole time.My son left the party at midnight but came home around 3 am. I’ll try to talk to him again in few hours.",367,582,0.87

616,Asshole,"I'm a master's student at my university. I'm a computer science major but what my thesis deals with is music.

I use an electric nylon string guitar and there is basically nowhere to study or practice. I'm not particularly loud, it has no sound hole so the sound doesn't travel, but I do play in the computer labs on campus. I need to interface with the school computers directly, I can do little at home on my own.

There are no rules regarding noise. In fact, another of the MSc students plays a recorder. Not for any work, for fun. There's been complaints about me, though.

Last week I was doing my thing in the labs and there was a student with child. A baby, maybe no older than 6mo old in a car seat. I can't just stop what I'm doing, I work on deadlines, so I need to play. She got quite upset at me which I think prompted the formal complaint. I'm not going to say it's wrong for a baby to be here as every student's situation is different, but I'm here to do work for the university. Scholarly work. I like to think academics take priority in these computer labs.

There's been two other situations where formal complaints have been made, but my MSc supervisor brushed them off for the same reason I would: academics take priority.

617,Not the A-hole,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I’d make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as “looking like a bull” (I don’t agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.

Here’s how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of “take that thing out of your nose, you’re ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull.” The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn’t be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I’m not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn’t even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she’s insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I’m usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn’t even make sense) does not “ruin” my face and even if it does it’s really not her place. I’m a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

618,Not the A-hole,"This happened awhile ago but after talking about it in a chatroom today, ppl said Im wrong...

History: This same kid, at age 10, also was throwing rocks in my pool and busted the liner, when I spoke to his father about this, his 50+ yr old father attacked me verbally.  This is my backyard neighbor

So this is the story:

I have Nest cams all over my house. the backyard one is set on night vision, and is able to see infrared light (such as remote controls and other night vision lights.

One day I glanced at my backyard cam and spotted a light off to the left side. I got up and looked outside and saw NO LIGHT. I then noticed on my cam that the light moved, again I got up and looked and saw nothing. I took screen shots and pics. It was pitch black outside. It disappeared. FREAKY SHIT! I really thought I was seeing some satellite lights or something.

Forgot about it, till about 2 months later I was in the front yard with my dogs. If your dogs are trying to pee or sniffing around, what do you do? You stare at ppls houses. I saw a drone on top of the FRONTYARD NEIGHBORs  house across the street, that then disappeared in their backyard. I immediately thought that was what I saw 2 months before! I was like, ""Damn dudes a perv looking in my windows!"" But I figured Id do reverse psychology and knock on his door the next day to tell him there was a drone over their house and I was worried for their daughter...Thinking that if they know I know they have a drone they will stop. If what I typed makes no sense tell me. 

So I knocked and told dude about the drone. Dudes an asshole anyway most of the time so he just shrugged and closed the door.

I was gonna call the cops, but I was sitting here in my backroom when I see the backyard neighbors boy, now 16-17 in the corner of my property with an r/C remote in his hand from behind his fence. Asshole neighbor and this boy are not from same house. 

I get up and look, and I see the drone has crashed in my backyard. Boy then comes and rings my bell and asks for the drone. I tell him Ill get it and I PURPOSEFULLY crack the one ""wing"" rendering it unflyable on the way back to the front door.

PEEPING TOM disabled!

Am I an asshole for breaking a drone if its being used as a way to peep in windows?

620,Not the A-hole,"One of my friends got engaged 2 years ago and  pretty informally asked me to be in her wedding as a bridesmaid which I happily accepted. Fast forward since then and I started/finished grad school and started my dream career path. I also moved to a different state than her halfway across the country (pertinent information for later). Since her engagement there has been very little talk abut the wedding which is supposed to be this November. I was added to a group chat where the other girls have been sharing dress ideas/bachelorette party ideas but nothing has panned out successfully. 

Two days ago I receive an invitation in the mail for her bridal shower which is next weekend. I texted her mom to let her know that this is super last minute and I won't be able to make it since flights are super expensive. Her mom said she was super disappointed since the bridal party is going to all be there (all but one girl lives in the same town it's taking place in). Then, this morning, I got an insane job offer that will contract me October 26-November 9th. I called my friend to talk because she never locked down a specific date for the wedding in the group and I wanted to see if I could make it work. She flipped out because she decided it was going to be November 2nd and demanded that I have to come because I made a commitment to her and I would ""ruin the entire flow of the wedding and photos"". 

I feel bad because I did tell her I would be there for her on her day but I also think it's pretty disrespectful to not give your wedding guests proper advance notice of when events are going to take place. Flights are expensive and I'm just starting out in my job so I don't have a lot of money to spare, especially if I don't take this assignment. If I had even received a save the date I would have blocked out my calendar 100% and gotten flights months ago.

623,Not the A-hole,"My child attended a high end summer day camp for the first time this year. Tuition is nearly 10K if you stay the full 8 weeks, and I could only afford 5 weeks which was still a hefty amount of money, but I wanted him to have the summer of his life after countless boring ones. Today was his last day, and he came home in tears. He has 5 counselors, and I was emailed a few weeks ago from the camp that parents are encouraged to tip their counselors. I thought “who actually tips?” and discovered today that “everyone but me” tips. The problem with the email was that it suggested that I tip his general counselors anywhere from $20-50, and his head counselor anywhere from $50-100. I did the math and thought that even if I gave the suggested minimum, I would still be giving away $130 that I don’t want to spend, especially considering how expensive tuition was. 

Anyway, my son came home feeling bad because he didn’t have thank you cards for his counselors. Apparently his friends that also were leaving were giving their counselors tips and they had told him “you were supposed to tip them,” making him feel bad. He called me cheap for not tipping, but little does he know how much money I already spent for him to have a good time. AITA?",185,297,0.95

625,Not the A-hole,"I am home on leave spending some time with my little brother we'll call him D.  My parents just left to go visit other family for the weekend so it is just the two of us.  I was asking him some questions about school and such since he is going to be a freshman this year when a thought jumped into my head.

Me: ""Have you had a human growth and development class before?""

D: ""A what class?""

Me: ""You know, sex ed or anything along those lines?""

D: ""No, we didn't really do that at all, maybe a quick class in 5th grade.""

He has been in a private school at a church which my parents are very devout members of.  However, he is now going to be in high school, the local public high school at that.  I have already voiced a plethora of concerns to my parents about socializing and learning other large group interactions, but they are convinced he will be fine because he has some friends through a local club he participates in.  I really do agree that he will probably be fine, but I do feel that it is very important that teenagers get some basic HGD or sex ed prior to high school.  I won't claim to have had a particularly risque high school experience, but there is a lot of information that I got out of the sex ed classes I was forced into and there were even more questions that I grew up not having answers to because of the sheltered nature of the household I lived in.

So I ask you, people of reddit, WIBTA if I were to put together an informative human growth and development course for my little brother?

&#x200B;

Info: My brother is 14.  I have my old HGD books and the internet.  I won't pretend to have teaching qualifications or flaunt things on my resume\` that at best peripherally qualify me.  I am an adult who understands knowledge is important and ignorance on this topic is dangerous.   

Edit: It seems I have left a lot of room for people to fill in my intent with their own creative license.  Like I said, Human Growth and Development.  I have no intentions of introducing him to porn or the art of kamasutra.  Simply give him some knowledge of what happens during puberty for males and females, warn him about STDs, tell him what safe sex is and be willing to answer any questions he may have.  You know, basic things that people should know so that they don't make it into adulthood with insane misconceptions.

The human growth and development topic is already something that I have addressed with my parents, but they are very uncomfortable with the topic and don't want to address it with him.  I was never given even a basic ""birds n bees"" talk from them so I have a feeling that they won't follow through with him either.  I went to the high school that he will be attending.  It has only gotten bigger since I left and even when it had a graduating class of 400, it still had a butt load of problems with drinking, drugs and STDs (highest rates in the county).",57,85,0.92

So, I am attending my cousin's wedding in less than a month, and so I decided I would wear my graduation outfit, since I think it would be a waste no to use it again and I don't want to spend any more money in something new. That outfit happens to be black, since it's the colour I'm most comfortable in and hell, because I like it. I had no issue with it until my mother realized I was planning on wearing it to the wedding and has been nagging about it for the past month, urging me to buy something new. My boyfriend and my boyfriend's mum are also quite insistent on an outfit change, saying that it is distasteful. I always wear black so I don't think my cousin will think I'm doing it with ill intent, and it's not even an outrageous outfit, it's just simple black pants and a black top. Christ I would understand the outrage if I decided to wear white or if I was wearing full goth attire, but a black pantsuit? It just baffles me that they'd rather see me wearing something I'm not comfortable with than with an outfit they think is out of social norm.

627,Asshole,"For context, I did not kick them off the machine. I was waiting for the Calf Raise Machine where a woman was currently working in. Right before I go to approach her, to ask if I can rotate in, her friend tells her to look behind her because she can tell that I am waiting. I pose my question, ""Do you mind if I rotate in?"". The woman who was initially on the machine sternly says, ""No. Me and her are working out here."" I told her, ""Alright, but do you mind if we rotate?"" Again, she says no with the same level of confidence only adding this time that they are ""Trying to get out of here."" I was a little taken aback by this so I responded in kind, ""So am I."" She refuses to let me rotate in the machine and this essentially starts a argument where she insists that I can't use the machine until she and her friend are done. I tell her that you can't just claim a machine and deny other people from using it, so I tell her that instead of all this arguing, I could have already used the machine. So, I straight up tell her, ""I'm going to use the machine."" 

I feel like by offering the idea of us just rotating it should solve any issues, but she did not want to offer any leeway. I don't think it's right to hold a machine, which mind you, is easily adjustable. I understand that the gym can sometimes be a hostile place for women, but I did not tell them I'm outright taking the machine. I requested to rotate, but this woman was not having it. Hindsight is 20/20 and I could have asked how many sets they had left, but initially, this didn't pop into my head. 

Once I began my set, she started cursing me out, walking away, and continued by giving me the middle finger. When I left the gym to get on my bike, I can see her on her cell phone recording me and giving me the finger. I smiled and waved back.

What we really wanted was a private court hearing just us and our 6 year old son but about a month and a half ago my mother started going on about how she would be so upset if she didnt get to come and witness it (dont need witnesses to get married here). Since the courtroom would be empty and mom made a big deal we invited everyone interested because we cant let just her come and no one else.

Well it was scheduled for 11:30 we got there and checked in by 11:15 and everyone is there except you know who, my mother. We've been eager to get this done and over with for some time and decided to set a date a month after getting our marriage license just so everyone could come.

At 11:20  we started the process and we were married in about 5 minutes. Wham bam thank you mam. Mom gets off the elevator to the hall outside the courtroom at like 11:31, 5 minutes after it's all said and done. AITA for not waiting?

Edit: I fixed my phrasing for the times. 
The set time for us to be married was at 1130. We got there at about 1115 the judge was ready to go and so was everyone else. 1120 rolls around everyone else was there. I feel like this should have atleast 10 minutes either way we are talking about splitting 5% of a day. Maybe I am the asshole but she wasn't there on time either way just like I predicted and when it was 1120 and she wasn't I didnt want to speak up and be embarrassed waiting around just to have my mother burst in at the last minute, or late like she was.",55,24,0.69

My head was bleeding pretty seriously, though I was perfectly lucid, anyway, I found someone and they called 911 for me.

Anyway, I didn't have insurance (god bless America 🙄), but I decided that I couldn't just go on with a big gash in my head, so I went to the ER. They fixed me up, and told me they would send me the bill. 

Well, I never paid the bill (like $2000). I didn't have the money at the time. They also never really made any serious attempts to collect or even put it on my credit report. So I figure that they don't care that much if I pay them. Also, I think this was a public, not for profit hospital.

My dad recently found out that I never paid them, and thinks I'm an asshole for never paying them and that I should start doing so now that I can afford to (over time).

So we were really surprised last week when Hannah asked my wife to be her Matron of Honor. The other bridesmaids are just Hannah’s family and her one best friend since childhood, so it’s pretty clear she only asked my wife to be the Matron of Honor because my wife is the only married friend Hannah has (we got married earlier than we wanted to because it made sense financially). 

So now the Groom-to-be has asked me to be a groomsman. The other groomsmen are, you guessed it, just his family and the Best Man is one of his best friends since childhood. It’s pretty clear that I’m only being invited because they offered the Matron gig to my wife. I don’t really want to do it though.

""I received the GameCube. Everything seems to be fine except it is missing the startup disc. Please send that to me ASAP and I will be sure to still leave positive feedback.""

The next day, I got the following reply:

""I'm not sure how you got the impression that this included a disc. Everything for sale was shown in the pictures.""

I was furious when I read that. I messaged him back and attached a screenshot of the item description along with the following message:

""I got that impression because YOU FUCKING WROTE IT! You even added three exclamation points to make damn sure buyers knew it. Send me the fucking disc already.""

He responded and explained that he had just copied and pasted the item description from somewhere else and didn't read it first. Ebay terms of service actually expressly prohibit sellers from doing that precisely to prevent this sort of situation, but I'm guessing he didn't read that either. He didn't actually have a disc to sell.

Returning it seemed like a hassle, so I proposed a solution. I told the seller that $75 seems to be the going rate for these discs. I said that if he would just give me a partial refund for $75 to avoid dealing with the shipping, we could resolve this amicably.

He had to audacity to reply that $75 was too much and he would only offer me $40.

I reported him for violation of eBay terms of service, and then initiated a chargeback through my bank. 

I decided that I was going to keep the GameCube because fuck that guy. If eBay insisted that I had to send it back, I planned to send it back broken and claim I got it that way.

I actually never heard from eBay about this, and this was over 90 days ago, so I doubt I will. Maybe the seller didn't report anything to eBay because he knows he violated the seller agreement.

A co-worker who I discuss gaming with said I took things too far and technically stole from the seller. I can see his point, but at the same time, that seller is a piece of shit.

639,Not the A-hole,"I went to a dinner party with my boyfriend's extended family last weekend. I've met a lot of the family already last year at Thanksgiving. 

At the dinner, I was talking to my boyfriend's Aunt and Uncle about what I do (systems engineering for nuclear power plants) and then his Uncle said something pretty gross about how the guys there must like having a pretty young lady to look at. 

Now I admit that hit a sore spot for me. I have had some crappy experiences with coworkers not respecting me because I'm a young woman.

I firmly said to my boyfriend's Uncle ""I don't care for how you just spoke to me; I better not hear anything like that again"". I was trying to be firm but respectful; speaking to him in the same way I'd speak to someone at work who said something I didn't appreciate. And he got kind of stubborn, saying he was just paying me a compliment. By this point, everyone was staring.

I was feeling pretty mad and I realized it would be a better call to walk away rather than escalate. So I said ""excuse me, I'm going to take a walk before I say something I'll regret."" And I went and grabbed my shoes and purse and went for a walk.

I'd already been having a really bad week before this, my best friend moved out of town and I missed her a lot, my apartment had been partially flooded by a plumbing issue, I was exhausted from the long drive the night before. And this thing, that should have been a little annoyance, was like the straw that broke the camel's back for me. 

I started crying when I walked. I texted my best friend to tell her I missed her. She called me right away and could tell I was upset, and we talked for a while as I wandered. Talking to her made me feel a lot better, and after catching up for about 20 minutes, I noticed my phone was dying, and I ought to have been getting back, so I said bye.

My phone died right after we hung up, and I started making my way back to my boyfriend's house. But I must have taken a wrong turn as I tried to backtrack my steps; I was lost in suburban sprawl.

I saw the church steeple in the distance, and I realized that if I went to the church, the train station was close by. And I knew my way to my boyfriend's family's house from the station. So I took that roundabout way back. By the time I got back, I'd been out for about two hours.

I got back and my boyfriend was upset with me for being gone for so long, not answering calls, and generally for walking out rather than doing something less dramatic. I told him about my phone dying, about getting lost, and he was still upset with me. I'd made things very uncomfortable at the party when I was gone. 

I apologized and said I'd tried to walk off to deescalate things, and it wasn't my intention to end up doing the exact opposite. But he was still upset with me for being a drama queen, which I don't think is fair.

AITA for what I did at the party?",306,513,0.93
640,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this has been ongoing for a couple of days now and I’m just so confused as to whether I should be in the wrong or not.

So, my and my GF were at her parents house getting ready to go to sleep as we had to wake up early for a flight, but she wanted to wash her face. She had already packed her things away and so she asked her sister if she could borrow hers. Her sister said yeah but didn’t know where it was, and my GF asked if her sister would look for it. Her sister refused to and started saying things in order to rule my GF up. I have to say that her sister definitely has an undiagnosed problem like OCD or Autism but her mum and dad let her get away with so much. They’ve been abusive to my GF all her life, both verbally and physically and I have seen proof of that. 

Anyway, her sister started talking back to her in a condescending and with a smirk in her voice. My GF called her out on it and then the sister came and asked me if I heard it and she said yeah. 

Then she blew up. Started screaming at me and calling me awful things. Her mum came into the house at that point and started taking the sisters side. She then proceeded to start screaming at my GF and calling her a bitch and a disgrace among other things. After that I couldn’t take it anymore and started saying how I felt about everything and that they need to leave her alone and that I heard her sister rile my GF up. Her mum proceeded to call me cheeky and arrogant and that she would no longer leave us to the airport. I asked her mother why couldn’t her sister just be decent and help and her mother proceeded to call me a cheeky fucker and her dad screamed at me to shut the fuck up.

I then proceeded to get my own mother to pick me up to and then I organised our own way to the airport.

A few days later and my GF tried to call her mother up to fix things. Her mother proceeded to call me an “arrogant little fucker”, and that I should go fuck myself and I’m not allowed back in their house ever again.

Then she proceeded to call my GF all sorts of awful things and that if she killed herself(which she has been seriously thinking about because of how they treat her) no one would care and she’d be fine with that.

I then proceeded to take the phone off my GF and said how awful and immature and pathetic she is being. 

I should also mention that her mother has started spreading lies about me. That I was going to go to their house and beat up my GF sister, and that I screamed in both their faces. None of things are true. 

Forward to today and my mum and dad and others who I’ve been explaining to that I have been out of line and that I shouldn’t involve myself in her family matters. I disagree with that because I believe that if you see someone being abused, no matter who it is, you shouldn’t just let it happen.

So yeah, was I being the asshole? There may have been details I have forgotten so I’ll happily answer any questions you have.",33,36,0.86
641,Not the A-hole,"First of all using a throwaway since I discuss my industry all the time on my reg account.
 
So trying to keep this short I'm a team/lead supervisor at an offsite facility of about 20 people for a major corp headquartered in NYC. We live outside San Diego so everyone loves it here but there are always threats of shutting us down as a cost saving measure and either laying off people or moving to NYC. Thus my job is very easy because everyone is motivated to not get shut down.
 
We were supposed to get a huge batch of test materials out yesterday. I mean it's make or break for our little facility that these things go out. They don't, it will be the cost cutters final straw to shut us down. One of my best engineers is getting married tomorrow and whether it was focus elsewhere, wedding month jitters or a once in a career screw up...I don't know...she dropped the ball and about 3 million dollars of test materials is still sitting in our shop. Those parts need to be in our facility in Dallas on Monday.
 
We have a plan to work all day tomorrow, most of Sunday getting the test units finished up loaded on a truck and then send four employees to drive to Dallas in rental truck so they show up and offload on time. Then corporate and Dallas is none the wiser.
 
Everyone is on board with making this happen but they are furious that I'm not making the engineer who screwed up not come in for at least part of the day tomorrow. I am trying to tell them I will have her make it up to us in other ways but I can't in good conscience make give her extra stress wedding. This isn't sitting well with almost everyone else and there's a general consensus of screw her.
 
This will pass eventually as she is a great engineer and generally well liked person....but right now am I the asshole?

Edit: so it’s 8:15 and everyone is here. No one is super pissed but you know it’s the weekend. The “bride” is also here and is going to stay until at least noon and help us get ahead so we can all go to her wedding. She’s also got a food truck to come over and is buying everyone breakfast so that’s helping a lot.

My kids are 12, 8, and 5. I have very fair skin and tons of freckles. 2 of them are fair skinned and have freckles. The other one has tan skin and no freckles(which is strange because my husband is also very fair skinned!). 


As a young adult my favorite line was “I love the sun but the sun doesn’t love me”. I would just sunbathe, burn like hell, then wear sunscreen the next few times. 



It really fucked me over as an adult. My skin is incredibly splotchy and rough. Thankfully, I haven’t had skin cancer yet but I won’t be shocked if it happens. I’m constantly at the dermatologist getting moles checked. 



I don’t want that for my kids. From day one they’ve worn rash guards, hats, and more “modest” when we are swimming/going to be outside for a long period of time 



This has become an issue for our rising teenager as her friends are often sporting bikinis, crop tops, tank tops, etc.



It started with her refusing to wear the rash guard pants/long suit so we compromised and said she could wear shorts but the top had to be a long sleeve rash guard. A hat still has to be work when not in the water. We’ve further comprised and allowed a regular bathing suit bottom but we aren’t budging on the top. This is pissing her off and has been an ongoing battle all summer. 



The issue turned in to a whole ordeal when she went on vacation with a friend. We told her we still expected her to wear a rash guard top and a hat when not swimming. 


Of course we get pictures from the friend’s mom and my daughter is wearing a bikini. I text my daughter and ask why she’s in pictures wearing a bikini. She says it’s her friends and she didn’t want to wear her rash guard because it was wet and cold. 


I text the mom and ask if my daughter has been wearing her rash guard at all and she says no, she told her she forgot her swimsuit so she’s been wearing her friend’s extra suit. I texted back and said that that’s not true, I packed it myself and she has to wear it for health reasons. The mom says ok and apologizes(I wasn’t mad at her to begin with, she’s just a polite lady). 


I tell my daughter I know she’s lying and that friend’s mom has been informed to make her wear the rash guard. She texts back “you are literally the most annoying person I’ve ever met”. 


When she returned we informed her she was grounded to not doing as she was told in regards to the rash guard, lying to us and her friend’s mom, and for that rude text she sent me.

644,Everyone Sucks,"Bear with me folks. We're first time parents. In trying to get things right, one of the few areas we consistently fail is getting a a good sleep schedule for our babe.

The facts chronologically:
-Baby was born with several complications that are resolving but nonetheless spent a week in the NICU
-Baby is severely gassy and fussy still st almost six months old
-Dr. Recommended wife to cut out dairy for potential intolerance to milk protein
- No Change
-Dr. Recommended wife to cut out soy as well 
-No Change
-Dad recommended to switch to hypoallergenic expensive formula (Nutramigen) for three days to trial while mom pumps
-Initial success with visible improvement to behavior, sleep, and awareness
-Wife quit after 45 hours of trying since pumping was overwhelming and the pump wasn't doing a good job of keeping up her supply 
-Baby reverts back to severe gassiness and fussiness and I'm becoming resentful
-Two months later, present day, we still have arguments over this.

Neither of us are getting good sleep since babe wakes up 3+ times a night. I've gained weight from all the stress and anxiety. She's never in the mood for sex because breastfeeding takes a physical toll on her. And I'm trying to force her to stop, even though it means an uptake in monthly expenses, etc...I firmly believe breast is best, but in my child's case, it doesn't satiate them and only makes them unbearable to be around due to fussiness.

Am I the Asshole?

EDIT:
Apologies for the sex comment. I understand that out of context it makes me sound like an Asshole. I'm only illustrating just how physically exhausted she is. To us, sex is on of the least labor intensive activities we enjoy together. Meaning that if she's not in the mood for that, then she's not in the mood to go out on dates, shopping, any activities outside the house really.

Also, I'm not trying to FORCE her like I mentioned...forcing means to pull babe away during mealtime. Or discouraging each time breastfeeding takes place. This is not that. I mean to say that I just want her to understand my perspective.

I get she's under stress and try to be supportive each turn. But I'm under stress too and just want her to see through my eyes",153,137,0.85
645,Asshole,"Edit: Thank you to all those who made me realise that whilst ITA, it's just because I'm hurt, I'm missing him and I'm not communicating it properly. I really appreciate your advice and sharing your experiences.
To those calling me names; shame on you - you know nothing about me, my family, my struggles, all you know is a paragraph of info I've briefly provided. Think before you speak so harshly and YTA.

Context: I'm 22F. Our parents divorced 13 years ago, and we have two half siblings [10M, 12F].

Every year since our parents divorced, we have spent the morning at our mums with the young siblings; watching them open presents from Santa etc; then we go to dads for Christmas dinner. It's always a very family-orientated day, which I like. 

Brother has been with his girlfriend for 2 and a half years. We have seen him maybe twice on his own since they got together (the two Christmases probably, lol). He moved into her house immediately and has lived there ever since. He has lost all of his friends by ditching them to spend time with her... they are literally joined at the hip. Now we all like the girlfriend, but we miss our brother/ son and spending time with him. I used to be so close to him, but now we barely speak. 

Now he's announced that they are spending Christmas together, and without asking, has announced that she will be joining us Christmas morning, during present opening time with my siblings, me and my mum. 

I'm really upset by this. I honestly cherish that family time so much, particularly as I never see my brother on his own anymore. A single hour or two on Christmas morning is surely not too long to spend apart from eachother? 
My mum doesn't care, she welcomes the girlfriend to join us, but I just feel like Christmas morning is ruined for me now. 

AITA because I don't want her to come?


Edit to add: For those who think I'm alone and haven't found my own independence yet - I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, living together for 2! But I still come home for Christmas 🤭",101,254,0.89
646,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been together for some time now, we get along great and enjoy spending time with each other. We don’t have kids. She lives with me, and the only bills she has are; her car insurance, her cellphone bill, and her school debt. I’ve never known her to be good with money. She works two part time jobs and doesn’t make that much, typically I pay for most things when we go out.  

Over the course of the last four months, she has been spending an increasingly large amount of money on gifts, cloths, toys, and school supplies for her two nephews.  I have asked her about her spending habits before and she always tells me “it was on sale” or “her nephews really like this toy” and so on.  Last week she came home with a few bags full of school supplies and I asked her why she spent over $100 (maybe more) on school supplies for her nephews. I told her that maybe their parents should be paying for this type of thing.  She became upset and she began to tell me that her brother, sister in-law, and parents (the children’s grandparents) are neglectful and don’t buy her nephews the things they need or wants.  I didn’t question her about this but, I have known her family for some time now and they are in no way neglectful. They provide everything one would expect and more for her nephews. Vacations, trips around town to local events, sports teams fees, afterschool clubs, toys, video games, food, and cloths, they basically live a middle class lifestyle.  

Yesterday she came home with two children’s school bags.  I asked her again why she keeps spending money on her nephew like this. She became upset and started to cry, and accused me of not understanding her. I’ve tried to explain to her that she doesn’t make a lot of money and that I can’t keep pay for everything all the time when we go out for dinner, or go on vacation. I told her that I think she should prioritise her spending and that it isn’t her job to support her nephew financially. I also told her that I think her brother and sister in-law are enabling this behaviour by not telling her to stop spending money on their children. They have probably become accustom to her coming over with bags of toys, books, cloths, and school supplies every few weeks and have just assumed it will continue, leading my girlfriend to believe they are neglectful.

Am I the asshole for questioning her on what I believe to be poor spending habits?",34,49,0.9
647,Not the A-hole,"So I started working for a grocery delivery app a few weeks ago. The customer places the order on the app and then it gets sent to me or another shopper who’s closer or whatever other reason. 

Today, I received an order with 35 items. That’s kind of big so I got about $25 total to do the order and deliver it. I usually introduce myself to the customer through the messages on the app and ask if they have anything else they want that they might’ve forgot. 

Btw the app lets me know the customers rating, how many orders they’ve had, etc. So this was a first time orderer. 

Anyways, she says “oh, really?! I can do that??” and I told her “Yes, I don’t mind getting any extra items you need!”. She listed at least 20 more items. It took me off track of my other deliveries but she tipped $10 so I didn’t mind as much. I’m used to things like this. 

So I finish shopping and her original price of $90 or so went up to about $160. They charge for bags here so the bags were about $8 alone, which it shows in the app. 

I delivered her items and she was sooo surprised that I “actually” did it. I told her “most shoppers will as long as you ask nicely!” then we said goodbye, etc. Looking back, I realized she might have thought I payed for the items out of my own pocket. 

Here’s some important context, I put my business card in one of the bags. I do for every customer. It thanks them for ordering and advertises my own personal shopping “business”. Basically it’s a card that tells them they can call or text me to arrange for me to personally shop for them at any store and we’ll agree on a price, since there’s only a few stores available on the app. I make half of my income from that, and half from the actual app. It has my number on the card. It’s just a side hustle that I e been doing for a week so far. I work full time on both things. 

So I’m on my way to start another order and I’m suddenly bombarded with a spam of texts. It’s the lady I previously delivered to! She’s cursing me out and demanding I refund her the money for the extra cost. She’s telling me I stole from her, she’s going to get me fired, etc. I didn’t know what she was talking about at first so I didn’t reply and then I realized she DID think she was going to get the additional 20 items for free. I said “I’m sorry, but it says in the terms of service that any additional item will be added to the total cost. You should see it updated in the app by now.” 

Long story short, I had to cancel my next order because she told the company that I coerced her into ordering more without telling her she’d have to pay for it, and made it seem like I was paying for it. I was on the phone with them for almost 30 minutes because they tend to side with the customer. Anyways, they ended up refunding her for delivery charge, service charge, my tip, and they gave her a $15 promo code for her next order. 

So AITA for causing all of this drama because I wasn’t more clear?

650,Asshole,"When I walk my dog around the neighborhood I pick up his poop and carry the poop bag until I reach a trash can, either a permanent city trash can, like the one you might find at an intersection, or, if they are by the street, a wheeled trash can that is in front of someone's house. 

OK, I know I might get some hate for this but I have a couple things I feel justify my actions. 

The trash cans I'm talking about are provided by the city, printed on the receptacle in huge letters is ""PROPERTY OF CITY OF (MY CITY)"". The city does not charge you for the trash cans. They are a requirement of using the city's provided trash service (Which they do charge for). Trash pick up is once a week, and it is common in my neighborhood for people to just leave the trash cans outside in that strip between the sidewalk and the street all the time. 

I only ever put anything in these trash cans if they are on the street, or accessible from the sidewalk. I don't go onto private property or seek out the cans if they are not immediately visible.

I tie a knot in the poop bag to seal the poop inside and reduce odor. 

I'm not a hypocrite here, if I leave my trash cans outside and someone else puts their dogs poop in my can I don't care. I do however, store my trash cans in my rear of my property so they are not  visible or accessible from the sidewalk. 

My boyfriend thinks I'm the AH because it stinks up people's trash cans, and technically- it's illegal to dump trash in these cans without permission. My argument is that if people didn't want other people to put trash in their cans they would wheel them up their driveway away from the street. Plus I think the cans are kind of an eye sore.

651,Everyone Sucks,"Sorry guys I’m on mobile 

A little background - sometimes when my boyfriend and I get into an argument he comments on the tone in which I’m speaking to him. He says it makes him feel bad and asks that I keep it in mind. To me it seems like I’m speaking normally if not most likely sounding frustrated or annoyed. However I usually apologize and try to reword whatever it is I’ve said to not sound as hostile. We usually are able to come to an agreement and smooth past the fight.

So Bf left for work this early this morning. I woke up later, fed and changed our 1 year old (16 months) and started getting ready for work.

Bf gets home, we great each other and he does into the living room where I have lo gated in. When he gets there he says in an accusatory tone op did you change lo. I say yes and ask why. Well the baby pooped. 

At this point feel as if that’s a dumb question why would I purposely not change him. It annoyed me and hurt my feelings. I tell him I changed him about 20 minutes ago continue getting ready for work as I’m running a little late and didn’t feel like discussing right then.

He starts changing lo. Suddenly he shouts my name and I yell back what’s up? 

He didn’t respond so I walk into the living. He’s wrestling a little with lo because lo is trying to stick his hand in the poop. (Yes babies are gross). I walk over because he’s clearly struggling. BF then snaps at me what am I doing he needs help. I tell him you don’t have to snap at me I’m literally heading over to you to help. Next time you need help say so the first time instead of just calling my name. I would’ve helped sooner if I’d known there was an issue. 

After we change lo I go back to getting ready for work and it’s clear I’m upset. Bf comes over to me and blocks my path as I’m rushing to gathering my things. He apologized for snapping at me. At that point I was upset about the diaper accusation, upset about him snapping at me, and annoyed he was blocking me when he knew I was running late and trying to hurry. 

So I told him how I felt and he didn’t take it well. That I was misunderstanding him and that I was blowing things out of proportion.  He said he thought he asked me when I changed lo last. I informed him that no he didn’t. I informed him that his tone was accusatory and it upset me. 

At this point he’s not speaking anymore and so I finally say that maybe he should take his own advice and work on his tone. 

Now that a few hours have last I feel like an asshole and that it was petty of me to respond the way I did. It was such a stupid thing to fight over but I really wants him to see that he has things he needs to work on when it comes to communication as well.

652,Not the A-hole,"Yes you read that right. Let me explain.

My girlfriend and I were on vacation with her family in Italy. For a whole week we were essentially living in a beach house right off the Mediterranean Coast, which was beautiful to say the least. On her birthday, she wanted to go out on a paddle boat, so the five of us went out: Me, her, her 9 year old sister, her aunt, and her older cousin. Me and the cousin paddled out and found a good spot to swim. Everybody else jumped out to swim -besides me and the cousin- and were having a good time until apparently there were jellyfish in the water. My girlfriend got stung on her foot and we wrestled her back into the boat. She was obviously in pain and shock (the sting wasn't huge, but still) and she was calling for me to pee on her foot (I am still unsure whether the claim that urine neutralizes jellyfish stings is even real, but whatever) Well, I was kinda caught off guard and you know, looking at her relatives also huddled on the boat- I was not about to just \*whip it out\* in front of them, regardless of the situation. It just seemed really inappropriate. Her aunt ended up peeing on the sting, so it all worked out fine. 

Since then, she's been bringing it up, saying that I 'let her down while she was in pain, etc', and its been the source of a few fights. I don't really think I did anything wrong- I'm just not going to expose myself like that to anyone in her family, regardless of the situation.

I've always loved animals, and since I've been at university I've really missed having a pet. So I'm thinking next year I'll get a pet to keep me company. I'll only be in a small apartment with no outdoor space, so I'm kinda limited on options. I figured pet rats would be perfect; they're small and really friendly.

However, when I expressed this to my bf he said that I should not, and that he would refuse to live with me in the future if I had rats. (He finds the tails creepy). He suggested a hamster as an alternative. While hamsters are cute, I don't think they are nearly as sociable as rats, as they don't tend to enjoy being handled.

657,Asshole,"I currently live with my new in-laws and my nephew is sort of obsessed with me. He is always trying to talk to me and admittedly sometimes I just lock the door to our room because I find him to be a little much. Anyway I went downstairs to make some ramen and he started yelling something with ""alphabet"" in it, but I couldn't tell what it was because he can't pronounce the L sound and it just sounded like jumbled words. It turned out he was asking if j wanted some kind of alphabet snack he has. Anyway, I did say, ""what?"" At least three or four times before saying -- not in an aggrivated tone, being casual-- ""I don't know what you're saying kid, you're talking nonsense."" 

His mom said, ""Come here (name), don't talk to her she's rude."" I was sort of taken aback and said, ""what?"" And she came over into the kitchen to repeat herself. I said I wasn't rude to him and she says that I am all the time. From my own memory, I only ever talk to him in a patient voice, I never scold him in any way. My strategy for when he jumps on our bed swinging a stick around is to cover my head for protection and hope his mother will come get him soon, and when he yells in my face I just cringe. I asked her to name examples and as far as I can recall she just said , ""you break his trampoline, that is so rude"" (there is a family size trampoline in the backyard that she claims is just his but I'm allowed to use it, admittedly I have accidentally knocked the legs out of their sockets more than once but I try to get my husband to put them back in place whenever he's available, but the kid does get mad every time he sees me on his trampoline and brings it up as neauseum).

Anyway, I came back with, maybe you shouldn't let him jump on our bed when we're both asleep in the morning and then call us grumps for wanting him to leave (which had happened that morning) and she just starts screeching, ""it's his house! It's not your house! Go home then!!""

I have no idea what inspired this. 

So, totally NTA, right?

Edit: getting a lot of negativity. But have any of you ever tried living with a 2yo that you have zero authority over? Like you have to just let him do whatever he wants, and you can't even tell him to stop because you're not ""family?""",191,121,0.75

659,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago but my family won't stop bringing it up. 

We went back to our home country in Nepal for a wedding and all of our family from abroad had gathered including my pregnant cousin. I was 16/17 and she was in her late 20s. 

On a day drip, we were SO hungry and really excited to eat dumplings and the whole day we were talking she told me not to share my food with ANYONE and we kept going on and on about how us two were gonna eat our own food and not share no matter who asks.

So we're eating, she finished, and asked me for some of mine.... I was thinking is this a test or something? I was so confused after she had told how we're not gonna share food... so I said no and kept eating. Its not that she was hungry its just that she wanted some more and at that time I wasn't thinking about it like I'm not sharing food with a pregnant woman, I thought she said it as a joke or something too. I'm also not someone who likes to my share food unless its made for sharing, why would you not order more, we weren't in any rush.

This happened in front of my whole extended family and I was berated by everyone and it keeps being brought up.

661,Not the A-hole,"This morning I went to get waxed because I have a date with someone tonight. Not planning on having sex but if it happens it happens and I would wanna be prepared.

I had to wait an entire hour because apparently only one waxer knows how to wax testicles and peen, and I was also kinda pisses that they charge different prices for men... anyways

So I assumed the usual Grabbing my legs under the knee pose for the waxer to do the needful... and she snickered. Yes, a snorting laugh with nasal flaring and mouth covering. 

I asked what she was laughing at and she said “oh just your... uhh... undies... cause of the pattern” (which was a pretty plain checkered pattern so how could that be funny?)

I should probably also explain that I have been self conscious about my size since as far as I can remember. Basically my circumcision was botched as a child and as a result I have an abnormally curved penis with visible scarring and to this day, pain during intercourse.

So this is why I believe that she was laughing at my genitals.

After the experience and after I payed I asked to speak to the manager (who turned out to be the owner) and explained what happened.

I then watched the employee get fired on the spot and saw her grab her belongings and run out of the salon muttering something about “lawyer” under her breath.

Am I the asshole for complaining and getting her fired because I found her reaction hurtful and insulting?

Two of the family members are practicing Muslims and have requested that no one drink alcohol while they are there. My reaction was to say, OK fine. But my husband is annoyed with their request, especially since we are hosting at our home and he feels he should be able to do what he wants in his own home. He also thinks it's unreasonable for them to impose their religious requirements on others.

A little background: My husband's father is from Pakistan, but he and some of his siblings immigrated to North America as young adults in the 1970s. My father-in-law is athiest. My husband was born in the US and was raised without religion. The visiting family members have lived in Canada for decades but haven't been to the US since 9/11 (due to their fear of being profiled). So this family gathering is a very rare occurrence and it will be my first time meeting them (although it is also unlikely I would see them again).

664,Not the A-hole,"My sister (28f) and I (25m) earn around the same amount and we live in the same area. Thing is, she is truly terrible with money. Has a huge amount of debt on a flashy car, constantly maxed out clothing store accounts, god only knows how much credit card debt. She also spends a ton of money on eating out, drinking, buying tickets for expensive shows etc. There have been many months in which she could not pay her bills. I’ve ‘lent’ her a crazy amount of money ever since I started working (around 3.5 years now). I say ‘lent’ because I’ve never seen a cent of it again. I know that she has also borrowed money from a lot of our friends and family, who she subsequently avoided and never paid back, either.

Anyway, toward the end of last month I got a call from her, asking me for some money because she was short on some of her bills. I’d had an expensive month myself - some work needed to be done on my car, I’d bought myself some computer related stuff and a couple other smaller expenses. I told her no, I didn’t have free cash floating around (true). She was irritated and kept sarcastically asking if I really couldn’t spare the money she wanted ($100). 

So, the next day she calls again, this time asking if I could please just lend her $50 bucks instead, since it’s only a few things she needs help with. Again, I said no and this time she started swearing at me and saying that I was being cruel to her for no reason. After ending the call, I got a text from one of my sisters friends. She told me that I was being horrible to my sister, since she apparently needed the money for food. According to the friend, my sister had last eaten 2 days earlier and was desperately hungry. I thanked her for telling me this and decided to wait for my sister to call again. 

She did, the next day, this time asking for $20. I asked her to drop the bullshit and tell me exactly what she wanted then money for. She rambled on about how she ‘just needed to settle the last bit of her cellphone bill’. I said no and cut the call. Again, her friend texted me and asked wtf is wrong with me, how could I be so cruel to my sister. She said that my sister had called her and broken down crying, saying that it was now her third day without a proper meal and she didn’t want to go another night without eating. 

Well the next day, I got another call from a cousin of ours, whom I trust very much. She told me that she was really worried about my sister, because she had visited them the night before, crying. She had told them that she was starving and I had refused to help her. According to the cousin, she looked so weak and exhausted that she ‘could barely walk’. The cousin gave her something to eat (which she apparently gobbled down) and she left, after crying again because she couldn’t believe that I’d refused to help her.

667,Not the A-hole,"So I found out that the husband (M early40s) of my friend (F30s) visits a prostitutes regularly. For the record, I they live in another country where it's legal, and we visit each other every now and then. I'm pretty close with her, but had always good respectful relationship with him. 

Her husbands business includes occasional traveling to my city, sometimes she comes with him and I let them stay in my place, show the city and so on. So it's not like bff's but it's a good friendship. Also, me and his husband have common friends and work in similar fields, so I'm kinda aware about his whereabouts. So, I recently found out that every time he is in my city for work alone without his wife, they have this gentlemen night out or whatever, hire hookers (here it's illegal btw unlike his own country). I confronted, and turns out, he regularly visits brothel in his country despite being married, and having seemingly a great relationship with his wife. She also discussed her sex life with me, and it's not like a dead bedroom situation.

So the thing is that he heavily pushes me to keep it a secret, makes it obvious that I'll ruin something good they have if I tell her, that it's not a big deal, man has his needs and so on. I said that ""wouldn't he want to know she is cheating on you even if you have great relationship and the truth might ruin it?"" to which he replied something like it's totally different, having sex with a prostitute is no big deal, no emotions involved, just fantasies, also it's many different women and not one (somehow it makes it better?), plus he uses protection with his wife AND the hookers, and checks regularly so he is not putting her in risk. I was very uncomfortable, this man is very assertive and confident, and is much older then me. I mean, I don't buy his bullshit for a second, but he states his reasoning without a shred of doubt in his own righteousness.

So, he IS the asshole. But that's not my question. 

My question is this. Do you really think that a woman cheating is much worse than a man going to prostitutes? And will I be the asshole if I tell her? Sure, it's none of my business clearly, and it actually seems like they have very healthy and happy relationship that I might ruin. But to be honest, the double standard pisses me the fuck off, because I do think that what he does is cheating, and that she should be aware of it. That if ""he has needs"" or something, but she too has ""needs"" which she sacrifices for their family. Like, I'm close with her and I know that she definitely has some sexual desires the cannot try because she is married. Maybe they should go polyamorous or something.

Their newest one is that they're not offering raises at this time. This is despite constantly increasing our workload and me always being available to help when needed. 

I finally snapped today though and when asked if I could take some extra work for a few people who were out I said ""Sorry, I'm not able to take anything else today"". This isn't the part I'm wondering about being an asshole though, I know that's justified. My concern is that since I said no it's going to be dumped on the only other person who can handle it and I know he's already overwhelmed as it is so I've just doomed him to a ton of extra work. 

I'm not a manager or in any position where I should be picking up anyone's slack but I've always done it and I think they were used to it so now they're scrambling.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 4 months now, and about a month ago met his whole family including his brother and wife. It came up in conversation that his brother is a huge fan of a certain small band that I just happen to know the guitarist from. 

This past weekend my bf told me that his brother and wife wanted to go for a night out with us, I thought this was a great idea! So they got a babysitter and we made plans to meet at a local bar for Saturday night. 

I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to show off a little bit and gain some brownie points with his family, so I called up my guitarist friend and asked him to meet us at the bar that night as a surprise. 

Well, the night came and we arrived at the bar, got a big booth table with his brother and wife and were off to a great start to the night. After about an hour my friend showed up and I invited him over to our table to meet everyone. He chatted with us for about 30 minutes before going to sit at the bar for the rest of the night. It seemed like bfs brother was impressed and I thought I did well by going above and beyond. I thought wrong. 

When we got home that night my bf immediately blew up at me asking why I had invited another guy along to an outing with his family. I explained what I was doing and who it was but he was having none of it. He kept saying how I was supposed to use this night to get to know his family and instead I spent the “entire time” talking to a different guy right in front of them. 

I do admit that I did stop to chat with my friend another few times, maybe for 10-15 minutes each at the most, but only when it was my turn to get a round of drinks. It’s not like he sat at our table all night or I was getting up just to go talk to him.

My dilemma starts with a happy note. I was about to get married to my long-term girlfriend. Upon getting my paperwork ready at town hall, I obtain a document which is needed in my eastern european home country; It's like a detailed version of a birth certificate. When the case worker hands me the doc with a confused look, I realize immediately that something is wrong. I read through it and almost fall of the chair:

I read that I was born under a different name than I previously thought. Not my dad's name, not my mothers maiden name, but a name I have never heard before. Also a middle eastern name, a very unusual one for my region. At this point I'm convinced I just found out I'm someone else's kid. My dad is from the Balkans and darker than my mum's family, but I've always tanned even easier than him. Bull\*\*\*\* in hindsight, but that's what my brain decides makes most sense within split seconds. I start sweating.

Then I read through several addendums. I find out that my mother was previously married to a man that was never mentioned to me in any way throughout my entire life. That her divorce to that man was completed after I was conceived, but about 4 months before I was born. Then my birth name was changed to her maiden name. At this point I'm convinced that nobody is entirely sure who my dad is. Then I read that my father tried to assume parenthood and was ordered by the state to do a DNA test. I read further, the test turned out to be positive, he is in fact my biological father. My parents got married later that year.

I'm walking out, shaking, livid that this part of my family history was kept from me. I send my mom a screenshot of the document, ask her if she's got to tell me anything. She calls, tells me she used to be married but seperated from the guy shortly before her and my father met. She also states that she sees no reason to have told me. She thought I would never have found out. To her it was more important to clarify she's ""no slut"" and the middle eastern gentleman whose name was mine for the first few weeks of my live was ""one of the cultured ones"" and not a mcdonalds worker. Like wtf??

I flip, yell at her that's not the point and how she could never tell me any of it and hang up.

I call my younger sister and FIND OUT SHE KNEW ALL ALONG. My mom told her at some point.

Right index distal phalanx is gone, now it's 23 years later and people I meet always ALWAYS ask everyday how I lost it so I make up some joke stories and make stupid puns with it etc etc. Well whenever I hang out around my pops he gets uncomfortable when I joke about it still and he doesnt tell me to stop but he gets shifty about it. My bro says he might have PTSD and I feel kinda bad about it but at the same time Its my injury and Ive had to live with it so I dont think I should change my behaviour around him. I'm only asking because I do notice he gets uncomfortable when I bring it up and I'm a complete dick when it comes to being tactful about ""feelings"" and stuff like that so I thought you kind folks could let me know if I'm being too much of a dick.",216,954,0.95
689,Asshole,"There's a diner near my workplace that serves pretty nice food and it's really cheap. From about a week after I got my new job (three months ago, ish?) until two weeks ago, I went there almost every work day.

A couple weeks ago, after I'd finished and paid the bill, I asked the waitress who usually serves me (we'll call her Kelly), if she wanted to hang out sometime, maybe get some coffee. The look on her face was soulcrushing.

She said something about having a boyfriend, and I nodded and left. I haven't been back since.

Yesterday one of the other waitresses, Maria, came by my workplace to pick up some things, and she stopped by my desk to say hi, and ask why she hadn't seen me in a few weeks.

I told her I wanted to cut down on the money I spent eating out, and she said, ""so this has nothing to do with Kelly?""

I told her no and asked her if there was anything else I could help her with before she left.

She took the hint, but now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for not wanting to see Kelly again?",175,141,0.89
690,Not the A-hole,"For as long as I can remember, I've had a Stammer (look it up if you're unfamiliar, itll help understand). While I was younger, I was heavily bullied a lot for it, and didnt have many friends. So 3 house moves, and 1 country later, I have a pretty solid group of friends, and am about to move away. Throughout the 7 years I've known Adam (changed for his sake) I've always told him, ""dont finish my sentences for me if I stammer, its demeaning"" and yet, Adam always does. So fast forward to last week, at a big party being thrown for me leaving, I'm doing a small speech, and Adam takes it upon himself to stand next to me, and finish my words for me, like a translator. So, after years of this, I finally snapped.
Me: Look, Adam, will you please sit down? I get that you're trying to be nice, but I've asked you hundreds of times to not do this, and you always do, its incredibly demeaning and embarrassing for me. 
Adam: I'm only trying to help, I dont want people sat here all night waiting for you to finish

691,Not the A-hole,"I’m a server at a semi-popular restaurant in my city. I’m in college and this summer I’ve been interning with my states House of Representatives. I love both opportunities but something recently happened. 

I’ve been serving at this restaurant since HS and I am now 21. I’ve basically had the same schedule since I started working and so have some of the other servers. One in particular, Lindsay, has started working there this past year and I’ve grown to like her. She’s a single mom and all she does is work work work to give her kid anything she could ever want. She reminds me of my mom who was also a single mother but didn’t have time for me or my siblings because all she did was work all the time. I wanna help her give her daughter what I wish my mom gave me. 

Anyway, I’m scheduled to come in at 3pm and I’m Lindsay’s relief. For the past summer I’ve been coming in around 1-2 so that Lindsay can leave earlier, beat the traffic, and get her kid from daycare before they close (at 3:30). The daycare is about an hour away so this works out perfectly. I even sometimes finish serving her tables and save the tip for her anyway. 

Earlier in the week I had a pretty long day because I come to my serving job right after my internship. I was super tired because I also spent all night doing LSAT prep. I decided to take a nap for that hour and a half and go into work closer to 3. I get to work and Lindsay doesn’t say a word to me and left. I figured she had a shitty day and I didn’t want to bother her so I didn’t say anything either. I kept coming in at my scheduled time for the rest of the week.

Yesterday I came in and I see all the other servers gathered around Lindsay who’s in tears. I say hi to everyone and get the dirtiest looks. I ask what’s wrong and apparently Lindsay has to find a new daycare for her kid because she’s been coming in an hour late to pick her up. Of course she blames it on me being “late” this week. And I tell her I was sorry but I never came in late. I came in when I was supposed to and that before this week I’ve been coming in extremely early so that I could help her out. But that didn’t mean I owed it to her to do every time. I have things going on in my own life that I gotta deal with and I’m sure if she wanted to she could’ve worked out a better schedule with the managers (who’re really nice) or put her kid in a daycare that’s closer and more convenient. 

I don’t think I did anything wrong but now all my co-workers are insulting me, ignoring me and refusing to cover my shifts. AITA?  

TL;DR I stopped coming in early for my co-worker and because she couldn’t leave early her daughter got kicked out of daycare and she blames it all on me.

EDIT: wow I’ve been at work and didn’t this would get so much attention. I’ll read everyone’s comments later but as an FAQ, I did tell her either the second or third day that I wasn’t going to be coming early that week but would resume after. I also called in to tell her that I wasn’t going to come in and she never said anything to me after and whenever I saw her at work she ignored me. The first day I came in at my scheduled time I also tried to talk to her about it but again she ignored me and although I apologized considering I didn’t let her know beforehand she didn’t ask me anything or asked to talk so I figured she got it figured out. 

I also just found out that the managers spoke to her a while ago about getting her shift fixed and she said no because she got it covered (by me basically). So now I don’t feel bad at all. The managers were willing to fix her entire schedule so she can leave earlier without it affecting how much she was taking home that day and she said no because she relied on me.  Not my problem at that point.

EDIT2: Jesus fucking christ, I just got out of work and did NOT expect this to get so many upvotes or my first gold (thanks!! :)) I read every single comment and learned something from each one. If I were in her shoes I would’ve appreciated it if I was given a heads up, definite fail on my part but like I said, I was fucking tired at the time, not a good excuse but that’s what it was. I texted Lindsay (because she’s still ignoring me) about it and apologized for the situation because I do feel really bad for her daughter.

 But I also told her that I wasn’t going to be coming in early for her AT ALL anymore although I intended to after this week. We both fucked up but she has not came to me to discuss this at all or apologize for making our work environment very hostile for me. Now most of the other servers won’t do anything for me which sucks but if they wanna be bitter about it that’s their problem. And since they care so much about this I’m hoping to see one of them step up to come in as early as I did (which I know won’t happen because they complain when they have to work their own scheduled shifts). Lindsay and I will have a meeting with our managers tomorrow morning to sort this all out and I guess I’ll update tomorrow. Thanks again!

UPDATE: 

Hey, everyone! I can’t thank everyone enough for all the advice and takes on this situation. I’ve gained a lot of perspective. As promised, I’ve got a couple updates.

I’m at work right now and had a meeting with with Lindsay, my managers and the co-workers who were basically bullying me. First my managers had no sympathy for Lindsay because like I said, they came to her multiple times suggesting a schedule change and she always declined. They’re going to fix her schedule in two weeks when we get our new schedule, but until then the rest of the girls (who were on her side), are gonna have to pick up those hours lol. They technically don’t have have to but they know they should if they know what’s good to them. They’ve already complained about it and basically said it’s my fault this happened blah blah blah sucks for them idc. 

Right after the meeting Lindsay pulled me aside and wanted to talk to me and she apologized about everything and said she didn’t think everyone else would react so badly. She also said that she actually got her whole thing sorted with her kid and the daycare TWO months ago and that she’s just been needing a break before she actually got her daughter. I understand her needing a break and would’ve gladly done the same if she had just been honest. I feel used. I asked her why she lied about this to everyone else resulting in me being the bitch of the workplace and she cried saying she didn’t think people would be so upset at me (???). I asked her to tell everyone else the truth and she said I should just keep what she told me between the two us because it will look bad on me considering no one will believe me. She’s right. I’ll probably tell everyone anyway. I cannot believe this at all and don’t feel bad about any of this. I’m not sure if her daughter actually got kicked out of her daycare but if she didn’t I’m also pissed that she used her daughter to lie.",743,7654,0.97

693,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account as people know my main and I don't want to cause a fuss if I get YTA status as I'll just let it slip and not bring it up.

Tldr at bottom.

Background info; I'm now a few days past my due date for our first child and have a lowered immune system from some pregnancy complications, so disease is a serious issue for me at the moment. I recently went and completely disinfected the home, and asked for it to be kept clean and sanitary for the arrival of the baby - this hasn't been done.

My husband has been sick for a few weeks with a throat and nose infection - so coughing and spluttering and producing a lot of spewtum. About 2 weeks ago, he coughed into my open mouth when I was sleeping (accidental) and I ended up with his infection for about a week (not pleasant as I also vomit blood from pregnancy complications and unable to take any medicine to help for the baby's health), but was luckily able to shake it off and have not had a re-infection, and I believe this is due to the fact I am very clean and specific about not contaminating or spreading the disease around.

This morning I was in the bathroom and our towels hang on a rack opposite the toilet, so as I was doing my business my eyes happened to glance the towels and I saw 2, 3inch long, yellowing and thick blobs of snot/spewtum on =my= towel. So this means this morning after my husband got ready for work he must have been facing my towels and sneezed or something and ejected the contents on my towels.

I am livid for the following reasons;
- It is absolutely gross.
- If I hadn't noticed it, I would have used the towel and smeared it on myself.
- He didn't clean it up - I know he might not have noticed he ended up ejecting anything but I would think due to the size etc he would have felt something or would have looked directly in front to see what he did, this stuff isnt a small amount it is VERY noticeable.
- My mother is staying with us at the moment as well to help once the baby is born and I don't think it's fair she ends up sick as again she might pass it to the baby.

I am debating if I should sit him down and say to him that it isn't fair or appropriate for him to keep open mouth sneezing and coughing everywhere, especially near items I use on my face and body. I don't intend to raise my voice or anything but I do intend on being exceptionally stern and putting my foot down, as I am so grossed out by knowing he's just going around and doing this - I wouldn't be surprised if there's snot/spewtum in places I've just not seen yet as well and the thought actually makes me gag.

WIBTA to discuss? Should I just let it slide, as he is sick and can't help it?

Tldr; husband is sick and getting snot/spewtum on my towels. Should I tell him about it and tell him to stop being gross?",35,73,0.91

696,Not the A-hole,"So my gf and I have been together for almost 2 years. I'm an atheist but she comes from a very Christian family. She has always been cool with me being atheist and I don't have a problem with her religion.
However her family is totally different. Every time we visit they force me to go to church, force me to say grace,...
I have told them multiple times that I'm not going to convert to Christianity but they don't want to hear any of it.
So up until now I've just been stomaching in because I don't want to start too much drama with her family, and we don't see them that often anyways.
So a few weeks ago we visited them for 3 days. Like usual they started shoving Christianity down my throat. I already had a tough week before that and I just had enough of their bs
So it was dinner time and they asked me to say grace. I said no but like usual they said we won't eat until I say it. So I just snap. I go and say something among the lines of ""thank you sky daddy for giving food to us and not the starving children in Africa""
So obviously they were steaming. They told me to get out of their house. I drove back home but my gf stayed.
So now I haven't spoken to them at all. My gf said she needed some time as she didn't think I could be this disrespectful towards their religion. Everyone except my best friend and my family is standing with her.
So AITA for standing up for myself?

UPDATE: After reading your comments I realised that everyone was an asshole. The parents for forcing their religion on me, my gf for not standing up for me and me especially for being so immature.
After I slept on it I called my gf and we had a long talk about our relationship. At the end we decided that it would be for the best to break up. I am crushed but I think it's better to end it now than years down the line.

I call my husband and tell him and he’s like “Oh ok did you get on the pill?” And I said no, I didn’t want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it’s the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I’m like trying to get pregnant without his consent.

I'm in my early twenties, female, live a typically developing life but was recently diagnosed with ulcerstive colitis. For awhile I have been having a lot of difficulty 'feeling' when I have to use the restroom so have begun to wear those adult ""Depends"" style diaper things. Pretty embarrassing, I know. Anyways, I've been having a really bad flare up for about five days, and a few times had to call my mom *my room is on the first floor, her's on the second* to help me because I was experiencing some dizzy spells and major GI problems. Anyways, yesterday I felt pretty good for the most part, but in the evening she said, ""Do you want to just come stay upstairs tonight? You haven't felt well in a few days and if you need anything it'd be easier to help you."" I said okay and slept in her king bed wearing a t-shirt, and one of the adult pads. Well, apparently I went to the bathroom on myself over night and it leaked out of the thing. I literally felt nothing. At one point I had actually woken up to use the restroom, cleaned myself up, but the issue seemed contained and the room was datk so after changing myself I got back in bed. Fast forward this morning, I woke up before her and headed downstairs to put on some real clothes and do whatever. Well, apparently, I left something in the bed by mistake. My mom woke up and after noticing went in to a rage, about how she shouldn't have to be changing sheets right now and how 'gross' it is. I feel so embarrassed and awful for walking downstairs when there was a mess to clean up. I really had no idea. Idek how to respond or say sorry, I just feel bad.",30,35,0.93

My dad really likes Facebook and runs several ‘Troll’ pages with bad memes and a lot of political commentary. Facebook is cracking down on him and his friends a lot more after the whole election fiasco and I’ve become less comfortable with the idea of his multiple online personalities, but I don’t voice that.

Then, they asked him to verify his identity. Should be simple enough. He went to his cousin and somehow talked him into getting a pic of his drivers license to prove that his account was a real person. Then Facebook asked for a phone number verification on multiple accounts. He got my mom’s, and he asked for mine. I voiced my disapproval and refused to give him the phone number. Of course, he was furious, and my mom was mad for getting him riled up, but I just didn’t want to actively help him do something that I thought was wrong and definitely sketchy.

702,,"This is something I did not put much thought into but since my Ex expressed her outrage, perhaps the internet can judge this. 


Without too much context, my Ex left me and our daughter Jo(not real name) many years ago and I have been raising her all by myself these years. She is 27 now, still living with me and works in a cafe nearby. 


Jo, while having the intelligence of a normal person(aced in Chemistry back in school), has the emotional maturity of a child. It does not take much for her to get upset or become happy, she loves praises and hugs, dislike strangers but warms up to them easily. She gets awkward talking to adults and loves playing with children, but would also pick fights and throw tantrums despite being 3 times their age. I can give more examples but I hope you get the idea. 


Me and Jo split the house chores and takes turns to cook for each other. We would also do ""Goodbye hug"" and ""Goodnight kiss"" on the cheek every day when we leave for work or go to sleep, separate rooms, to be clear. I would praise Jo if she has done her part of the chores properly as she likes praises, and also buy her snacks from time to time. 


I have not find another partner after my Ex because Jo would certainly be upset, and I have gotten used to staying this way. Jo has been single too(as far as I know) and has shown no intention of moving out, which I am fine with it. There has only ever been 2 of us in the house after Ex moved. 


My Ex, whose private life is not mine to share, paid us a visit some time ago, a long time in many years for an update on Jo. She was absolutely disgusted of our lifestyle. She said we were living like a couple which is not supposed to be, we are father and daughter for christ sake! She demanded that we seek therapy and have Jo moved out so that she can be independent and have her own life. Jo in turn, screamed at her birth mother and kicked her out of the house.  


I have nothing on my conscience as we never ever did anything questionable or vile. Therapy? We are both happy adults enjoying our lives. Have Jo move out? If she wants I won't stop her, but if she's happy here then she can stay as long as she likes. 


I do think I am not the AH who ""ruined"" my daughter's life with this ""unhealthy relationship"", but I shall leave you to judge. AITA?


Info: It is not medically proven but I believe Jo is not in the spectrum or has disabilities as many of you think. She is smart and functional and capable of living by herself(proven when I went business trips and left her home alone when she was in her teens, the house was kept clean and tidy), but she is also lazy and enjoys being spoilt. She has 2 close friends her own age, also single, and would hang out with them sometimes. I also believe that therapy is only required if it cause problems, and if she is happy with her life, even if it is a little out of the norm, I don't think we need any therapy.",1865,12110,0.93
703,Not the A-hole,"My BF (together 3 years) has a friend, ""Gina."" It was important to me to get to know her. I felt like I connected with her, since we both talked alone one night about our respective mental health problems. She shared she was diagnosed with some of the same things as me. This was important to me because, at least for one of my diagnoses, I'm not close to anyone IRL who also has it, so I was pretty excited to meet someone who had already been treated for it. She said she was recovered and that she would love to be a support for me.

It became clear that this wasn't the case. She shamed me for an episode I had while i was with her, excluded me from things when I would always invite her places. The worst thing she did was abandon me during a PTSD attack. My boyfriend decided to stay out of it. He said he planned on growing apart from her anyway, so he didn't feel like having a major confrontation with her for that reason. Fine.

Gina ends up getting offered a job at his same small company. He had put her forward for the position before any of this went down. Since June, we have been long distance because i went back home to stay with my parents while I receive treatment. He was supportive of this decision. Gina just started at the office last week or so. My bf calls me every day during his lunch break. I told him that maybe this was a bit much for me to commit to - I need more flexibility. He responded ""Ok, how about twice a week?"" I said sure. Then he goes, ""Ok, so then the other two days, I'll have lunch with Gina.""

I let it go at the time to process it. I had a bad episode on Tuesday this week, when we were supposed to talk. I was honest with him and said I couldnt talk because of how intense it was. He was understanding and said he'd still be around if I changed my mind. Later, I asked if we could do the next day, he said that was his Gina day. If this was any of his other friends, I would understand that he wants to spend time with them and honor commitments to them, but now he is enforcing this rigid ""two days each"" thing which makes me feel like I am being put on the same level as her. I am in a VERY vulnerable moment and I don't understand why he would create this issue. 

I have NO problem with him having lunch with her if he wants - they are coworkers! I do have a problem with is this rigid schedule that now I am expected to work around. Because of my disorder being so heightened now, I don't always know in advance when I am able to have a nice phone call with him, but it would be really nice to know that I can have flexibility and not feel like i ""missed my chance."" After all, that's what I wanted in the first place. I have reassured him many times he has no obligation to stay with me through my recovery, but if he wants to, I need to be supported.

705,Not the A-hole,"I know I sound like an absolute creep and stalker, but you need to acknowledge the context. 

So, my boss had planned to telework for a whole week and told us one week prior. Nobody had problems with that, why would we. She said she would be totally contactable whenever and stuff, since, yeah, teleworking is basically working but at home so of course we should be able to contact her. 

Well, her telework week began and it came out that she wasn't contactable AT. ALL. We have a Slack server and she was disconnected, all services were trying to contact her, without her answering, or she was sending people a text saying ""I can't answer now"". Well, it was as if she wasn't working at all to the point it was really fishy. She was still sending like 3 emails a day just to appear active when she really wasn't. We couldn't do or complete a thing because she wasn't validating any of our work. 

Anyway, later this week, I was at the office with 2 of my coworkers. One of them hated my boss with a burning passion and kept talking shit about her all day, and suggested that, if she wasn't active at all, it was probably because she was on vacation or went skiing. Well, I laughed and answered that it'd be unbelievable, that she's not that bad and that we should trust her, maybe she's busy because of her kid being at home or doing house chores. My coworker called bullshit and asked I anyone in the office knew a way to locate someone. 

And I did know one way. Out of curiosity, I decided to track my boss' IP. I wanted to see if my coworker was right. She was very interested in knowing where my boss was and highly agreed that I did it. It appeared that my boss was indeed at a ski station, in vacation. My coworker burst out and left our office, telling LITTERALY EVERYONE about how the boss was skiing while pretending to be teleworking and stuff. Everyone knew on that day. I didn't want to expose her, I was going to keep it to me, but my coworker decided otherwise.

This happened in March. And recently, in July, my boss told me that she discovered I was the one who tracked down her IP. I said I was sorry because indeed, this behavior really is bad behavior and I know it. She said she wasn't gonna fire me because her anger cooled down, but she didn't trust me anymore. I didn't answer but I found it really unfair since she was the one breaking the trust by lying to everyone saying she was at home teleworking, and taking us all for fools. If she had just said she was in vacations instead of presenting she was teleworking, never would I have tracked her. 

I spoke about this to several people and they were all on my side, even my tutor (my boss is her boss too). Even tho, I want to know if I was the asshole? Because I know it was disrespectful of me to invade her privacy even though she lied, especially because she's my superior at work. 

tl;dr : I tracked my boss' IP address because she went MIA while supposed to be teleworking.

Edit : I'm 20 and a woman... Everyone seems to think I'm a man but that's not the case haha. Anyway, I need to add that getting an IP address doesn't take time (like I didn't work my ass out to find it). It didn't take any effort from me. Also we couldn't do our work because my boss wasn't responding. For days.",693,2718,0.96

710,Asshole,"Earlier this year I started a gaming group of me and six other friends. We meet up fairly regularly at a player's house. This player, we'll call him Steve, was dating Jane, another player.

About a month or so ago, Steve and Jane broke up. She got over it fairly quickly and acted like nothing had happened. He, on the other hand, was rather hurt. We continued to have game nights at his house until two weeks ago, when he told us he tried to be ok with being around Jane but he wasn't. He didn't want to see her anymore, even if it meant leaving the group.

None of the others wanted to choose between two friends so the ugly decision fell to me, being the one to make the group in the first place. After a long talk with Jane, I told her that without Steve we didn't have a venue and without a venue we can't play. I told her that game nights will resume in two week's time on the 30th and that if we can't find a venue by then we would start playing at Steve's, without her. Jane blew up at me, saying that we are kicking her out, that it wasn't fair, and that Steve will let her come over after he's had a while to get over the breakup. I told her that my decision is final.

On one hand, I feel like my decision was logical and in the best interests of the group. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole. Reasons I feel this way:

\- I am not unbiased in this decision. I am on ""Steve's side"" of the breakup, though I will not admit this to my neutral friends. Also, though Jane was never ""that player"", there were definitely times where she got close.

\- Jane is more stubborn and vocal about wanting to play. Steve was willing to gracefully bow out of the group if that's what we decided, though he does want to keep playing with us.

\- Jane was the one that brought Steve to the group in the first place.

\- I don't think Jane will be able to find a venue. Steve's house is free and central, and no cafe or meeting room matches that. I am also not going to help her search. I basically set her up to fail because I had neither the spine nor the decency to kick her outright.

\- The 30th is a deadline I made up- I can extend it if I want to. But I am not going to, because I want this all to be over, one way or another. Anyway I doubt more time will change anything.

\- I feel like my decision will ruin the other players' friendships with Jane.

So tell me reddit. AITA?

\*Edit: I think there might be a little bit of confusion- While venue is definitely a problem which we would have had to address, the biggest reason for my decision is that I wanted to play with Steve over Jane. Steve wants to play with us as much as Jane does but he's willing to leave to keep the peace. I was not ok with this so I used venue as an excuse when talking to Jane. If that makes me more of an asshole then so be it. I just thought I should clarify.

\*Edit 2: Hi everyone. After you judged me the asshole, I told my friends my horrible reasons behind my decision. They are the ones that are affected by this situation, they personally know the people involved, they know what it's like to be in the group. They deserve to know my reasoning and call me the asshole more than any internet stranger. You are all right. I am an asshole. I am my group's asshole.

712,Not the A-hole,"Sorry this is a long one. 
My friend and I are both 31F and have been friends for 23 years. I have quite a few close friends but she has told me before that I’m her only/best friend and I was her “Best Man” when she married her wife 5 years ago. We’ve never been in constant contact, as life got in the way, but about 6 years ago we agreed to make an effort to meet monthly for a catch up.
My friend is desperate to have a child and over the last 5 years they’ve tried adoption, sperm donors and are now trying IVF. I’ve supported her emotionally and been there for her as much as possible during this time.
Last year I told her that my SO and I were going to start trying for a baby and I fell pregnant straight away. 
My friend badgered me to tell her straight away and was really upset (which I completely understood and wasn’t even angry at her for), she didn’t speak to me for a couple of weeks and cancelled our night away that I had planned and was paying for to treat her for her 30th birthday. 
Afterwards she got in touch and apologised and again I understood and told her that it was ok and I loved her. 
During my pregnancy, we still met up monthly, but as my bump got bigger I felt awkward and guilty due to her initial reaction but I kept my feelings to myself. When i invited her to my baby shower, she told me she couldn’t face it and booked a holiday instead. At this point I was upset and angry for her making me feel guilty that I was able to get pregnant so easily when she has struggled. I had also worried and cried to my SO that I didn’t think the friendship would survive after the birth and he got really upset and angry on my behalf that I had such an “awful” friend, but I always defended her to him as she’s been trying for so long. 
In the last two weeks before the birth, she was messaging me every day for news and I had to tell her to stop and once the baby arrived she was desperate to come meet her straight away. 
At this point, my SO said he wasn’t comfortable with her meeting the baby yet and didn’t want her in the house. I also had a really traumatic birth and was super emotional on top of all this, so I was honest about mine and my SO’s feelings and how I’d been made to feel bad during pregnancy and she apologised but also told me how I had no idea what she’s been going through, when I’ve been a shoulder for her to cry on for years. I told her I needed time to get over feeling like this and asked for space. My baby is now 2 months old and I still haven’t reached out to my friend. I even missed her birthday 2 weeks ago (but we were actually in hospital that week as my baby was unwell).

714,Asshole,"My coworker (28f) thinks that sending work emails to each other that use please and thank you's, as well as any ""soft"" language, is dis-empowering. Her messages often come across as harsh and demanding, and leave me (35f) feeling like shit, or like she's really angry or annoyed, especially when giving feedback. I mentioned this to her last week, after tensions ran high because of yet another email exvhange, and today she expressed that I'm an asshole for asking her to ""feminize"" her language, when she is just communicating information in an efficient manner, and that I wouldn't say this if she was a man. Bias IS a thing, and I try to be conscious of my own, so yeah.

However, I don't feel like I'm asking her to ""soften"" herself, I'm simply asking for common courtesy and respect in communication with someone I talk to every day. She says please and thank you during face-to-face interactions, and is otherwise often my favourite coworker, but tensions RISE when one of us is working remotely. AITA?!?

Edit: I didn't ask her to feminize her language or even soften her terseness, she was the one who suggested that's what I was asking. My suggestion was that saying please when asking for my help on your project, would help our tense communications.",83,83,0.87
715,Not the A-hole,"So there are a multitude of reasons behind me (M19) walking out of this but I will keep it short and sweet. 

Maybe a week or two ago, I had a girl (F21) slide into my DMs (which is something that does not happen to me, like ever) so I thought hey this is sick lets see where it goes. Also so you know, she has nothing up to date picture wise on Instagram, but I thought why not, there are a few older pics from Instagram but nothing recent. We are messaging back and forth but there isn't really any chat, it's really just questions about each others lives and I know that's the standard but still. So we decide to meet up for food, and we decide on Nandos. She gets there before me so when I arrive I look around and spot her face.

She looks nothing like her old insta, apart from a slight familiarity about the face. So I instantly think shit, I've been catfished, this is not going to go well. I decide to sit down, and about 15 minutes later the chat is going nowhere. Now I don't know if anyone here has been to Nandos before, but you go and order the food up at the front, there is no waitress that comes over to take your order. So not realising this, the girl, quite literally, slams her fist on the table and says ""where is this fucking waitress"". I understand if you haven't been to a place before and don't understand how it works, but as soon as you turn out to be a psycho, that's gonna be a no from me. 

So pretty much as soon as that happened, I put £15 down on the table, so that she could buy herself a whole chicken or anything else, said ""this has been nice"" and walked out, got myself a McDonalds and went home.

720,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory mobile/ first proper post warning.

I'm 23 weeks pregnant with my first. One of the first things I said when finding out I was pregnant is that I do NOT want a baby shower. There's a number of reasons for this:

1. It's not a norm in the UK where I grew up so even though it's more common here in Canada the whole premise makes me uncomfortable. I've literally never attended a baby shower ever. 

2. I have general anxiety but social situations are the worst.  I'm not comfortable at parties but can cope it if I can blend and not be center of attention. I don't even like opening Christmas gifts in front of super close family, I feel like no matter how genuine the reaction it comes across as fake.  A party centered on me is my idea of hell. 

3. I can count on one hand the friends I could invite, and that number dwindles when considering who is reliable enough to actually show up based on past experiences. 

4. My mom is the only 'real' family I have on this side of the pond and is a narcissistic asshole who always manages to make a scene. I have managed for 7 years to prevent contact with my wider FILs but would either have to invite her to a shower and deal with the consequences or not invite her and deal with her tantrum.  Lose lose for me. 

5. We're in the middle of major renovations on our house. We had to move out 3 months ago and are living with SO's dad. We're rushing to get it all done before baby arrives which is super stressful on top of regular work,  life and pregnancy stress. My stress meter is at the limit and time non-existent.

Now out of the blue my (normally ok) Future MIL suddenly announced to my SO that her and his Aunt are planning a baby shower (not asking if I'd like one, just assuming). I obviously said no when SO brought it up and cited the above reasons.  He says I'm selfish, that they are excited about the baby and want to do something nice and it will hurt their feelings if I don't oblige them. None of these people are likely to be any physical or emotional support when the baby actually arrives. 

Future MIL was also apparently upset that I already bought several items for MY baby, despite the fact she's actually never once messaged me to ask how the pregnancy or baby is since we told her in April or asked if there's anything we need or if we have a registry. 

I repeated my reasons above to SO who said I should just 'get over it' with respect to my 'dislike' of parties.

This has all sent me into a major anxiety attack as my mind started spiraling trying to figure out if I'm in the wrong. I ended up having a melt down at my OB appointment yesterday and she's referring me for therapy and to possibly look at going back on meds for prenatal depression. 

WIBTA if I stick to my guns and make it clear that I am not okay with a baby shower.  I'm totally willing to have a co-ed, low key house warming bbq with his family when our house is finished and we're settled.

723,Not the A-hole,"My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. 

My boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

I went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of ""I couldn't help it!"" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

He seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

I realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

When he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not.

I've been with the company two years and when I started they let me know that one of the senior employees brought their dog in a few times a week.  I had no problems with this I love animals. 

When I started I didn't mind the dog at first. She was a fun addition, but since we work in an office park she barks at anything. Not quite growing! Loud ass barking! This has been going on for two years. I've been patient and understanding that shes excited, but now another coworker has started bringing his new puppy to the office.  When they're both there they get into barking fights, if that's what they're called,  and recently began a territory war right behind my desk.

I mentioned it to my girlfriend and I feel like she almost just figured she was invited to. And its not like she ISNT invited... its just that I am very worried that my uncle is going to say/do something really awful to her. She is from Iran, and she is not muslim but she was raised muslim. My uncle is pretty damn racist, he always has been, he uses every slur in the book when he talks about minority groups. I told her I really don't think its a good idea, because neither side (my uncle or her) is going to enjoy this. Not only that but the bar is a pretty old school irish bar filled with ex cops and I just feel weird about inviting her to a place where she might not welcome. The thought of one of these guys, and/or my uncle, saying something to her or trying to start an argument with her just makes me cringe. When I told her this, she got very, very upset and told me that I just didn't want to bring her around because I didn't want my uncle or family knowing that I had an iranian girlfriend.

727,Asshole,"For some background information, my daughter has developed a recent obsession with owning an animal pelt, particularly one of a farmed fox. (I know this because the one she has shown me has a mutation that is not found in the wild)

Me and my husband are not animal activists, but we find owning animal skins, especially fur farmed pelts, abhorrent, so we obviously refused. I was honestly disappointed that she would consider supporting the fur industry in the first place, I thought that I raised her better than that. 

This request was made a few months back and not mentioned again. Now however, on her birthday, we gave her $50 that so that she could choose what gift she wanted. To me and my husband's horror, she had purchased what I believe is a coyote pelt online and I found it when cleaning her room. We disposed of it and spoke to her about it when she returned from school.

Our daughter is very young, and we offered to return her the $50, but she refused and was upset.

Since then, he's always flirting with me and my older sister. But not to the extent where we can say something about it. It's weird bc his age older, he isn't a hideous beast or anything so I'm not judging based on his appearance.

Whenever my friends are over, the creep is turned up by 100. He shamelessly flirts and always mentions that he models. He doesn't pick up on cues and refuses to let the small talk die. He's always asking what us ""college girls"" are up to, but in a really suggestive way. He's constantly staring at us. We hated it. Whenever HIS friends come over, they try to invite us over for drinks. Or worse, ask us if we want to see pictures from their photoshoot.

I hear about old guys in my backyard. I step out and see it's my neighbour and his friends. I thought they were complaining about the music, but they brought alcohol. They came to my party, uninvited. I was so pissed off, that I cried.

They brought liqs, but everybody wanted them gone but the drinks to stay. They were flirting and making everybody uncomfortable. Because they're so much older. These whole grown men were flirting with the girls and couldn't even tell how repulsed everyone was. It killed the whole vibe.

My guy friends asked them to leave. They were talking about how the party just started and everybody's having a good time. My guy friend said that because they're here, nobody is having a good time. Told them to cut from the party and go buy his kids school supplies. They both looked embarrassed and left.

Before he left, he said it's wrong to use them for their alcohol. I said I don't want him there, and I don't want HIM. They tried to take the liqs, but I asked where they thought they taking them. They left it, but said something about being **ROBBED.**

735,Not the A-hole,"I am a practising Jew. Some might believe our rules to be quite archaic and unimportant in today’s world, but as with any religion, adherents like myself try and find a balance to best live our lives. 

My daughter is marrying a non Jewish man, and has blown a sizeable amount of money on her dream wedding. Many of the wedding customs that she’s chosen to incorporate are things that either directly go against my faith (and the faith she was raised in) or are in very murky waters. I have said nothing to her because I want to be supportive and it’s not MY wedding, it’s hers. 

She approached me recently asking if I would consider buying her her wedding dress as the one she wants is *very* expensive. I hesitated over it, and said to my daughter after some deliberation that I would love to buy her her dress on the understanding it would be modest according to my faith, as if I bought her the garment and it wasn’t in keeping with Jewish law, I would be aiding in both violating my observance of our faith and another Jews. In our culture/ faith, it doesn’t matter if she’s not a practicing Jew, she is still Jewish by blood. She agreed, and my stipulations were a higher neckline and covered arms. 

I trusted her enough not to go to every bridal appointment, paid half the deposit on the first one where my daughter and the stylist went through our requirements, but a few weeks ago I thought I may as well pop into the store to see how her dress was coming along as I was going past and to my extreme surprise the dress that the salesgirl showed me was a completely different dress altogether. It was a corset / bustier style which obviously is rather different.

After double checking there hadn’t been a mix up, I called my daughter and told her I was very sorry but she’d need to find another way to pay for the rest of her dress because she broke the understanding we had. 

She was very upset, understandably, being as the dress is very expensive, but in my eyes I agreed to something and the way she tried to dupe me with something else was underhanded and wrong. She can wear whatever dress she chooses to, but I cannot and will not be the one financing it. However my entire family excepting my husband are against me on this and think although she was wrong, I should just suck it up and pay the rest of the amount for her dress.",320,489,0.88

These dogs were originally the family dogs for 3.5 years until I (33)moved out to be closer to my job and my brother moved to the area and bought a house. My sister lives across the country and I have relocated outside the country. My mom has never liked the dogs while my dad does. 

My brother renting a room near work since my parents live over a 1.5 hr drive to his office while searching hard for a new place. My dad walks the dogs and my brother comes when he can on the weekdays and every weekend to give them a bath and/or drop off food/treats. 

It's been one month since and a few days ago, my brother sold his place. He's been searching hard for a new home with a yard and with his old place sold for a good price, his options are better. My mom hated having the dogs. We told her we understood and to please be patient while my brother finds a new home. Then today, without first talking to my brother, my sister or me, she gave them away to a family friend none of my siblings or I had never met. I find this all out when I get an early morning call and my mom is sounding defensive about not wanting the dogs around and talking loudly, which initially confuses me. Then she admits what she did. I told her I understood she's not happy with the dogs, but my brother was very actively searching for a new home, and going behind our backs without even a day's notice was not the right thing to do. She erupts in anger at me, tells me that the 3 of us love the dog more than her, that we don't get a choice because we don't live at home anymore. I told her we're family and she should have at least talked to us first. She should have given my brother an ultimatum of one week before giving the dogs away. Even a days notice! She said she doesn't need to do that.

My siblings and I have been planning a trip to Hawaii for my mom's birthday for the past 6 months. We're planning to pay for all of it. She messaged us all and told us to cancel the trip because she's not going since the 3 of us are angry with her.

741,Not the A-hole,"Some back story: My mother has always had this weird anger toward my sex life. Which, quite frankly.. I believe is not any of her business now that I’ve moved out. She’s called me a slut in the past many times before, made me cry as she called me disgusting, over and over again. You get it. She still seems to always be so curious about it though. Maybe worried, which I understand. But, it never ends well for the both of us. Just conflict.

The reason for her anger I believe is because for one, I am still young (19). I am her *daughter*, and I am extremely sexually active. No strings attached. Multiple partners. You could understand why she called me a whore. I sleep around. But, I’m not in a relationship.. if that helps anything. If I was, I think it’d be a different story.


On the other hand, she’s always let me in on her relationship with her current boyfriend, from which she’s cheated on several times. She’s never seemed to feel guilty about it at all. She in fact boasted about it, the times it happened. 


She also is constantly talking shit about me to her boyfriend - something that she tells me from time to time. Don’t know why. 

She once told me, and I quote, “Oh.. and. I told him by the way. About how you’re sleeping with so many guys again. I’m sure even he thinks you’re a slut.” 

Anyway. The whole scenario went down like this. And, sorry for the format issues. I’m on mobile. 

We were sitting at my dinner table. Having a great time. She invited herself and her boyfriend over, offered to cook dinner. I thought it was sweet. Sure. I have no problems with the guy. 


He jokingly asks, “You having fun living alone now? Hahahah. How many guys have you had over?”

I sarcastically replied with, “Just a few.”

Maybe it was my fault for thinking this kind of joke would slide past my mom. And, it wasn’t even a joke. I was being honest. But, I tried to make it seem like one. 

At this point she’s infuriated. “Are you kidding me? Already? Wow. Just wow. You are a whore.”

Ouch. In my own house? Really. And, in front of the boyfriend? Jeez. It’s like she was asking for it. It might’ve been best to apologize and lie to her. But, I couldn’t do it. She disrespected me. She’s been disrespecting me. And, the thing that pissed me off the most was that she’s a hypocrite. The audacity she had to call me that in front of her boyfriend baffled me.

Glancing at her boyfriend, and back at her I said,  “But you aren’t so innocent though either. How can you say that to me?”

It was like throwing gasoline into a fire. She almost got physical. Yelling gibberish. “How dare you speak to me like that, I am your fucking mother.” Over and over again. “Get your shit (boyfriend’s name) we’re leaving. C’mon.”

Hasn’t spoken to me since. It’s been 3 days. 


AITA?


Edit: Some people are questioning why I never told my mother’s boyfriend about the cheating until now, and how it was cruel, why I never brought it up before, how I used it as a weapon, etc. which I think is a very valid point. I posted a comment but I will repost it here:

I have also been reading the comments about why I never told my mother’s boyfriend. It is really a good point. My reasoning though is, I just recently moved out of my mother’s house. I felt like I could finally stand up for myself and point the finger back. It might have been cruel - yes, the timing. But, I would have never had the guts to tell her boyfriend, and have her realize I was the one who told him - me being the only one who knows that information - whilst living under her roof. I’ve thought of it before, but.. I was honestly just too scared. I can totally agree with me being the asshole here though for that specific point.",629,5150,0.93

743,Not the A-hole,"This happened yesterday, and I thought of this sub while it was unfolding, so I figured I’d offer myself up for judgment.

As I’m walking up, a car pulls into a “Parents With Children” spot across from the entrance. Mom’s driving. Her ~10yo son hops out of the passenger seat. The kid has the keys, and from the moment they start walking, he keeps clicking the lock button on the key fob, causing their horn to honk, over and over again. Deep breaths. Surely he’ll stop after 3-4 clicks. Nope. His mom lightly swats him on the arm and tells him to stop. 

They enter the little vestibule, where the carts live, just ahead of me. The kid’s still clicking the fob, the horn’s still honking. Mom swats his arm again. He grins at her sheepishly. They go straight inside, I stop to grab a cart. Horn keeps honking. I walk in, they’re in line at the Starbucks just inside the door. Kid is still clicking, horn is still honking. By now, it’s obvious the kid knows exactly what he’s doing, mom knows what he’s doing, they both know it’s not cool, but neither of them give a shit, apparently. 

So as I’m walking by, I say, “Hey!” Loud enough to get the kid’s attention. He turns and looks at me wide-eyed. I tell him, calmly, “You know, that’s incredibly annoying to everyone around you. Next time you should try and have some manners.” He doesn’t say anything, just continues to stare at me. I move on, grab some tomatoes, and head to the deli. 

A few minutes later, mom marches up as I’m ordering deli stuff, wags her finger at me, and says, “Don’t you *ever* speak to my kid like that again.”

Me (matter-of-factly): Hopefully, I’ll never see your kid again.

Mom: Don’t you *ever* speak to my child like that again.

Me: Maybe next time you should just take the keys away from him.

Mom starts going on about how she had to leave her kid alone by Starbucks to come tell me off. Or something. TBH, I wasn’t really listening. She wasn’t making much sense, and I didn’t really care enough to try and follow along, so I just stayed quiet and waited for her to finish. Being confronted for scolding her kid was a risk I accepted, so I let her say her piece. 

She ended her rant with, “Don’t you *ever* talk to my kid like that again. If you do, I’ll have you brought up for assault,” and promptly turned and walked off. I don’t think confronting me was quite as satisfying in reality in as it was in her head. 

The young man who was taking my deli order and had witnessed this, looked at me and said, “How is that assault?” I was similarly confused, so I called out to the mom, who was still nearby, and half said/half asked, “I think you’d actually be the one brought up on assault charges?” She opened her mouth to say something but instead kind of huffed and walked away.

Then I got to explain the whole backstory to the kid at the deli, who said, “Why didn’t she just take the keys away from him?” Good question, deli kid, good question.

This is currently happening and I can’t decide if I’m the asshole. I will accept whatever judgement decided. 

A little bit of back story, my boyfriend travels once a month due to his job and I have taken him and picked him up every time unless I was at work and couldn’t miss. One time I even picked him up past midnight even though I had work the next morning. Last month we went to visit his family in Canada and I had to leave earlier in the week than he did because I had to go back to work. The day comes around and he decides that he’s just going to send me off in an uber. His reasoning is because he didn’t want to sit in traffic, my flight was at 6 PM on a Sunday. There was literally no traffic. To be fair, the airport was about 40 minutes away. When he told me he wanted me to take an uber I was upset but said “fine, this means I get one time of not picking you up if I don’t feel like it” to which he agreed. 

Fast forward to now, his flight lands at 10 pm and I just don’t want to pick him up. I’ve had a long week at work, have been cleaning to make sure my place is clean when he gets here, the airport is about 35 minutes away and just simply am too tired. I told him I want him to uber and he threw a fit. I reminded him about our deal which definitely made him regret about not taking me that day. 

So Reddit, AITA for not picking him up, even thought I have no good excuse?",62,99,0.88

752,Asshole,"Using a Throwaway because contrary to some of the allegations that have been leveled against me I am not doing this for self promotion. I will also not name the girl because while it’s been very public I don’t want to bring attention to her family.

So several years ago a 20-year-old coed went missing in my hometown, well there have been several semi breaks in the case nothing has ever come of her disappearance. I always thought she was a beautiful young girl in the case deeply affected me because it was so close to home.

Maybe a year or so ago I was  up in the middle the night and sort of inspiration hit me and I wrote a song about the disappearance. I think it’s very good and very genuine and if nothing else it brings attention back to the case and it seems like it’s stalled out. I sent a copy of the song to her family and they basically responded with “we appreciate your effort’s but this is really not in line with our values but we appreciate you bringing attention to the case.” I figured that was fine enough and they’re the the family.

I took the song around to several radio stations and created a YouTube channel and really didn’t get any play out of it which is fine, if people don’t like it they don’t like it. 

Well for one reason or another my YouTube channel got a little bit a buzz recently and it’s been extremely negative and people are really making fun of me. In fact so much so that a lot of times I go out in town people will quote lyrics from the song to me and it basically makes fun of me. Well this buzz also got the attention of her family again and they sent an incredibly nasty email tell me telling me to drop it that they warned me once they werent appreciative of the song and if I kept it up, they are going to have to “take action.” I responded to the email and said I was sorry and I was just trying to bring attention to the case and this particular family member just replied with “you’re a fucking creep, let it go.”

I’ve deleted my YouTube channel since obviously my message wasn’t getting across, but I haven’t slept a wink since the exchange with her family member. I am wondering if I am the asshole for writing that song?",197,212,0.86

TLDR at the bottom

So a bit of back story...
My sister (technically half sister) is a my dad's daughter and her mum is a difficult person. So there has been many disputes between my dad and her mum, especially about my sister's maiden name. Legally it's my dad's last name but her mother had tried to erase that fact and has always called her by her own maiden name. This has created a long standing feud.

So today my half sister got married and she legally changed her last name to match her partner's name. 

Afterwards she had a book where we took pictures and wrote messages. 
I said congrats, and then said underneath in a jokey way "" you will always be a (insert my dad's last name here)"". 

After that I told my family and they have all said I shouldn't have done that because it was in appropriate and would cause drama.

TLDR; I said my sister will always be apart of my family and my family said I shouldn't have done that because it could start drama.

760,Everyone Sucks,"Last night I pulled an all-nighter and really needed something to give me a boost this morning, so I stopped in to McDonald's for a sausage mcmuffin and some hotcakes.

The place was p much empty because it was still early morning. There were just a handful of people at tables and one lady who was mopping the benches and floors. I specifically chose a seat on the opposite side of the restaurant to where she was cleaning so I wouldn't get in her way.

Well after I'd been there for about fifteen minutes she came over and started cleaning the benches and floor right next to where I was sitting, which already kind of annoyed me since she was getting in my space, but I let it slide and carried on with my breakfast.

When she finished with the table next to me, she started kind of nudging her stuff toward the table where I was sitting and getting more and more in my space. I ignored her because I wasn't finished eating yet. She then started mopping the seats on my table opposite to where I was sitting, and then the floor around it. Eventually she asked me if I could lift my feet up and move my bags off the bench so she could mop them.

That was pretty much the limit of my tolerance. I stood up, told her ""you could wait for people to finish eating, you know?"", and walked out. I was in there maybe 20 minutes total and I found her attitude beyond rude and intrusive.

Now here's the thing - when I eat at a fast food restaurant or a food court, I ALWAYS take my rubbish over to the bin and throw it away. But this morning I was so irritated with this lady I thought, ""if she wants to clean so bad she can clean the whole table"". I'm feeling kind of guilty about it now though, like maybe I was just taking my tiredness and bad mood out on her. AITA?

EDIT: Just to clarify, I never yelled at this woman. I didn't even raise my voice, just told her she should wait for people to finish eating.

EDIT 2: Well I'll admit to being an asshole for leaving my rubbish behind, but your replies have confirmed that this was terrible food service on her part. When I used to waitress at a chain restaurant I would have been severely reprimanded for bothering paying customers to finish cleaning.

761,Asshole,"A minor thing, but one that apparently not everyone agrees with me about.

I work at a hospital, and the bathrooms there are single stall, unisex bathrooms. They lock from the inside. I noticed a long time ago that the custom seems to be that a person approaching the bathroom will knock on the door, wait for a response from inside, and then try the handle if they get not response. Presumably the person in the toilet is supposed to say “occupied” or somesuch in response to the knock. 

This horrifies me. I’m not talking to some random while I’m sitting on the commode. It feels like a minor, but unappreciated, invasion of my privacy. Instead of knocking, I think they should just go straight for the handle. Clearly if the door is locked, the bathroom is occupied. No response required. 

I personally never knock. I just go for the handle. Some of my coworkers think that’s inconsiderate, because somebody might have forgotten to lock the door. I have never once walked in on anybody, but I bet if I did, they’d remember to lock it next time.

764,Not the A-hole,"My brother in law, Phil, started dating Jenny, who is good friend of mine and my husband from way back. At first they had a really nice relationship, they were well-suited and really into each other. We were happy for them. They moved in together 2 years ago. 

This weekend Jenny and Phil broke up. Jenny made the decision to end the relationship because Phil can be kind of a dick, basically. He’s critical of her and he is painfully self-involved - he just is, I don’t think anyone who knows him would disagree with that. I’m kind of relieved for her that they’ve broken up? As happy as I was about their relationship to start with, she’s a good friend and wonderful person, and I have (on a couple of occasions) seen Phil being a manipulative dick to her. 

Anyway we live in the same town, Sunday afternoon Jenny calls, tells me they’ve broken up and can she stay in our spare room for a bit? I agreed. It’s probably relevant to note she moved to our area for Phil and she’s got a limited network here. 

My husband obviously goes to see Phil and offer him comfort etc. Phil is broken up. Jenny is the best relationship he’s been in, he thought it would last, he was considering proposing. Husband explains to Phil that Jenny is staying with us and Phil is upset and feels she has been chosen over him. 

Mother in law then gets wind of the whole thing and agrees with Phil that having Jenny stay with us is a betrayal. Dramatic phone calls ensue, and my husband starts to feel guilty having Jenny stay with us as this means Phil can’t come over in his time of need. However, as Jenny is already with us and is using ours as a base to move out and into a place of her own we agree she should stay. 

**Why I don’t think I’m an asshole:** Jenny is my friend and has been for 10 years. She doesn’t have many options in town and reasonably wanted to be out of their apartment after the breakup. She chose to end the relationship so if one of them has to move out right away I think it’s right that it’s her. Phil can be difficult and I think it would’ve been hard for her to not move out immediately. 

**Why I might be the asshole:** I didn’t actually ask my husband before I agreed for Jenny to come over. We weren’t together when she called me. I did call him after speaking to her and relayed the conversation and checked he was ok with her staying, and he said he was.

Also Phil is family and can be kind of fragile. I didn’t think at the time, but it is legitimate that he may struggle to be alone right now. 

While I have not expressed this to family, I am definitely on Jenny’s ‘side’. I think breaking up was the right call and yeah, I don’t particularly like Phil these days. That may be colouring my judgment.

773,Not the A-hole,"Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of TV ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. 

So how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. 

My cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

I basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

That's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of ""Scott's Tots"" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

No amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

There is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. 

I have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. 

Would I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

It’s just despite living a half-hour away, I see her maybe once or twice a year. If that.

Anyway, now I’m 25-years-old and my sister is 7. My dad recently asked me to dinner with my step-mother to have a talk about something, which was weird. He said that they were doing a lot of estate planning recently. He talked about what I would be inheriting, what my half-sister would get, etc. He discussed what kind of lifestyle he would want her to have if they passed before she were an adult (my dad and step-mom are wealthy). Then they talked about how on our side of the family, there’s not really anyone who could take her. My step-mom has some family that would step up and be guardians, however their first choice is me.

Now, I’m not anti-kids. I do want kids someday. I just…don’t want to promise to raise my little sister if anything were to happen. We’re not close, if our dad and her mom were to die, I would not be a familiar/comforting presence to help her through it. It would probably derail my life as well, and prevent me from being able to have a family of my own.

My father got upset with me, and said I was being selfish. I pointed out she’d have other places to go, like my step-mom’s sister (their second guardian choice). I said if it ever came down to truly no one could take her and I was the last possible family member then I would, but I would not be first choice and I wouldn’t sign any paperwork. The dinner ended coldly, my father is pissed. I got an e-mail from my step-mom saying “I’m sorry your father yelled at you, but I hope you understand why, he just wants your sister taken care of”.

To start off I live with my mom and she works nights. Earlier in the year my aunt asked my mom if she could hold a party/get-together in our backyard on the anniversary of her husband's (my mom's brother's) death. My mom had told me in the sense of it being ""later this year"".

I largely forgot about it until I got a call the other day from my aunt where she was talking about the party happening this weekend. It's not a simple case:

First, my mom couldn't get time off work and won't be able to attend this mid-day gathering. Aunt knows this, doesn't care, and assumes my mom will just not sleep. Aunt has also assumed she will just let guests walk into the house to use the bathroom which isn't an option because 1) the only bathroom is right next to my mom's bedroom in the back of the house and 2) aunt has already admitted last second that there are going to be people we don't know who will be there and it won't be just family. That means there will be unsupervised people in the house, many of them complete strangers, keeping my mom awake.

Secondly, I've been having issues with Aunt's daughter and daughter's boyfriend (20s). Not going into too many details, but the last couple of months things have escalated to the point where I've had to file police reports on the stuff they've been doing, and I've become so anxious being outside that I start having panic attacks if I'm outside alone. We have tried talking to my aunt about this, but she always hand waves it away either denying that that could have happened (or that it was that bad) or tried to use some excuse like they are stressed, cousin is acting out in grief, boyfriend did it all alone, or ""they just need to smoke a joint"". Basically her daughter can do no wrong. Either way, I REALLY don't want those two in or around my home but Aunt doesn't care and insists they be there.

I've told my mom that I really don't want to attend, and she has suggested that I could try and attend but stick close to family like my grandfather for safety, but you can see why the idea of hiding behind someone at your own home where you should feel the safest can be infuriating. Otherwise, I've thought about leaving early in the day and locking the doors and feigning getting called into work or a previous engagement that I couldn't cancel so no one can enter. Basically running away. (Guests wouldn't be entirely without a toilet, aunt and cousin live down the street, you can see their house from the yard)

Aunt and cousin can get manipulative and lie a lot, so by not going I risk them trying to use my absence to fuel whatever revenge or woe-is-me story they come up with and will have no way to defend myself or my mom if she gets caught in the crossfire.

777,Asshole,"Just a little context: my wife and I are well off and in turn, we were able to give our only child a good start at life. She makes good money and didn’t come out of college with any student debt. We also let her live at home until she was able to buy her own house.



She has a boyfriend who didn’t get a good start at life. His parents have nothing to do with him and have never helped him out. He still struggles to pay his bills on time but just barely manages it. This leaves him with little fun money to spend. 



It has caused issues in their relationship because my daughter has no issue spending money on him but he is very prideful and would rather not do the activity than use her money. Anytime we have offered to pay his way for vacations, events, etc he has declined and not joined us. It can be frustrating when we genuinely just want him to spend time with us and not worry about money. 



Now here is where I’m mad. My wife and I are on a month long sailing trip with some family friends. The plan was for my daughter and her boyfriend to meet up with us one week out of the month. The boyfriend of course declined because he couldn’t afford it. Ok fine, we understand taking a week off work could set his bills back. 



We asked if he could dog sit for us. Our dog has hip problems and unfortunately can’t enjoy these sailing trips anymore. We of course planned to pay him for this service.


A few days before my daughter left to join us, we told her we were putting money in her account to give to her boyfriend for the dog sitting.


He declined this money. I was annoyed so I asked my daughter for his number.  I sent him a text saying that I am not gifting him this money, it is payment for a service he’s providing. 


He texted back and said thank you but he can’t accept the money as families are supposed to do favors like this for each other. I texted back that while that’s very nice of him, I will be deeply offended if he does not accept this money and we will no longer be on good terms.


He eventually accepted the money but now my daughter is on vacation stressed out because he boyfriend was mad about having to accept it. My wife says I just caused my daughter more stress but I felt like I needed to be firm on my stance. We were NOT going to accept his services for free.",648,2040,0.95

Last night over text, she said so if we ever got married are you going to keep pressuring money over money that we share? I told you as of right now I do not have it and I’ve had many other issues to take care of. She also mentioned the rent we’re going to be sharing together. 

she’s supposed to be moving in with me in the coming weeks. So I’m starting to think I’m going to get the same answer and not get this money back.

781,Not the A-hole,"This is going to sound bizarre but hear me out. For context: me (23F) and my friend JC(24M) are part of a group of friends. JC has a major crush on one of the girls in our group: ED(23F). JC is gluten intolerant. I’ve seen this guy doubled over & almost in tears because of it. He makes a noise vaguely resembling a wolf with its genitals caught in a mousetrap. JC also gets horrendous liquid fury from both mouth & anus, as my poor toilet has experienced many times. He still eats it, which is pretty annoying. 

Our group had a gathering at ED’s house and she had made food for us. She made some pate served on toast & a bunch of other mini dishes - all which had gluten. She apologised as she had forgotten that JC couldn’t eat it. Seeing as he is majorly head over heels, he says regardless he would try one. Immediately, I had the mental image of him fleeing to the bathroom with liquid destruction blasting out of both ends. I gave him a firm “don’t you fucking dare” glance and he retracted his hand. 

ED goes into a lengthy discussion about the food she made and how grateful she is for us trying it. I quickly pass out as much of it as I can to stop JC giving into his desperation to impress ED. The only bits left are 3 slices of mini toast and toppings. JC declared he will still eat it and didn’t care if he died. Usually I wouldn’t have cared if he wanted to coma himself via gluten, but I was his ride home and I knew the burden would be on me to take care of him. I didn’t want to spend the night watching him writhe in agony on the floor so I told him not to be stupid.  He shouted back that he was an adult and could do as he pleased. I quickly grabbed the bread, shovelled one into my mouth and crushed the remaining 2 in my hands. 

JC became FURIOUS. He led me outside and screamed in my face that I had embarrassed him and I had no business to control what he ate. ED later told me she’s glad I stopped him as he would have definitely been in an awful state if he had eaten the food. 

Our friends think it’s absolutely hilarious but JC is now blanking me & told me I am a controlling bitch. He told me that was his once chance to impress ED & the consequences were for him to deal with later. 

AITA for not letting my friend eat the bread?

Edit: some of these comments are really insightful & others are downright hilarious! Thank you for those who mentioned Celiac disease - I’m pretty sure this is what JC has but wasn’t sure at the time of writing and didn’t want to label it incorrectly.

783,Asshole,"My family is on a very tight budget tight now, and I do all of the grocery shopping/budgeting for family expenses. My husband and I have had arguments in the past when I get pissed at him for tapping into ""luxury items"" that I had purchased for a planned meal/special treat for the kids. Sometimes I hide food so he doesn't get into it, so I don't have to police the food stash. This really pissess him off so we agreed to stop doing it. At this time we agreed to check in/assume food was purchased with a reason and to maintain open dialogue around the food. 

So the incident: few nights ago husband and I are hanging out. Husband grabs bag of tots out of freezer and starts heating up oven. We both see each other seeing this happen. I say nothing, but am instantly pretty peeved because I bought those with the intention of having them with dinner after kids first day of school. The tots cook. The tots get flipped. The tots get taken out of the oven. At this point I can't hold back, ""you know, I bought those for [kids names] first day of school."" He says I should have told him that at first, and it was bitchy to make him feel guilty after they were already cooked. I say he should have asked from the start and not put me in a position where I had to nag. It lead to a huge fight, granted, partially over other things. But even a few days later neither of us have changed our minds over the ""you should have asked"" VS ""you should have said something"" and I'm still really mad about it.

784,Not the A-hole,"So to give you some background, my wife's sister (Serena) has been in and out of abusive relationships for her entire adult live. She herself is a verbally and emotionally abusive person, but she seems to be attracted to physically violent men.

My wife (Jane) and I have tried, along with the rest of my wife's family, to get Serena out her terrible relationships. We've put her up in our house for months at a time, flown her accross country time and time again, but she always ends up going back to her abusers.

Serena's latest abuser (Turdbucket) is apparently wanting to meet the family. They currently live outside the country, and are flying in this weekend (giving us 48 hours notice) and asking to stay at our place.

Now I don't have a problem letting Serena stay, she's welcome in our home. But I am not willing to let Turdbucket stay in our home, with my wife and children. This douche canoe has assaulted Serena physically on multiple occasions, left her stranded in a foreign counrry, controlled her and all forms of communication to the point at which Serena  is afraid to even talk openly on the phone with her parents.

Honestly we have feared for Serena's life. We have even offered, again, for the millionth time to help her get out of her situation, but she refuses. She says things like, ""Well he only hits me when he's drunk"" or ""I'm really hard to deal with so most of the time it's my fault"".

You can see how upset I might be. Im no psychologist but I believe she is suffering from battered women's syndrome.

So I said no to letting Turdbucket stay in my home, even for a night or two. 

The problem is now I'm the bad guy. My wife says I'm an asshole for putting her in an uncomfortable position. Jane doesn't feel comfortable going to Serena (or me going to Serena - I offered) and saying no to TB staying with us. Jane is worried that Serena will opt not to stay at our house or visit at all if we refuse to let TB stay in our home. Worst of all Jane is now trying to be apologetic for TB's behavior, diminishing the severity of his abuse. 

I feel I should not be obligated to let people stay in my home. I am concerned for the safety and security of my wife and children. And I want nothing to do with anyone who is physically violent to their SO.

So, am I the asshole?

785,Not the A-hole,"My son’s father is not really in the picture. He’s seen him maybe a couple of times in the two years he’s been alive. What I didn’t know before I got pregnant, was that he had another child that he also hardly ever sees. If I had known that, I would not have gotten involved with him, but I am assuming there is a reason why one does not advertise that when looking for dates. I got to know the mother of my son’s half-brother, Erin\* and we actually became decent friends. She was in a long-term relationship with our sons’ father, she was his high school sweetheart and has known him for even longer than that. She really stepped up to help me through my pregnancy, wanted her son to know his brother, etc. I was really grateful for that. She is so nice to even babysit for me if I need and I will do the same for her. As awful as our shared baby’s father is, I am really glad that I gained this friend out of the situation.

My son is now 2, her son is 7. As stated previously, he has barely seen my son since he’s been alive and has been very much in and out of his half-brother’s life. The last time he split, Erin told our sons’ father that he was out of chances and to just stay gone. I don’t blame her. He had really burned her and there’s a lot more to the story that isn’t mine to tell there. (Again, stuff I didn’t know when I got involved with him, that would’ve prevented me from getting involved with him in the first place.)

However, our sons’ father approached us both recently-though separately. From what it seems, he said the same thing. He’s cleaned up his act. He’s been sober for a year and a half; he’s doing much better and he wants to be the dad that they deserve. Erin told him no. I completely understand and respect her choice. I told him yes, because my son is still young, he doesn’t remember not having his dad. I said one screw up and it was done, but I was willing to have visitations and give it a shot, because I want my kid to have a dad in his life.

Now, Erin is pissed at me. She says with everything she’s told me, how could I let him back in? She thought we were in this together. I said we still are, and I’d never let him around her son or her. She’s still so upset with me and said she expected me to say no too. I said that I respected her choice, but we could do different things and it would all work out in the long run, but she just started ranting that even if it did, how would she explain to her son one day that my son saw their dad but hers didn’t and it became a whole long mess. It ended with her saying that I had picked him over her.

Now I feel like shit. Erin has become my best friend. She was my rock these two years. But I do want my son to get to know his dad. Am I being an ass here?",29,113,0.94
786,Not the A-hole,"Last Friday night a group of work friends and myself went cosmic bowling (where they have the lights and music and stuff). There was 5 of us total. I'm not a big drinker, and all my friends know this. I will drink socially, but mostly just to go with the flow and not be that odd man out. So usually in every group of friends when you go out, theres a most dominant/loudest person in the group. We have one, her name is ""Becky"". And shes actually great, shes one of my closest friends. But she is a big drinker and shes also one of those people who INSISTS on everybody having as good of a time as she is. 

So we get start bowling. I order a rum and coke, and plan on this being my only drink because I have to drive myself home. Everybody is drinking, having fun. About 40 minutes later a waitress brings out a tray of drinks and Becky hands me one. I say what is this? She says ""I bought it for you!"". I say I was only planning on my rum and coke, but at the same time I feel bad that she spent money on this drink, and so I say ""Thank you. but this'll be my last one"". And I drink it. 

A bit later. More drinks are brought out. And theres another drink for me, purchased by Becky. At this point I have to put my foot down. I say that last one was my last, I cant drink any more, Im driving home. Becky starts with the ""Oh come on, you can take an Uber, we're having fun dont be like that. Besides I already bought it, they cant take it back"". I say no, I told you I wasnt drinking any more. Im sorry you bought that, but Im not drinking it. Bowling is stopped dead. Everyone in the group is now watching this conversation occur. A couple say ""Oh cmon"" and I say no.  

Now it becomes Becky offering the drink to everyone else in the group. ""Hey do you want this? He doesnt want it"". Everybody says no. The night awkwardly continues on, but ultimately the vibe was killed. I think we play 1 more game, and then everyone just wants to go home, so we all leave. I've seen all these folks this week, and everything seems normal. No hard feelings.

But at the same time, I know that argument killed the night early. And I'm thinking about what should I do to avoid this happening again.

I see this 2 ways:

1. I told them, very clearly, I was only having 1 drink. I drank the 2nd out of politeness. But beyond that, I had to stand up for myself when they continued tried to make me drink more. No means no, right.
2. I do recognize how 1 person in a group can derail the evening if they dont go with the flow. And in this case, if everybody was getting sloshed, maybe I should have too, and planned on that before even agreeing to joining.

789,No A-holes here,"So the other week I lost my wallet. It was in my work bag and it must have fell out, and I didn't notice it until the end of the day so I had no idea where to look. It was annoying, but it happens, so I locked my bank and credit cards and got on with the process of getting them replaced. A couple of days later, I get a call from a maintenance worker that they found my wallet. It had fallen through an access hatch where I was working, and fallen in behind some equipment, and he had found it the next day. I thought this was great as I didn't have to now also replace my health card, driver's license, etc... A couple of days later I drove down to pick it up. Now I had $20 in my pocket to give to the guy, but when I saw my wallet (and I will stress that I saw this as he passed it to me, and I didn't open it up to check right there) that the cash I had in it was missing, there was $120CAD  and about $50USD. So I took the wallet, thanked the guy gratefully, and went on my way. He never knew or saw the $20 I had in my pocket.

Well now I am retelling the story to some friends and coworkers, and several said I was an asshole for not giving him a reward. I figured that since the room was locked and only maintenance personnel has access to it, and he found it the very next day, he most likely pocketed the cash himself, and if he did, well that was the cost of me losing my wallet.

791,Asshole,"Sorry for the clickbait title, but now that I have your attention please hear my dilemma. 

Long post, TL;DR at the end.

For the past 10+ years I’ve worked for a major US retailer that earns around $5 billion annually. My job is to rebuild a small electronic tool that is essential to the daily operation of each store in my region (currently around 50 stores). Unfortunately, these expensive units (around $500 each) fail quite often due to wear and tear. On average, I see 20 of these units per week. 19/20 of these units have a fairly common issue that I figured out how to fix myself with parts that cost $0.10 each. This saves my company $100K or more each year since they don’t have to replace a unit every time it fails.

However, every once in a while, a store employee will take it upon themselves to try and “fix” their failing units instead of sending the unit to me for repair. Their usual process of repair is to SMASH THE FACE OF THE UNIT WITH A HAMMER.

Now these things aren’t indestructible. In fact they’re really just small electronic boards with an LCD screen enclosed in a plastic housing. Needless to say, hitting them with a hammer never fixes the unit and always damages them further by snapping off the mounting points for the electronic board, shattering the LCD screen and ruining the keypad. This takes a repair cost from 10 cents to a couple hundred dollars.

Here’s the thing: I have all the parts available to rebuild these units. The cost of my repair parts is split throughout the region so no one store takes a major hit. I can build an entire unit from scratch if I so choose but it takes the better part of an hour to complete. While repairing the common failure takes maybe 10 minutes. The fact that some dumbass thought that smashing a $500 piece of equipment with a hammer was a good idea just irritates me to no end.

So instead of just doing my job, replacing all the broken parts and shipping the unit back to the store, I’ll call the store manager and tell him he needs to order a new unit because the one they sent me is unrepairable (even though it’s not). This costs the individual store $500 for the unit and I keep all salvageable parts for future repairs.

My excuse for my behavior is that it puts more accountability on the individual store rather then the store being able to pawn off the accountability throughout every other store in the region.

So AITA? Should I just shut up and do my job? Or am I righteous for holding the store accountable?

TL;DR: I repair store equipment. When a dumbass store employee intentionally destroys expensive equipment, instead of just doing my job and repairing the equipment, I make the store order new equipment which costs the company money in the long run.

792,Not the A-hole,"So I live with four roommates, one of them being a friend of a friend who needed a place to live for the semester. We get along well enough, but we mostly just stay out of each other’s way and only really talk when we see each other around the house. 

Before we moved in together, she told me and my other roommates in passing that she has a small bladder and has to pee a lot. Whatever, that’s not a problem, there may only be one bathroom in the house but I’m sure we can work it out. Well, she wasn’t lying, because whenever anyone else enters the bathroom, she will come out of her room and say that she has to pee. I’m not kidding. It’s like her bladder activates when anyone steps out of their room. 

I’ve come to expect her presence when I leave my room because if I even think about going to the bathroom, her door flies open and she’s asking if I’m planning to use the bathroom because she really needs to. 

Not only that, but she will stand outside the door while I’m using the bathroom and have a conversation with me, which I find really weird because I’m clearly on the toilet and I don’t want to be bothered. There have been times where I leave the bathroom and I see her staring at me through a crack in her door so she can run to the bathroom when I get out. Not only is it annoying, but I also find it creepy and it almost feels like an invasion of privacy. I’m not sure if she’s doing it on purpose or if she really has to pee that much, but I feel like this is a communal bathroom and she expects us to use it at her convenience. 

I’ve been very nice in letting her use the bathroom when she needs it and hurrying up what I’m doing so she can pee, but frankly I’m tired of it and I shouldn’t have to cut my showers short and piss like a fucking jet stream just so she can use it when she has plenty of time to use it when I’m not home/sleeping.

Other friend gave me some advice on how to talk to her about this, but then immediately afterward texted my best friend about what I said.

She’s already told her dad that he can join us in the evenings when we’re home if he wants to hang out with my dad. Her dad agreed and had no problem, understanding that this was my family’s tradition. Thank you again. 

For background, my nuclear family lives in the hometown where my wife grew up near her parents, siblings, and some extended relatives. My own parents and brother live in different states so it’s not often that we can spend time together. Growing up, when my dad was able to take days off from his two jobs, he would take my brother and I on fishing trips for a couple of days to bond. As my brother and I got older, we moved away from our home state for work opportunities but always made a point to take these fishing trips together at least twice a year depending on all of our schedules. 

This year, because my son is still too young to go camping and fishing, my dad suggested he and my brother fly out to where we are so that we can fish locally and still be able to go home each day during the afternoon. I asked my wife if she was okay with this, and she thought it was a good idea since she knows how much these trips mean to me, and our son would be able to stick to his nightly routine while getting to spend time with my dad and brother. 

The issue now is my father in law (FIL) heard about these plans when he dropped by to visit our son while I was at work. He asked my wife if he could also join us and she said she’d have to ask me. Now, I get along fine with my FIL but these fishing trips are more about getting time to talk to my dad and brother than about the actual act of fishing. Honestly, we’re not that great at fishing! Now that I have my own child, I wanted to have this be his first real bonding moment with my side so that as he grows up, he’ll be able to participate and remember the tradition that my father started. 

I told my wife how I felt and she said that I was excluding her dad from what was a great bonding moment with our son. I said yes, but her dad had his own kids and could establish his own traditions with them and our son. This trip was for me and our son to connect more with his grandfather and uncle. She disagrees and said I was acting like an asshole. 

I accept whatever judgement this thread decides. Am I the asshole for excluding my FIL from a bonding moment with my side of the family?

EDIT for grammar and spelling mistakes 

Clarifications: I’ve read all the comments and a few reoccurring questions came up that I thought I’d answer. 

1. My wife confirmed that her Dad wants to hang out with my dad each day he and my brother are here. My FIL is retired and doesn’t have many friends. They are only here for 3 full days. As I mentioned in individual replies, since we’ll be coming home in the afternoons and evenings, I thought this was a fair compromise so that I get the bonding time with my dad, brother, and son and he can hang out with my dad in the evenings. 

2. Yes I am selfish for wanting to just spend time with my brother, dad, and son. I only see them three or four times a year without other people around. They are literally my best friends (besides my wife) and I can open up to them about anything. One of the reasons I would prefer my FIL not be with us on the mornings is because it would inhibit my talks with my dad and brother. 

3. Background info, my wife decided that our nuclear family would go no contact with her brother and sister because of issues I’ve posted about previously. This was her choice and I support her because this is what she thought was best in handling her siblings. I have a good relationship with my FIL and MIL and see them several times a week. I’ve offered to have separate bonding trips with him and our son but he’s refused because he’s not into outdoor activities like camping. He wants to go this time only because my dad will be present. He would rather stay in and drink beer and watch movies. No shame in that but I want my son to grow up enjoying the outdoors the way my dad taught me. 

4. To those of you who have commented on my passionate desire to keep the fishing trips exclusive to just my brother, dad, me, and now my son, it’s because for almost 30 years, this has been a sacred and vital part of my brother and my upbringing. It helped me to know my dad and brother as people, and to share in our family history. You don’t have to like it but it is what it is. My FIL is a nice guy but him being there would prevent us from sharing openly what we always have discussed before. 

5. My wife is reading all the comments along with me and we both see both sides better. She gets now why I want that bonding time with just my dad and brother and I can see why my FIL may be hurt. But again, who invites themselves along someone else’s trip? 

6. Lastly, just confirmation again, that my FIL has every opportunity to bond with my son and me since he lives so close to us, while my dad and brother don’t. We plan these fishing trips months in advance just to be together. 

7. Because of precious issues with my wife’s siblings, there is no sense of a larger family after marrying her in this sense. We’re happy for those that get this kind of in-law family dynamic after marrying, but it’s just not our situation at all.

810,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé and I have a friend of mine living in our spare room in our apartment as a roommate. She and I had actually met as roommates years prior to me and my fiancé meeting, then she moved out and eventually we all agreed to get a place together for cheap rent. Now my friend and I have drifted apart over the years, but I did still ask her to be a bridesmaid, especially because she was a roommate. The first thing she asked was “If I said no, would you be mad?” I said no, not at all, but I need to know as soon as possible so I can plan the wedding party. She said that she wanted to be a bridesmaid right then and there, so I went forward.

Fast forward a year later and I’m getting married in 5 months. She has yet to ask for the weekend off. We work for the same company and I know you have to do so far in advance. She keeps claiming she will, but then makes excuses to put it off. She has yet to order her bridesmaid dress (which is only $100), which she’ll need some minor alterations on, despite knowing it takes a month to come in and then it’s going to take some time to take in and such. I’m not even asking her to help me with anything regarding wedding prep, because I don’t think that’s her responsibility. Just get the dress, shoes and show up, please.

I know that the weekend is way more important to me. However, all of the other bridesmaids have their dresses. They have the wedding weekend off and if they need to, have travel accommodations paid for.

Things sort of came to a head this weekend. My fiancé doesn’t have many friends or close family he’d want in a wedding party. Therefore, we don’t have as many groomsmen as bridesmaids. That meant that one member of my party was going to have to walk down alone. Because I was nervous about our bridesmaid even showing up to the wedding, I just planned on it being her. I told her that she was walking alone and she flipped out on me, because everyone else had a partner. I said it wasn’t a big deal. She was so pissed and yelled at me for a good few minutes, before going to her room and slamming the door.

At this point, I’m just done. My fiancé and I are moving out after the wedding, so I’d just have to put up with her for another few months. WIBTA if I told her to just forget the dress and that she’s not a bridesmaid anymore? She’s not disinvited from the wedding, but if she doesn’t want to take off, she doesn’t have to?",106,1085,0.97
811,Asshole,"
So I have a degree in Computer Engineering and most of my work has been focused on embedded systems, robotics, real-time systems, safety validation for human machine interaction, etc...

My boyfriend had a MBA and he's working as a manager at a big airline manufacturer. So, he's certainly not dumb!! But he keeps wanting me to help him with computer stuff. And he doesn't seem to get that it isn't stuff I am experienced with; even though I'm generally tech savvy. 

He's got windows computers, and some Samsung smart TV, and is really into gaming, while I haven't touched windows since the year 2000 (literally my last windows pc was ""millennium edition"") and I'm not a gamer. I've got a Mac at home, and my work computers have always been linux, or I've been working on low level shit that uses direct hardware interaction...

So the thing is, I won't know what the fuck is going on when my boyfriend has some issue with his games or tv or phone. I could probably figure it out, with some googling, but honestly after work I'm not in the mood to do more debugging. Especially not being paid. 

We've had some arguments when I said I didn't want to work on his computer or debug his issues, and he was annoyed because he thinks that's easy for me. An be he does so much for me.

So, kind of as a joke, i said that I'd bill my boyfriend my contract-work rates. (I occasionally do contract work, but less so recently, because i value my free time more than money.) But anyway I have a fair going rate, 110 dollars an hour. It's more than I get paid at my day job, but it's the going rate for contract work near me because u gotta absorb the risk of bad clients.

And when my boyfriend asked if I could figure out frame rate issues with his new game recently; I said yeah but only if he signs my consulting contract. I wasnt joking  that time I think he took it as a joke, he was laughing though it all, even though I was serious. He signed it, and agreed to pay, though he made a joke about how we've now got a workplace romance.

Getting it optimized took 2.5 hours, so i venmo requested my boyfriend for $275.
And he got mad saying he cold have gone to geek squad for less. And I was like ""well why didn't you?"" And he said he thought that I was joking about the contact. I was like ""I was dead serious, it's not a joke when you sign a legally binding contract"" 

And he went off on me for being stuck up, for being ridiculous for charging hundreds of bucks for a favor, when he does me favors all the time. Like driving me places, and doing the dishes more than me.

So in the end; i know bringing a contract into it to make a point was petty. But I still feel ripped off for not getting paid. 

AITA for saying I want my cash?",106,60,0.85
812,Asshole,"It looks quite obvious that I should let them know, but my friends have pointed out that I might be an asshole for telling on him so I'm coming for your judgement Reddit

I recently found that my soon to be 16 yo brother occasionally smokes cigarettes and weed. My first thought was to tell my mother, so she could take action, but when talking to my friends I was told it would be hypocritical as I started smoking his age (and still do years later) and did way more (going to bars etc) and ended up being a responsible adult. In their eyes he's just making stupid mistakes like any teenager would and he'll come to his senses just like I did. I know that him smoking started with friends pressure and I don't know what else they might offer. When I started smoking none of my friend did and all I did was my own decisions (even if stupid)

My family doesn't really care about me smoking (both parents did when they were younger, but quit when had kids) and believe as long as I am respectful (don't litter, spend my own money and am mindful of people around and kids) I will quit when I'm ready.

My mother knows he tried and doesn't mind as it is a time to try things and she prefers him to be open about that, but she does not know that it's becoming a habit.

I feel like an asshole if I tell on him because we don't have the closest relationship and he trusted me with this 

I also feel like an asshole for not telling because it's bad for his health.

816,Not the A-hole,"A couple of years ago I made friends with a cool exciting girl who lives by my parents' vacation place in Marbella. I've always been attracted to her, but at the same time we've had a lot of disputes over our different values.

Anyways, as we were both highly attracted to eachother, we ended up becoming friends-with-benefits when I was vacationing in Marbella a summer. It was fun and all, but underlying everything there was still a lot of discussions over different key values.

Fast-forward a couple of summers. She has been together with someone for 6 months, which I am at this point totally okay with, it's even a bit reassuring to know I can just be friends with her and not indulge too much in the whole romantics of it. I come to Spain and hang out with her and her friends whom I got a good connection with and really wanted to hang out with more. She invited me to a concert, and we're all going. I express my hype about this and everyone is looking forward to it.

She then tells me she's been ""hiding"" me from her boyfriend, because of our past (two years ago), but it ended up with him finding out who I was and also that we used to have sex together. He becomes mad at her for lying, and thinks something is going on. I tell her she should tell him the truth about me, that I've been hanging out with her as just friends for the past years and that I wish to meet him so we could square things out and ease the tension. She says she wants to as well.

Anyways, the day before the concert she texts me and asks if it's okay that we don't go after all. I ask her what's up, and she tells me she and her boyfriend had stopped fighting about her lying about me, and that she doesn't want to light that fire again.

I then say that I respect that, and I don't wish to get in the middle of something, but ask if the others are still going, because I'd really like to hang out with them and get to know them better. She then proceeds to say that everyone's still going, but she doesn't want me to come because of her boyfriend. I then say I feel left out and mistreated, and she says she knows that, but still wishes I will respect her situation. I say I would like her to respect my situation and be honest with her boyfriend instead of excluding me. She then says that's not going to happen, but she can meet up with me three days later to do something else together. 

I say to her that this doesn't feel right, and that I can't ignore that I feel mistreated in this and if she doesn't want to see me at the concert I don't wish to see her later either. She then says I'm being selfish and not a good friend to her. I respond that our values are obviously different here, but I still wish that she'd tell her boyfriend.
She doesn't respond after this.

At this point I don't even wish to hang out with her anymore, as we've had discussions like this before. 

Am I the Asshole here for standing my ground?",27,29,0.92
817,Asshole,"I have two younger siblings (19M and 14F)and my mom provides for all of us. Me (21) and my brother (19) are studying in college in a different town. College is free in my country, but my mom still has to pay for our apartment and bills. With three kids and being the sole provider money is tight but it's still enough. My mom always insisted that she would pay for our education, it's cheap and it's kinda expected and normal for parents to do that in my country.

So here's my problem. A few months in my freshmen year, I thought I could handle getting a part time job (20h). I dont know anyone in my course that does this, so I knew It would be risky handling a job while studying full time. My mom got upset with me when I told her I wanted to get a job and told me that If I ever failed a single class that she wouldn't provide for me anymore. Fair enough. I agreed, got a part time job and started saving for a dream I've had for ages.

I'm now in my fourth year. I never failed a single class. I thought that since I'm not having any trouble keeping up with school that I would get a full time job (40h) and be a full time student. I am methodical, and ever since I started college I kept a log of what I should save a month to be able to accomplish my dream right after college. I will make a lot more now, but I will save everything. And I would need to save the exact amount that I make, If not even more. That's where the problems begin. My mom expects me to pay for my expenses now that I have a full time job. I am putting myself in A LOT of pressure just so I can accomplish my goals,  I am studying architecture in one of the best colleges in EU and everyone who studies architecture or knows someone who do knows is a extremely difficult degree let alone joining a full time job in the mix. I am now expected to be independent just because I was working already towards that. My brother never worked a day in his life, my mom never pressured any of us to do that.

I already am basically her personal bank. Anytime she needs money she comes to me. I always lend her money, it's already in the thousands and I never seen any of it back. (EDIT I do not want the money back and never asked, the times she needed were big unexpected expenses, it's not a common accurence)

I'm upset because I'm doing the impossible because my goals drive me, not so I can support myself during college. I feel like if it's now expected of me to be independent just because I work full time, then my brother should too. I'm really feeling like an asshole but at the same time I feel like working towards my goals just made my life more difficult because now I am forced to contribute just because I theoretically can. I do not pretend to be dependent after I graduate, I know I will be able to be completely independent and live by myself by that time, that is one of my goals that will be accomplished because I started working young (you can only work with18yo here).

I would only expect her to cover my basic living expenses. Ever since I was twelve I was always the one that bought myself clothes and shoes and whatnot with my gift money.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT since it's been asked - This dream is an alternative housing for myself, so I will save a lot if I do it right after college, It will make me completely independent from my mother, I wont need any help from her nor will I need to live with her while still saving a lot. This will be basically an investment, that's why it's important for me to do it right after college, the sooner I do it, the more I can save every year

EDIT 2 - the money I lent her was for big unexpected expenses. I told her not to worry about it since I will not need it (since I'm now working full time and it doesnt feel right wanting the money back from my own mom). The money is enough unless there's some disaster. Our family is not even allowed to receive help from the state so yes, the money is more than enough. We are good, she has lands in her name and all, it's not like we are poor.

&#x200B;

Please keep in mind culture differences. I understand most people on here are from US. In EU is expected and sometimes obligatory to parents to help out.

&#x200B;

FINAL EDIT -

1 - I didnt know this until now but yes, in my country is obligatory for parents to support ALL of their childs expenses until they finish college. My parents are divorced and my father is obligated by the state to pay for half of mine and my sibling expenses until we all finish college, he is not paying as of right now but it accumulates and I ( if I start to pay for thing myself as of now, otherwise my mom will get it because she's the one that spent the money on us) will receive it eventually. This is the law in my country and I did not know that until now. They dont have a way of knowing if my mother helps or not because she is the legal guardian (i dont know if this is how you word it).

2 - I have 25 hours of scheduled obligatory classes a week. This is not US. Our bachelor takes 3 years and the masters 2. So yes, it is difficult. In my course I know a single person that works 20hours (and he's trying to graduate since 2012) and I never even heard of someone with a full time job, and we are 200 in my year. Our teachers strongly advise us against it because of how hard it is, I had teachers advising me to give it up while I was still at a part time job.

3 - I'm not buying a house. Alternative housing it's not a House, neither has the price of one. It's an alternative to housing, there's a difference. If I can do that I can live on my own. I wouldnt be able to live with my mother because there arent really works available for architects in my city, so after college I would be the one living almost paycheck to paycheck because in my country architects are paid like shit",285,415,0.89

819,Not the A-hole,"My ex wife and I have been separated for about 2 years and share custody of our 6yo son. We are on the same page for pretty much all parenting decisions, and we coparent very well and get along pretty well.

When I (34m) have my son on work/school days, sometimes the only way to get him out of bed, woken up properly, and washed is to just have him jump in the shower with me. I usually help him shampoo his hair, but he does all the other washing himself. Then I let him sit in there for a few minutes while I get dressed.

This kind of thing is fairly normal to me as i grew up with both parents, a sister, and one bathroom when i was a kid. My mom amd sister would have a block of bathroom time in the morning, then my dad and I got our shot. So being around my naked dad as a kid was no big deal, and I guess i carried that feeling into raising my son.

But my son's mom has an issue with not only showering together but us both being nude around each other while we get ready. She thinks it is weird. I do understand that he is probably getting too old to bathe together all the time, but more so bc I want him to become more self sufficient, and not bc of the nudity. 

To be clear,  I respect my ex's wishes, and we promised each other we wouldn't undermine each other's parenting. So we did stop showering together.  But I still don't necessarily think it is a huge deal. So I need to know- am I being creepy with my son in the shower? Did i grow up in a weird household? Am I the ass hole for not seeing it as a huge problem?",166,262,0.95

I'm an audiologist and I do work for the VA. I, personally, feel that hearing loss claims are ones that fraudsters erroneously select the most thinking they can just ignore the beeps and get some quick cash. 

This guy comes in with a claim for hearing loss. Now, to be clear, you don't need to be deaf to get money from the VA. You can have normal hearing that shows a decline over time and still get a rating. The guy is doing fine. Hearing is looking normal. Then we get to a point and he basically gets everything wrong. So I call bullshit and tell him that his hearing his normal, I know what he's doing and he needs to cut it out so we can finish the test. 

He apologizes, he does look a little nervous, but he says that the small space he's in for the test is triggering a panic attack and that;s why he jacked that part of the test. Guy was a submariner so I'm not buying his claustrophobia excuse.

I note in his record that I think he was being noncompliant with the test and potentially trying to manipulate the results. That's usually all it takes. This guy, however, within a few days of the test withdrew his claim. I suspect he withdrew his claim because I called him out rather than just making a note and he didn't want my accusation to turn into a fraud investigation. 

This kind of pissed me off. I'm tired of people trying to cheat the system. My BIL is a VA Special Agent so I called him to tip him off to this guy. He tells me that it isn't going to go anywhere because 1) the guy withdrew his claim and 2) proving he tanked his test, or tried to, would be somewhat difficult as his lawyer would almost certain argue he actually did have a panic attack since the rest of the test was perfectly normal participation. He suggested I just let it go.

I chose not to.

The guy is employed as a police officer. So I called the misconduct tip line for his department and basically laid out that he was trying to cheat a compensation exam. An investigator contacted me and thanked me for my tip and said they may need to subpoena some records if they find enough to warrant more investigation.

My BIL is telling me that I fucked up big and I shouldn't have done basically any of the things I've done aside from making the note in my report. From my standpoint, if more people stepped up and actually vigorously pursued fraudsters then there would be less fraud.

Pre Situation Context: Me and my roommates hangout with our friends at our place a lot. Its the biggest house, and its the only house in our friend group where effort was put into furnishing it. (We are all students) 

Often if we are just chilling or drinking or just playings, we might order food. Anyone who wants food can join the order or not. Since its easier to order from one place, one person pays and everybody usually sends them money or hands them cash in return.

Situation: The other day I was invited to one of my friends appartments for dinner, a form of housewarming dinner. It was the two people living there, me and two of their other friends who I distantly know. I brought some wine as a gift, we ate two course dish and hanged out afterwards. Shortly after the meal, they ask me to send them $75 Dollars. Apparently, its for my part of what we ate. Nowhere in the invitation chat or during the meal was cost or price brought up and personally I would not want to pay 75 dollars for a single meal.

I’ve spent time around Anna and have been super lovely to her because I know Steve and Anna care for one another and were friends before I met Steve. All good there, no jealousy or bad feelings.

However we were at a party and she was being flirty with Steve and crossing boundaries with many people. One friend said it looked like she was trying to mark her territory but I brushed it off.

A week later I’m on Steve’s Facebook messaging everyone at the party about how much they owe. I’ve never been a jealous or suspicious person but after seeing how she was around him (flirty and touchy) I just had that feeling, so I looked at their Facebook messages and she’s sent him naked pictures, maybe two months ago? There’s no reply on his behalf but I see they’re calling each other often.

I came clean to him about snooping and how upset I was about the pictures. The fact he didn’t mention the pictures makes me suspicious. He says Anna has no boundaries, he didn’t realise until he saw how upset I was how inappropriate the pictures were, and he’s not the only person she would have sent the pictures too etc... 

Anyway... Steve has a large dinner party and Anna is coming. Steve says she’s going to apologise to me but she gets there and there’s no apology or acknowledgment of what’s happened. I would never have agreed to this dinner otherwise and I feel disrespected.

This whole situation hurts, and truthfully it doesn’t feel right. My gut feeling is that something is off and I don’t want this woman in my life. So would I be the asshole if I told him to cut her off?

Edit: just for some clarification Anna has a boyfriend and I’m certain Steve’s not cheating on me. Still I find the pictures and their relationship inappropriate.",57,124,0.95
826,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


She would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""WA!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


We tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. She thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


So a while earlier she was on the sofa playing Nintendo switch, looking very focused, and I decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


I approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""WA!"". She was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


My wife called me a childish AH for scaring her like that, but I meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. AITA?


Edit: I did talked to her and explain why I did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted I apologise and make it up for her. I don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so I ended up posting on reddit to see if I am really in the wrong.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and have a pretty solid understanding of each other.

We were celebrating our dog’s first birthday yesterday (I know, but also LOL) & the boyfriend calls me at lunch to ask how I’d feel about him inviting a particular coworker out too. I communicated that it’d be a lot for me on this day, but I would like to hang out another day this week instead. He said no problem, that he understood & it seemed like a nonissue.

Fast forward to when we’re driving to our location that night, he says “I hope it’s okay that I invited -that coworker and his wife-.” Well, if they’re already invited I’d have to accept that, but yeah I’m stoked that we talked about this earlier and seemed to be on the same page. He admitted he made a mistake and apologized. I didn’t spiral into anxiety mode, but was bummed and feeling unheard. 

At our location, everyone ate dinner, but unfortunately there is nothing I can eat on the menu at this location. Normally I would have eaten beforehand, but I had made cupcakes for our guests (I know, extra) and I ran out of time. By 9 pm boyfriend insists we go back to another friends house afterwards. It wasn’t “hey would you like to go here now?” It was “oh btw we’re going to meet up at their place now”. 

On the drive there, I say that I need to eat first, but his bladder trumped my hunger. “Gotcha, then we shouldn’t stay long.”

1.5 hrs later as he’s finishing a video game, I remind him that I really NEED to eat something, can we please leave. “No, I’m about to start another round.” Again, I say PLEASE. It’s ignored. So I’m feeling unheard again & like my mental AND physical needs aren’t being considered now. We left almost an hour later.

All things considered, I had a good time with the coworker and wife earlier & I didn’t die from hunger. But am I the asshole for being upset still that my best communication efforts were ignored for his fun-guy agenda?",47,51,0.87

833,Not the A-hole,"I don't really like shopping so I always order clothes online. Once a year I'm ordering a lot of clothes so I don't have to bother with it for another year.

So when I checked out my shopping cart, I saw that they offered 15% discount to all students. My girlfriend is going to university and she's also always ordering at this same online shop with that discount, so I asked her if she could give me the code for the 15% because that'd make me save up a significant amount of money since as I said, I only shop once a year and buy quite a lot at once.

She told me that the discount code is attached to her account and she can't do that, so I asked her if she could just order my things with her account and I'd give her the money for it right now or send it to her bank account if she prefers that.

She refused and said that she doesn't feel comfortable with this because she'd get emails from the online store. I found this a bit ridiculous and was completely confused as to what's so horrible about getting 2-3 emails when making an online purchase for someone else.

We've been together for almost 2 years.

That's when I got a little frustrated with her behaviour and said something along the lines of: ""Yeah, kinda knew you wouldn't do it, nevermind I'll just order it myself"". I probably shouldn't have said that.

It's really not about the money that I'm paying more now for no reason, though. I'm more dissapointed in my girlfriend for not wanting to help me out with something so easy. She now says that I have acted inappropiately because I asked her of something that gives me a personal advantage and she has the right to refuse and say no.

835,Asshole,"Sorry for any typos for formatting issues, I’m on mobile 

About a week ago our family cat  went missing, we thought it might come back but for a few days it did not show up at all. We panicked and felt scared for our cats safety as there is a river semi-near us. Eventually, through the pound’s website we found hat our cat had been taken by the council. After we go her back, we needed to figure who did this. We asked around and found out that our neighbor had done it to other people in he neighborhood; give the cat to the council because it is on their property (which they can legally do) but not tell us at all, while they know we are worried. The main issue is that every night we were calling out the cats name, and they did nothing at all.

I thought of a idea for vengeance, it turns out that the neighbors garage is on our property, so I could cost them a lot of money by reporting this to the local council, as they would have to pay for inspection (or whatever it is called) and if the council says so, they will have to pay for the reconstruction (keep in mind this is a full brick-metal garage)

Will I be the asshole if I do this?

TLDR: neighbor handed cat into local council and never told us which made us panic, we will get back at them by making them renovate which will cost money

They said they didn’t have theme colours, but the bridesmaids are in bronzey champagne and the groomsmen are in pale tan colour. Sweet. I went dress shopping, and found a beautiful emerald green dress. It was on sale but still a little pricey, but I fell in love with it, so I bought it! 
This past weekend, we were staying with P & S and P mentioned that she doesn’t want anyone wearing black at her wedding or want any hint of black at all. I was nodding along, until S said “yeah, and if anyone wears green, I’ll lose my sh*t”. 
When I asked why, it turns out that his suit is a particular shade of forest green that he’s getting custom-made, and he wants to be the only person wearing green, like how no one else wears white out of respect for the bride. Fair. When I asked if other shades of green would be okay, he said that he would feel like his day was ruined if anyone wore any green of any shade at all. 
I can’t return my dress, and I’ve been panic-searching all week and I can’t find anything similar in a different colour, or anything that I like enough to drop $$ on it.

846,Not the A-hole,"About a year ago, I willingly shared my location with my mom through the app Find Friends. I'm a college student living in an unsafe area so I didn't want her to worry about me. This hasn't been an issue for the most part. I know for a fact she checks my location frequently because when I go out she texts me things like, ""What are you doing at Target?"" or ""Whose house are you at?"" Never bothered me though because I know she's just worried about me and I don't do anything suspicious. (Though even if I were, it wouldn't be any of her business because I'm an adult.) The point is, I just don't care or mind - it's just a minor inconvenience that I'm willing to deal with if it puts her at ease.

However, the other day I was sitting with a large group of friends at a tea/coffee establishment. All of the sudden, I feel this stranger hovering over me and I'm about to snap and ask what they want because I hate random strangers touching me and invading my personal space. Much to surprise, I looked up and saw my mother holding a bouquet of roses. Everyone around me was staring and wondering why this random woman approached my table. It was clear that my friends were confused and so was everyone around us.

She gave the flowers to me and said that they were for a milestone that I had achieved recently (not going to specifics but basically like an award). I was seething because it was extremely embarrassing and my friends around me told me they were creeped out by her after she left. In spite of how I felt, I was polite to my mom and didn't act up. I just said thank you.

When I got home, I unshared my location with her because I thought she inappropriately took advantage of my location. It was a well-intended gesture, but after what happened I felt like she needed to understand boundaries. It has been a few weeks since this has happened and my mom has been very upset. She frequently calls me to ask me to share my location with her and I say no every time. I told her that if she's worried about me, she can call me instead and I will tell her I'm safe. She kept making excuses and said that she wants to know if I'm safe *right* *away,* to which I said ""You are the one who wants to know my location so you must make the effort to call me and find out. I always pick up and you know that, so it shouldn't be an issue. If that's not enough for you then it just means that you want to have my location for inappropriate reasons.""

I don't know if this is relevant, but my mom is an Asian immigrant and stay at home mom. That said, she doesn't go out much and can be socially unaware sometimes. She doesn't understand American etiquette. I don't think she knows how weird what she did was. I have no issue with her wanting to see me as long as she tells me first.

847,Not the A-hole,"So, a little backstory:

I am 15 and the cousins are 9 and 6. So back where I live these cousins would be constantly dropped off at my house for me to watch while their parents went to do whatever they were doing. They just would drop the kids off without telling me in advance and leave. 

Main story:

So when my parents told me we were going to Las Vegas, I was ecstatic because I could have a couple of days to chill and relax before school starts without having to watch any little kids. But when we arrived my uncle (father of the cousins) called and asked where we were (because we weren’t home to watch his kids when he dropped by). When we told them we were in Las Vegas he said he had relatives who lives there so he told his kids that they were going to Vegas as well and staying with relatives. Naturally I was pretty frantic cuz I didn’t want to watch some kids on vacation. My dad also booked them a room so they could have a card to go swimming. So tonight I had a all you can eat buffet dinner and when I went to my room I was just chilling on the bed alone doing random stuff in my phone with my sister. Then I hear knocking on the door and I’m kinda concerned and I open it and it’s the two kids. I pretend to be sleepy and tell them I can’t watch them because I am sleeping. I feel bad for lying but I’m just tryna have a relaxing vacation. Sorry for any grammar mistakes or anything I’m writing this minutes after it’s happening and I just ate a bunch so my brain is probably messed. So reddit, AITA!

Update: I’m pissed right now. My uncle just pounded on the door while I was sleeping and told them to sleep with us on the bed without asking our permission. I told them to leave and that I’m sleeping and the kids didn’t seem to want to stay either. He said “it’s okay I’ll pick you up in a couple of hours”. Like dude what it’s 11 and you just came into my room while I’m sleeping on vacation please leave. I ended up making them leave but I’m hella annoyed",24,27,0.96
848,Everyone Sucks,"We don't have a roster or anything, just whoever does them does them. However for over 10 years my wife continues to do them wrong, it's not just me being OCD but the way she does them I pretty have to unpack the dishwasher, repack them and do it again. She puts cups in upright, they fill up with water which means everything else doesn't dry properly. 

She basically opens it up and throws dishes and cutlery in, it blocks the rotors so the water doesn't flow properly - This means if there are any dirty dishes the grit doesn't come off them. She won't pre-rinse and will throw the good knives in there or pots with food caked all over them. This ruins the knifes and pots. Then she will pile up dirty dishes in the sinks so when I go to have to take all the crap out of the dishwasher and rinse it I then have to unpack the sink first... so... that's the background (also tied in with this is she never cleans out the lint filter on the washing machine or dryer, and will use the vacuum cleaner until the motor blows cause she never empties the bagless or throws away the bag on the other one) it's driving me insane.

So.... I made step by step instructions, I laminated them, and I placed them all around the house cause you know... maybe she somehow forgets... every single time... The kids love it, they treat it like chores and love to follow them but... my wife flipped out! started saying she's not going to be controlled and how degrading it was to have someone create instruction manuals for something so basic and she through them all out.

849,Not the A-hole," AITA for not leaving work to pick up my distressed daughter?

My  daughter is 15 years old, she went to a party last night that got way  out of hand (too many people, drugs, teenagers being stupid teenagers). I  told her that she wouldn't be allowed to go to this party because my  wife (her mom) is overseas atm and I would be working a night shift so I  wouldn't be able to pick her up or drop her off.   


Being the  rebellious teenager she is, she went anyway (I'm not surprised or angry,  I did the same at her age) but then called me at around 2 AM saying  that she was feeling uncomfortable because her friends were pressuring  her to drink and do drugs and she really didn't want to, so she asked if  I would be able to pick her up.   


I work as a security guard,  and the way the job works is we have 5 people rotating in 5 different  spots. It's a very high security company we work for and it's instant  dismissal for leaving a post unguarded. I called my supervisor and asked  if he would be able to get a replacement in ASAP for me, but because we  were already a guard down and it was 2 AM, there was no one available.

I  called my daughter back and asked if she was drunk, she said no. I  asked her if there was anyone else at the party who was sober, she said  yes. I told her to go up to them and say ""My friends are pressuring me  to drink, but I really don't want to, is it cool if I hang with you  guys?"" and to just stay with them until my shift finished in 3 hours  when I would be able to pick her up. She said she would.

When I  finally picked her up, she refused to talk to me at all until we got  home where all she said was ""I can't believe you wouldn't pick me up  when I asked you too."" She's locked herself in her room and I've not  gotten a very angry phone call from my wife asking what the hell I was  thinking not picking her up immediately. My wife understands the dynamic  at my work, however I get the impression she might think I'm being  dramatic when I say instant dismissal. I'm not, I would have been fired  and between my wife and I, I make 80% of our income.   


I didn't  want to call her an Uber or a taxi because I didn't feel comfortable  with her being in a strangers car at 2 AM. I was worried something might  have happened to her at the party, so I called her best friend who I  know went as well and asked her if anything happened. She assured me  that the two of them were joined at the hip the entire night, and while  my daughter wasn't having a good time, nothing outright bad happened.

854,Not the A-hole,"recently one of my departments requested a suspension for an employee who got into an argument with an employee and threatened violence against him. employee not only admitted to doing it, told us about it and thought it was funny. I authorized the request to suspend as did my boss but our HR person denied the request and cited reasons that have never been cited before, had never been  cause to deny a suspension request in the past, and contradicted previous disciplinary paperwork. For example one item of note was that the employee did not sign the supervisors notes from their meeting about the incident. Another said the action was too harsh and a warning should be given, even though I am aware of several other cases equal in severity that were handled similarly. It should be noted prior to this our corporate office approved or denied these requests directly and the process has only recently changed.

 I emailed HR asking if she could direct me to the policies that require what she cited (knowing they don't exist) and explaining how this contradicted previous situations. I ended with a jab comparing her expectations with having to undergo formal parliamentary hearings and stating if that is to be the new state of things I will miss our previous hr manager. The previous HR Manager was notoriously incompetent. 

The next day I received an email from a woman who works HR at another one of our properties. She answered that the things requested were nowhere in policy but was the way they've always done them at their property and explained why. I responded, first expressing that I was confused as to why the HR person for another property was involved and then explained to her that those were not standards followed at our property and that inconsistent standards and administration of disciplinary action would be problematic and leave us vulnerable to discrimination lawsuits. I further explained that our HR supervisor is close friends with the sister of the employee we requested to suspend so if we were to hold his paperwork to a different standard or give him lesser a punishment than those previous that could  create a perception of bias. I clarified that I was not stating our HR sup was biased, but that the situation would create a perception of bias.

Our HR sup responded and she was mad. She claimed she knew I was going to say that so she had asked the woman from the other property to review it and the notes and reason for denial were actually the other HR persons even though she signed the paperwork. 

Today we redid all of the paperwork and resubmitted the suspension request meeting all of the requirements requested. She was pissed and scolded me for calling her integrity into question. I told her if she sent it to another person because she assumed I'd claim bias, then obviously she saw there was a perception of bias and that wasn't on me.

So I (M25) will be getting married soon. Neither my fiancé (F23) or I drink, and I am not a fan of alcohol. I think it has too many negative societal effects, and therefore do not want to serve it at my wedding. I cannot in good conscience encourage drunkenness.  I also don't want to assume legal liability in case any of my guests drive drunk and injure / kill someone.

My fiancé doesn't drink either, but her sister and parents do, and she said that her family would expect fine wines at the wedding and drinking at special occasions is a key part of their culture. I am definitely willing to have mocktails and dealcoholized wine but by fiancé says that it won't suffice.

There is another reason I don't want alcohol. My family has a negative view of my finance, and having alcohol at the wedding would only make it worse, as my parents are strict teetotallers and view alcohol as a very big evil.

856,Not the A-hole,"This is going to be long but please bear with me. I certainly help on this one. 

My sister has had eccentric behavior for some years now. She has been unemployed for 5 years and lives at home with mom and grandma. For the past year or so she has been lashing out at both of them, being physically violent at times, especially towards my grandma. I live away from home due to my job but I've been here in the house for the past week to spend some time with my family. 

During my stay at home, I witnessed another such episode of her rage towards grandma and the way I saw her scream and break things in the house was certainly not normal. I don't share a very emotional bond with my sister and naturally don't know a lot of what's going on in her life so I thought it might be a good idea to talk to one of her really close friends behind her back to maybe know the reason why she is acting the way she is.

Now this is where is gets really strange. When I discussed things with her friend, K, about the how things are in the house, she was so confused and said that my sis always mentions how good her relations are with grandma and how she is taking care of all her medical expenses. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. She had been feeding lies to all her good friends to appear someone with a good social status. How she has been running two successful businesses earning shit load of money, and posting lies on her instagram stories. 

I personally thought it would be a good decision to let K know that these are all lies and in reality all my sister does it stay at home throwing tantrums and browse instagram all day. I have a habit of keeping journal and somehow my sis got hold of my diary and now knows everything that has happened between K and I. This has unloaded a shitstorm on everyone in the house, especially me. Even my mom has been pointing fingers at me that I'm an idiot for letting K know about all the lies that she had been telling to them.

After all this, I had a good, long talk with K that my sis needs psychiatric help and that K would not be speaking about this to any of their other mutual friends. But honestly I cannot be sure that.

He blew through his allowance in 2 days. And when I told him that I could buy one game and when he beat it then we could buy the next. But it would be a progression and he couldn't get them all at once he accused me of being selfish.

SECOND EDIT: As I mentioned in a comment, I was too skeeved to have a productive conversation with my husband last night. Thank you all for your very valid points, it was very helpful. I went into work late so we could go out to breakfast and have a level-headed conversation. He has apologized for giving out our address, and has agreed that we'll help get his brother on the road to an all-encompassing recovery. That recovery will not be taking place in our home. He's also privately spoken with each family member who tried to drag me, reiterated what I've said (housing, rehab, etc.) and told them if they're so hell bent on this matter that they can take him in. Thanks to everyone here, I really appreciate it.",51,51,0.98
860,Asshole,"I know what you may be thinking, but let me explain. Also I am using my daughter's account to post this, so this is actually written from my perspective and not OPs.

My daughter recently got engaged and we could not be more happy for her. She is a wonderful girl, and while I don't fully approve of her fiance, he will make a great partner.

Recently, when discussing the wedding, my daughter informed us that she doesn't want to be married in a church. We raised our daughters devout Catholic and this was where I put my foot down. I told her if she still wishes to receive my blessing and funding for the wedding, then she will get married in a church.

My other daughter called me and my wife to tell us we were being manipulative, and that good parents would support their daughters wedding regardless of the circumstances. I told her that all we were asking for was that our daughters got married in a Catholic church, but she insisted we were being manipulative. I admit we hung up on her out of frustration. That, I regret. 

So, I now ask you Reddit, as my daughters and I are not talking, AITA? Is it so crazy to ask for one thing in the wedding if I am spending over $20,000?",806,947,0.87

I am a nanny, and I work for a family with a toddler. I took said toddler to a busy story time and we ran into two little girls (2 years old and infant) whose family (family b) are very close friends with my employers (family a). I have had conversations with my employers about how family b are looking for a new nanny, and really hoping to find someone they can trust with both the baby and the toddler. Anyway, today I see family b’s kids with their new nanny. At one point nanny leaves the two year old alone in the public library (there were a bunch of other moms there, but still no one was supervising the kid) to take the baby to the public bathroom to change her. I kept my eye on the little girl to make sure she was safe. I don’t know if the nanny thought it was fine because there were so many other moms there, and it if it wasn’t for the fact that my employers know the kid’s parents so well I’d probably feel like it’s not my business. The fact that I do know all the parties makes me feel like I’d be keeping something from them by not mentioning it. Also, I don’t know if the other family told her it’s okay to do that, but it seems off to just leave a two year old unsupervised in a crowded public place. Would I be the asshole if I mentioned it to my employers?",31,31,0.93
864,No A-holes here,"I (17M) have been dating this girl (16F) for around six months now. We both suffer from anxiety and are very shy people. So when we found each other via friends who knew we were both timid and had a hard time talking to people of the opposite gender. Long story short we seriously hit off. We had so much in common and within nearly two months of talking made things official. So we've known each other for the better part of eight months. However, a thing about her was the fact that her home life was shit. Her parents weren't abusive but they constantly drank. It got to the point they'd turn her into a slave as they would make her do everything (such as turning on the TV, heating up food, etc) cause they couldn't think properly.

She would call me crying because she would have panic attacks over the phone. So one night it got really bad, so I split an uber with her. She came over my house around 7PM. My parents were not happy. They loved her but they were mad that she was staying over. They started yelling at me before she arrived and told me I was an idiot.

I asked them if it was related to having to spend money and take care of her like she was another child (such as food and all that) but they told me no, that they would take care of us for as long as we lived if they had to. They just told me it's because they don't want to be involved in drama. Like if her parents come to our house and start stuff. After explaining her situation, which they sort of knew about already, they reluctantly agreed to have her stay as long as she needed. I would have given them a heads up however it just happened and it was off a whim. She needed the help now so without thinking I did it.

When she arrived my parents greeted her, they were nice but I could tell it was forced. After some talking she explained her situation after crying. So I told her to get some rest and we can figure this out tomorrow. It's starting to make me think, I know I did the right thing but I also brought her over without my parent's permission. If I am the asshole I feel I was a justified asshole. But I need unbiased opinions, AITA?

865,Not the A-hole,"This is more light hearted than the usual post around here, but I need you guys to settle a debate.

I live with my sister.  She is a heathen who doesn't think hamburgers require buns.  Example:

""I'm making burgers tonight!""

""Awesome!""

*30 minutes later*

""Burgers are ready!""

""Great! Wait... where are the buns?""

""We don't have any :D""

""I... you... why burgers if we don't have any buns?""

""Ohhh it's fine, just wrap it in a tortilla or make some rice and mix them together.""

""Are we related?""

This debate has been raging for years.  To the point I make sure there's always hamburger buns in the house *just in case* burgers happen so I can enjoy them the way George Washington intended.  She insists hamburgers don't need a bun and I'm the crazy one for refusing to eat cooked disks of ground beef without the accompanying satisfaction of condiment absorbing carbo loaded deliciousness.  And, no, this isn't some crazy keto diet struggle.  She'll happily eat them *with* the buns if they are available.  She just doesn't care if none are available.

An interactive aquarium/miniature zoo just moved into the local mall. At first, I thought that it would be something good for the kids, until I looked into it and realized that the chain has several bad reports about animal abuse and mistreatment. As it turned out, the fact that it was opening at all was controversial. I told my husband that I didn’t want to support it and I’d rather go to the zoos in our areas that we know are actually taking care of the animals, properly. He agreed.

He has one weekday a week off, so our oldest will stay home with him and they do something with him while the baby goes to daycare. I found out while at work, that they were at the aquarium/zoo that we had agreed not to go to. When I texted him, he said he had co-workers that had gone and it was perfectly fine. Yet, when I read reviews, there were reports of the animals biting the kids. Again, he didn’t even talk to me about this. He just took him. I was pretty pissed.

I told him not to bring him back and that this place was banned. My husband thinks it’s overkill, because they went and it was “fine”. I looked at the pictures. Those poor animals do not look comfortable and it does not look like your average aquarium/zoo, they’re way too cramped. My son said he didn’t have much fun either.

871,Asshole,"I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \[26M\] gf \[24F\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.

**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.

He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.

**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin.

879,Not the A-hole,"So the other night I was hosting a party to celebrate my birthday, and my friend, who I'll call Sara, was invited. I've known Sara for ages and we're fairly close, but she has a habit of being a bit of an attention seeker. Last time she turned up to a casual meetup to watch Netflix and she decides to wear a corset and a miniskirt. I'm not judging her for choosing to wear that, she can wear whatever she likes and usually I love this kind of look, but it was an excuse to make every single conversation about her outfit, and she interrupted other conversations to make it about her.

So this time she arrives and starts speaking in the loudest, most terrible American accent I've ever heard (We're all from the UK) and claims that it's because of her holiday in Washington for 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS.  I make some joke about how she sounds more American that me, (I'm half American and lived there for a few years before moving, so I still have a bit of an accent). The conversation moves on, but the rest of the night she keeps up the accent.

Then later I overhear Sara introducing herself to my friend Jack, and she tells him that she got her accent from ""all the time she spent in the US"". Again, she spent two weeks there and that's the first time she's ever left the continent. Unfortunately, Jack is really kind and also fairly gullible, and he clearly believes her. So I join the conversation, trying to be tactful,  saying that while she has a talent in accents (she doesn't) it's still fake, and she gets really upset and ends up leaving early.

Later I get a text from a different mutual friend who calls me an asshole because Sara's been sticking with this accent for a whole month since she came back from holiday, so it's ""obviously real"", and I shouldn't have told her she was faking it in front of other people.

She IS obviously faking it, no question, but I do feel really bad for embarrassing her in front of my other friends, who she clearly wanted to impress. AITA?

EDIT: So just wanted to clarify a few things, since I wasn't clear. I didn't call her out in front of everyone, just one other guy at the party. Plus, I genuinely didn't set out to embarrass her, it was just an offhand comment meant lightly.

Thanks to everyone for their comments, whatever the verdict. I spoke to her briefly earlier to apologise and we've patched things up. I didn't ask why she did the accent but when we spoke she was back to the RP.

Thanks for all your help.

&#x200B;

I live near a family who are known locally for having a lot of foster/adopted kids. I've always found them odd but never said so because they help kids by giving them a second chance. Personally I disagree with this; I don't think you can give 20+ kids the individual attention they need. My experience with one kid recently reinforced that.

A while back when walking my dog I found a teenager hiding in the woods very upset. Obviously, I stopped and tried to help. She said she felt depressed, her siblings bullied her, her parents picked favorites, she felt invisible, etc. We talked for a while, I made some suggestions, eventually she seemed calmer. I offered to take her home but she said she was good and went on her way.

I recently found out the family have an online following. I recognised a girl in the back of the video as the girl from the woods. She's quiet in the videos and it does seem like her parents barely pay her any attention. They currently have 17 kids in the house, and others who are grown. They're trying to adopt another foster kid. I read about them and it seems they've ""got rid"" of problem children they'd adopted in the past who ""weren't a good fit"" for the family, etc. Others have noted they seem to favor some kids over others.

I think the parents are addicted to adopting kids and don't have the time to cater to all of their needs. It seems they give up on difficult kids and have separated biological sibling groups for that reason. In videos they have many kids in a room, some with just mattresses. The older kids seem to raise the younger. They talk about strict rules often; it sounds more like a prison. Maybe I'm biased about this because of my talk with one of the kids and my own opinion but I don't think this family should keep collecting kids. I'm considering contacting CPS to try prevent them adopting the foster kid but am I preventing a kid from having a family and a better chance in life?",186,1540,0.97

I don't wear hearing aids because I don't like the full range of sounds, and I prefer to communicate in BSL (British Sign Language), but I can hear a bit still. I like subtitles so I actually know what's going on when I watch something, I'll only go to subtitled movies at the cinema and everything I watch at home has subtitles. I very occasionally go to non-subtitled viewings (midnight releases are never subtitled, and your girl was first in line to see Spider-Man) but I end up missing quite a bit of dialogue if I can't see the actor's lips or it's too low or something. Anyway.

I have this one ..friend (using that term loosely) who absolutely hates subtitles, he says they're super distracting and he ends up just reading instead of watching. I told him he's getting distracted by what he's watching, so it's not like he's lost focus of whatever we're watching! 

The other day we were watching Season 6 of B99 and I refused to watch without subtitles, I love that show (I haven't previously seen S6 cus it's not on Netflix yet)  and I didn't want to end up missing something important and not getting a joke or subplot because I couldn't hear it. 

But my friend got mad at me for ""always doing this to him"",  he said ""I hate reading jokes before they're said on screen, you're making this show so much less funny for me. It ruins it."" 

And I'm also ""messing up his schedule"" all the time because I tend to only go to subtitled movies which are always at annoying times, so our friendship group will only go there on Sunday mornings or Tuesday evenings. 

He says because I chose to not wear hearing aids and occasionally watch non-subtitled things I should just never do it, or watch things alone, because I'm just seriously pissing off everyone else I'm with, they're just too nice to say. I don't think that's true but I can't tell if I'm being the asshole or not.

I don't have hearing aids; I can't really afford them. The NHS only goes so far! It's hard for my friend to understand, and I guess for some of you too, that hearing aids don't magically cure not being able to hear, they just aid, (for some people).",649,1413,0.94

Proff A was placed under investigation, but didn't get fired because apparently Proff A and V were dating for several months at that point, and apparently student/teacher relationships aren't technically against the rules if the student isn't in the professor's class, and it's a consensual relationship.   


So okay, no harm no fowl. I didn't realize Proff A and V were dating, and he didn't lose his job. But somehow people found out that I was the one that reported him, and now everyone in my major (which is pretty small) has been treating me like shit, and accusing me of trying to fuck over Proff A, when I was just trying to make sure he wasn't inappropriately kissing a student in class. 

So AITA for reporting him? Maybe I should have talked to V first, idk.",276,491,0.91

889,Not the A-hole,"I'm on mobile.

So my (28f) fiancé (29m) thinks I was being an asshole ( more like a Karen) in this situation. I do not.

Background info, I work as a bartender so I know full well how to stay polite and ask for stuff nicely. 

I went to Starbucks the other day and ordered a frozen cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso in it. I was one of the only clients in the place along with my 2 friends, so the baristas were not busy making orders.

I saw that the barista used a blender, made the iced cappuccino mix, poured the extra espresso shot in the blender and pour the drink in the cup, handing it to me. The thing is, she had overshot her quantities and threw half of that mix out. This means half of my extra shot of espresso that I paid for went down the drain. Having known this is how she made it, and wasted some of it, I would have order that shot on the side.

So, as nicely as I could ( my service tone) I said that I was sorry to ask, but would it be possible to get the full shot that I had ordered, since I ordered it because I was sleepy and I had paid for it. The employee looked at me like I was crazy, so I said that I was sorry for the trouble but I really wanted that shot. 

She looked really irritated and asked the manager if she could make another espresso shot. To which the manager obviously said yes. As she gave it to me though, she was very dismissive and just pushed it over. Even with her attitude, I thanked her and told her I appreciated. 

I'm 100% sure my tone, my smile, and the way I asked was not condescending at all, as I try to be overly nice to customer service employees.

My fiancé is not the one to ask for something to be replaced when it's not what he ordered, but I am. I know it's a hassle for employees but I much prefer my own customers tell me something is off right off the bat so I can fix it.

So, was I a Karen in this situation or is he being dramatic because it makes Him uncomfortable to ask?

Edit: wording because it was a confusing sentence.

I accept both judgements ( for maybe having sounded condescending to her) and I will try to word stuff better in the futur.

Second edit: some people are confused as to why I'm calling it an ice cap. Here in Canada, we have Tim Hortons ( which I usually go to), and they have ice caps. As this situation happened almost 2 months ago, I just forgot what they were called at Starbucks. I did explain what I wanted and ordered it by its Starbucks name equivalent at that moment.

Also, I'm francophone so I do confuse word meanings sometimes. By ""overly nice"" I didn't mean like a cartoon caricature type. I meant I'm really careful of being super friendly and courteous, if that helps.

I've had a bunch of tips given to me on how to order from Starbucks properly. Thank you kind baristas.",267,848,0.94

894,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because we're both Redditors. My husband (31m) and I (27f) have been married for a little over a year, been together for about 4. I wanna start off by saying that we are also best friends and haven't really had an issue like this before.   

   My husband, who we'll call Allen, is on the autistic spectrum and struggles with his emotions and with negative thoughts. He's been on a medication for the last couple of years that helps him look at issues more objectively and without as much clouding, but I noticed lately he has been getting more distressed at things I consider minor inconveniences. Whenever I notice these behavioral shifts, I ask him if he is okay and if he took his meds he always says yes of course and that he is just having a bad day. He has never lied to me before that I know of and I usually feel I can trust him.   

  It all kind of came to a head this morning when we were getting ready for work and he was getting super frustrated over a small leak under the bathroom sink. I decided to ask him flat-out if he had taken his meds that morning, and he said no and shuffled around in the drawer for them and pulled them out of a tiny travel bag I know he doesn't use daily. I asked him if he had been taking them consistently and he finally admitted he hadn't because he doesn't like them and doesn't want to and he has the right not to. 

     I got really upset over it and definitely cried a little bit (I'm a crybaby, I'll admit it), partially because I feel he lied to me repeatedly for weeks and primarily because I feel like he is sabotaging his mental health. He sees it as his right to not take them if he doesn't want to and that I am the asshole for being so upset over a decision he feels is his alone to make. I can definitely understand his want for freedom, but I feel like this affects us both. Reddit, AITA?

TL;DR - Husband has been lying about taking important meds. I'm mad and he's mad that I'm mad. ",30,27,0.89
895,Not the A-hole,"My GF and I work in the same company, I'm one of the managers in my department. My GF is in between jobs looking for a new job, she is a temp here doing repetitive stock creation for my work. I hinted she should pick up the pace, and that milking our clock takes money from the company, from our bonuses etc. She stopped talking to me. Around lunch time I asked what was bothering her and her exact words were ""don't criticize my work, stay in your lane. You're not my boss, *names actual bosses*."" While I'm not her boss, I am able to give her orders and even give her write ups. I hadn't planned on writing her up, but she ordered me to take her home, while I'm on the clock and she still has her shift to finish. She says I'm being a cunt and I'm a bitch all the time when I refuse due to those things. That's where I drew the line. AITA for wanting to write her up? I feel as if it's the most professional way of handling it, and I don't want to give her special treatment due to the circumstances. She doesn't like the job here but doesn't seem to be trying too hard looking for another.

INFO: Our higher ups have put us in control for a reason; so they wouldn't have to deal with small bs like this, unless it's what they consider a serious matter. That's why I'd like to take an initiative to do something about it rather than turn to someone higher up.

EDIT: thanks everybody for the input, whether I liked it or not. I appreciate the different ways to look at things. I wouldn't say a lot of the stuff I said to another employee and it was selfish of me to even mention she's taking from our bonuses.

899,No A-holes here,"Just trying to put this throwaway to good use and I really enjoy this sub. It's quite cathartic. This happened last month. So for context, I work at a non-profit. It's been a little under a year since I've been here and it's not been that great. I'm a 24 year old brown dude in an office full of all white girls between the ages of 26-60, except the President, an old white dude who is barely ever in. This context is important because being in that kind of environment, I kind of walk on eggshells and mostly keep quiet. They joke about how quiet I am all the time.  

This could not be any farther from the truth. I don't want to sound like I'm humble bragging but I am a bit of a social butterfly. I'm very much an extrovert and that's just my personality that I don't really display much at work because I simply can't relate to any of them and just out of respect. I come in, put my headphones, knock out my tasks, contribute to anything I'm asked to, and then leave. I'm always a participant, I never exclude myself, I just don't talk much when I'm here because I don't exactly feel comfortable telling this office about my personal life. 

So I'm at a bar and I'm chatting up this girl and we're having a good time and I lean in and we start making out. We do this for about a minute till I stop, look at the girl, then hear ""Heyyyy, [my name]"". I turn around, and it's the other younger co-worker of mine (26F). She just asks in a really sarcastic manner ""how's your night goin?"" I politely say it's going good and make a sarcastic remark about how this is bad and I should leave. We both laughed, and I left. Thought that was it. 

The following Monday we have a staff meeting and the Prez is not there so I'm the only dude. The Chief of Staff asks how everyone's weekend is and we all say good. Then the co-worker I saw at the bar points to me and says she knows I had a good weekend. Everyone turns to me ooh-inh and ahh-ing asking what I did. I smile and just said I went out this weekend to which my co-worker replied, ""he was kissing on a pretty cute girl when I saw him"". They started to laugh, ooh, and ahh even more. I immediately responded to her by saying ""Nice one. Real cool of you."" She was like ""whaaat you're young. It's fine"" I just stayed silent and the COS shut it down pretty quick when she saw my face. The co-worker later had to give me a really uncomfortable apology to which I just stopped her in the middle of it and said no hard feelings just don't say stuff like that.  

When I tell this story to some of my boys, they start calling me an asshole for reacting that way and I shoulda just ""been a man about it"". I don't know what that means. I just don't want my personal life spouted out like that, especially around a bunch of girls. Another friend of mine said that at least now they don't think I'm some quiet kid who sits at home all day. I told him I could care less what they think, I'm there to do my work and leave.

900,Not the A-hole,"So, for context: I'm a brown Hindu woman who lives with her parents (we're in India, where it's not weird). I've had a complicated relationship with my parents for the most part, because of my 'progressive' beliefs and lack of participation in organized religion.

The sich: tomorrow is Raksha Bandhan. It's a Hindu festival where the sister ties a ceremonial thread around her brother's wrist to signify their bond, and the brother vows in return to protect her. It's one of the major events on the Hindu lunar calendar, but I can't... bring myself to put any stock in it.

In general, I'm not someone who enjoys festivals or rituals. I've also associated them with symbolism I can't relate to and a forced sense of joy. My brother (almost seven years younger, and my baby) feels the same way - perhaps even more so, and openly - and Raksha Bandhan so far has been something we 'celebrate' because we're expected to (and because we like our parents too much to fight about one thread-tying photo-op). 

He's been away at college for a few years now, and these rituals seem more unnecessary now than ever. So this year I decided not to send a Rakhi (ceremonial thread) by snail mail. 

I've been getting flak about it for a few days that at the time I thought was only good-mannered ribbing. But today my father turned vicious during dinner and said fairly hurtful things about how I was disrespecting the sibling bond and had failed my religion.

I tried disengaging from the conversation first but then reacted with anger myself, pointing out how he had never returned any of his own cousins' calls on festivals and people had actually stopped sending Rakhis to us. Traditionally speaking, the brother visits the sister's home with gifts on Raksha Bandhan, and they break fast together. If we're being so pedantic about how a bond should be celebrated, why even sub in with postal services - why aren't we actually visiting relatives living in town the way we're 'supposed' to?

He's not speaking to me now (I expected as much) and I feel terrible - I didn't mean to react in anger, or 'throw it back' in any sense. Am I the asshole in this situation?

[Edited to add the 'trigger']: the real argument started with me joking about how I should get the Rakhi as I do the gift-giving and protecting. As a student, my brother has very little money to spare, so I sometimes send him a little extra for take-out or to buy himself some nice books (a beloved shared interest). I did so recently, and my brother has been (sincerely) calling it his Rakhi gift since. When I mentioned the same to my father as a light-hearted response about not sending the thread instead, it got ugly.",20,28,0.94
901,Not the A-hole,"So last week I called in sick for a shift on Friday. The night before I was having a rough go, my mental state wasn’t the best, basically I was having a sad bitch kinda night and didn’t feel mentally, emotionally (or even physically) okay to go in for my shift. I called in, asked for the day off so I could come back to work the next day feeling refreshed. Everything seemed to be fine, my manager wasn’t upset, my shift was covered and blah blah blah. 

Now two days ago while I was at work, one of my supervisors told me that someone told her I was out drinking Thursday night, hence the sick day Friday. I was upset because I didn’t think I should have to explain anything to anyone— it was covered, I needed the day off. She told me that she “wasn’t going to tell” me who said it. 

There’s only a couple of young people who work there. Two of them are especially gossipy and it’s on ongoing joke that they do so. I asked one of the girls, I said: “Supervisor said someone told her I was downtown drinking thursday night. I don’t know if it was you or X or who it was, but I would appreciate it if no one said anything about me that isn’t true. I wouldn’t be upset if it was true, yada yada”. She said it wasn’t her, I was like okay, thank you. That was all. 

NOW. I just went in to pick up my cheque. Supervisor comes up to me. 

“Brokebadbitch, I heard you were going around asking people who said that about you. You can’t be doing that just because I told you what someone said. “

“Supervisor, if someone is talking about me I have every right to tell people I don’t appreciate it. I couldn’t tell them specifically because you wouldn’t say who it was” 

“That’s because I was lying to see if you were actually drinking” 

“So you lied to me and now you can’t handle the consequences of the lie” 

and it went on like this with her thinking that I was petty for going around and asking, and of course I think she’s CRAZY (she’s a 40 year old woman, i’m 22) for starting a rumour ABOUT ME, TO ME.

Who is the asshole here?",160,2629,0.96
902,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so this happened a few minutes ago. Let me lay out the situation here; I am currently overseas, so I am not physically with my girlfriend right now. She's back in the states, and has a little bit of financial troubles. I have offered her any help she needs with money, as I do have a pretty decent amount saved up, so it wouldn't hurt me a bit to sacrifice some of my own finances to help her out. She has always said she doesn't want to take my money because ""I work hard for it and earned it so I should be the only one who spends it."" And just now, she mentioned about somewhat wanting a sugar daddy. I explained to her my issues with that. I am her boyfriend, we are very serious at this point, and if anyone is going to provide her security and stability, I feel like it should be me. And, if anyone else is to provide her financial stability, then it should be friends or family, not some random old creep who wants to solicit sexual acts from my girlfriend. I explained that to her very clearly, and all I got was a ""oh I wouldn't do anything sexual with him; do you not trust me, etc."" I also told her that she could do that if that's what she really wanted to pursue with her life, but I would not be in a relationship with her if that's the route she takes. She claimed it was just a joke, but then claimed ""oh well I mean, I'm kind of half joking but half considering it.""

I'm pretty upset at the whole thing. I feel that it is my responsibility as a man to take care of my significant other in every way possible, whether it be physical, emotional, or financial support. I don't think I really acted in an unreasonable way, I feel like most boyfriends/husbands would see an issue with this, as money can influence people to do things they wouldn't normally do.

906,Not the A-hole,"My very good friend already had one kid with someone that is not really around, doesn’t pay child support, etc. The thing is, she’s really okay with that and talks about how much she enjoys being a single mom. She says she doesn’t have to consult anyone on matters, can do everything for her son and that they’re a team. I know for a fact that she didn’t choose to become a single mom in this scenario, because I was around when they were both parenting this kid together and the dad took off.

She then had a one-night stand with a friend’s brother about a year ago and ended up pregnant. The father was excited from the beginning, wanting to be around, etc. My friend was eh about it. She complained that he was “too involved” by wanting to go to ultrasounds, do things for her (like get stuff she was craving, take care of her, etc.). I told her that I know you’re independent and not used to it, but unlike your son’s dad, he’s interested. Keep the door open, you don’t have to let him take care of you but at least let him do things that revolve around the baby like appointments and get stuff for you. She acted like it was a huge chore to do so and fought him on a lot. I watched this poor guy really try with her, on everything, while she just fought him. She didn’t call him when she went into labor and then eventually called him after she gave birth, so he could come to the hospital. He’s on the birth certificate. Keep in mind, I’m her best friend, I’m at her house pretty much every day and was at the hospital when the kid was born, so I’ve witnessed all of this.

Now, however, he’s at a distance. He comes by a couple of times a week (baby’s too young for overnight visits since she’s breastfeeding) and she’s saying he’s “going back on promises” he made to spend the night, be around every day, etc. I told her that she didn’t exactly make it the best environment. She asked what I meant. I said that she pushed him away and put herself in this position, to do it all alone. I said that she told him several times that she was used to doing it alone and wanted to, and that she can’t expect him to just keep kissing her ass and waiting. I told her that I knew it was harsh, but that she needed to work on her relationship with her daughter’s father so it wasn’t fucked up, because he’s a good guy (unlike her son’s dad) and it needs to work out.

She got pissy with me, said it was none of my business and asked me to leave. We’re still talking, but she won’t mention him. I wonder if I overstepped, but when I talked to him (I didn’t reach out, I saw him at the store and he started the conversation), he parroted basically what I said. So, I know I’m right.

908,Asshole,"29M, ex-wife is 28F. We divorced when our daughter was 2 but she's 8 now. It was amicable, at least as amicable as divorces get. We have split custody, I'm on weekends as my ex-wife lives closer to her school.

I take some recreational drugs sometimes. Never when my daughter is home, in fact, never when I think there's even a possibility of her being home with me. My drug use is limited to psychedelics and marijuana, never opiates or anything that puts me or others in danger.

Last week Tuesday I took some 4-AcO-DMT, a psychedelic that metabolizes into psilocybin when ingested. Mushrooms, basically. It lasts anywhere 4-6hr with onset after 45min or so. I took it at 2PM.

At 3PM, when the effects are starting to take hold, I get a call from my ex-wife. She had an emergency at work and needed me to pick our daughter up from school. She needed me to pick her up, keep her until 8PM or so, then she'll come get her from my place. It's about a 20 minute drive there and back. 

*I told her ""no""*, without much reasoning behind it other than I can't. For starters, it's irresponsible to use a vehicle at the cusp of my come up. And second, I don't want my daughter to see me like this, nor do I feel like I could handle the responsibility. Lastly, it's my ex-wife's responsibility to pick our daughter up. If I was sober, I would have, but I wasn't, and it wasn't my job to do it to begin with. I had to tell her no. She hung up on me.

I phoned her back, she skipped the call. I left a voicemail explaining I'm out of city right now and truly can't. I even Facebook messaged her this, got the read receipt, but no reply. It turns out my daughter waited at school for 3 hours before she came and got her. She didn't find alternative arrangements to pick her up. Everyone is mad at me: my ex-wife, my daughter, the school.

909,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have a 5-year-old daughter. Right now, she’s the only grandchild on either side of the family. Originally, my husband and I talked about having more kids, and we weren’t sure if we would have more. After discussing it at length, we decided that we are one and done. We’re confident in this choice to the point that my husband is getting a vasectomy. Now, she probably won’t be the only grandkid on my husband’s side, as he has a brother who’s engaged and they say they plan on having kids a little after the wedding. However, I am an only child, not by choice. My parents wanted a large family but were unable to, I was due to have a brother but he sadly passed away not long after birth. So, my daughter will always be their only granddaughter.

We didn’t make a huge announcement about not having more kids, we just figured we’d tell people as it came up. As it so happened, one of my cousins got pregnant and my mom and I went in on a bigger gift for her shower. While we were shopping, my mom mentioned number two for me and I told her “Yeah, Husband and I decided we’re not going to.” She completely overreacted, started crying, etc. She’s not typically a dramatic person, but I should’ve see that coming. Ever since, she’s tried bringing it up, but we’ve stayed firm. We hadn’t told her about my husband’s vasectomy.

Now, my daughter has never asked for a baby brother or sister, but she did create an imaginary older sister for herself. It’s cute, age appropriate. She brings her everywhere and I don’t really mind it. My mom, however, takes this as a cue to ask her constantly “Well don’t you want a baby brother or sister?” and my daughter just shrugs and tries to go back on playing. I tell my mom to cut it out, but she says she’s “just asking” and there’s no harm in getting her opinion. Frankly, my 5-year-old doesn’t get a say in whether or not she gets a baby sibling. She can create an imaginary sibling group for all I care.

Then, the other day, my mom asked my daughter yet again and when my daughter didn’t respond, she said “You need to tell Mommy she should put a baby in her tummy”. I turned to my mom and told her that if she brought up the topic of a baby again, she wouldn’t be allowed around my daughter, and to shut up about the topic in general. I said I was sick and tired of having this discussion and that she just wanted to live vicariously through me. She got very upset, then left the house.

I was walking home from the library at night reading a book with the LED flashlight I had. Someone drove by and catcalled me. I looked up and shined the flashlight at what I was looking at, which was the car that went by. The car swerved a moment and screeched to a stop. I didn't want to risk walking past it after that, so I turned around and took a side street home. I heard him yelling for me; his rant riddled with curse words.

***Additional Info*** (will be added to when more is needed)

**Definition of catcall**

>The definition of catcall used as a verb: to make a whistle, shout, or comment of a sexual nature to a woman passing by.

**did you know there was a car where you were pointing your light? did you know the catcaller was in the car?**

>I knew there was a car. It was only one car on the road at the time.  
>  
>I heard the shout come from the car as it went by. There was no one else around at the time.

**how bright is that flashlight, worse than high beams?**

>It was a small cheepo flashlight from walmart. Nowhere near as bright as high beams. But I am aware that a quick, unexpected light to the eyes are still quite disorienting.

**Did you blind them on purpose?**

>I was on autopilot. Where my eyes were, my flashlight was pointing. I didn't mean to blind him. If there was an accident (like another car or pedestrian got hit), then I would've stuck around. There was no one else on that road at the time and there was no visible/audible injury, so I fled.

**You were walking while reading? In the dark?**

>Yes. I just checked the book out from the library was eager to get started on it.  
>  
>Yes. that's why I had the flashlight. I always have the flashlight in my purse anyways.

**you shouldn't be reading while walking, at night. You're a nuisance with that flashlight and are distracted, could easily bump into a post, fall in a hole, trip over an obstacle, etc.**

**You shouldn't be reading and walking at the same time anyway, especially not at night,**

(These aren't entirely requests for info, but I just wanted to clear this up.)

>I have a habit of walking extreeemmellyyy sslloooww when I have my nose a book. I do that to ensure I don't trip or crash into anything. Even a small pebble felt under my shoe would make me stop for a sec.  
>  
>The catcaller was something I wasn't expecting, so the mode I was in at the time was disrupted.

**what did they say?**

>It was the onomatopoeia of  ""woot!"" or something of that nature. It was that typical call that isn't a word per se, but it still means the same thing. They wanted my attention, even if it was for a short second.

**the noise your quickly identified cat-caller made could just as well have been to call you attention to the traffic**

>I was walking really slowly on the sidewalk. My situational awareness was decent enough to allow me to stay off the street and not bump into anything.

**what if he had lost control over his car in his confusion and hit a different pedestrian?**

>I knew enough about the area to know that there was no one else around. The street is almost always empty at that time of night. It was just me on the sidewalk and the car driving by. There was no one else around.

**you weren't necessarily shining it at the car, just in the direction of the noise**

**you can’t be an asshole for accidental behaviour. You didn’t do it deliberately and thus weren’t the asshole.**

>These people actually understand! I was on autopilot. It was a reflex. It! Was! Not! Intentional!

**If he was looking at the road like he should, he wouldnt be blinded by the light**

>This whole time I thought my flashlight reflected off a mirror or something. I never considered the possibility of the driver still looking at me when he went by. Thing is... I appreciate the new perspective, but I kinda doubt that's what happened.

911,Not the A-hole,"I’ll keep this as short as possible. Dated a guy briefly last year. I broke up with him in December because there wasn’t any long term potential. Reconnected a couple months ago, decided to be FWB because we get along great and the sex is fantastic.  We were both very clear that it was just hanging out and having sex. 

I’m in my late 30’s and he’s in his early 30’s, if that matters. 

We established ground rules that neither of us was sleeping with anyone else (because condoms suck, we’re both negative for STIs) but that if we did, we’d tell the other person and would start using condoms, if we decided to keep having sex at all. 

I’ve been on the pill for nearly 20 years and have never been more than a day late. I’ve never had a pregnancy scare. My period was due to come 10 days ago. It didn’t. Two days pass, three, four, five. I start freaking out. I reach out to a couple friends, then I reached out to him. 

Important back story here is about three weeks ago I was honest with him and said I was developing some feelings, but that I explicitly did not want to be in a relationship with him. I told him that honesty is important in these situations and if my feelings skeeved him out, I understood and we could end things.  He pulled back a bit, which is understandable, but we kept seeing each other once or twice a week.  Recently I got a little drunk and used the “L” word, which probably wasn’t my brightest moment, but it is what it is (and until now, I genuinely did love him, just not in the way where I want to be with him). 

I told him I was 5 days late and that I was scared. He blew up and accused me of manipulating him and trying to “trap” him.  I told him that isn’t the case, I don’t want to be with him, but I was hoping he would support me through this scare and be with me if I had to go down the abortion road. I told him I made a doctor’s appointment and would take a test after my work week (I work Sun-Tues in a high stress job and I know myself well enough that I would *not* be able to perform well knowing I was pregnant). 

This morning (the morning I said I was going to take a test) I woke up to 18 missed calls and [this barrage of texts.](https://imgur.com/a/5zJgAcn). I think that he is a piece of shit for some of the things he said, but his comment that I shouldn’t have told him until I took a positive test got me thinking. 

Should I have waited? I never expected him to react like this, but had I known he would, I never would have told him, whether I was pregnant or not. I’m feeling incredibly guilty for the stress this is causing him. The few friends I’ve told said I did the right thing, but I’m wondering if I did. 

I responded to his messages saying I took a negative test, I’m going to the doctor tomorrow, and that I never want to hear from him again. 

But what if I’m not pregnant? Should I have thought more about how this would impact him?  Should I have kept this to myself?

AITA for telling my FWB that my period was late?

Edited to add: I did take a test on that day 5 and it was negative. He was aware of that. These texts came yesterday after he asked me if I got my period yet and I said no but that I was taking another test tomorrow (today) and had a doc appt scheduled for Thursday.",78,96,0.92
912,Asshole,"My son is 14 years old and severely autistic. The school that he goes to does not provide school busses just for special needs children, so he rides the same bus as the rest of the other kids in our neighborhood. The school year started two weeks ago and this is the first time he’s been riding the bus. In the years past, I drove him to and from school, but with my schedule this year, just dropping off and picking him up from the bus stop is much more convenient. 

Two weeks ago, on the first day of school, I introduced myself to the bus driver and asked that he keep the bus as quiet as possible, since loud noises lead to my son getting upset or having meltdowns. He said he would “try his best”. 

That afternoon, my son became agitated during the bus ride home and refused to get off the bus at his stop. I had to get on the bus and calm him down in order to get him off. The bus driver glared at me as we were getting off the bus, and I said “if you’re going to be mad at anybody, it should be yourself. I told you to keep the bus quiet.”

After that, every morning and afternoon the bus driver glares/frowns at me. In contrast, he greets all the other kids and their parents in a very cheerful and friendly way. 

I called the school and told them about the bus driver being so rude, and they said they would “look into it.” After a couple more days, he hadn’t stopped with the dirty looks, so I called a few more times and they said that “nobody has ever had any problems with that bus driver and many people say that he’s the best one at the school” (Which I sincerely doubt). 

I mentioned the issue to my neighbor, who has two children that ride the same bus as my son, and she said that I am completely unreasonable, that the bus driver is “the nicest guy you’ll ever meet“ and that her children say my son is “extremely disruptive” on the bus and that she thinks he shouldn’t be riding the bus. Obviously this made me angry, because my son has just as much of a right to ride the bus as her kids.

914,Asshole,"Hello AITA. Since there's potentially money involved, I decided to use a throw away account. 

So this sort of goes back a few weeks but my best friend started dating a new guy. I only saw pictures and I have to admit he's very good looking but I didn't get to meet him until Saturday. And I don't know how to put this...but he's a staggering douche. He came over to my house to meet my boyfriend and I and all he wanted to do was talk about his motorcycle. My friend was just goo-goo eyes at him and I was honestly bored stiff because he could not talk about anything else.

 He was literally in the middle of telling us how he sent both his bike and helmet off to some reality TV show custom shop in LA to have them painted to match when my Rottweiler started humping his helmet on the floor. Obviously the dog is much bigger than the helmet so I didn't see him ""holding on"" (and thus scratching the helmet) but I laughed my ass off. I mean this guy putting so much pride in his bike that his entire life revolved around and it was reduced to being humped by an 11 year old Rottweiler. My boyfriend started laughing and while we were trying to say we were sorry, we just couldn't control it. I shooed my dog away and the guy actually went into the kitchen and asked for dish soap to wash his helmet. As he was in the kitchen, I was laughing so hard I felt like I was going to pee my pants and my friend kept saying ""you guys are such fucking assholes. you're embarrassing him."" I managed to compose myself when he came back in the living room and he and my friend left. So AITA for that incident?

Now to today, my friend just called me and said that her guy just realized that my dog had left massive scratches in the helmet and he wants to me to pay him back. I told her that if Bubs really left scratches, then he would have showed us on Saturday after he spent 10 minutes with his helmet under running water with soap. So I don't believe him and that I refused to pay. I guess this guy is being such a douche he's sort of hinting that he won't go out with her again if I don't pay. I told her that really should be all she needs to hear about this guys character. She again told me I was an asshole and I embarrassed him. 

I can see in so many ways that I wasn't polite during this situation  and maybe I shouldn't have laughed. But it was funny so I think her words to me are a little harsh and I can't see any way I'm an asshole for not paying for the ""damage"" when he didn't show me the ""damage"" right away. 

But I guess I need some impartial judgment...AITA?

edit: I suck at grammar and hopefully found everything.

edit: well not sure if anyone is still reading this or not but figured i'd update anyways. I got to see pictures of the helmet and it looks as though it were scratched on concrete or by sandpaper. The damage is a wide spot maybe 1 inch at its widest and 3 or 4 inches long. There is no way that this came from a dog ""humping"" it for 5 seconds at the most. I honestly don't know how the damage happened or what he's trying to pull but even though there is no way my dog did the damage, it is completely outside the realm of possibilities that he missed this damage while he was washing the helmet. It's literally right in front of the visor thingie...I even think we would have seen it as he was walking out, the damage is that plainly obvious. And for him to contact us 4 days later...give me a break. I can rest very easy not paying this douchebag a dime. He wanted almost $1500 from me. Not happening. Let him take me to court if he's that convinced.",214,131,0.81

I (27 f) was recently left in a difficult financial situation when my ex of 5 years left me. My parents are helping me keep my place (through helping me with my mortgage), which I otherwise would not be able to do without their help. My mom texted me last night asking if I get long term disability insurance through my work (because if I don't, we will need to attach it to the mortgage). I didn't see the text until after 10:30 at night (I spent a good chunk of the evening cleaning and was not near my phone). I did read it, but decided to save responding until the morning (I fully admit my relationship with my mother is tense at the moment, as there have been MANY instances like this one, and many instances of her talking to my ex behind my back when I've asked her not to, and I just didn't want to get into an extended conversation with her late at night). Also, when I did not respond instantly, she emailed me as well. And sent it to me on Facebook. I also planned to email my workplace in the morning to double check (they respond very quickly), but my work email was not working in the evening, so I figured it would be better to save responding for when I could actually tell her what I'd done to find the answer to her question. When I woke up, I texted her to let her know what I was going to do, and sent off the email to work. When she responded she told me not to worry about it because she'd already contacted my union this morning to ask. I told her she was overstepping and being rude. She said ""Well I guess I am always going to be rude"" and that ""we are working against a timeline."" I pointed out that the timeline is not so short that it couldn't wait a single evening (which is very true, and besides, if I had responded, I wouldn't have been able to give her the answer until today anyway, given that the work office wasn't open that late, even if my email had been working). She said that I am I have called her rude and passive aggressive when she retreats (? not true, I have called her rude in a few situations, but she 'retreated' after, and 'retreat' for her is dropping passive aggressive comments to make me feel guilty, at which point I called her passive aggressive). I told her that her behaviour was hurtful, and she said ""I'm sorry that you feel hurt. Strange though that you can't see how much you are hurting others. I can't take much more.""

She's just been so angry at me lately, but she keeps going above my head in situations like this, rather than letting me deal with them myself even though I am an adult. I've asked her to stop treating me like this, to stop treating me like a child, but I get a similar response to the one above every time. Am I the asshole here? I don't want to drive her away, but I want to be treated like an adult who can advocate for myself.

Edit: To add on, I have expressed many times my gratitude to my parents for what they are doing for me. They are doing a wonderful thing for me, I just don't want my autonomy to be taken from me in the process.",32,46,0.97
917,Asshole,"My future sister-in-law, Fleur, offered to throw me a bridal shower, so I spoke with my friends, and Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Lavender, Parvati, Tonks, Angelina, Cho, and Minerva all said they could for sure go, other friends didn't commit which I was fine with since they told me upfront. Fleur also invited several family members, who all committed to going. I checked in with my friends multiple times and they said yes, they were for sure going and were so excited.

The day before the shower, Tonks texted me saying she couldn't go because she had to help another friend move. Then, the morning of, Angelina and Cho separately text me that they're not feeling well and can't come, and Ginny texts me that she got into a fight with her husband and can't come because she's too upset. While I am on my way to Fleur's house, Parvati texts me that she unexpectedly has to work late and can't make it, and then Lavender texts me and says that she's so sorry, but Parvati was supposed to be her ride, she is currently unable to drive due to an injury, and she can't afford to take a taxi.

Hermione, Luna, and Minerva are the only ones of my friends who made it. All of the family members we invited did come, so we still had fun, but to be honest, I was extremely hurt and embarrassed that more than half of my friends bailed the day of. They all said they would still give me gifts, but I would've rather they showed up with no gift than the other way around. I'm so upset that I don't want to be friends with anyone who bailed anymore, with the exception of Lavender since if she hadn't been counting on Parvati, she could've arranged another way to get there. I spent all day yesterday crying to my fiance and wondering why I don't matter to my own friends.

I'm especially hurt by Ginny not coming, because I have been friends with both her and Hermione for years and I consider them my closest friends. She is known to bail on people a lot last minute because she does have some health issues, but usually when she bails they're for more low-key hangouts and I thought she would surely not bail on this, especially since she wasn't even sick that day. She was supposed to give Hermione a ride because Hermione's car broke down, so Hermione took three buses and a Lyft to make it. I'm also particularly resentful towards Angelina, because I have helped her with some pretty major things, including writing a letter to a judge vouching for her character and finding her a temporary place to stay when she broke up with her ex.

Am I being unreasonable for wanting to cut them out of my life? The only people who know how I feel about this are my fiance and Hermione, I have not been able to work up the courage to tell the friends who bailed how upset I am, so I guess I wanted to get some unbiased opinions before I have those conversations.

920,Not the A-hole,"I have been letting my mom and her boyfriend use my car for the last few weeks. I had no problem with this really, because I was able to share my boyfriend’s car with him because we pretty much have opposite work days. 

Yesterday, I went to my mom’s house to do some laundry, and my little cousin asked me for his vape back (which I confiscated from him because he’s too young). The vape was in the glovebox of the car I lent them, and so I went to check if it was in there because I completely forgot about it when I gave them the car. 

The vape was not in the glovebox anymore, so I figured that they got it out and put it away, assuming it was my cousin’s (he’s been known to acquire them countless times). No big deal, I guess. Expect mild agitation they’re going through my glovebox. 

So I go into the house and ask my mom “Hey have you seen a white vape? It was in my glovebox” and she immediately starts yelling at my cousin, completely ignoring my question. This is usually what she does when she’s lying: yell at anyone she can. So I just redirect the attention to me and say it’s mine now because I took it from them and I am giving it back to my cousin’s friend’s mom, who I’m pretty sure they got it from in the first place.

She claims she has no idea and changes the subject. So I just go into the room where the laundry is and check the drawer where they always put vapes they’ve confiscated. Of course it’s there. 

So I ask her boyfriend (who’s been with her for 11 years) if he knows anything about it, he acts like I’m stupid for even asking. But I already know that it was most likely him, he’s gotten into my glovebox before and found lube I left in there and tells everyone in the world about it. 

At this point he’s  just straight lying to my face and going off on me. Accusing me of snooping in their drawer and saying he has no idea how it got in there. He ends up calling me a “stupid fucking cunt” and I tell them I’m taking my car back since they want to steal and lie about it. 



Okay, this is the part where I feel bad. I took the car back. But it’s the only car they have (besides my sisters who also lives there, but still needs the use of her car). I made sure my sister could drive my mom to work before I took the car. I feel like my mom should’ve defended me after he called me that, instead she just yelled at me and my cousin for starting a problem. Her bf has got dr appointments as well, but I honestly don’t care if he gets to them or not. It’s my mom I feel kind of bad for, but the lack of respect is what made me decide to take the car. 

I just don’t get why they lied even though it was so obvious to everyone in the house that the only one who would’ve taken it out of my car (that they were using) and put it into the drawer (in their bedroom).

921,Not the A-hole,"So I (19F) have this friend (19F), let's call her Taylor. Taylor recently acquired a hamster when her friend neglected it (she reported that friend to animal control), and before she got this hamster, she was saying she was going to give it to her dog to play with while the hamster was in the ball. I thought she was joking (stupid me, I know.) 

Then, yesterday, she told me ""the hamster's dead."" I asked her how, thinking that it died from the neglect or something. Nope. She told me she gave the hamster to the fucking dog and it played too hard, resulting in the hamster's death. I'm just on the fence about this because she's my good friend, but at the same time, her ignorance and negligence resulted in an animal's death and I'm not okay with that. I really, really love animals and I actually really loved that hamster and it just doesn't sit well with me that the first thing she did when she acquired this hamster was give it to her dog. I feel like she killed the hamster. 

So WIBTA if I reported her to animal control?

Edit: I reported her to animal control and they're opening up an investigation. I then told the original owner, Desiree what had happened and she's going to see about pressing charges. Desiree says that she didn't neglect the hamster and was trying to get the hamster from her parents when Taylor took it.

Mostly they are nature and abstract art. No one in my family really likes my tattoos, but it's not their body or their money so their comments never bothered me much.

Sometimes good tattoo artists have LONG waiting lists. There's an artist I've been trying to get an appointment with for years and recently his receptionist contacted me saying they had appointments available. I booked one and got a new piece a few weeks ago. It never occurred to me to think of the wedding before getting it done, and besides, I already have so many tattoos that why would one more make any difference? 

But my brother saw the tattoo in one of my social media photos and contacted me upset that my new tattoo will be a distraction during the wedding and in the pictures. The dress that he and the bride picked for the wedding party is short and strapless. I offered to wear a different outfit that covers more skin, but they also think it would be distracting for me to not match the rest of the party. 

I asked why my older tattoos didn't bother them but the new one did, and they said it's because they ""had to accept"" the old ones and thought I'd ""respect them"" by not getting any more. I don't really understand how it has to do with respect.

Two things are occurring that we are incapable of solving, or we do not have the time to devote to meet his needs:

* Anxiety - we recently had to put our other dog (a pug) down, and since then our beagle has lost his mind. He has ALWAYS had severe anxiety, to the point when we first got him 10 years ago we almost had to return him because he destroyed our apartment, cost us thousands of dollars and went through several different bouts of training. He slowly became better -- but never completely. Now it's become so bad that if my wife leaves to go to the grocery store he tears apart the house. He's always enjoyed his crate, but if we lock him up there he screams so loudly we're afraid animal services is going to be called. I gated him off from our daughter because he peed on himself this morning, and he's whining horribly as I type this. My next step is to get him on CBD treats, but don't know if that'll work.
* Physical limitations - he had a disk rupture in his back 7-8 years ago and had a major back surgery. They wouldn't have proceeded if he was older, but we decided to give it a go as he was relatively young. Cost us $10k+. Since this surgery he hasn't had full control of his back legs, and it's become degenerative as he's gotten older. He can run/walk, but he's got quite a swagger. The issue is he doesn't know when he's going to the bathroom. He has the muscle memory that when he goes outside he goes, but is now going in the house more and more -- and we can't have our daughter continually crawling around in carpet that's been peed and pooped on. We both can't continually watch him time-wise both inside and outside to make sure he's going.

We've enjoyed having him as a dog, but he's been very challenging his whole life. And we're both now almost resenting him 100%.

AITA here? I don't know what to do...he's not in a state to euthanize, although I know I'm a horrible dog owner for saying this I am waiting for the day we have to make that decision. He's also likely too old for us to get back into the shelter system.",149,60,0.76

He was a construction worker that was paid very good money under the table so we were able to still qualify for foodstamps, wic, welfare, etc... (and it's basically the only reason we ever had food because all the cash went to drugs and sometimes even the foodstamps were sold for cash)

The thing is, he was urine tested every few months for his job... He used to have me pee in ziploc baggies which he would then tape to his leg on the days he knew he would be tested.

They have been probably 10 years clean now, got their children back already (not me because I'm an adult now) and even had a few more since. They both are employed, pay taxes, etc...

I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL’s profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as “a vapid slut” and her husband “a pathetic cuck” along with other slurs I don’t want to repeat.

I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that’s too much.

We’re definitely concerned for our daughter about what’s happening at school and we’re looking into therapy.

Now to make this easier to explain, my Dad has been single since I was around 8 years old (I'm now 25). My Mam was never around she left us when I was around 4 months old as she was addicted to drugs etc. 9 months ago he started to date my fiancee's sister. My dad is 44, she is 42 I think. Now I think for starters this situation is wrong. When we are married and if they get married, she would be my son's nana/auntie and my 'nephew and niece' would then also be my brother and sister in law. 

I have been trying to get on with it and still be civil in this situation but since dating her, my Dad has changed into a completely different person. He isn't interested in seeing my son, he used to have him on a weekend to sleep and now doesn't even see him for half an hour. He has not seen him for 1 month.  When he does have him, he sits on his phone and lets my son who is 4 just run around and do whatever or makes him sit on the ps4.  He used to constantly take him ouy to the beach or park... His girlfriend stops my dad from coming round to see us, he's not allowed to help us with anything in the house etc like he used to beforehand, and she ""wants him home"" after work so he's not allowed to pop in on his way past. I live around 5 minutes drive away. His girlfriend does not like it if she hears anything from my dad's past life, if we joke and have a laugh she doesn't like it. I have now told my Dad that i don't want anything to do with them as it's taking a massive toll on my health.  On a daily basis I am becoming angry when my son says he misses grandad and my dad could not care any less. There is more information but I do not want to write a novel for you all...

So my question is, Am I the arsehole for telling him to just get on with his life with his girlfriend and we can get on with ours??


Edit: I will also add, my son being 4 obviously speaks alot, asks alot of questions and requires attention. She doesn't like him anymore. She gets jealous that my partners father takes our son swimming. She thinks he's the favourite grandchild so does not like him for that. She also told me when my dad did have him, she goes upstairs out of the way because she gets sick of him saying ""auntie?"" And wanting to talk to her.

Edit 2: I have given him many chances.  We have been on the phone today and it just blew up into a huge argument.  I have tried speaking to him about it for around 5 months and his exact words today were ""if you want to take a huff and not speak to me I do not give a shit, just letting you know"".  I will add to this also, when trying to make this better we had them round for a drink a couple of months ago which ended up in her getting hold of me and we were basically pinning each other to my living room floor which I was told to apologise for and my dad laughed about.",36,51,0.95
929,Asshole,"I’ve been with my boyfriend (let’s call him B) for three years, and he introduced me to his daughter last year (let’s call her E). It was rough at the beginning, she had a hard time accepting me, but it’s been getting better, although, she’s a teenager, so the weirdest things can make her blow up, one of which is when I try to get her to eat new foods.

I’ve cooked dinner at their place a couple of times. I like to try new recipes, like different types of pasta, Indian curries, Mexican food. Every time I cook something she hasn’t seen before, E would be hesitant to try it, but B would make her, and every time she’d try it, she’d claim she didn’t like it, then go and eat something else, like cereal or a sandwich. I admit, I get a little hurt when she doesn’t like what I make, but B told me it was normal, she’s a picky eater, he can barely get her to eat anything either. 

I started to try to find some foods that I think she would like, and I cooked them and wanted her to try them, but she recently snapped at me. She told me to stop trying to change her, said she would never like what I cook, and that it’s rude of me to keep shoving new foods down her throat when she clearly doesn’t like it. B did talk to her about snapping at me, but he also suggested to me that next time I should just make something that I know she’s going to like, something she has had before. I honestly thought it would be fun to try new foods, I don’t understand this breakdown.",472,891,0.93

Usually this isnt a problem because I typically go to bed an hour or so before her because I go to work very early in the morning so I'm asleep by the time she comes to bed. Occasionally she will come to bed at the same time and lay there looking at her phone. It pretty much lights up the room even at minimum brightness and makes it hard for me to get to sleep. Last night this was the case and after asking her to turn off her phone so I can sleep, she got all pissy about it so I told her ""If you want to be on your phone, please go downstairs, I am trying to sleep here"". She got up, grabbed her pillow, and walked out saying ""you know, this is bullshit, it's my bed too"" and slammed the door. She ended up sleeping on the couch. She texted me a few minutes later saying she just wanted to lay in bed, not be banished to the livingroom.

934,Not the A-hole,"So my mom and mother-in-law take turns watching my 4 year old daughter throughout the week. This Monday my mom told my wife and me that she's taking our daughter to the local water park. It's a big water park, and my wife and I haven't been there since we were kids. We weren't comfortable with our daughter going there with our parents because of how big it is, and the fact that we're unfamiliar with it. It would be fine with us if my mom took her there some day after we've gone to see it and are more comfortable with it.

When I told my Mom this, she was livid. First she said that I'm forcing her to break her promise to my daughter. I told her that she should have asked us if she could take our daughter to the water park before telling our daughter that they were going to go, and made sure we were okay with it, and if she had done that she would have known how we felt about it and wouldn't have promised to her that they would go.

 She also said that this means we don't trust her, but I told her that of course we trust her, we let her take our daughter lots of places. It's not that we don't trust her, it's that we're not comfortable with the water park and we want to check it out first.

Anyway, now my mom is still watching our daughter when we're at work, but she's barely speaking to us, and she's clearly still really pissed a couple of days later.

ETA: I forgot to mention that another part of the reason I'm hesitant is that (A) my daughter is afraid of slides, and (B) my daughter is afraid of loud noises, and (C) there's a local rec center we've taken my daughter to where there's a big bucket that occasionally splashes water all over the place, and my daughter is *fucking terrified* of that. I told my mom that I wanted to see the place first to make sure there's nothing like that which would stress her out, and she said she ""knows how to handle"" my daughter's tantrums/meltdowns, and I should ""trust her judgement"" about whether there's anything there that will stress her out.",174,455,0.94
935,No A-holes here,"Six years ago I was good friends with two classmates. Let’s call them Kirsten and Bette. After college I remained good friends with Bette but the friendship with Kirsten kind off ended when she had a baby and I started a busy job. Bette tried to get us together, but it wasn’t there. To be clear: at first I still called her and tried to stay in touch but she didn’t. I get having a baby is a lot, but my life was changing too (working 60 hrs a week). I didn’t have the energy to put into a friendship I was carrying alone. 

For two years we hardly spoke and only meet when Bette would arrange it. A few months ago I had a really tough time and Kirsten seemed willing to support me. Bette yet again arranged a meet up and for a few weeks everything was cool between the three of us. I got invited to Kirsten’s bachelorette party and her wedding. But the next month all the contact with Kirsten was initiated by me. Three times I asked Kirsten to hang out and three times she ghosted me. After that I stopped reaching out, because that doesn’t feel like friendship.

So for the last two months we didn’t talk except for the bachelorette party I still decided to attend, because I wanted show her I care. Note: it was very expensive to attend - so I feel like I put in effort. It was fun but Kirsten made some drunk comments that she didn’t talk to me because she didn’t trust me. I told her she can trust me and that I don’t understand why. She didn’t bring up that convo ever again, so I don’t know what the problem really was. Other than the party we didn’t text or call - because for once I didn’t initiate. 

A week ago Bette told me Kirsten had a reason why she doesn’t reaches out. She told this to Bette but she didn’t want Bette to tell me. I told Bette that I don’t like it that she is constantly in the middle. If Kirsten wants to address an issue she can do that by talking to me. I told her Kirsten doesn’t really feel like a friend anymore because of the ghosting and not initiating contact. I think it is disrespectful to ghost someone and you don’t do that to someone you call a friend. She was shocked but she agreed that she didn’t want to be in the middle anymore.

I told Bette that I’m not putting in more effort, but that I still wanted keep it civil and attend the wedding. But to be honest, after discussing everything with my mom today, I don’t want to attend the wedding. Why would I travel for two hours, get a gift and prepare an outfit for someone who ghosts me? Would I be the asshole if I didn’t go to Kirsten’s wedding? 

And if I decide not to go, how can I let Kirsten (and Bette?) know in a kind way? Because I really don’t want to be the asshole.

TLDR: a friend hasn’t been trying to stay in touch with me. Told other friend that she has a reason but that I can’t know the reason. She ghosted me, I stopped initiating, haven’t spoken for two months. I’ve tried but now I’m treated disrespectful and I’m uncomfortable going to her wedding.

Update: Bette was messaging me a lot about the wedding since she is looking forward to it. Felt it was time to make the decision because I didn’t want to slip up and tell Bette about my thoughts before I told Kirsten. Send Kirsten a message stating I won’t be attending because we haven’t been in touch and she’s been ghosting me. Told her this isn’t what a friendship should be like and it’s uncomfortable to attend her wedding while she ignores me. She turned it against me, that I should have spoken up if I felt neglected and that I’m going to miss out now. I told her I made my boundaries clear previously during multiple convo’s and that if she had a reason for not staying in touch she should’ve talked to me about it instead of ghosting me. She only responded that it’s fine I won’t be attending. So that’s it, her reactions made it clear she doesn’t care. Glad I ended it.",48,70,0.97

938,Not the A-hole,"My parents were incredibly strict helicopter parents. For the purpose of this, it shall suffice to say that I've barely survived it. I lived over 1000 miles away for over 20 years. I visit 4 times a year for 4-5 days but that is a limit to keep mentally sane and I spend time with a counsellor before and after to help me through these experiences where I feel treated like a personal asset. (eg. My dad complains when I have a rental car, because he knows I can 'escape' any time or will tell me exactly how to slice an apple I plan on feeding my mum.)

&#x200B;

My mother is in an advanced state of dementia.  She can still recognize me and my dad as well as those who see her frequently. She is physically unfit, she has been declared the highest level of nursing support available, cannot go to the toilet or even stand up of her own will. 

&#x200B;

My dad looks after every detail of my mother's life. He takes her to the toilet every 3 hours, takes her to bed, get up, feeds her, etc. 

However, he cannot leave her alone for a moment as she may get up and will then fall. So he takes her out when tending to the garden, hanging the laundry, to the kitchen when cooking food etc. 

&#x200B;

But he is also the control freak who will shout at her if she has a bad day, will keep telling her that if she does not help more when he is washing her that he'll put her in a home.

&#x200B;

Over the last 4 years, my mother has regularly been looked after by a very friendly nurse why my dad had hired to assist her. She too would be told how to slice an apple (or rather be told not to do it because the way she does it is of no use). He would tell her not to use her laptop (she studied for a part-time degree in nursing and has kids to talk to via Skype) after 8pm. Surprisingly she has lasted 4 years but eventually last week she decided to quit after my dad lectured her about how she had to bring up her son. 

&#x200B;

My dad now believes he can look after my mom by himself. This means no one will monitor the meals he feeds (I've seen him serve breakfast at 2pm because his very detailed prep just takes this long, following it by a slice of cake for dinner) her. It means he'll have to take her out every time he goes shopping (which means she may sit for an hour in car waiting for him to complete the shop as this is a place she cannot free herself from.), every time he walks the dog, ...

&#x200B;

I've spoken to pretty much every support place he can get and usually he rejects full-time help, but finding someone part-time like the nurse he had is very hard. 

The only way to force this on him would now be to call authorities, and to get a judge to review my mother's care. My dad got away with being the control freak, by having a lot of charisma. I fear he has a 60% chance of getting away with all this as none of these actions will be visible during a short inspection.

940,Asshole,"I (24F) work in a fairly large casual office. One of my coworkers (22F - ""Becky"") is a little lacking in the self care department. She often appears to have not showered and has a lot of dandruff and is constantly picking at her skin. She doesn't wear deodorant either. To my knowledge, these things don't really bother other people, but I guess it's also not something that people would really feel comfortable talking about. Her lack of self care doesn't really bother me very much, I'm just a little bit of a germophobe. 

We've been in the restroom at the same time a few times and she has consistently left without washing her hands. I know some people might not care very much about this, but it really bothers me. Sometimes she asks me for help with things at work and it makes me not want to touch her computer or mouse. 

The main issue with this is lunch. A few people in the office eat lunch together and sometimes do potluck style lunches. Becky started joining when she got hired. I really hate sharing food with her, so I started abstaining from the potlucks and just bringing my own food. She then asked for some one day and reached toward my plate. I got visibly uncomfortable and said no. Other people at lunch asked what the big deal was and I said I don't really like germs. They replied that everyone in participation washes their hands frequently, which then started the main problem. I said ""Well Becky doesn't, so I'd rather not share with her.""

Becky turned really red and left lunch early. After this, people told me that I was rude and shouldn't have said anything. I think that she should just wash her damn hands. Coworkers told me that I made a poor career move, but I just really hate germs! AITA for calling her out like this?",613,2857,0.96
941,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway.

I'm not a kid person. I don't have anything against them, I just don't have kids of my own, and don't want to have any. My roommate has an 8 year old son, but he does not have custody. He's still able to take him out to places (movies, theme parks, etc.), but his son does not live at the house with us so I'm totally fine with that. Now I barely know this kid (usually I see him when his mom drops him off, and then he gets in the car with his dad), but I do know that he is a lot to handle. He's an 8 year old demon to his father, let alone to me who doesn't like kids. But again, this has never been a problem since he does not live with us and I hardly see him.

Until this morning. My roommate wasn't here, he was stuck in traffic for almost 2 hours. He called me saying that his ex was dropping his kid off, and asked me to look over him until he got there. I said absolutely not. I don't know the first thing about kids. I didn't even know if it was crossing some legal grounds with their custody agreement or something like that. I told him that the kid needed to stay with his ex, but he said that wasn't an option, that he was supposed to have the whole day with his kid, and his ex wouldn't be back until the evening anyway. I repeatedly told him this wasn't going to work out but he basically hung up on me.

Low and behold, my roommate's ex pulls up and drops the kid off. I don't know his ex at all so I didn't feel like arguing with her, and I figured I'd just keep the kid in my roommate's room for a few hours. He didn't say a word, he just followed me right into his dad's room, I turned on the TV, shut the door, and I thought that was that. I was already extremely uncomfortable with the situation, and I was wondering if I needed to feed it or something. I did check up on him occasionally and he was laying in the bed, and I figured he'd do this for another hour or so until his dad gets back. I also called my roommate and told him this.

And then the kid starts fucking screaming. I rush in because I thought something happened, but from what I could tell it was just a tantrum. Not like a normal tantrum though, he started smacking the walls and knocking over everything off the shelves. I tried asking what was wrong but didn't get an answer. He wasn't in pain or anything, he was just...going crazy? I blocked the doorway because I sure as hell wasn't going to let it out of my roommate's room, it's his fucking kid and I shouldn't even be watching it. This is literally exactly what I was afraid of. I mean what was I supposed to do? I'm not going to touch him, I can't punish him, I literally had no idea what to do.

Anyway the icing on the cake was when he toppled over my roommates 32 inch TV, and I just watched it happen. I didn't do anything at all. The tantrum lasted maybe 10 minutes until my roommate arrived, and needless to say, he was furious. I basically told him to fuck off and to get his kid out of here. He did, and I'm wondering what's going to happen when he gets back. So am I the asshole?",236,472,0.94

The problem is, it is almost certainly going to be held at a bar. And my ID just expired and I haven't replaced it yet (I wanted to go last week but was very ill). And I cant find my social security card, so replacing it today may not even be possible.

I'm trying to explain why--logistically--I may not be able to attend. I don't understand why he can't tell the coworker who let the secret slide that he doesn't want to go to a bar (because I probably can't attend and he is insisting I attend).

My sister and her sister-in-law convinced me to go back to college to get my AA degree because I was stuck in a dead-end-job and they thought it would help me get something better.




At the time I was working at a daycare and making very little money.



They suggested I do online classes so I could still work full time. The only issue is, I couldn't afford internet or a computer. My sister told me not to worry, that I could go to her place when I needed to study or do homework. The school campus was about a 40 min drive from work and almost an hour from my home, whereas my sister's place was just down the street from my work.



I start school and a few weeks go by and everything seems to be going well. One day I texted my sister that I would be over after work to do some homework. She said that it wasn't ok for me to just assume I could come over whenever I needed to do homework and that I needed to ask permission; and that sometimes she and her husband didn't feel like having anyone over. 



I was a bit taken aback. So I decided not to push the issue and  from then on to just drive the extra 40 minutes from work to the campus and do my work there and then drive the hour home a few times a week. 




I'm still a bit salty about how everything went down. My sister convinced me to go back to school and assured me that I would have access to her computer and internet. But after a short time, that was rescinded when it was no longer convenient for her.

I will try to keep this as short as possible and I will also not go in to too much detail because frankly the memories are not pleasant.

From the moment I was born, to my parents divorce to when I turned 19 my father has never been a parent to me, he has been in my life the entire time but I have grown to see him as a close family friend instead of a father, I love him but not as a father, he was never been interested in my personal life, he has never been a role model, he has never thought me anything from shaving to riding a bike it was all my moms job and let me be clear there have been moments in my life where a male role model and some male advice would have made my life a lot easier, in fact I am sure it would have saved me from a lot of hurt.

However for the past two years my father seems to have gotten it in his head that he is suddenly entitled to put his nose in my personal business, school choices etc, basically stuff he should have bothered with the past 21 years.

Now I have mostly ignored his attempts but he keeps trying and honestly I just want to tell him to f*ck off, he didn't care about my life for 19 years and now that I am an adult and got my own shit in order he suddenly feels the need to behave like a dad? The point is he missed his chance and I will never see him as my dad, on the other hand he is trying I think and it may just be buried hatred for his failiure as a father influencing my distaste for his new found attitude, essentially he now feels the need to do it when I am an adult when I needed it when I was a kid?

956,Not the A-hole,"A bit of background

I first started practising martial arts as an escape, training mostly with law enforcement, military and a few professional fighters. As a teen, this made me open my eyes to a new reality as I met people with immense destructive potential that were in fact kind, patient and willing to teach me and drive me to push my limits, a far cry from what I was used to deal with.

I studied, unofficially, with my first instructor for about a year and then, officially, with another, for three more, and only dropped it when it became toxic in the gym, from demands and requirements that became incompatible with my wallet and my personal values.

Now, my ass hole episode.

Needing a way to recover from an injury, a few years back, I sought a way to regain my fitness after being deemed recovered and martial arts seemed a good way to do it. The only requirements I put up was being non competitive and non sport oriented. I found it but was I in for a treat.

The gym I found was an hour away for my home, give or take, driving, so I questioned in advance if only attending practice at the weekend would pose any problem. I also warned that I was recovering from an injury. No obstacles were raised.

Less than a month after starting, I was told that I was to attend seminars: events only held during weekends, always away, (our class was not eligible for hosting) and paid separately, while voiding scheduled and paid in advance classes.

Fast forward a year, more people have joined the gym, 90% of which have been promoted to 5th and 4th Kyu, some only a couple of months after joining. I stay as I joined. All the while this goes on, how and what is taught keeps getting watered down, to the point it was becoming a travesty. Me pushing new students to put some effort into their practice was considered out of order as well as I posing a doubt to a senior student or pointing some detail that could either hinder or block a technique.

After my second year and attending a seminar, which was the first my gym was hosted (a complete flop in my view as in an eight hour day we got about three hours of practice), things got dirtier. My instructor and seniors were more than willing to let me know I was the black sheep of the flock. Attending weekend classes was not enough. Not attending seminars, in or out of house, was disrespectful. Pushing others to do better was disrespectful. Making others think about their practice, pointing flaws, even if blatant, was a breach of etiquette.

Nearing my third year I was informed I was to attended a seminar for examination. I house. And pay for it. I declined. At that point, I did not care about advancing any more. I practised for the joy of practising and the peace and clarity of mind it granted me. As it should.

My instructor didn't took this well and informed me that ""he was the master and when a master says, the pupil does"".

I left.

1. We both paid for the dog initially. But he didn't go to the adoption, he just picked him out from the website. So all the paperwork is in my name and I paid for all vet appointments, vaccines, doggy day care, etc... Every single bit of paper work regarding Bax has my name on it. 

2. We live in Ocean Beach, CA where we don't really have ticks. The best we can guess is that the Airbnb  next door had a dog that brought the ticks in. I can grant that Brian didn't probably know what ticks look like, but if a dozen things that look lima beans are stuck to your dogs gums and ears, let along his entire body, it might be a good idea to do something about it. 

3. Believe me or don't but Brian never really cared for Bax. Liked him, said hello to him, etc... but never fed (unless I asked him to), never walked him (even though an awesome dog beach is about 3 blocks away) and missed two vet appointments I couldn't make (one to test for lyme disease relating to the ticks).

4. I cheated and I should have just broken up with him. I pretty much decided a year ago that I didn't want to be with anymore but I could not figure out how to do it because our lives were so enmeshed. 

5. I didn't run away with the dog, I brought Bax to my parent's house (who also love him) so we weren't there for moving out day. Brian knows where we are. 

I guess that's it...I'm still reading.

6. A couple people of asked why I got Bax after I’ve pretty much decided I was going to break up with Brian. The answer is Brian promised me that if we got a dog he would finally be happy, he would finally start exercising, he would finally start being involved in our house and our relationship again. And I really wanted to believe him


Edit: wow lots of hateful men here, not sure if any of you realize this...but...I didn't cheat on you. And of you are using my ex as a proxy for your own anger...maybe pick someone better? He was kind of an asshole.",1219,2080,0.85

961,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple of years ago and am still conflicted about it so looking for an outside opinion. 

Four years ago my good friend announced that she was engaged, since she only had a small ish friendship group she asked us all to be there for the wedding on the spot, no date set for the wedding, but of course we all agreed. 

Now I consider myself an amateur sportsman and play cricket for a local team with a bunch of my other mates. And every year we partake in a “cricket tour” of some part of the UK for anywhere between 3-7 days. It always takes place at some time in late June, early July. 

We book a lovely house in Wales (a 6 hour drive away) a year in advance to get time off work and to secure the house, pay my club, non refundable deposits etc etc. Arrange matches to play throughout the week and pre book/pay for activities like paint balling and go carting. 

Really looking forward to it because it’s my only holiday that year.

So I’m all geared up for tour with it only being 2 months away, and my friend approaches me to tell me that her wedding date has been set... 2nd of July... 

Right smack bang in the middle of my tour. 

So I told her there and then, sorry I’m on holiday with my mates that week and expressed my deepest apologies for not being able to make it. 

She was enormously offended by this, not outwardly but privately to other people that i then subsequently heard about. Because I wouldn’t either cut short or not attend my tour because it “happens every year” whereas she’s only getting married once. Which is a *more* than valid point. 

She even went as far as to passive aggressively “uninvite” me from her hen do by stopping updating me about it and not telling me the date. 

We basically haven’t spoken since.

Edit: To clarify, the gap between her engagement announcement and the eventual wedding date was a shade under 18 months.",57,293,0.95

963,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this to the point.

So basically my mum is pretty nasty despite her saying she's clean, she leaves her messes and expects me to clean up.

Now I don't hate cleaning at all but I get tired and miserable from doing the same thing over and over again, my brother is at home all day doing nothing and he's on his 30s he's more than capable to help as well, his excuse is that it's not his mess while mum's excuse is that he's on medication so he can't help, I've seen him wash up once and that's after mum complained about me refusing to do anything.

I would often deep clean the house and then tell her to keep it clean,she would dismiss me and say she will but the next day she would make a mess and not clean up.

An example is when I Polish the oven and stove and the next day she cooks curry and there's little drops of curry on the counter and stove, instead of wiping it up right away she leaves it to stain the surfaces. It took me 2 minuets of scrubbing with bleach to get that shit out.

The issue is that she now did a surgery so her dominate hand is disabled for God knows how long, which leaves me to deal with all of her messes, I would outright refuse but she  can't physically clean up again, I partly blame myself for pampering her and letting her become lazy but now I'm tired of it, but it would also be an asshole move to leave her with her responsibilities that she can't physically deal with herself. 

Tdlr; am I the asshole for leaving my mum to clean up after herself with a disabled hand after being her slave for years and getting tired of it.",33,48,0.91
964,Asshole,"So I'm a very rational person when it comes to money. Me and my gf are both students, I earn a bit of money through different online activities (low to middle 4 digit range) and get some from my parents, my gf only gets her money from her parents/her own savings. She used to work on the side as well, however she needed the time for her studies and stopped half a year ago. 

I usually split up everything we buy, e.g. going through the bill after buying groceries and calculating what exactly each one of us has to pay and what not. And I do that for every amount, from 2€ to 50€. EDIT: I only split up regularely occuring costs. I do invite her to dinner and that stuff and take over costs when its the end of the month. Also she still spends money on clothes and similar stuff that she only sends back when I talk to her about it. ANOTHER EDIT: I don't split 50/50 since I spend way more on food than she does. I pay for ingredients we need for dinner and I am the one as well who prepares and does the cooking, I just take out her optional expenses like sweets, drinks and generally stuff that I don't touch/eat, that is all hers.

Usually she's totally fine with that, however recently she got fed up with it. 
Now, my parents take over some of my costs when I ask them to do so to help me out. Most recently my gf told me how absurd it would be for me to write down every Euro she owes me from buying stuff while my parents pay my study fees (~250€ for 6 months) while she has to pay these fees by herself. She started generally using this explaination whenever I don't have to pay for something out of my own pocket while she does have to.

A few days ago it peaked when she requested me to pay  a bit more than half of our rent for the flat we share, since I can deduct parts of these costs from my taxes (I work from home).

I value money a lot and denied both her request, since they seemed very irrational to me, however like the doubtful human I am, I wanted to ask you guys. Don't hold back. Ty.",314,428,0.9

Edit/Update: Just got home from the appointment with the wife and MIL. I kind of opened up to her mom being there and everything was okay, until we heard the heartbeat.

969,No A-holes here,"So eight of us classmates (18-19M/F) are planning on taking a short weekend trip before the beginning of the next term.

One of those classmates is a gay guy T. who's best friends with almost all the girls in the group. He isn't close with any of us other guys. Even when we used to ask him to hang out after class, he always seemed intimidated or put off. I'm not the one to force someone to be my friend, so obviously we never pushed him.

I'm not sure why he has a negative vibe around us guys. We were never homophobic towards him, none of us holds those kinds of views anyway.

So we've been planning the activities for the trip in a group chat and I guess the rest of us guys instinctively assumed T. would want to hang out with girls more. E.g. the girls want to visit this famous shopping mall in center-city on the evening us guys will be going to a concert. There have been more such differences in group planning and we mentally put him in the majority girl group because those are his best friends he normally follows.

Anyway one of the girls told me in private chat yesterday that some of us are being rude by assuming T. doesn't want to do any activities that the guys are mostly interested in. For example, she told me T. told her in private that he's actually interested in the concert but that he doesn't want to ""bother us"" since we haven't asked.

I mean, it's sort of understood anyone can speak up at any moment of the planning and say: ""Hey, I'd like to do this instead"" or ""Sorry XYZ doesn't work for me, can we change it?""

I'm not a mind reader and it's hard to coordinate what each of eight people want already without someone not willing to express themselves. We counted T. in with the girls because that's his usual crew, I have no idea why he thinks he'd bother us by tagging along for the concert, but that's definitely not the case and he could've just voiced his mind.

AITA for this? Other people who didn't want to do an activity spoke up, I'm not sure why he didn't.",22,38,0.91

I’m 23 they are 18 
We both go to college and work part time at a local bakery. This is their first year of college and my last, I guess you can say we are both a bit stressed. 
Recently they’ve been calling in sick last minute constantly, or showing up late to work. Me and the older workers keep having to stay back or come in on days off to cover for them.
However the other day they just didn’t rock up at all, no message to say they are sick or unable to work etc. 
This screwed me and other my coworker over as they had been there all day and needed lunch, but you can’t have less than two ppl manning the store. So the 18 year was meant to come in and cover for them. 
I am fuming after the first half hour of them not coming in. As that means I will have to stay back an extra 4 hours and do the closing shift.
We call the manager who had just left telling them the 18 year old hasn’t rocked up. 
They try to get a hold of the teen and seem really pissed off about the whole situation.

My shift time ends but I have to stay because there is no one else to cover (I had some loose plans I had to cancel because of having to stay back). And my other coworker who had been there since 6 am had to stay back too. I rant a bit to my shift buddy,  saying some harsh things which in hindsight I regret. 

2 hours later I get a message from the missing coworker saying they forgot they had work today. 
I message back saying they are two hours late their excuse is bullshit and need to get here now. 
They rock up around the same time as the other kid on closing. 
They apologise and seem genuine, but I am too mad to care. I tell them that they need to grow up and that they can’t keep pulling shit like this. 
They look genuinely hurt and I felt kinda bad. I basically left after gruffly telling them I’ve told our manager about them being unreliable. The other kid also looks kinda shocked and embarrassed for them.

975,Asshole,"I am mum to a beautiful 20 year old called Lucy. She has just finished her second year at uni and is at home for the summer. 

My niece Jennifer is getting married in a few weeks time and we have of course been invited. 

Lucy is a very girly girl type person, loves getting dressed up and trying new clothes so she is very excited. 

Lucy has got bad vision and has worn glasses from a very early age. She has tried contacts a few times but hates them, both because high prescription contacts are uncomfortable, and also because she feels like she doesn't look like herself without her glasses. 

Lucy was helping me with some shopping yesterday and in the car ride home we were discussing the wedding, what we were going to wear, what we were doing regarding makeup etc. I made some suggestions to Lucy regarding hair/makeup, but also (maybe thoughtlessly?) suggested she could maybe try contacts. Soon as I said this she gave me a look and was quiet the rest of the car journey. She went upstairs as soon as we got home. 

I didn't see her until dinner time, and when I asked what was wrong, she asked why I ''told'' her to wear contacts, and asked if I was ashamed to have a daughter who has to wear ''thick'' glasses. She then took off her glasses and tried to eat her dinner without them. Within a minute or so she was clearly struggling and was close to tears, and asked her dad to get her glasses for her, and she took her food and went to eat upstairs. 

My husband was annoyed with me, asking why I had to suggest contacts to her when I know she doesn't like them. In my defence it was just an impulsive suggestion that came out without even thinking. I have nothing against her glasses and think Lucy is beautiful with or without them. It was just a suggestion to see if she'd like to try a different look.

UPDATE: I had a heart to heart with Lucy earlier today. She broke down crying and admitted that she thinks that I don't like her glasses. That's not true at all and I told her that I only brought up contacts as one of many things she could experiment with for this wedding. I told her how sorry I was for being thoughtless. I know that she's worn glasses for so long that they're a part of her now, and even if they weren't contacts are uncomfortable. I held Lucy while she cried and she made me promise that I would never, ever mention contacts to her again, even at her own wedding, and I swore I wouldn't. I'm the asshole. I was insensitive and spoke without thinking. I knew she didn't like contacts but said the first thing that entered my head. I won't bring up contacts to her again.",1304,4393,0.94
976,Asshole,"A few months ago, my friend came to my place to show off his new power washer. We cleaned some really dirty things with it and I decided it would be a good idea to write ""No Parking :)"" on my driveway with the power washer.

Recently, I moved out of that place and rented a room near my university (tired of driving so far away everyday, basically). My previous landlord contacted me, wanting reimbursement for ""defacing"" his property. I don't think I've defaced anything, but he said the writing can drive potential residents away. I explained that it was basically ""cleaning"", not ""defacing"" (because I used a power washer) and told him to just clean the whole driveway with a powerwasher. He still told me to fix it or reimburse him, but I can't because my friend sold his power washer already and I'm a broke student. I just told him no.

AITA?

Edit: I should add that I cleaned a bunch of other stuff the landlord failed to clean (fence, mucky outdoor tiles, outdoor furnitures, etc) and basically made them sprakling-new. I didn't have to do all that, but I just wanted to make my living space nice to live in. Can this balance it out, somehow? I know that from this post I'm TA, but I cleaned and maintained things the landlord doesn't give a shit about without anybody paying me, so I can say I did him a small favour.

I'm 19F sharing an apartment with 3 other girls (20-24).

We're pretty sure that one of the roommates, I'll call her Kate because why not, has some sort of a disordered eating issue. She blames her problems with food on poor digestion but we know she binge eats, although she tries to hide her stashes, and the frequent throwing up just screams bulimia to me.

Kate often eats and throws up really late at night, when we're all sleeping or at least trying to sleep. It's pretty loud and honestly gross, and the vomiting-toilet flushing can last for up to an hour.

Don't even get me started on the smell the next morning, even though she does clean up and open the windows. Vomit is just a stench that lingers.

Trust me, we'd all like for Kate to get help, but she's an adult and you can't force someone to talk or change their behavior if they don't want to.

She does this stuff couple of times per week usually, otherwise she's a quiet person who doesn't give anyone trouble - she pays bills on time, does her chores etc. None of us wants to throw her out, but we want her to take her ""business"" elsewhere because it's interfering with all of our lives.

If she won't stop, she could at the very least throw up in her room which is further away from other bedrooms and the stench would stay there.

I paid cash, and the attendant went into the station to deal with the transaction. When he came out, I noticed he was putting the 89 gas nozzle into my car instead. I immediately tried to tell him that I paid for 91, but he wasn't paying attention. I yelled a bit louder and another employee (who looks like the manager) pulled the nozzle out. By that time, about $5 (give or take) of 89 had been pumped into the car. The manager went into the station to deal with the error, and started pumping 91. When it was finished, I was surprised I only got \~$15 of 91. I told the manager, ""I wanted $20 of 91"", and he said, ""You paid for $20 of gas, and you got $20 of gas"".

Things were fine, until I got the lead on the (bass) guitar of my dreams being sold, for an outrageous price. The guy only had time yesterday, when the date was gonna take place. I had a fair bit of anxiety, but realized I couldn't pass up this guitar, since this opportunity most likely is a once in a lifetime thing. 

I've always got a fair bit of money stashed away for gear purposes, and off I went to get my dream guitar. It was beautiful, played great and I bought it on the spot. I hurried back to the place we were gonna meet, only to be met with Alyssa, all dressed up and super pissed. 

She noticed my guitar case, and was like ""So this is what you pick over me, huh?"" and just walked away looking pissed. I went home, tried my new guitar out. She texted me not long after going ""you're such an asshole, I was looking forward to this so much, and you blew it.""

She went on a tirade about how she's apparently had a crush on me since last year, and how I'm just a self-absorbed asshole for picking (my dream guitar since childhood) over her. I tried saying sorry but she hung up. I'm thinking about letting her cool off and asking for another date.

I started going to therapy and working two days a week, but the moment I come home I will still crawl right into bed. I just have no energy. 

My 17th birthday was a few days ago and my mom was asking if I wanted a party, she thought it would be good for me. I told her several times that no, I don't want a party, pretending to be totally fine and happy is exhausting. Especially with that many people around. 

But when I came back from work and opened the door, the house was filled with people. (Maybe 10% family I'm not close to and 90% my moms friends). I didn't know what to do so I walked back out again, I grabbed a slice of pizza somewhere and walked around the park, hoping that when I came back they would be gone. 

While at the park my phone blew up with texts from my family and mom, that I was ungrateful and spoiled and didn't deserve nice things they tried to do. 

I came home about two hours after I left the party, my mom was super pissed. I tried to explain but she thinks it's just excuses. 


Was I the asshole? My mom is still not speaking to me, and I do feel bad that she went though all that effort for nothing.

I recently had to leave to housesit my best friend’s family’s house for a week. I called and reminded her to try to keep the apartment somewhat clean. She said she’s got it and essentially to quit badgering her. So I trusted her.

After that week, I came home to cat food all over the floor, there was chinese food in a box that had clearly been sitting there for a week, three garbage bags that she just never took out to the dumpster, you name it. The apartment was destroyed. 

To top it all off, I went to throw away yet another bag of food that she left, and there were maggots and fruit flies swarming out of it, so now there’s another issue. 

I just spent the past 4 hours cleaning our apartment and it is no where NEAR clean. I am at my wit’s end. My best friend (24m) is looking for a roommate and now we are apartment hunting. I feel awful for leaving her to live alone, but this whole situation is making my anxiety and depression much much worse, and I have talked to her about this over 20 times and every time I do she gets irate and starts yelling and asking why I am ONLY blaming her for the messy apartment. 

There are liquor bottle stains, fruit flies, food everywhere. It’s ridiculous. In her room, she has massive amounts of fast food bags, ice cream tubs, taco bell wrappers, 2 liters of pop that aren’t finished.

so I sometimes like to run a bubble bath and lounge with music for 30 minutes and just relax, kate decided to start messaging me and she asked me what I was up to. 

so i sent her a photo of my knees in the bath surrounded by bubbles (no dick in site) with the caption BATH TIME in all caps. 

did not think much off it until my girlfriend went on the shared I-pad and saw the photo (I forgot to log out) and is now incredibly pissed at me. 

AITA?

993,Not the A-hole,"Today I had just about had it. 

I work from home and live in a house with roommates, and I loathe the entire situation. We're moving out September 1st and it couldn't come soon enough. Usually the days are fine minus some craziness from the four dalmations left in the house, but occasionally someone (roommates tinder date, or most commonly - the roommates family members) will stir about. 

Sometimes it's fine when the mom comes, even if it is just a little crazy that she comes in as she pleases. I just keep my door shut and try to avoid communication. But recently (mom is a contractor) she has been doing renovations on the house during the weekdays when I work. This is not okay, and I've never been given notice. The last time it happened she was told it wasn't okay, but clearly disregarded that memo.

Today, I'm extremely sick with a cold but had put off some deadline work that needed to get done. No biggie, until I see three giant vans careen down the street and park in the driveway. 

Long story short, they immediately begin hammering, about 4-5 people, into the walls and ceilings. I went out to get some food delivery and was greeted, and I just rolled my eyes.

An hour later, the power goes out in the middle of work. I am a web developer and many of my connections rely on a stable internet, which is why I pay the bulk of it's cost. So the router is shut off and lo and behold, about an hour of data entry is gone. I brush it off to be non confrontational, until two hours later it happens again, when I was napping. No harm no foul, but I prepared what I would say if it happened a third time. They were quiet and I was unsure if they were still there, but an hour later while I'm redoing all of my work from the first time, the power goes out again.

I go out and said ""can you PLEASE alert me if you're shutting the power off? It would only take you a second. You know I'm here and it's unfair that I have to keep redoing my work.""
He replied ""you don't own this house. I don't care if you're working or not."" Dumbfounded by a clear as day asshole, I started screaming (frankly losing my shit) for him to get the F out, and started throwing his and his buddys tools out the door. He then calls the mom, who says they can continue working and I get no reprise.

Later, my roommates sister drops in trying to be funny to me about the situation and I basically unloaded on her about the worker and the mom, and she said she's glad it happened because IM the asshole.

994,Not the A-hole,"Using a throwaway just in case. Before you sharpen your pitchforks please read for the full context. 

I (22F) have been dating my BF (23M) for 2 years. In that time I have befriended his childhood friend Chris (23F) and his girlfriend Jessica (23F). Chris and Jessica have also been dating for roughly 2 years. 

Before I knew Chris he was dating another girl we will call Rose. Apparently their relationship lasted just short of 3 years until Rose broke up with Chris to date another guy.  According to my BF, Chris was pretty torn up about it until he met and fell for Jessica at a party. 

I obviously never met Rose. Up until recently I had no clue what she even looked like. Never crossed my mind to bother asking my BF or Chris because I know Rose is in the past. 

Anyway,  so I was at Chris and Jessica's place with my BF and my BF was scrolling through old photos on his laptop showing Chris, Jessica and I photos of their ski trip from 2016. 

So my BF is clicking through and there's this photo of a ridiculously attractive girl arm in arm with Chris. 

I was like ""Wow,  who is she?"" thinking she was a hot ski instructor or something but Chris tells me it was actually his ex. 

Surprised,  and with my foot in my mouth,  I blurt out that's she's drop dead gorgeous ... and of course,  I immediately regret saying it. 

Jessica quickly leaves the room and Chris mutters ""f**k,  thanks a lot"" to me and follows her out. My BF gives me a look like ""why the hell did you just say that? "" and I'm just sitting here dumbfounded by my own stupidity. 

We can hear Jessica crying hysterically in the bedroom so my BF and I wait around 10 minutes and then we see ourselves out and drive back home.

I've tried calling Jessica to apologise,  I've also tried messaged her,  but she's just not answering anything from me.  

My BF has been in contact with Chris and Chris is angry. He says his GF is actually very insecure about his first girlfriend Rose and he thinks I'm an absolute asshole who was trying to stir up drama and drive a wedge in their relationship. But in all honesty I was just shocked at how ridiculously good looking this Rose person was ... like when you see an insanely attractive supermodel and you're like ""wow, people that actually exist!""

Of course I do recognize that I'm an idiot but I don't think I'm an asshole. I understand that Chris and Jessica are upset with me,  but at the end of the day all I was saying was that Rose was gorgeous (not that she was a better girlfriend or a better person or anything like).  Plus,  I do feel bad and I'm trying my best to patch up things with Chris and Jessica.

995,Asshole,"Last night was a goodbye party for a friend (she was moving out of state). I was excited to only have my two youngest with me and getting a little bit of a ""break"". As the server is delivering the food (and all the chaos that comes with that) my 3 year old decided to stand up and touch one of the recessed lights burning his hand. I tried everything to calm him down ice water, even went out to the car and got some burn cream from my first aid kit, which was brand new and had to bring it in to use the restaurant's scissors to cut the package open.

Not once did any of the staff ask he was ok or what happened. When i explained to the front desk lady what happened she just gave a sympathetic nod and then scurried away. He was crying so hard I had to ask for to go boxes and the bill. They didn't even offer to help me box it up. Thankfully one if my friends was able to coax the wailing, drooling, snotty kiddo out of my arms so I could box everything up.

Now I'm not looking for a free meal, I should have been paying more attention to him and realized he was standing in his seat, but the lack of concern frustrated me. Especially since the bill came out to $41 for two kids meals and my food, and I lost out on a good bye dinner for a friend along with being stared at by every patron in the restaurant.

Anyways, he spends about 45 minutes taking things apart and putting them back together. Long story short, the damn mower was out of gas. I am a fucking moron and deserve all of the possible shit for that alone. 

I ask the guy what his hourly wage is and he says 60 for heavy machinery. But he also tells me that my mower isn’t heavy machinery and that he didn’t think that (small engines) warrants the same wage (but didn’t specify a wage).

So I hand him a fifty and ask if that’s fair. He says, “yes,” but in a tone that I perceived as a bit disappointed, or perhaps frustrated. Could have definitely read that wrong as well. 

I know most techs round up per hour. Especially for the first hour and some others charge a service fee just to show up. (He didn’t say anything about that, but I didn’t really ask him either). 

Now I’m worrying that the guy thinks I took advantage of him because he was a friend-of-a-friend type.

1000,Everyone Sucks,"This is a new situation for me, and I can't find anything like it anywhere. I come from a community where infertility is very common. My adoptive parents couldn't get pregnant and adopted me. My husband's parents adopted him and his brother after they couldn't get pregnant. My adoptive mother's two sisters also couldn't have children, nor could my adoptive father's adoptive mother. My biological mother and my adoptive mother's parents have passed. I do not know of anyone in my immediate or close extended family who has ever had a biological child.

I got married, and I was so much expecting problems that I was shocked to get pregnant. I'm in the second trimester, and things are going routinely. To emphasize the main 'thing' here is that **I am the first woman in two generations to have a pregnancy in living memory**.

Naturally, I try to be sensitive but apparently I'm ""milking"" it by complaining of my various (normal) illnesses and problems. They say that I'm making it up and that it's not that bad. After months of this from everyone, I ended up blowing up at a family dinner and asking a room full of barren women how the hell they would know how bad I was feeling and WHAT pregnancy even feels like.

However, it was expressed to him that when school started again he would be able to keep the job under the conditions that no grade drops below a C and when school started there would be no working after nine on a school night.  Throughout the message has been that school comes first.

Fast forward to two weeks ago and he was reminded he would need to talk with his boss and tell her he could not work past nine on a school night.  He said he would and I dropped it...

Fast forward to one week ago and he was reminded he would need to talk with his boss and tell her he could not work past nine on a school night.  He said he would and I dropped it...

School started today and I reminded him that after work I would drop him off and pick him up at nine.  He said he couldn't get the schedule changed online and was getting off at eleven.  I told him he was supposed to have this worked out with his boss and he confessed he hadn't talked to her yet about it.  My response was basically 'well, you screwed up, you knew in advance and the rule is no working after nine on a school night. I don't care what the deal is, I will pick you up at nine.""

9:00 rolls around and I am sitting in the parking lot waiting.  I went in, tried to talk to the boss who said ;well I don't have anyone else and I can't change the schedule until nexr week so he has to stay.' to which I replied the it was his first job, he screwed up and made a mistake, but no matter what, school comes first and he is not working after nine and she needed to go get him.

It got a little heated but in the end, he did come with me and was EXTREMELY pissed about it.  I reminded him the situation was of his making and if he had just told her in advance, there wouldn't have been an issue. I asked him how long I would have been waiting out there if I hadn't come in and he said ""Until 11:00.""  Yeah, not going to happen, folks.

So, AITA or should I have let him ride out the week and started 9:00 off-work next week?

Edit:  A couple of clarifications here.  I did not go in there spouting off.  I went in and politely asked to talk to here, suggested we sit down for a moment, and when I explained that after 9:00 was not acceptable she started getting bitchy.

I have been very hands off about this job all summer.  He found the job, he has done marvelously at it and I am VERY proud of him.  But TBH I will put his education above a fast food job any day.  School and grades come first.  He wants to be a pilot and with the grades he got last year that probably will not happen unless he understands that.

Edit:  Here is my last on this then I am out.  I will admit I could have handled this situation better.  Yes, I was an asshole.  As one person suggested, I might have called the manager ahead of time and talked on the phone about it, but honestly I feel her attitude would not have been different.  What I am about to write does not detract from my assholiness. I also feel however, that many responses here are made by younger people who are barely out of their teens themselves and have not had the privilege of raising teens themselves.  The kid was pushing this on purpose, IMHO to see if I was serious about the work limits and needed to know that I was.  Wrong or right, it was coming from a place of educating him about my commitment, how he treats other people, and how to act in the future.

At any rate, there is nothing left to do at this point but move on.  I will not revisit this thread after this.  Thank you for all of the people who offered helpful advice.",193,74,0.75

My mother and I are co-hosting an event soon and she asked if my husband would please grill all the burgers, sausages, etc ""because he's such a fantastic chef,"" which is true. He and I are both vegetarian and she knows this (it's been a deal). Without consulting him, I told her he would happily grill vegetarian burgers and sausages, but he wouldn't touch meat. She blew up at me. Said things like how it's so hypocritical that we make a ""big show"" of being accommodating and respectful of other people's lifestyles, choices and values, but can't respect that some people eat meat and accommodate that for a few short hours. She also mentioned that my dad, who has been sober for about 10 years, will ""be just fine with alcohol being at the party."" I asked her if she'd be asking my dad to bartend, and she replied, ""well, no, of course not."" I said that asking my husband to grill meat when he has moral/ethical reasons for not eating meat is in the same vein as askng my dad to bartend. I also told her that it was pretty rich that she said we make a big deal of being so accommodating and respectful of other lifestyles when she is telling me she is basically refusing to respect mine.

A friend of mine posted about his job in the area that’s looking for a dishwasher (it’s a minimum wage, part time, food service job). My friend told me the job would be horrible for her but that they’d be immediately hiring.

My sister never does chores, much less dishes. I wouldn’t either when I lived at home, but I did them more than her. She would constantly give me shit for being lazy and never doing chores, even though she not only didn’t do any but made more of a mess than I did.

I told her recently (after I’ve been doing minwage jobs since I was 17) that I don’t think she would be able to handle getting a minwage job because of all the cleaning. I told her this coming from a place of “it was hard for me, it’ll be hard for you, here’s a warning” but she got incredibly defensive and turned it onto me being lazy and how she’s nothing like that.

I asked if she would mind picking child up from care on Fridays at 4:30 & stay at home with child until 5:15 so that she had enough time to get to work. Said it was fine, asked if I was doing extra study. I said no I wanted to join gym, it was for “me time”. Mum commented that I get enough “me time” at uni & if I wanted to go to the gym I should go during my study hours instead.

Full time study is meant to be 40hr/week (lectures & self directed combined) Currently I’m in lectures for 16, I have 8hrs of study time at uni either between before or after lectures & I travel between daycare & uni takes 4hrs/week. My extra study hours are when child day naps or goes down for night. I was planning to gym 3x/week for an hour each time, limiting loss of study/extension of child’s hours @ care. 
Daycare hours would extend by 1 on Monday morning, we would use the gym crèche on Thursday because that’s our home day, & Friday I could have extended daycare hour by 1 but I asked Mum instead thinking she would want to as she is usually visiting us around that time anyway.

We were watching TV together when we saw Pans Labyrinth was on a channel and it just started. I knew it was rated R but I figured he was more than old/mature enough to see a rated r movie right? I know its 17+ technically but in my head I thought 14 years old was definitely old enough. At that age I had already been exposed to a lot of 'mature' stuff and so did most of my friends.

1010,Not the A-hole,"Ever since I was a kid, I absolutely loved cars. In a city not far away (maybe an hour or so drive?), there was a car factory. A family friend mentioned that they had tours. I asked my mom if I could go. She said ""sure"" initially, but when she looked up the requirements, it said there was a minimum age.

A few years passed and I finally reached the minimum age. I remembered about the factory and asked my mom. It was around this time that I wasn't doing as well in school as my mom wanted. So she said ""ok we'll go during the school year but ONLY if you do the following this summer...."" What followed included having to read 10 novels, writing reports on all of them, and doing some reading comprehension exercises from a workbook. It was impossible. I already had trouble with reading comprehension and reading speed and I could barely even get to 6 novels by the end of the summer. I wrote reports on some of them, but a lot of the books I could barely understand. There were a lot of tears involved. The summer ended and I didn't meet her requirements and so she told me I couldn't go to the factory. A similar thing repeated the next 2 or 3 summers - a promise to see the factory as long as I somehow pulled through with her ridiculous conditions that were impossible for me. Eventually I gave up and realized it was stupid to think I could have gone at all.

Many years later, I'm in college and still love cars. A few weeks ago, I remembered the factory tour. I realized that I'll be home for my birthday and that it would be a perfect time to go. I also remembered those summers filled with fake promises and I decided that I'd go on my own - without my mom. Just today, my mom remembered about the factory tour and said ""hey, we should go on that."" I told her that I'll be going alone for my birthday. She was a bit surprised at first and asked why. I first didn't want to tell her because I did not want her to feel like she was a bad parent. This car factory thing was just a small mistake - otherwise she raised me well and fairly. Eventually though, she kept prodding and I revealed everything. I told her that because it was my desire from the start and considering how she had stopped it back then, I wanted to go on my own and have it be my own moment. This has upset my mother a decent bit. I told her I won't be changing my mind on this unless given a good reason.

My sister is saying that I'm being petty. She says that our mom made this mistake a long time ago and I should get over it by now.  But I feel like what she did back then was pretty bad and I'd rather not be reminded of it while in the car factory. I'd rather just be alone there at the factory than have my mother with me - the one who prevented me from going in the first place. I feel like I have the right to be mad about this.

1012,Not the A-hole,"So, I have a now 8 year old son, and he’s an absolute joy. He’s mild, polite, and really shy, and has a hard time making friends at school, even though he’s pretty sporty. He is in a Catholic school and I’m the one who looks after him before and after school while taking night shifts for work, when the wife gets back from her job. 

Onto the story. As I said earlier, my son is very mild and shy, and has a really hard time making friends. Despite this though, he’s really come out of his shell and has a tight-knit circle of friends he’s been with since entering the school. He has 5 close friends in this rather large school, and they stick together like glue, with frequent visits to each other’s houses after school.

Last week, it was my son’s birthday, and it happened to fall on a Thursday, meaning he’d be in school for the day if I decided not to pull him out. He had a party scheduled for the weekend, and all of his friends were going to accompany him to bowling, laser tag, and pizzas. Of course, as the ‘Favourite’ parent I offered to let him stay home for the day so we could go out together for the day, but he said that he didn’t want to miss school. 

I decided to learn how to make cupcakes, so he’d have something to take in to school for him and his friends. I was a somewhat capable cook, but I got alot of practice in over the year. So the day before his birthday, I spent the day baking and experimenting, and the fruits of my labour were 7 fist-sized chocolate cupcakes, practically glazed in icing, cream, and lollies. I had half of one to taste test, saving the other half for the missus. 

The following morning, on his birthday, after having a family breakfast, and hiding the cupcakes in the car, I dropped my son off to school, busting out his surprise just as he was about to toddle into school as an 8 year old for the first time. His face lit up when he saw the size of these balls of baked chocolate, and I told him he had one for each of his friends so he could share it with them at recess. With a big smile and a big platter, he toddled off to his friends, and I left to get ready for his family dinner, which I took the night off to attend. 

Everything was fine, until I got to the school that afternoon to pick my son up. He had the empty platter, but a downcast expression, so I knew something was up the moment I saw him. It turned out some of the students complained about not getting a cupcake to the teacher, who then threw out all 6 of the cupcakes I slaved away over stating that ‘Students should share, or not bring it in at all, its not fair to all your friends!’. For the record, my son never interacts with ANY of the students beyond his friends, and tends to keep to himself, hence the reason I only made the cupcakes for him and his friends. 

Tldr, I made cupcakes for my son and his friends, but not his entire class of 30. AITA?

Edit: Because it was asked in a comment, other parents have done this in the past without any repercussions. My son has mentioned it before that his classmates would exclude him from similar celebrations, but that it was fine to him because he didn’t know them that well",44,30,0.92

Therefore, our budget is only $3k and by god I am not going above that no matter what I have to cut out. Well, my parents (mostly mom) generously offered to add $2k to my budget because although they understand my position they want to help where they can. I resisted at first, but they were both pushy and insisted they wanted to help their only child with her wedding so I caved in. 

With more money my mind instantly went to find a quality photographer, something impossible in this area for $500 - my previous budget. I did research and I found a *fabulous* photography team, gorgeous work, videography included too, just my dream style photography. I put the down deposit down because they fill up quickly and I was scared I'd lose them. If there's ONE thing worthy blowing big bucks on for me, it's a photographer. 

I went to my mom thinking she'd be happy but she looked aggravated. Apparently I was supposed to know the $2k was for a *dress* bc it's tradition that mom and daughter dress shop together. In my mind I think ""$2k for a dress I wear ONCE?! And will collect dust in my closet or will be sold at MAYBE half its original value?! What a waste"" but I did not say that, I responded that I thought a photographer would be better worth the money and would give us better memories and overall better bang for our buck rather than a dress. Besides, I found a gorgeous dress online I love and have already in a shopping cart waiting to buy and alter for only $200 

Well.. mom got huffy with me and is upset I even suggested spending her gift on something *other* than a dress. She's also upset that she'll be missing out on the dress shopping experience with me. I kind of awkwardly left her house and haven't spoken to her since yesterday afternoon, but a couple of her sisters have messaged me and told me it would be rude to spend the money on anything she didn't want to spend it on and I should've assumed she'd decide what to do with the money since it is a gift. I can't get the down deposit back either, so I'll lose $500 if I cancel and spend the remaining $1500 gift on a dress.. which seems like MORE wasted money to me. 

AITA for spending the money on a photographer and not wanting to cancel the photographer and continue with my mom's dress dream? 

TL;DR - got money for wedding planning, spent on photographer, found out gift was for a dress, stuck between canceling photographer and losing $500 down deposit or disappointing mom who gave me the money",38,30,0.91
1015,Not the A-hole,"For background My sister (36) and I (22) were extremely close before all of this. She essentially took care of me and was like a mother to me for the early part of my life (My mother was there but not really as she worked all the time)

&#x200B;

Fast forward, I'm now 20 and living on my own, I've fallen on hard times and have to move immediately. My mom's house is not an option because of how small it is with my stepfather there. I don't know what to do and my sister clicks to me. I call her and she talks to her bf (32), since it's his place. He agrees and I move in with them. I don't plan to stay long and immediately start looking for a place. While I'm there, I contribute to groceries, household items and clean as I feel like I should pull my weight. In fact I'm the only one who buys groceries because all their money goes to pot. I have to buy groceries for myself twice and hide the second portion because they eat like they've never seen food before and are constantly borrowing money from me and not paying it back. I feel bad to say no. I complain to my mother but she just brushes it over. Now, I never enter her room without her knowledge whether home or not unless invited. I stay in my room, go to work and back to my room.

&#x200B;

I get home one day and notice that things are not exactly where I left them. I'm a tidy person so I know. I say nothing and go about my business. I notice this happening a couple times, like coming home to my TV being on, pocket change missing $5s and $10s, stuff like that. I tried speaking to her about it but she became offended, I'm not confrontational so I dropped it. I finally find a place and let her know I'm moving. I go out the that night but before I left I took the cable cord to my TV with me (kinda petty I know but it's mine, I bought it) so that she wouldn't be able to use it while I wasn't there. I feel like if she wants to use it she should just ask instead of sneaking around. I get home and wake up the next day (moving day) to my sister cursing loudly. I listen carefully and realize that it's aimed at me. I'm so confused but I hate conflict so I say nothing and pack my stuff. I hear her on the phone with a friend of ours ""So fucking ungrateful, she has to hide her stuff from me? Of all people? Me? That bitch!"" and ""she thinks she has a fucking maid around here, I'm glad that bitch is leaving"" stuff like that, really obscene. I'm hurt but I steel myself to packing as fast as possible and just moving out. I left without saying a single word. I've never spoken to my sister since.

&#x200B;

It's been 2 years and she has since tried to talk to me but refuses to acknowledge the situation and won't apologize as she doesn't see what she did wrong. I refuse to let her gloss over what she did and won't speak to her because she really hurt me.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend and I tend to watch movies as we eat dinner most nights. I really enjoy this, but the only problem is it usually takes until we’ve finished eating to decide what movie to watch. (My girlfriend can be very picky and indecisive, which can be cute until it gets to a point where it impedes on our plans.) So last night I decided to skip the usually 30+ minute decision period and immediately put on a movie as soon as we sat down. I didn’t ask her what she’d like to watch or tell her the decision I made – the movie simply started playing. She asked about it and I told her not to worry and that she would really like it. She got really upset and told me to turn it off. She refused to even watch five minutes of it or give it a chance simply because I chose it without her. I think her reasoning for getting upset is silly, especially because I know her taste in movies (and every movie I’ve gotten her to watch she has really enjoyed). 

&#x200B;

We ended up not watching a movie at all. So when I asked about what movie we should watch tonight, she made passive aggressive comments saying she’s surprised I haven’t already decided.

He is a very good BBQer and eventually wants to open his own restaurant. He does not have any significant savings that I’m aware of other than his 401(k). I have told him I am not OK with him cashing out his 401(k) to start this business. It’s not that I think he will fail, he cooks very good but it’s not an easy endeavor. I told him I would like for us to start trying to sell his barbecue sauce at farmers market’s etc. He does not want to start slow like that, he wants to quit his job in January and go balls out with the catering. When I asked him questions about the funds for the business he says he will mow lawn‘s when he’s not cooking and use his G.I. Bill to take programming classes Incase it doesn’t work out. I’m very concerned considering I’ve seen two credit card bills that are in his name that are past due.

1026,Asshole,"My best friend is getting married this Sunday and I’m one of the bridesmaids. She called recently and the conversation struck up on whether or not I’ve got my appointments done and I’m ready. I said I didn’t have anything scheduled, and she mentioned how it’s important to have my makeup done professionally, if not my hair, since I’ll be in a lot of the photos. 

I agree with her completely, and I don’t want to embarrass her in front of everyone by not looking up to par for the event. However, money is incredibly tight right now. I’ve been sick for the past 4 months with on and off bladder and kidney infections. I recently just got off of steroids for swelling as I’m fighting a virus right now with a weak immune system. I’ve got medical bills stacked up, and I’ve been missing weeks of work at a time. I have a little bit of money saved but that’s for bills and I don’t want to take away from the funds. I’ve resorted to selling most of my electronics for extra cash since my work and employment is a bit shaky right now. 

I have to tailor the bridesmaids dress she gave me and I’m paying for that. Hair and makeup is a few hundred dollars together and when you’re struggling that is a lot of money to spend on one-day things. I can do the makeup myself and put on some nice lashes and attempt to make myself presentable to the best of my ability (I’m by no means a makeup artist and I don’t usually wear makeup) and I was going to straighten my hair and make it look as nice as I can. I know I’m going to pale in comparison standing next to the other bridesmaids. 

Her family judges harshly on appearances and they want everything to be perfect so they’re putting a lot of pressure on her, and her on us, to look presentable and beautiful and perfect for the day.

She went off at me all ""Just because it's rainbow doesn't mean it's gay, and even if I was gay that wouldn't be a problem, gay is okay"" yada yada yada.

1029,Not the A-hole,"I know this title makes me sound really bad but please read, I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

This morning I saw that a used copy of a recent game (Fire Emblem) was in stock at my local Gamestop. Since I had a coupon and their premium membership, it'd be cheaper than buying off Craigslist or Ebay. I submitted an online in-store pickup request, which got confirmed via email that my item would be held for me today.

When I got to the store, there was a small line and it just so happened that I saw them ring up someone with a used copy of the game I had reserved. At first I didn't think much of it, they probably had a few used copies. The guy was super friendly with the staff and was hanging besides the counter after his transaction was done, so I assumed it was an employee.

When it was finally my turn to pay, I showed them the email and the worker looked shocked and said that they had accidentally sent out that email because the game was already sold out and tried to convince me to buy a new copy. I said that's bullshit and turned over to the guy at the counter and asked what he just bought five minutes ago.  That guy turned bright red and refused to show me what was in his bag. The employee then said that another store 40 miles (!) from here had another copy in stock and could reserve that for me.

At this point, I'm pretty pissed at both of them so I basically said ""You need to refund that right now and sell it to me, or I will call corporate and your manager for selling the game I reserved and get both of your asses fired for wasting my fucking time""

He finally ended up complying and refunding his game so I could buy it after but I was still mad at em. When I got home, I left a shit review on the survey they had on my receipt. I told my girlfriend, who is a retail worker, and she said I was an asshole for causing a scene and being a Karen. AITA?

While we have used poor language in front of our kids admittedly, we have never used this phrase or anything close around him. My child has never used this language directly towards me but I have caught him lately saying more bad language.

This has sparked something with us that  we need to change up our parenting styles and have failed with our current methods.  But our in laws refuse to get on board. We have repeatedly asked them to utilize timeouts, ignoring tantrums, etc and they will not listen to us. They continue to brush off bad behavior, coddle and spoil. In fact, our kids behavior is always worse when they return from their home. So while I'm not excusing what my son said/did, I think the in laws had it somewhat coming for failing to parent when we aren't around.

So we are preparing to go over there and pretty much say get on board (for consistency purposes) or the kids will not be coming back over until you do. AITA?

Over the last 3 or 4 years, my social group has undergone some morphing and changing. We have settled out into a fairly diverse collection of people in terms of race, age, and activities or interests we pursue (There is only one woman in the group regularly, but more on that later) We do everything from attend protests together, playing sports, concerts, hosting parties, camping, DIY home projects, gardening, home brewing beer, or just sitting down to play card games and board games together. At least 3 to 5 of us get together on a weekly basis, sometimes more. Everyone is emotionally supportive and expresses platonic love without being homophobic or insecure, it's a group I'm proud to be a part of and I have a lot of respect for them.

&#x200B;

We handle our few disputes in a mature manner, but the biggest wrinkle in our fabric that has developed is our buddies new girl. He's in his 30's, unmarried, successful in his field, owns a decent home and nice car, super funny, nerdy, handy with tools, to top it off he's creative, intelligent, and kind. He's kind of a group favorite and has a lot of social capital within our group. This guy also hosts most of our events, whether it's spontaneous hanging out or a planned occasion. He loves to throw parties, he has a perfect space for hosting, and he's somewhat central to all of our locations. We can all be at his place within 20 minutes roughly. Well, he started dating this woman, and initially she was well received. She seemed articulate, college educated, cares about the plights of others, and genuinely invested in our friend. For the first few months we were pleased our friend had someone, and the minor little social faux pas were ignored as a one off or not that big of a deal.

But the thing is, those social faux pas have not shown themselves to be anomalies. And, they are just social annoyances. I don't have what I would normally consider a good reason to dislike her. She's not a mean or rude person, she's moral and genuine, and cares about my friend. \*But her social rhythm is out of step with ours.\* She is the best person I feel the worst about. She's loud, she doesn't or can't engage with the activities we participate in meaningfully (concentration, it seems, is the issue), she invites other people to events w/out asking, she doesn't read the room when suggesting music or entertainment, and sometimes will have such anxiety or discomfort that my friend is required to be pulled out of the evening to assuage her or calm her down.To fend off any accusations of misogyny girlfriends or women are a welcome addition to the group.

I was recently in a musical at my local theater, and a lot of my family traveled across the country to see it. Afterwards, me and my family invited him to go eat dinner with us. My family has no idea what happened with his dad. We were all chatting at the restaurant, then they ask him where his family's from, what they do for a living, etc. He says ""my family's all down in Texas"" (where his dad lived). Then everybody gets back to talking with each other, and a couple minutes later he says ""Well, everyone except my dad."" As soon as he realized no one heard him, he gives me this look as if to say ""Nobody's paying attention to me."" I looked at him and kinda shrugged. The rest of the meal was fine. We finish eating, said goodbyes, and everyone went home. Later that night he calls me and says I was being a total asshole for not acknowledging what he said about his dad.

I haven't seen her alone since they started dating. And John has primary custody so he always brings his kids. That is not usually a problem either, I generally like kids, the problem is John seems to think that everywhere he goes where there are other adults present means he gets a built-in babysitter for the evening, and he does this especially with women.

John has walked into my mother-in-laws home for dinner, plonked himself on the couch with his phone, and told this kids to come play with me or my other SIL, Hilary, nevermind the fact that we are already helping to make food or set the table. The last time we went for dinner at his house, he offered my husband a beer, and told his daughter to play with me. Like excuse me, I want to have a drink and adult conversations, not spend my precious free time taking care of HIS children. This happens everytime we see them. He stops attending to them altogether when there are other people around.

I'm very busy at work rght now and I took the afternoon off specifically to have a relaxing time at the beach, not spend time with him and his kids.

Hilary completely understood, but Terry and her mom think I'm being an asshole. They think I should suck it up for Terry, and keep in mind that John needs a break sometimes. I think Terry should learn to say no to John. There's nothing wrong with her being apart from him for a day, and John should suck it up and learn to manage being a single parent. The kids are no one's responsibility but his own. But I don't have kids, so I'm not sure. AITA?

I love the r/tinder subreddit and find the app to be a wonderful dumpster fire. I think the profiles are wild and fun and enjoy reading them. So, after several months without the app, I redownloaded it. I told my gf that I was going to make a profile, the first line of my bio says that I'm in a monogamous relationship, and I told her I would include a photo of us together if she was comfortable with that. (I also said I would let her look through it wherever she wanted).

Originally, she said this was fine and told me to send her funny quotes from the profiles. She said she trusted me and knew I was not looking to cheat. However, she has backtracked and now says she's uncomfortable but doesn't want to control me. 

I don't want to upset her, but I have a lot of fun looking at these profiles and don't think I'm doing anything wrong. To me, this is no different then going to a bar or club without my gf; sure I could meet someone but that's not what I'm there for, I'm there for entertainment. My gf and I have talked about being okay with each other dancing with other girls, and going out and understand we might be hit on,  we don't see that as cheating.  But if you trust me to be drinking and dancing with girls why don't you feel comfortable with this app?

EDIT for clarity: I appreciate the input and will be talking to her tonight about it and most likely deleting the app, just wanted to add some clarity to why I was confused by the situation:

1. I remade an account this morning and was only on the app for about 15 minutes before work. 

2. I had no matches and only had the app for a few hours before she texted a large paragraph about how she originally said it was fine but now felt uncomfortable. I didn't write this because I was ignoring her feelings, I was confused because in my eyes nothing had changed since I only had the app on my phone for a short time

3. The part about going to clubs/bars was added because she enjoys partying and dancing with other girls, I'm more of a home body but when I go out I dance with my friends and sometimes people who join the group. We both discussed the etiquette for going out- what was okay and what was cheating- and both are fine with dancing and flirting. My point was, why is dancing with girls okay but having a tinder profile not?

4. I reached out to talk more in depth but since we both work and can't speak until tonight I wanted input from y'all. I know I need to get better at seeing things from different perspectives and I understand now why the app makes people uncomfortable, I'm just still confused about why the app is considered cheating but clubbing isn't (per our previous convos)

Either way I accept that I'm TA and will apologize to her",43,66,0.82
1048,Not the A-hole,"I while back I was attending a festival with a group of friends. We were six people in our group. I knew one friend well, I will call her Jess. Her roomate and friend was with us, I will call her Anne. Anne's younger brother ""Dave"" was also part of the group.  There were three more in the group, but they were not really involved in the drama. 

We were on day two of the festival and had so far had lots of fun together. The atmosphere was good

The festival area is quite large and three or more artist would usually play on different stages at the same time. This was Dave's first festival and he was really excited to see his favorite artist perform. The artist was one of the main artist (who rarely performs in Europe) and would perform on the main stage. Getting a good place was going to be tough. 

We had just bought some drinks when we realised that people were rushing to the main stage to see the artist way earlier than any of us anticipated. Dave was antsy, so Jess suggested we just down our drinks and get a move on. I agreed that this was a good idea (you were not allowed to bring drinks to the stage area). 

Anne and our two other friends looked at watch other and gave a wague ""hmm"" for an answer. So I suggested that maybe Jess and I go ahead with Dave so he is sure to get to see the artist and that we meet up right after unless we find each other during the show (we had already agreed on a meeting spot in case we lost each other and could not reach each other by phone). 

In my mind it was a win win. They did not have hurry with their drinks, Dave would get a good place to see his favorite artist and no one would be left alone. 

Again we got no real answer, meanwhile more and more people were moving to the main stage. So Jess said ""Ok, let's do that"". 

So we downed our drinks and went towards the stage. We managed to get a good spot in the nick of time. We enjoyed the show and towards the end Anne even managed to elbow her way to us. 

The next morning at the breakfast table Anne confronts Jess about the night before. She said she was upset because she had wanted to spend quality time with her brother and bonding with him by watching his favorite artist perform. She had not mentioned that she wanted to do this earlier and her brother was clueless too. 

Jess apologised and I could tell she expected and apology from me too. I said it is unfortunate that she feels that way, but she could have easily joined us. I did not apologise. 

So AITA for not apologising afterwards for abandoning half of the group at the festival so one friend could see his favorite artist?",18,43,0.88
1049,Asshole,"In 2015, I went through a pretty rough patch in my life. I was depressed and shut out all of my friends, family (2 parents + 7 siblings), and even my wife, Sarah. This period can be summed up with me breaking up with Sarah, lying to my family that we didn't get back together, and them finding out that we did get back together. I made a huge mistake and I apologized.

Now to the meat of the story. My family are not big fans of Sarah.* Yet, Sarah and I love each other very much, but we lived on different continents. Constrained by a work permit that fell through and an expiring visa, we got eloped and applied for her green card. This was decided and done within a week in January 2018. Afterwards, we told my parents and then told my siblings.

We also told them that we wanted to do a ceremony and reception in her European hometown in mid-August 2018. As a student, this was the best time. After hearing this, they were offended that I didn't include them in deciding a wedding date and location. I apologized that this was how it had to be.

In June 2018, we made the decision of cancelling and postponing the wedding due to issues with her green card. She ended up not getting it until October. I told my family that we would reschedule for the following summer in 2019 - around the 4th of July since this is when most of my family and friends would be off work.

After hand delivering the new wedding invites, emailing them wedding details, and calling them 1 month after the RSVP deadline, I found out that many of them weren't going. Some were angry that I was asking them if they were going to MY wedding. Some of them were upset/annoyed that I asked them why when they gave me their excuse. 

Anyways, here are a few excuses:

* Wedding was cancelled last year so not sure about this year - no one was attending the original one. If they weren’t sure, why can’t they ask?
* Too expensive - my family isn't rich but if they can afford a family of 3 - 5 to go to Asia and/or to vacation elsewhere for 2 - 3 weeks, I think they can afford one ticket to go to the wedding. I even offered to pay for their plane ticket.*
* No time - along the same lines, if they can go 2 weeks somewhere, shouldn't they have a few days to go to the wedding? In addition, the reason why everyone was going to Asia was to visit grandparents. This was triggered by the passing of my maternal grandma last year. My grandma was sick for the previous two years; why didn't they go then?
* No time to plan - in total, people knew about the wedding for over 1.5 years
* We don't feel comfortable staying there
* I wasn't sincere about my apologies
* It was inconvenient
* I deserved the family not going because of my past actions

Regardless, I'm extremely happy that my parents, 2 out of my 7 siblings, and 11 friends were at the wedding. However, I don't think what happened in the past warrants my 4 other siblings (1 had a legitimate reason) to skip their brother's wedding. They chose to not go to the most important day of my life. That hurts me the most. And for that, I want to cut them off.

So now that you know the backstory, WIBTA for feeling this way and for wanting to cut them off?

1051,Not the A-hole,"Little backstory - I live in a city on a block of public parking. There's no meters on my half of town, and my block is never crowded. Neighbor is diagonal from me, and has a giant truck with an out of state handicapped sticker. Mind you, I've lived here for 2 years this month, and he's been here longer. He's not disabled, and needs absolutely no assistance hauling furniture, groceries, or working on his diesel truck, but I never thought twice about it.

Well about 6 months ago, a friend parks on the street, and when he leaves, is harassed by this guy for ""parking in my handicapped space"" - friend immediately tells him that he has no handicapped sticker in front of his house and he can park anywhere he wants on the block (minus the actual handicapped neighbor down the block who has their own space, marked by a city sign). Magically, some non-official, amazon-esque sign appears in front of his house (physically attached to his home) that basically says:

""Reserved Handicapped Parking - Violators will be towed at vehicle owners expense.""

Well my SO is home for the summer and today she parked *barely* in front of his house, behind his giant truck, and really out of the way if i'm being objective about it. He responded by moving his truck directly in front of my front door, clearly out of spite.

So I called the local police department today and explained that he is threatening illegal towing, and harassing my house guests for parking on public streets. I'm sure it'll piss him off, and I already assume thinks I'm an asshole, but am I really?",13,31,0.89
1052,Not the A-hole,"For background, I was born in China, but was adopted as an infant by a white family. I have little knowledge of Chinese culture or language and never really ""felt"" Chinese. It's caused some weird issues where I wonder if I should feel more loyal to my birth country, despite being culturally very white.

My very good friend and roommate spent their life until middle/high school in China, then came to the US for high school and university. We currently don't see each other in person over the summer, but we text every day.

I recently posted on my instagram story a photo that said ""#FreeHongKong"". Not long after, my friend texted me a fairly long rant about how they don't like how US media is portraying the situation, saying, ""the way US writes the issue just makes me so fucking mad"" and how the US ""just thinks it's China doing bad well no it's not!!!!"".

I replied, ""...I considered blocking u from seeing my story because you're my friend and I don't want to argue about this with u! We are primed to hold different opinions from the start and I don't wanna fight about it"".

After a couple more texts from them I then said ""I don't expect either of us to change our opinions so we don't have to talk about it lol"".

At the time, I meant ""I value our friendship more than a political argument that is bound to end up as an actual fight"" and ""I'm not going to try to convince you to turn against your home country, but I would rather you not try to convince me to take China's side"".  

However, upon re-reading, I can see how what I said can easily be misconstrued as ""I refuse to change my opinion and I don't want to hear your point of view"". And I realize that me admitting I wanted to block them from seeing my #FreeHongKong post didn't help.

We agreed to drop the topic, but they were unusually cold to me afterwards and now we haven't texted/interacted on social media for a longer than usual time.

I feel like I sounded like the typical close-minded American who immediately thinks China=communist baddies, but I also believe China really is the bad guy in this situation.

1053,Not the A-hole,"My son is in 9th grade now and was assigned summer work. He has chosen advanced classes and he knew what to expect. 

About a week before school started, we went on a planned vacation. About a month before school started I reminded my son to do his work, and he started the work to make it look like he was doing something. It's two days before the vacation and he has maybe read 2 chapters of the book he is supposed to read. His work consisted of 2 fairly long books to read, 15 page packet for calculus,  and 3 chapters in a textbook for biology. He got though the first book in the two days before the vacation. 

I was pretty pissed off because he had all day in summer to get it done but didn't. I had him bring all of his stuff and he was going to work during the 8 hour flight here. I also had him work after we got back to the hotel and on a train ride we took. He got everything done by the third day.

1054,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have two young kids together. We both work full time jobs; the kids are in daycare. We do equal housework and taking care of the kids or we used to, anyway, before this started to happen. 

Recently, my wife has decided that she doesn’t get enough breaks. She claims that the kids are always around us and it’s just too much. I say “Yeah, well but it’s kind of what we signed up for.” She’s let her responsibilities slip and has just left it all to me as of late, when we were always a team. I was never the kind of husband to make her do everything with the kids, we did it all together. But now I pretty much do it all, plus all the housework. She gets as many breaks as she possibly needs, napping and such. She took the day off yesterday because she realized that even with the kids in daycare because she works, she only has 4 hours to herself at the end of the day. I didn’t really know what to say there. 

Then this morning, she asked me about getting a nanny or mother’s helper to help her on the Saturdays I work. I said no. I told her that at this point, she’s barely doing any work during the week with the kids, at this point, the least she can do is spend time with them on Saturdays. She offered to work more hours during the week to pay for it, so she could get some alone time on the weekends. I asked when are you going to spend it with the kids, and she got mad about that. I also pointed out that if we did this, all of the money I make from my Saturday shifts, would be going to this nanny or mother’s helper (we live in a HCOL area and the cost of daycare vs. in-home childcare for 2 kids is a lot different). 

Now we’re not speaking and she thinks I’m calling her a bad mother. I’m not. I just think that she needs to take care of our kids. She has the weekends off and since I/the daycare take care of the kids during the week, it’s not a lot to ask her to take care of them on the weekends.

Am I being an ass here?",651,1225,0.95
1055,Asshole,"A few weeks ago I was on a business trip and the plane was delayed, and so to get to the hotel to check in on time I had to rush. I only had a backpack (no carry on), and had an aisle seat in the back. My idea was that because I can instantly get up, I can likely beat a lot of people who would be slow to get up and hopefully leave the plan as fast as possible. The plan halfway worked and I got to about the halfway point of the plane from the back when an old man got up. Totally fine, beats being in the back. I did not crowd his space and gave him ample room to get his bag. Thats when he turned around and told me in a stern voice ""we all have to wait our turn you know"", and proceeded to purposefully take his bag out from the overhead area and put it on the floor behind him, crowding/blocking me me. I don't know if it was purposeful, but the bag did hit me several times, each time he gave the stink eye as if I should not be there.

I did not hinder anyone as you dont have to be parallel to your seat number when you get out, and even if its an unspoken rule I did not shift anyone out of alignment with their overhead bags. To me, if I am faster than others, I can utilize that speed as long as the aisle is clear, and the first person to step in front is where I stop. The old man did not seem to think so. AITA for rushing down the aisle?

For context, I did indeed run through the airport so it was not a comfort thing and my original flight got delayed even worse so I had to switch to this flight (meaning I would have confirmed early so I would have early boarding to get off faster)

Edit: For more info, there was a 75 dollar late check-in fee for the hotel and if the hotel decided to charge it on my stay then my hotel would be out of the company budget, and therefor I would likely have to pay for the whole stay myself

Edit 2: So its about 85/90% YTA and I agree in the sense that I was not aware to the strength of the unspoken rule that even if you have the speed and space to move ahead you should not. I should have assumed people would take offense to that and not tried to move up.

I also think I'm TA for not thinking to call my hotel and try to work something out, as likely they would understand and so I should have tried to call. My bad on that one.

However, I don't get the ""everyone else had somewhere to be""/""you're not any more important than anyone else on the plane"" thing. Unless everyone else on that plane had the same exact situation where they had potentially hundreds of dollars on the line or were late to bigger things (a connecting flight leaving right as we landed that is the last one of the day, etc), I feel like my situation should have been prioritized over someone waiting just to go home. I don't care if people were tired, I was as well but mustered enough leg strength to hustle it down the plane. On circumstances alone, someone who could lose hundreds of dollars has a more important problem then someone just being tired. So yes, to my knowledge there was no major connecting flights afterword and I didn't see anyone else from that flight going to my hotel and so would have the same problem, meaning my situation was more important and so temporarily I was more important.

Also, for those who keep saying I should have paid for a better seat, I would have but I was moved to this flight because my original one (where I had business class) was delayed even worse.

Such as, if a boyfriend leaves her she thinks it's the end of the world and cries and cuts herself. I couldn't take it anymore. At first it shocked me, and I felt bad, but I got so desensitized to her cutting herself I no longer felt bad and actually got annoyed that every single day she wanted me to spend hours of my time to help her calm down.

Me and my ex wife had a bit of a messy divorce. I guess technically our reason for divorcing was that she's a lesbian, but a lot of resentment built between us before then until she decided she no longer wanted to be with a man.


So, my father is not religious at all, and doesn't care about sexuality. My stepmom however is VERY religious and VERY against homosexuality and makes most of the decisions in the house. When we divorced, my ex wife moved in with them while trying to find a new place to stay. 


I was honestly surprised they let her live with them, but didn't really say anything even though it kind of bothered me. Well I visited them a little while back, and for some reason they started talking about how great she was and how I should of treated her better and how sad it is that we divorced. It was frustrating me so I snapped and said ""it doesn't matter how I treated her, we would of ended up divorcing either way because she's a lesbian."" They didn't believe me and said I shouldn't lie like that, so I just told them to ask her when she gets home then and left a bit afterwards as things got awkward.


Well she texted me the other day freaking out and saying that wasn't cool telling them that, and that my stepmom kicked her out after finding out she's lesbian because she doesn't want her daughter growing up around that.

1061,Not the A-hole,"So my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  I put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  My daughter and I have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  I am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

The problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  He calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  She has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  He has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  She recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

She sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  I was very proud of the way she handled it.  We have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  I think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

Last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""Babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  It was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  He then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  He then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  She.  Is.  Done.

As a mom, I would want to know if my son (13M) was treating someone like this.  I recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  WIBTA for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  We have chatted in the past, and I have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  Or would I be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  I talked with my daughter tonight and told her that I was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (For the record, I would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  I respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  I explained that I don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and I am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  But I have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  I am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

She was not upset at all and said she understood why I would want to call his mom.  She asked that I wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  We agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by Friday, I will make the call.  As a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  She is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200B;

Also, for those of you who have asked... From a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  We never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  When problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  So her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  I'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",662,14997,0.94
1062,Not the A-hole,"I’m gay, my (widowed) mother is very religious, you can see where this is going. I came out to her when I was 19, I had been with the same man for 2 years then. Mom demanded I break up with him and start dating girls if I wanted to keep living at home. Bf was still in the closet and living with his parents too, so I ended up couch surfing for 3 months before getting back on my feet. During that time, I cried myself to sleep every night and hoped I could repair my relationship with my mother, but she never budged and demanded I break up with my bf every time we talked.

In the years that followed, I tried to maintain a relationship with mom, but she kept trying to “turn me straight” at every occasion. The last time I saw her until recently, I was 22 and I had been invited for dinner; when I arrived, there was her priest there and mom happily told me he would “cure me” of my homosexuality. I got up and left without a word. We went no contact for years.

I got married last week. Still to the same man I had been dating when I was 17, we’ve been together 9 years total and he’s perfect. On his advice, I extended one last branch to mom by telling her about the wedding 6 months ago. She first tried to make me call it off, but she eventually crumpled and admitted she had set money aside since I was born for my future wedding. Of it, she gave me over 25,000€. Until then, we were planning a tiny ceremony with just a few close friends, but with that money we upgraded the wedding by renting a vineyard, a catering service and a much better cake, and we were so happy! I was mostly happy mom was finally accepting my sexuality. We had several heart-to-heart conversations, we cried and hugged a lot and I was very glad.

On the day of the wedding, things went south. As I was getting ready early in the morning, I stumbled on mom crying in the bathroom (we were in a rented house together with mom and my husband). What I first thought were tears of joy were actually from sadness and anguish. She admitted she found the idea of me marrying a man revolting, and she could put on a fake smile while it was all in the future, but she couldn’t believe the wedding day was there. I was dumbfounded and asked why she gave me the money, and she said she wouldn’t miss my wedding for anything in the world, even though she didn’t approve of it or accept me - no matter if I married a man, a dog or an inanimate object… I took that as a punch in the gut. I got really angry and told her she was not welcome there and to go home. It turned into a shouting/crying match but she left.

I couldn’t enjoy myself during the wedding, and I still feel empty inside. The happiest time of my life was tainted forever, and I don’t think I will ever be able to talk to my mother the same way. I also feel *dirty* for having the wedding paid for by her. AITA?",534,2891,0.94

We get extreme weather here and it was approaching winter. I've heard of people keeping dogs outside and although I'd never seen them walk him or let him off the chain, I assumed they did. The winter came, with that came heavy snow, below freezing temperatures. I decided to look and saw that even overnight, the dog was left to sleep outside in the snow with no shelter. 
I spoke to my neighbour, A, who told me that I was imposing and to mind my own business. B then said that they can do what they want and that he's a ""guard dog"". A year passed, I reported them twice to the RSPCA who did absolutely nothing beside come and speak to my neighbours, causing me more abuse from them. 

I noticed that both went to work every day from 8am until about 6. After seeing this dog pacing all day, crying and whining, I started giving him treats and feeding him proper dog food. Sometimes I'd go in their garden with my dog so they could play. Whilst doing this, I noticed that the chain wasn't locked, just looped around a pole so one day I slipped it off, the neighbours dog was SO happy and playful and just wanted to run, so I thought fuck it, and I took the dog to the field (literally connected to the back of our houses), using my spare harness and leash. My god, the dog was ecstatic. I've never seen a dog so grateful just to feel the grass (their yard was concrete). 

This became a regular thing, I'd take my dog for a long walk and then take their rottie (who they haven't even named, just call him dog) to the field and jog with him. 

2 days ago, I guess somehow my neighbours found out. They came to my door and accused me of ""kidnapping"" their dog and said that they were reporting me to the police, which they didn't. My boyfriend says I was out of order and shouldn't interfere. They obviously think I'm an asshole, too. So what do yous think? 

P.s - I work from home and know for a fact that the dog is never walked and never let inside. 

**Tl;Dr** neighbours dog is locked outside in all weather, never walked and so I began walking him when his owners were out. They found out and lost their shit.

Edit - so, this was a very mixed bag of reactions. I appreciate all of you for taking the time to comment. 99% of comments agreed what I did was legally wrong and probably super dumb, even if they didn't think I was TA, I think you're right! The rest of the comments say I should steal the dog or rescue it. And, the majority of people suggest calling ""animal control"" - I did, I rang the RSPCA and made a report, they chose not to pursue it. 
I'm in the process off heightening the fence between our and their garden. I feel awful that I've put the dog in this position because I can only imagine how distressed it must feel every time I walk past with my dog and don't pick him up for a walk. What I did was selfish, to ease my own conscience and wasn't in the best interest of the dog. 
If I see any ""direct"" abuse, as the RSPCA said, I'll report it. But, other than that I will leave them to care for their dog in whatever way they can/want and I'll focus on my dog and stop imposing myself and my standards on other people. 

Thanks again, you guys opened my eyes.",156,422,0.94

She's also an immigrant and her English isn't great. So she buys all this tech from smartphones, smart TVs, smart watches, tablets, computers, Echos, etc. Without having a clue what they do and how they work; she calls me every single time and every time I go and show her. I get a call at least once every 2 weeks with a new problem and the problem is usually nothing but she freaks out and calls me immediately. 

She just bought a brand new CRV and the dealership told her that she can plug her phone in and have her phone show up on the display (Android Auto). They didn't set it up they told her she can download it and it'll work. So naturally, she comes to me and starts asking me about it. I knew exactly what she was talking about, but I didn't want to set it up. So I kept saying, yes your car has navigation and voice command it's built into your car and you hook your phone up Bluetooth. I kept dodging Android Auto and anything related to it. Every time she's at my parents house, I just dodge her entirely now so I don't have to be tech support. I personally have Android Auto and even I have issues with it sometimes.

1075,Not the A-hole,"English is not my native language. So please excuse the errors. I hope I can explain myself clearly.

My ex wife and I were married for 4 years. She had two daughters with her ex husband. They were 3 and 5 when we got married. After our marriage, I came to know that she basically cheated on her ex husband, which lead to their divorce. 

In retrospect, I think that our marriage was kind of doomed from the begging. Our marriage consisted of her wallowing in self pity about how her infidelity destroyed her marriage and her girls and me consoling her everyday. 

She refused to discipline the girls because she felt she was was responsible for hurting and I couldn't do anything because I was not the dad. 

Finally, she decided to get back with her ex husband and cheated on me with him. I was kind of relieved that our relationship ended. I did everything I could for the girls but their dad always managed to paint me as an asshole. So I stopped trying to do anything and just provided for them. 

Now after a couple of months, my ex calls me and tells me that her daughters want to see their stepdad. That's me. I was surprised because they never appreciated what I did for them. Long story short, things did not work out for the ex husband and my ex wife and they broke up again. 

So I told her that they only wanted to see me because their dad kicked them out and told her not to call me again. She called my mom about it and my mom thinks I was inconsiderate. AITA here?",212,1789,0.97

Basically I'm getting married soon, yay me. My partners family has been heavily involved due to tradition and wanting the wedding to be somewhat traditional, which I have no problem with. The wedding is going to be traditional and their parents have helped with funding some of the wedding.

Now we have no children, and don't plan on having any any time soon. However, their sister does, she has three. We've asked all of our friends and my family to not bring children to the wedding at any part during the day as we don't want kids there. Now I work with kids and have no problem with kids but I know that a lot of kids don't have very much spacial awareness for the scenarios there in. Therefore me, and my partner, don't want children at the wedding.

My family was fine with it, our friends are fine with it. Sister-in-law throws up a fuss.

We've hired out quite a nice place for the event and it comes with an on site secruity for the event. At my partners birthday party the other week my sister-in-law was adamant that she was bringing her children to the days proceedings. We argued for a bit but in the end I just told her that if she brings her kids to my wedding I'd have her and her kids ejected by secruity.

While my partners on my side I'm getting a lot of fall-back from her family and it's just causing a whole lot of headache for everyone, I'm unsure how I'm going to solve it.

1079,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.

A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

Was I in the wrong?

Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.

Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.

Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head.

Now as is often the case with a bunch of toddlers bundled together, they very easily pick up a bug and come home sneezing and a nose full of snot.  

My stay-at-home-wife and MIL (who are joined at the hip)  always make a big fuss about every cough or sneeze.  They immediately go into full panic mode when he even has as much as a running nose and are always keen on keeping him home so he can ‘recover’ until he is completely free of any sort of symptoms. It’s safe to say he easily misses 1/3rd of all available school days this way.  

I on the other don’t really see a big deal when he’s not running a fever and seems his energetic self. 
I remember in my young days I hardly ever skipped a day of school, even kindergarten unless I was seriously ill.
I know its only kindergarten but I do feel it’s important he goes as often as possible. 
He’s an only child so I want him to mingle with other kids his age as much as possible to develop his social skills and other abilities. He already was a late talker and his pronunciation still leaves a lot to be desired.  
   
Also, whenever he does stay home my wife allows him waaaay too much screen time on tablets or TV instead of keeping him occupied in some meaningful manner (but that is another can of worms) 

So we often have the same heated discussions where I insist he goes to school whereas my wife and MIL insist he stays at home because they believe he’s too sick, or they fear he will only get sicker.

1081,Not the A-hole,"Before we get into the meat of the story, I’m on mobile so I apologize for all the issues that come with that. Now, to the story!

My daughter who for story sakes I will refer to as R, is about to start her first week of school next Monday. Up until today my ex wife and I seemed to be at an understanding that the only people who should be dropping R off for her first day of school Is myself, ex wife, and our spouses. Well as I found out about an hour ago, ex-wife told my mother she could come, AFTER I had already told her I didn’t want her there. I love my mom, we’ve never exactly been the closest but we try out best to make it work. When R was born she was a huge help to me, and she took care of R while I was away for military service for 8 weeks around 4 years ago. The reason she had to take care of R was I was obviously gone and my ex wife had some pretty severe mental health issues and ran off with another guy and left R. 

Now, I will forever be thankful to my mother for everything she’s done for myself and R but she has become a little overbearing with how she acts. Ex wife has cleaned up her act of 3 years ago and we have 50/50 custody and for all intents and purposes she is a good mother. My mother still refuses to step away from parenting R, breaking rules I have set for R all the time at her house and refuses to babysit for my ex wife if she doesn’t get her way.  When I found out about her deciding to come along to R’s first day of school I text her and said “mom it would mean a lot to me if the first day of school only R’s parents came. This is a big deal to me, it’s not because of anything you have done I just would rather this be a parent only event. “

Her response was “I will be going, it isn’t about you it is about R.” 

To which I responded “Mom it is honestly really upsetting how little respect you have for my parenting choices.” 

Her next text honestly hurt me a bit, she told me 

“That’s laughable! Why don’t you stop and think about when u were in basic! I had R almost full time! I worked my ass of to make sure she had a since of stability! Not to mention the cost I’ve helped with. It’s a power trip w you. I’m not taking anyone’s place. If it upsets you that she wants me more than u step back and look in the mirror. She respects my answers. I’m sorry I feel that way...but I am going!”

So here I am, pissed at my mother, annoyed with my ex and they’re seeming to team up on this one and telling me to get over myself and that I’m a dick. So Reddit, AITA?

1082,Not the A-hole,"Context which will be needed: I just got a new job and need a better bus pass than the one I have already which I use to get to school, the new one is only about 25% more and I agreed to pay for this 25% by getting rid of my pocket money as I won't need it (the pocket money covered more than the 25% but idrc).  The reason I need a bus to school is that they decided to live in a different town to where I already went to school, this was out of my hands and they said that they would pay for me to get to school and back when we moved. 



My dad just came into my room screaming at *me* because my *mum* came into my room, took pretty much clean jeans which had my passport in them and decided to wash them without checking my pockets while I was at work. Anyway, my passport was destroyed and my dad is saying it's my fault for not emptying jeans pockets, which I was going to wear again btw so ofc I wouldn't empty my pockets. 


Next thing my mum comes and starts shouting at me for the same thing. She then says, and I quote directly, ""if I have to check your pockets when taking things from your room you have to pay for your own new bus pass"". So she is saying that despite it being out of my hands where I live I now must pay for my travel to school and not just to work. Is that fair on me because honestly, it feels like I'm being robbed of about £30 a week because they decided to live in a different town (which is completely out of my hands and I shouldn't have to pay for a decision I didn't even make). 


My mum kept on shouting at me so at the end I just told her to ""piss off"" which apparently ""really hurt her feelings"" and she said that I really upset her, this is total bull cause she has told me that she ""doesn't love me"" and said much worse things than ""piss off"" to get me to go away. She is just trying to guilt-trip me and try to make out that I shouldn't be angry for having to piss away 1/2 of my wages a month.  



-(1) am I in the wrong for not emptying pockets of jeans which weren't meant to be washed yet?


-(2) should I have to pay for my own bus pass to both school and work despite my parents agreeing to pay for school?


-(3) am I in the wrong for telling my mum to piss off even if she says worse things to me?

1084,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend, my brother and me ordered pizza. We threw in some other stuff too - wings, bottle of coke, pint of ice cream, a cookie - and the total was £24.96.

The guy knocked and I realised I'd forgotten to get my wallet so I went to get it and my girlfriend answered the door. I didn't hear what he said but my girlfriend responded ""I have a boyfriend"" to which he replied ""that's what they all say"".

I showed up at the door, wallet in hand, and put my arm around my girlfriend. I expected the dude to back off or at least look a bit embarrassed but instead he squared up to me (he was shorter so it didn't really work but he tried it). He put the food in my girlfriend's hands and looked her up and down before winking at her. Right in front of me. She shifted uncomfortably and actually moved a little behind me.

I have a ""do no harm, but take no shit"" approach to life, and this was some shit. However, while we're in the UK where tipping isn't necessary but is appreciated, my mother is American and raised me and my siblings with the belief that we should always leave a 20% tip.

I opened my wallet and I had was a £10 and a £20, so I gave him those, and I was willing to let him keep the change as a tip, but then he winked at my girlfriend again and she retreated inside the flat.

I held my hand out, and said ""my change, please?"". Delivery guy's face dropped, he shoved the fiver at me plus the 4p in coins.

The delivery guy then said ""come on mate you're seriously not tipping?"" so I took the fiver and put it in my other hand, and used the hand still holding the coins to give him the 4 pence and slammed the door in his face.

I want to point out that I'd never actually said ""here's your tip"" or anything like that, he'd just assumed that the change was his tip.

My girlfriend was in the kitchen getting plates when my brother, who hadn't heard the exchange at the door and had been in the bathroom this whole time, saw me put the five in my wallet and said ""you didn't tip?"", and I gave him a recap of what had gone on.

I thought he'd understand, but instead he said that the guy didn't mean any disrespect, he just thought my girlfriend was cute, and I had to get used to her being hit on. I replied that I understand that she might get hit on but I was literally right there, so it was absolutely disrespectful to both me and her. I can't blame him for hitting on her, she's cute and he saw his shot and he took it, but he should have backed off when she said she had a boyfriend, and even when I showed up he still didn't leave her alone.

My brother said that I still should have tipped him as it's how we were raised and he might have really needed that tip. My girlfriend says that she was uncomfortable from the way he talked to her but even though she appreciates me sticking up for her she thinks giving him the 4p might have been a dick move, however she respects it's my money to do what I want with and is grateful for me standing up for her.

AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: It wasn't so much he was hitting on her in front of me that pissed me off (although it did), what pissed me off more than that was that he didn't just take no for an answer. He should have taken the initial ""I have a boyfriend"" as a sign to back tf off, and the reason my girlfriend thinks the 4p thing might have been a dick move is that when I went to hand it to him I sort of separated out the 4p and £5 and kind of faked like I was going to give him the five, before giving him the pennies, which is where the dick move part comes in.",469,1234,0.86

I'd been with my fiancé for just under 4 years and our wedding was supposed to be in June. I'd say it was a near perfect relationship and I loved him with everything that I am (I still do and will for a long time). We'd planned on doing bachelorette/bachelor parties in late May so we could spend the last few weeks focusing on the wedding. I went to Palm Springs for mine and it was actually supposed to be really tame with just swimming, laying out, good food, wine, massages, etc... I got way too drunk one afternoon and literally had the pants charmed off me by an extremely attractive older guy who knew how to say all the right things. I ended up in his room and got to kissing and heavy petting before I realized what I was doing. I sobered up and left immediately for home so I could confess to my fiancé. 
He took it much worse than I even imagined he could and broke up with me, cancelled the wedding and hasn't looked back. I deserved it, it sucks and I wish it weren't the case but I got exactly what I deserved.

 I decided that I'm going to take this semester off, work at my sister's stables and try to recover. The issue is, my ex-fiancé is around all the time. He's still great friends with my dad and helping on the new well project. I'd assumed with calling off the wedding he would just stay in Tucson on the weekends since he's working there (he's taking a one year deferral to med school, ostensibly for our first year married) but he's at our property every weekend. He eats dinner with my family and he and my brother go out to the bars all the time. It's insanity because everyone is happy to see him drive up on Friday and then sad to see him go back to town on Sunday. I'm biologically related to these people and I don't feel even half as welcome. He stays in the guest house and I feel like I have to hide out. Needless to say my plan of ""recovering"" is not working if the guy I'm supposed to be recovering from is here all the fucking time. We are cordial to each other but I definitely feel like he is sticking a knife in every time he talks to me so I try to avoid him as best I can.
 
I've politely asked my parents to not have him over because it causes me so much stress and heart ache. The answer I get is a pretty uniform ""just because you caused the breakup with your bad choices, it doesn't mean that we have to stop being friends with a genuinely good person."" 

I don't disagree with that but I just don't why it has to be at my house. If they were to go see him in Tucson, go out to dinner...I mean that would still hurt but it wouldn't be so ""in your face."" 
AITA if I basically ""lay down the law"" and say this is my house, you need to respect me and my ex-fiancé can't come over anymore?

Long edit ahead: so I guess some of the criticisms in this were very harsh which made me feel exceptionally guilty (which I deserve, I’m not not saying I don’t) so for the first time since the break up I called my ex to just talk to him about everything that happened (we’ve had a ton of conversations about logistics, really none about “us”) and find out why he felt the need to be around so much and maybe just explain my feelings and why it hurt me so much to see him 2 days a week. We actually had a great conversation which was very refreshing. I told him I’m not in any way trying to dictate who he can see but maybe being at my house two days of 7 is a bit much. He agreed and said he wound scale it back. I was just about to let him go and he dropped a major bomb on me that he was still massively in love with me and that one of the reasons he was around so much is he was trying to build the courage to ask me to go to some sort of counseling with him to see if maybe we can work things out. After I caught my breath at him saying that I started balling my eyes out because I hate myself so bad for what I did to such a great guy. We talked for a little bit longer and basically what it comes down to is that if I do the leg work to find a counselor that will work with our student health insurance he’ll go with me. We aren’t really “back together” because we have so much work to do be we also agreed that we aren’t going to see anyone else either. I’m going to re-enroll in classes and try to find a place to live so I can actually graduate next spring. He’s still doing his deferral year and will start Med school next summer/fall.

Remediating the basement water issue shot to the top of my list instantly and I talked to her about my desire to raid savings to fix the basement. She objected as we don't use the basement much and so it could wait. My feeling is that regardless of use a wet basement is a health and safety issue and risks long term damage to the home. We couldn't come to an agreement.  

A week later she told me that she had family and friends coming over for a weekend.  I didn't think anything of it.

She asked me to go help. I refused and told her I wanted no part of this, especially after she drained savings without so much as a talk. A fancy renovated bathroom is 100% a want, not a need.

A nice couple used to live across the hall from us but they moved a few months ago.  One day about a month after they moved out, I saw a woman coming out of that apartment. I asked if she had just moved in and she replied no, she’s staying at the Airbnb there. That night when I got home I looked it up and found the listing on Airbnb.

One of my other neighbors had previously complained about strata management preventing him from short-term subletting his apartment. So, out of curiosity, I looked up the strata by-laws (publicly available for a small fee) and confirmed that short term sublets, including Airbnb, are not allowed in our building.

My roomie and I discussed it and at the time neither of us was bothered by it. However a few things have happened since then which have made us reconsider:

1. There have been 3 occasions where the Airbnb renter mistook our apartment for theirs and tried to get in. It’s actually terrifying to be alone at night and hear someone try really hard to open your door, wriggle the door handle, etc, followed by swearing and usually phone calls.

2. There have been more drink spillages and untidiness than usual on our floor, including pizza boxes with food left in them thrown in the recycling bin, etc. Can’t prove these things came from the Airbnb but they started after the Airbnb started. 

3. Loud noises - nothing on the level of Airbnb horror stories I’ve read online, but still an increase in late night loud noises, loud music, etc

4. Sometimes the Airbnb tenants and I happen to be in the lift at the same time and they’re a large group of drunk, rowdy men. They ask questions that are anything from friendly, small talk etc to very personal or kind of creepy (eg are you on your way to meet your boyfriend). I wouldn’t go as far as to say it made me feel unsafe but it definitely made me feel uncomfortable.

Given the above my roomie and I are now considering reporting the Airbnb to the strata. (We’ve asked the other neighbors but nobody knows how to contact the apartment owners.) Half the people we ask for advice say we should report them because they’re breaking the rules and having strangers around all the time is less safe than having a permanent resident. The other half think we shouldn’t make a big deal of a bunch of minor incidents and that we’d be ruining someone’s financial stability as well as possibly ruining the holidays of people who’ve already booked the Airbnb for their trip.

We both agree that it’s minor stuff but it does make our lives harder so we are undecided. So, WI(we)BTA if we reported the Airbnb to strata?",65,217,0.95
1096,Asshole,"My family is split about 50/50 vegetarians and omnivores, anyway me, mum, dad, aunt, uncle, gran and granddad and their 6 year old cousin were at a family dinner. Cousin asked why half the people were eating meat half weren't, dad basically said not everyone's ok with the killing aspect. Cousin clearly hadn't really thought about this so kept asking questions throughout the dinner such as if the chickens died naturally lol and if they were happy. Aunt was clearly getting annoyed so said they live in a luxurious ""hen hotel"" until they get old and  then get killed in their sleep, told her to stop talking about it. Dinner ends without incident.

&#x200B;

Later in the day cousin and me were alone and she was still going on about it later asking about the ""hen hotel"", so I told her to google how chickens are raised . Replied with she doesn't have a computer and kept asking if the ""hen hotel"" was true, after dodging the question a few times I told her it isn't true at all. She asked what happens in reality so I told her not to tell aunt/uncle, then image searched ""chicken factory farm"" (it was smartprice chicken for dinner) and passed her my phone. She was clearly quite upset by it and accused me of lying, I told her it was the truth then she went upstairs. Wouldn't let me come in her room so left her.

Aunt/uncle go to check on her and she'd been crying for a few hours over it. Uncle came in to the living room (me and mum only people present) and went absolutely batshit. Told him to calm down, he asked why I showed her it and told him cause she kept asking and the hen hotel was the dumbest thing I've heard in years. He was really getting in my face/aggressive by this point so stood up and told him to fuck off, luckily did but I expect he'd have attacked I wasn't much bigger than him. Aunt came in a bit later and told us to go, so me/mum/dad all did, mum said I shouldn't have shown her it dad was taking my side. Aunt/uncle are still furious apparently. AITA?",77,104,0.85

Its been an ongoing arguement with my husband. He watches adult cartoons with our 5 year old because he doesn't want to watch the children's stuff. Yesterday, our son told his dad that he wanted to watch something scary. My husband chose scream. I told him that the child meant Scooby doo or Super Monsters, but he rolled his eyes and did what he wanted, per usual. 

This morning my son woke up talking about his toys being murdered and people hanging from ropes, in trees. He obviously had a nightmare, but wasn't upset. It was just like he was storytelling. I told him that those things are only in movies and that he didn't have to worry about that. I'm having trouble confronting my husband about this because he gets very defensive. I'm on my couch in tears, because I feel like I have no control. 

A little background; my step brother hanged himself almost two months ago. How tf can I take my son to see his grieving grandparents when he is talking about people hanging from trees?!

1102,Not the A-hole,"Background here. I am a 16 year old born with China parents and a China born sister who is 23 now. My parents migrated overseas to where we live now with my sister and had me, completely born in an English speaking environment. I can speak Mandarin, but usually only at home, and I study in a school with English as first language. 


We went to my father's hometown in Szechuan Chengdu last month, and welcomed by our grandparents who threw a big reunion party with my uncles aunts and cousins, about 20+ people. They speak in Szechuan dialect as their mother tongue, but are able to understand and speak Mandarin too. While my parents(obviously) and sister(able to understand but can only speak Mandarin) are comfortable with it, I have trouble understanding the dialect.


I tried to ask an uncle speaking to me to speak Mandarin, but was responded with laughter, the other relatives also seemed to enjoy my confusion. That uncle, using Mandarin, told me that I am a banana who has forgotten her roots before turning back to dialect. My parents told me not to act selfishly and expect everyone to change for me. It was awkward and frustrating to be the only one in a house of strangers(yups, relatives but strangers) who had no idea what others were saying. 


Since they were comfortable, I figured I might as well as make myself comfortable too. When an aunt came to speak to me again, I responded in English, this time enjoying her confused face. Even though I had no idea what they were talking about, I spoke English throughout the rest of the party.


I had an earful from my parents after that, they said that I was disrespectful and a walking form of embarassment and because of me they got scolded from my grandparents for teaching me to behave this way. My sister(secretly) supported me though, saying they had what was coming for teasing me like that. AITA?",1760,11840,0.96

1105,No A-holes here,"I am 13 weeks pregnant. 

My MiL just informed me that her son and his wife (not pregnant) texted her to ask if it would be “weird” if they were to use a family name for their hypothetical future baby. “Weird” because someone else in our close family has already used this name for their kid. 

It is also my husband’s middle name, and in my family, the firstborn son is traditionally given the father’s middle name, and we did plan on carrying on this tradition if we have a son.  

SiL doesn’t care about any of this, she loves the name and has said she would use it anyway because it’s her #1 choice. (This was all expressed to my MiL via text, on the day I hit 12 weeks).

1107,Not the A-hole,"I bought a new apartment 3 months ago in a 4 unit condo built in 19th century. The building is old and has beautiful hardwood floors. I love the apartment and everything about it; except the downstairs neighbors. Ever since my first day in the apartment, they have caused problems. The woman is around 40 and she is from the Philllipines. The man is around 60 and he is from England. They retired early and they never leave their apartment. I am in my mid-20's a working professional woman. I work 12 hours a day, and I sleep 8 hours so I am only actually ""living"" in the apartment for 4 hours a day (which I spend most of it on the couch).

Our problem started when I was moving in. The woman saw that the delivery guys were bringing my couch and she stepped on the door and started shouting my name. She was scared that my couch would damage the walls, while it was clear that the couch could, and did, easily fit through. She was shouting that she would make me pay for damages. She said that the couch needed to go.

In the past 3 months, they have emailed or messaged me 5 times about my footsteps. They told me that they can hear me walk and it disturbs them. They told me to wear slippers and put rugs. I wore slippers for 3-4 days and then got sick of it. I like being barefoot. I also don't want to put rugs in the apartment at the peak of the summer heat and I love the hardwood floors. So I have basically been ignoring their request. I am sorry that this is happening to them but I also believe that they should probably not live on the first floor of an old hardwood floor building if they are very particular about noise. I also believe that my unit is my private property and what I do in it is my business. They should not force me to do anything. I had a friend over for a week, and when I was not at home, they ran into my friend and told him to wear slippers. How dare they disturb my guest??

Today, I got another email from them about my footsteps. The email was very long and very detailed. I think they wanted to record my behavior for the courts, in case they wanted to sue me. So I went to the police in person and explained what was going on. The police said what I do in my apartment is my business and they should respect that. And suggested that they go to the couple and tell them to stop emailing me about my footsteps. So they did. I watched them get the shock of their lives.

Do you think I am the asshole? I do walk barefoot and pay no attention to my footsteps. I also refuse to get rugs.

TLDR: Downstairs neighbor can hear my footsteps and kept telling me to wear slippers/ buy rugs. I do not wear slippers and don't have rugs. When they sent me another email, I went to the cops and the cops said they would talk to the neighbors. They did and the couple is shocked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: I did not mention this but there is another problem in this building. The basement floor was sold in January (the unit below theirs). The couple who bought it wanted to change the layout. But the crazy neighbors did not give the condo board permission to do this, because they are worried about the noise from renovation, and the new owners can't get the city permit without the board permission. Apparently, the unit has been sitting empty, waiting for their approval.",254,563,0.94
1108,Not the A-hole,"As most interpersonal problems this has a long (and for most people boring) backstory that I try to leave out, also I'm well aware that I'm telling the story from my view and thus am biased.

I'm 26, male, my girlfriend/fiance is 30f, my mother 53 (and female...). I moved out of my moms house 7 years ago. Since we already had a rather complicated relationsship I didn't told her where I will move. Somehow she found out and threatend to sue me because she felt like I still own her money (she wanted to use the money on a well known scammer that didn't had permit to stay in the country, everyone warned her about it, she still gave him money in the 5 figures). Told her that I don't think I owe her money and that I couldn't afford to send her multiple k anyway. If she wants and because she's my mother I could send her 300 bucks, thats all I have. Nothing happend there.

&#x200B;

We move and she starts doing surprise-visits. She contacts me on messengers and so on only when she needs something (2 am, she calls because she doesn't understands the pop-up ""Please save your work and restart your computer"", she calls me and the boyfriend of my sister while we're in a foreign country because she doesn't reads the sh\*t thats clearly written on the screen).

&#x200B;

She called my previous workplace to talk with my boss about me. She got angry/disappointed when I refuse to tell her where I work/live.

Yesterday someone rings the bell of the house (where I don't know from where she has the address from), a dude tells me he has to bring flowers, he's a courier. I let him in, it's my mother with a dude and I honestly don't know what to do. Don't wanna make a scene in front of strangers. Take the stuff he carries and try to refuse her gifts, took his ones as I think he's just a poor guy who tries to do his job and maybe got send through the whole city just to find me. As I don't take the gifts from my mother she gives them to my fiance who's taken of her guard. We don't let them in the flat and they leave.

Got a message from her saying ""Sorry if I surprised you"" on which I replied ""Didn't expected it and don't know where you got my address from"" on which she got angry and told me that she didn't saw me for a long time and she just wanted to show me her new boyfriend. If I don't want the gifts I should throw them away. She didn't replied on my repeated question where she got my address from.

Myself and my fiance feel unconfortable with her knowing where we live, I have to admit that I feel borderline scared/not safe anymore. This may sounds weird but I have to protect my family, even if this means protecting my family against my mother.

1109,Not the A-hole,"I'll give you all the Tldr dotpoints as my life is a horrible and complex clusterfuck but I'll outline the major factors here:

-My narsissitic mother controlled my every move while living at home , eventuated in huge fight and her kicking me out of home on the night of my 21st birthday party (which she organised)  in front of all my friends, because she didn't approve of some new friends I had made and I refused to uninvite them given that I was a legal adult. 

-Nan was equally as horrible,  everything was answered with violence/smacks/beating with kitchen utensils /throwing slippers / Calling all her grandkids Fucking little cunts etc etc (admittedly my cousins were a bit nuts but I was a quiet very well behaved child) 

-Rarely saw Nan,  maybe once a year. Always got massive anxiety going there as it usually ended in fighting and then I'd have to be alone with my now enraged batshit crazy mother for hours/days after the fight they would always get into. 

-Nan wasn't a huge part of my life despite living less than an hour from us,  only ever attending maybe 3 or 4 birthdays up to that point,  maybe get a Christmas card with $50 every 2-3 years and a very generic 'dear grandson,  -card message - Nan ' 

So got kicked out of home, so I went full no contact with whole family,  worked my arse off,  never homeless,  made a life for myself,  got married etc all without any family support at all. No one in my biological family has been there for me for any of the gigantic piles of shit life has thrown at me. Not a phone call,  nothing and I've kept the same email addresses I've had since a kid open so they could if they ever needed to get In touch with me as I know they all had them. 

Fast forward 12 years to last week,  I get a call from a mate who has my younger brother on facebook,  (I'm not on FB anymore) and through my friend my mother has reached out to him to get a message to me to say:

'Your Nan is on her deathbed with cancer - you need to come and see her'.

The fact is,  I don't care. These people are nothing more than strangers to me.  And cruel nasty strangers at that, they did nothing but fill me with fear and left me with mental disorders and anxiety problems.

1110,Asshole,"Hi guys, I guess this is a would “we” be the assholes in this situation. I have a roommate (19F) let’s call her Holly for the purpose of this post. I am a 25F living with two other occupants who are 30M & 33M same sex couple who own the house. Holly has lived with us  near on 5 months now. 

Over the last 5 months we have come to notice Holly does not shower - not regularly anyway, her and I share a bathroom and we have seen and noticed her only shower 3 times since she moved in. She constantly has a sweaty/BO smell that follows her everywhere, to the point you can barely be in her company. 

Her bedroom has this same smell, but worse. 
She recently went overseas on holiday - during this time we thought we would clean her bedroom and sheets and linen for her as the BO smell was wafting to other parts of the house even though her door stays closed at all times.

When cleaning out her room we noticed she had not once in the 5 months seen her wash her work uniforms/clothes nor the bedsheets and linen. All the furnishings and bed linen were given to her by the owners of the house when she moved in with us, we have now noticed make up/foundation and food stains all over the pillow cases and duvet covers and also make up stains on the walls. 

We also discovered some of our cups and mugs missing that were sitting under her bed with murky mouldy liquid still sitting in them, we have not once brought up any of these issues with her.  We have politely asked her to move out and given her 2 weeks notice to find somewhere else to live - without once mentioning a reason, the breaking point to all this behaviour was when I went into our shared bathroom too find a green phlegm loagie spat into the basin sink hardened to the surface one morning - no signs of it being cleaned away (it only would belong to her as her and I are the only two that use that bathroom)

My question is - Are we being the assholes for asking her to move out without

1111,Not the A-hole,"So I am from a 3rd world country. My hardworking parents, by living well below their means and saving for years, were able to send me abroad for college. We arent wealthy. Back in my 2nd uni year an American friend of mine invited me to join her trip to the UK. My parents were supportive and wanted me to go on trips and see Europe, to really take advantage of my time studying there. After all, when would I get that chance again? After college the plan for me was to go back to our country and settle down, so I really wouldnt have a chance to go to Europe ever. So I agreed to join this trip. 

My friend is nice and well meaning, and til now I dont have any ill opinion of her. She just came from a very different background than I do. She's from a very wealthy white family in the a conservative southern state of the US. 

So we were traveling and the topic of tipping came up. I was caught by surprise when she mentioned it, first because there simply is no tipping culture in the European country where I study and second it was the UK. I do know that the UK had labour law and labour union and all that. Their servers are paid well above what my middle class parents make back home. So that's exactly what I told my friend, 'why should we tip? These people are paid well above the minimum. It's not the US where customers have to tip to make up the difference'. And the restaurants that we went to werent upscale nor the service exceptional. They were just small ish neighborhood restaurants. Literally all the waiters did was bring us our food. So she dropped the topic. 

A few days later, she brought it up again, telling me I have to start tipping my part because for the last few days she had been tipping my part without my knowledge and it's costing her more than I'd saved. I felt really bad bc I never asked her to do so, and it blew up into a mini argument (neither of us was very confrontational so that was the worst fight we ever had). I was arguing that these servers are well paid and the UK had functioning labour laws. They make more than my parents, who are funding my trip. I am willing to pay for my meal, but not extra to my waiters for following their job description. My friend's only argument was 'it doesnt matter! It's manners' and implied that I'm cheap because of where I came from, which hurt a bit. She said that if I wasnt willing to tip we could go to McDonald's, but honestly prices are about the same whether we go to a McDonald's or these restaurants, the only difference is that someone bring our food to us here. And I didnt wanna be the reason why she couldnt fully enjoy her trip by taking away the eating experiences. She even said 'it's only 1£, it's not even a lot'. In my country, you can have a full lunch with 1£. But in the end I gave in and told her I'd start tipping, but only bc of my friend and nothing else. Maybe I was holding these waiters against impossible standard, you know? But I still feel unjustified about it all. ",97,88,0.91

1113,Everyone Sucks,"Some context: I (22F) just got a new car and am still getting used to the different dimensions of the car. So i pull into an empty space and i didnt realize there was someone in the car to my right. The lady gives me a dirty look, pulls out and re-parks. I waited a minute in the car for my bf to meet me in the parking lot, and I didnt really think much of it. Then when my bf comes to my driver side window the lady gets out of her car and starts yelling at my bf about my ""bad park job"" and that i am ""inconsiderate"" and some other not so nice things I cannot remember at the time. She also mentioned not being able to exit her car and thats why she re-parked.

Also it was my birthday and this happened at like 10am in the morning at a grocery store. I was not in the mood to deal with an angry, middle aged white woman who wanted to lecture me on my park job. So i just walked away. While i walked away i looked at my parking, i was in my spot, and that spot even had the double parking lines--so im confused as to why she didnt have enough space to get out of the car, unless she also parked bad in the first place. As i walked away her yelling got louder and meaner.

My bf also mentioned that he thought maybe i was in the wrong, but then looked at the parking and said maybe she was just a little too big and needed more space to get out of her car, so i couldve been more understanding?? 

SO AITA ?

Edit: if you guys dont trust what i am writing is true, then why answer? Many of you guys are stating that i am ""lying about how i actually parked."" If you think I am lying, why even respond to a inaccurate post?? ANYWAYS to clarify, i also have a small coupe, so when adjusting to new parking dimensions i mean from going to a mini-van to a smaller car, but i still was in the lines, and i was sure there was enough room. It is not like i purposely blocked her in because she is a ""middle aged white woman and im a racist""-- according to some of you. I just mentioned her age and race to give context. I could also say that i am a millennial POC, if that helps!

It was my aunt's birthday last week, they had a party, invited all of us (cousins and other aunts and uncles). 

My aunt (birthday girl) recently became a grandmother to a 1 month old baby (cousin's baby)

Saw my cousin with my aunt, said hi and happy birthday, saw him (cousin) holding his baby and I proceeded to just ignore the baby and move on to other members of the family to say hi.

Everyone who came before and after me was all googoo gaga over the baby, surrounding my cousin. I just proceeded to ignore the baby and talk about other things not relating to the baby.

I had a decent time, it was nice to be there. But a few days later, I was talking to my grandma and she told me that Aunt and cousin found it offensive that I didn't even say congratulations to my cousin or asked how the baby is or what his name is.

1115,Not the A-hole,"I get along well enough with my in-laws so long as no religious talk comes up. When it does happen I usually just laugh it off and change the subject as I'm an atheist and have no intent on converting. My wife is christian but very liberal (Christmas and Easter, doesn't think gay people are sinning kind of thing).

Usually they say grace before meals which is fine, I just stay quiet and let them do their thing before we all dig in. Lately though I think they've wanted me to consider christianity as they've been doing stuff like tagging me in bible verse posts on facebook, trying to convince me and my wife to go to church with them (I'm not stopping my wife from going, she just doesn't want to go either). Kind of uncomfortable but y'know best to just laugh it off and keep the peace.

This time though my MIL asked me to say it. I thanked them for the honor but said I wouldn't be comfortable in it as I don't believe in god and wouldn't know what to say. FIL responded by saying just to give it a go and what's the harm, to just open my heart to the possibility of it and try. I again said I'm not comfortable but my wife put her hand on my knee and gave me a look so I figured just to try my best to indulge them.

1116,Not the A-hole,"I live in a 4 bedroom with 2 other people and I got the master bedroom with the En suite bathroom so when my friend said she wanted to sleep over (she lives 2 hours away) I said yes. We haven't seen each other in months so I thought it would be nice to spend time together since we used to be very close. Anyway, a few incidents happened.

 On Saturday she wanted to cook so I pointed out my kitchen stuff (separated from my housemates'). Well when she was using my non stick pan, she used the metal spatula to stir. I didn't want the coating to come off so I said, ""hey, that spatula is not mine. Here's mine"" and gave her my wooden one. She said my housemate (they met earlier while I was out getting groceries) said it was fine to use her stuff. I told her I prefer her using the wooden one. She just shrugged and took it but I could tell she was offended.

Saturday night I had to leave her for a dinner with my coworkers. I didn't invite her because the dinner was sort of a thank you thing for us completing a project and was paid for using leftover money we collected for the project. My friend was offended she was not invited even after I explained. She said she would pay for herself. However there were about 10 of my coworkers including my boss and the conversation revolved around work anyway so I thought it would be awkward if I suddenly brought another person. No one else brought even their SO. So I left her at home (she has her own car).

On Sunday she did her laundry. She left the clothes in the machine for an hour after it was done because she was on her phone. When she went to get it, she saw that my housemate had taken them out and put them in the basket because she wanted to use the machine. So my friend bitched at me that my housemate was 'so rude' for handling her laundry. I said it was NBD because housemate needed to use the machine too and my friend was taking her time.

Anyway, after she went home I suddenly got a text from her bf basically telling me I was an asshole for making her feel uncomfortable. He said I had no idea how to treat a guest properly and I was rude and unwelcoming. I mean, I tried to be tactful but I guess she was offended anyway. So AITA here?

ETA: I know I'm the AH for the dinner. If it makes a difference, I told her in advance about it. I messed up because I didn't say ""You can't come though"" and let her think it was a casual thing where anyone can join. But other than those 1 hour dinner (I made excuses to leave early), we did spend the whole weekend together. So thanks everyone for pointing out how rude it was to leave a friend alone when they're here as a guest.

Edit/Update: Thank you everyone for weighing in. I do feel a bit better to see lots of NTAs. I replied to the boyfriend asking specifically what my friend said she was upset about but he didn't give me a clear answer. So I texted my friend this morning, apologizing for making her upset and she basically laughed it off and said she had a great time (??). I told her that her bf texted me and she didn't reply. I don't know, maybe she was just venting to her bf and he thought he would go all white knight and defend her honour or something. You guys have also made me question whether I want to keep this friendship. I do realise I've been 'couching' my words with her because she can get offended easily when directly called out. It wasn't a big deal before but this whole weekend visit thing did sort of opened my eyes that maybe, if I can't even say something simple like ""dude, you're gonna scratch my pan with that metal thing"" because I was afraid of her reaction then maybe it's not a healthy friendship anyway. So it feels a little bit like a small personal growth for me. Things are kind of up in the air with us right now but I've decided not to worry so much about it.",133,510,0.95

1120,Not the A-hole,"So, the title is pretty self-explanatory, but I'd like to presente some more details in my defense.

&#x200B;

It's pretty rare to go to parties, even rarer organizing on. Even I am surprised with myself for hosting a karaoke party for this year's birthday. To capitalize on the opportunity, I decided to invite, besides my usual group of usual friends, some folks who I don't see from a long time, whom I studied with back in middle school. And, to my surprise, a big number of people showed interest at the idea, claiming they were sure to show up, even asking if they could invite more people. And, as I thought I'd need a bigger space to accomodate everyone, I rented a big room at the local karaoke parlor.

&#x200B;

Approaching the date, however, I notice the lack of responses at my questions when I ask for confirmations or if anyone needs for me to reschedule the party, I wouldn't mind, for me the trouble of rescheduling(I didn't host it my exact birthday, it was about a week after my birthday) was worthy seeing them again. One would think they simply didn't have the time to answer me, they were busy with their jobs, family, etc. But you'd see the icon that they all read my messages, they simply didn't answer.

&#x200B;

Well, come the big time, and only 5 of friends show up(from the group I already hang on with). And there we are, all 6 of us, in a room supposed to fit 30 people, and of course, with a cost proportional to it. Well, it was frustrating, of course, but there is always next time, unexpected appointments pop up all the time, they certainly must have a good reason for not showing up, right? Well, I suppose so, but they didn't bother telling me. I waited a few days, I didn't want to sound like I was demanding an explanation. And nada. Only a couple of friends bothered explaining why they didn't go. I'll be fair, after some time, I forgot about the issue and had tons of fun with my friends who did show up at the karaoke, but still, I had way more costs than if I rented a smaller room.

&#x200B;

Well, the part where I ask you all if I was an asshole was, after about a week waiting for their explanation, I lost my patience with those who hyped the party only to vanish without a trace, and sent the following message at the messenger group I had set to organize it:

&#x200B;

""Thanks for the good times at the karaoke, my friends.

&#x200B;

For those who showed up, I had tons of fun and I'll hold fond memories of it.

&#x200B;

For those who couldn't show up, and provided me with an explanation, don't worry about it, there is always a next time where we can see each other.

&#x200B;

And for the rest, I wish you a big, fat and long... good evening.""

&#x200B;

I know, that sounds like a passive-aggresive teenage girl... And, of course, my chances of getting a response by then went down to zero. Possibly, a few bridges got burnt with it, but fuck it.

&#x200B;

Still, I'd like to hear your opinion, Am I the Fucking Asshole here?",25,25,0.95
1121,Not the A-hole,"My job recently hired a new girl. We became instant friends due to being the only girls on our graphic design team, similar interests and close in age. She funny and super nice. She already told me so much about her life despite knowing me for about a month now. 

The problem comes in that when it comes to the job duties she severely slacks. She doesn’t follow the design templates, plays on her phone most of the time or skimp details when we’re designing ads. (E.i. Forgets the picture completely or doesn’t use the right font or color.). She spends most of time talking to me or playing on the computer. 

It’s gotten to the point that our Senior Creative Director told me he wants me to retrain her. I’ve tried but she keeps making the same mistakes. Every time she does something wrong, he pulls me aside and tells me not to make the same mistake she did. Out of the 50 mistakes she makes in a week, the director only knows about 3 tops. I don’t like throwing people under the bus. So I cover when I can or act like it’s news to me when the director finds out. Doesn’t help she constantly puts my name on her projects as well. 

For awhile now she’s been using our ink/paper/funds for a her own freelance work. During my shift today, I mentioned to the director that we ran out of ink since I needed to out design plans for a meeting. He was confused since he put in new ink over the weekend and it’s only Monday. So he checked the print list and it was all the new girl. 

He gave a lecture about the ink isn’t for her freelance use, which turned into a critique of her duties and comparing her to me. Basically “Blitznyx would’ve done this. She did the design the right way. Take her example. etc.”. She is now giving me the cold shoulder or attitude. I’m tired of this and her entire work ethic. But soon her lack of work with reflect badly on me. I’m thinking about just telling the director EVERYTHING and have her be his problem. 


WIBTA

Update: It’s her day off today and I’m looking through her files to see if she put my name on any. Well her deadline is tomorrow and has gotten barely anything done. She just has a sketch and yes she put my name on it. So instead of finishing my work that’s due Friday, I have to rush to do hers. If I don’t, I’m guaranteed to get in trouble.",27,51,0.95
1122,Not the A-hole,"My dad, little sister (5) and I (17) live together. My mother passed away 2 years ago. My dad has always told my little sister that she has a ""wee wee"". But where she's going into Kindergarten, I thought she was old enough to know that she has a vagina. So I told her. I didn't give her any other information about males, just females. Just that they have vaginas. Thats all. When Dad found out that I told her, he was pretty upset, as he thinks she's too young to know. I don't know, maybe I did overstep. But I didnt find out until I was going into 2nd grade, and I was told by a school nurse. It was embarrassing to me that I did not know what a vagina was. I just thought that where she is going to be interacting with other people besides family, it is important for her to know. My cousin, had raised her daughter with the word vagina and not using other words and she turned out fine. So I don't know. I feel kind of bad. So Am I the Asshole?",149,231,0.96
1123,Not the A-hole,"I work at a GNC store. (No judgement please, it pays the bills and allows me to attend college classes.) Full disclosure, I earn commission on things.

Last night I had a couple come in looking for weight loss supplements. They're both teachers with limited time so going to the gym isn't always an option. I gave them products that would really work for them. In addition, my commission would have been great. It was going to be a $400.00 sale. I was excited and so were they.

We have this guy who comes in once a month, we'll call him Mr. Regular. Mr. Regular does all of his shopping at a corporate store close to his house. He spends all his money there, earns points and rewards there. However, when it comes time to cash out those rewards, he comes to a franchise store. Franchise stores lose money on people like that because we don't have a corporate safety net. In addition, this guy is a piece of shit. He's rude, condescending, he likes to ""test"" your knowledge and then bully you if you get facts wrong. Plus, he likes to jump in and ""help"" other customers by judging them and bullying them, which makes those folks leave. He's lost us sales in the past.

In the middle of my sales pitch to the couple he jumps in and starts picking apart everything I was going to sell them, going as far as to make up lies and bullshit about the products. He scared them off the sale and the result was a $400.00 sale lost, along with my $30-40.00 commission. I was pissed.

He starts laughing and teasing me, saying things like, ""hope you like sleeping in your car, you failure,"" or ""can I watch when your boss gives you a spanking tomorrow for being a fucking loser?"" I lost my temper and snapped. I snatched the product he was holding out of his hand and went off on him, """"get the fuck out of my store. You can't shop here anymore. I'll be calling the other franchise stores in the area and telling them to flag your account so your deals and rewards are useless anywhere but your home store. You literally just took money out of my paycheck. You're a fucking idiot who knows nothing. You literally screwed me out of part of my paycheck. I hope it was worth it because I'm going to make life a little harder for you now. You're never using points/rewards anywhere but your home store. You can tell them exactly who is screwing them because of you.""

Once he was gone I got on the phone with every franchise store in his transaction history and told them to blacklist him. He now has no option but to cash in his rewards at his home store. I let my asst. manager know about everything. He said he understood why I went off on him and banned him but says I didn't need to have the guy blacklisted from the other stores. He said the guy would probably never come back to our store so problem solved. Now I'm curious, did I go too far?

AITA?

ETA: Let it be known I don't care what people think about my job. I get it some folks think stores like mine are ""snake oil sales"" and don't work. I'm in college full-time and they were the only place willing to work with my schedule. It's a paycheck. I need it to survive. I have no other sources of income or money available. I'm a broke 21 year old trying to better myself. Passing judgement on me like u/pearsonwhohurtyou and everyone judging me for my job in their thread, is an asshole move. I don't pass judgement on your life and job. Focus on the event. Passing judgement for something unrelated goes against the sub's rules. That's like someone posting a judgement call saying ""I'm a cop and AITA for giving a man on his way to his labor wife a ticket because he broke three traffic laws and the speed limit"" being judged for being a cop.",32,31,0.84

1125,Not the A-hole,"Title. 

I've been dating a guy for years and the past two weeks have been the first time I've been able to see him in over a year. We get by pretty well online but it's been great to see him in person for a while.

He lives with his whole family. He just got switched to full time at work so I've been staying mostly in his room while he works (I know, great visit, but they switched his schedule while I was on the way here).  I've been doing some light cleaning and feeding animals and stuff to make up for being here and because what else am I going to do all day? I've been very quiet, totally out of the way, not messy, the only electricity I've used is to charge my phone, I don't even watch their TV and have been buying my own food, stuff like fruit and sandwich stuff that I can keep in boyfriend's room. They didn't even realize I was here for like a week.

Dad and mom were on vacation so they weren't inconvenienced by me at all and I can't imagine my one phone charger or occasional bathroom use ran up the electric bill, but they decided to cut the rent into an extra portion that I'm apparently supposed to pay.

I wasn't planning to pay a bill, they knew I was going to visit and no one told me about rent for the one single time I've been out here to visit in three years (we talked about rent once if I wanted to move in but I'm just visiting for a few weeks not the 6 months+ we talked about). Boyfriend told me to ignore it, but I'm stressed that they're going to confront me about this money I don't have that no one told me I would owe. I didn't charge him rent when he visited me for months so this was just totally unexpected.

If I had visited one day a month since we started dating I would have spent far longer than this in the house so it feels a little absurd and insulting tbh.

Is it normal to charge a guest from out of state for staying over for a few weeks? Would I be the asshole here if I don't pay them?",56,62,0.93

1128,Asshole,"My girlfriend is a native English speaker from the United States, whereas I grew up in Quebec, Canada, with French as my native language. We met when I relocated to California for a job. I'm completely comfortable speaking in English, but since we've moved in together and gotten a bit more serious she's insisted on trying to learn French for me. Part of that is immersing herself in French media. For the past few months, we've been watching Québécois TV together a couple nights a week. This is where the problem arises - for me, this is just supposed to be fun, but for her, this is study time. She always pauses the show in the middle of important scenes so she can look up words she doesn't understand. Plus, she insists on turning on the subtitles so she can better understand what's going on, which I think ruins the comedy. Last night I finally cracked and told her I didn't want to watch TV with her anymore. At first she said it was fine, but this morning she told me I really hurt her feelings. So, reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: This post got a lot more popular than I was expecting! Thanks to all of you for your input. Also, because there's a debate about my girlfriend's language-learning methods in the comments, I want to clarify that she isn't just using TV shows to learn. She's also attending classes and going to meetup groups. Also, when she's watching TV, she's not using English subtitles, she's using French. She's making lots of progress!

It seems that most of you agree that I was the asshole. My girlfriend and I have a very loving relationship, and I feel awful for hurting her feelings, so I took time to talk with her today and apologize. She said she felt hurt that I wasn't more supportive of her efforts to learn French. We've been to Quebec together a few times, and apparently, each time she felt like an outsider because she couldn't speak the language. I had no idea - I always made an effort to include her and translate for her when necessary, but I guess it wasn't enough. From my perspective, I love her language and her culture, and I'm fine with living in it together, but now that I've heard her perspective I understand how important it is for her to learn French so she can really get to know my family better and understand my background. She also mentioned that she's embarrassed that she can only speak English and that her French isn't very good and she speaks with a heavy accent. I reassured her that I find her American accent extremely charming.

Overall, I really didn't realize how sensitive of an issue this was for her. I suppose I thought of this as a hobby of hers, but now I understand that this is her way of showing me how much she loves me and wants our relationship to succeed. So I'd like to think I'm not a complete ass, just a bit daft. Our solution is that we'll spend some time together watching the shows and movies together each week, just not before bedtime. (I think sleep deprivation is part of the reason I'm cranky about it.) She'll write down the words she doesn't know and ask at the END of the show, not in the middle. I also think I'll surprise her with some love letters in French from time to time. Maybe I'll make her a French playlist on Spotify, too? I promise moving forward to being extremely supportive of her efforts.",329,1650,0.96
1129,Asshole,"Im was really ticked off but now that I'm at home I am wondering if I should have gotten angry at her. I have also worked in a customer service industry so I feel guilty and was wondering if i was just being an r/entitledparent 

So anyway, I was at the department store with my 2yo. At this rate she was already quite cranky and we needed to go home. I was in a bit of a rush at this point and when she grabbed a toy to play with I told her to put it down as we needed to go. Cue tantrum. She started to cry and I told her I was going to leave as I am teaching her that tantrums don't get her anything. She's very young and I dont want her to associate tantrums with getting her way. 
Anyway I walk away (3meters) and she is well within ny sight and she can see me too. There are no other customers in the area that she can disturb. My daughter generally knows to come to me when this happens and thats when I talk to her and explain why she cant get the toy anymore.
Out of nowhere this saleslady was like ""excuse me, you cant leave your kid here,"" in a hostile manner. 
I tell her, ""Im standing right here, i am not going to leave my kid by herself""
This goes back and forth a bit and she wouldnt listen to me. 
I told her that I am trying to discipline my kid and I have no intention of leaving her alone and at this point my voice was angry. But she just kept saying I gan leave her there. 
So i just take my daughter and tell her to return the toy and head off.
AITA here?

EDIT:
I was not far from her. I was literally 4 steps away from her and have been standing there for a good minute telling her we need to go. I wasnt threatening her that I was going to leave her there. She normally heads to me straight after she's calmed down. But she wasn't given that time since the sales lady butted in.
I did explain to her that I was trying to disciple my child and was not going to leave her but the lady wouldn't budge.

For those angry at me for the way I am raising my kid. I hear you and I do understand your input. I'll try another way to handle her when she gets to that point.",198,127,0.86
1130,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend was my best friend growing up and he's always showed OCD traits, but has never gotten a formal diagnosis. I am not being an armchair psychologist when I say he has OCD - pretty much everyone who has spent an extended amount of time with him has agreed that he has it. He is deathly afraid of germs and getting sick and even the word ""vomit"" makes him sick. I've tried encouraging him to get help but he puts it off.

He owns his own apartment which has two bathrooms. I stay there a few nights a week, but usually me staying there comes with rules. Most of the rules are easy to follow, usually simple things like shower before getting into his bed or leaving my shoes near the front the door.

However, the reason I'm posting about this, is he has a dumb rule. One bathroom is for peeing, and the other is for pooping. The bathroom in the masterbedroom is the one where we can pee, and the other is for poop. He says it's because it puts him further away when he is in his room. 

The other night I had came over after eating burritos, and woke up to the worst stomachache of my life. Suddenly I had to go, and I just skipped over to the masterbath to relieve myself and, of course, that included going number two. Somehow he had woken up while getting out of bed and he noticed I'd been there for a while. When I came out, he asked if I pooped, and when I said yes he got really frustrated and told me that was the one rule he really didn't want me to break (it's also where he keeps his toothbrush, and now claims he has to get a whole new one). I told him it was ridiculous and I really had to go, and he replied that it was his place and brought up the fact that I don't pay the bills there. That part kind of hurt, because I am in-between jobs and he knows that.

Eventually I just packed my stuff up and went home where I can use the bathroom freely. I tried texting him about that night but he insists he wasn't in the wrong somehow. Was I the asshole?",108,289,0.92
1131,Not the A-hole,"In May my friend and I moved into a really nice apartment in a great part of the city we live in. I graduated from college a few days prior, and now have a decent job that allows me to pay my rent and utilities, and have a little extra at the end.

Anyway, a few weeks after we moved in, an old friend of ours started sleeping over with him and its blossomed into a full-blown relationship. She's been here every night since the end of May. The thing is, she hasn't contributed at all to the cost of our living here. She does all her laundry and everything else here. She even moved a dresser and extra TV into his room. 

Now, I haven't said anything for the entire summer, but our electricity and water bills are substantially higher than what they would be with two guys using them. I became internally annoyed over the past few weeks and finally told them that she needs to pay 1/3 of our utilities and a small % (15) of rent cost. 

She works full-time, has no bills aside from phone and gas for her car, and is much closer to her work because of where we live. She could have lived at her sister's house, but her sister was making her pay $400 per month, (which is still *super* cheap). 

They both became agitated that I asked her to put forth her fair share of our rent. I had to literally negotiate for $300 per month. Which is about 12% total of our monthly cost to live here. The price she's paying for the area we stay in is still amazing, but she's mad. 

I don't know why my roommate is against her paying her fair share. I suspect he may fear her leaving him if she can't stay here for free. I grew tired of feeling used, because, without my 50%, neither of them could live here anyway.

I am currently 22 and going to college, mom helps me out by having me live with her still. I have a 14 year old litte sister and started driving her to school ( on my offer) because I know how much it sucks sometimes take the bus. Been doing this for a year.

One day, I come home, and go to my room to see that it's fucked. We had carpet floors and there were chips everywhere, spilled over food ect. My bed was undone, PlayStation controllers greasy and TV left on, my draweres were open. Game cases left opened, disks were greasy too. 

Mom was down stairs. I asked my mom if she invited the neighbors' kids over or something since my room was basically trashed. Confused, my mom says no but mentioned that ""the boys you tutor came by"". That put me off and I was confused. Mom then tells me that lil sis invited some boys over and went to my room to play videogames. When she asked if lil sis had my permission, lil sis said that I tutored those kids and let them play my games all the time. I told her that this was false.

Mom came with me to my sister's room. I asked her why she invited a bunch of boys to my room and why she thought it was okay. She got upset and says ""look, I was just trying to impress one of them. It's not a big deal. Just clean it up"".  I got angry but mom gave het punishment by having her clean up the mess made. Before that, I told her that I would no longer be driving her to school unless she actually gave a proper apology. I let my mom know too just in case.

I cleaned your room so get over it! It's not fair I have to waste money for the bus!"". I told her that ""the mess was your fault. You're responsible for it. I don't HAVE to drive you"". 

She goes and cries to my mom. My mom thinks I'm being harsh by not driving her and should think about how she feels in all of this since she's still young and just made a mistake. But I think it's perfectly reasonable for what happened and how she hasn't gave me an apology. AITA?",43,183,0.98
1133,Not the A-hole,"I (31m) like to have a comfortable shower. I can’t stand cold water, and I don’t like pools unless they’re heated or it’s so hot they’ve become warm. 

The shower in my apartment is cold. Based on a thermometer, it’s coming out at about 62 degrees (f). It stays that temperature for about five minutes, then suddenly skyrockets to whatever you’ve set it to. The building is large, and has one water heater, so I assume it’s just because it takes forever to get to us. 

My husband (30m), gets extremely angry and talks about the environment, the energy waste, and just the amount of time I’m wasting. He thinks I should just suck it up and hop in, because otherwise it’s a huge waste. 

Info: I have asthma and cold water makes it hard to breathe. It doesn’t cause an asthma attack, or lock up symptoms. I don’t even know if it’s asthma related. I just can’t breathe well when I’m cold, and the shower is cold enough for me to feel that unless it’s warmed up.

I’m also English (although now live in the US) so wasn’t bought up with the tipping culture so for me a $100 tip feels like a huge amount of money as a thank you for a couple of hours work.

I was furious because in the past we have had issues with my MIL eating food I specifically bought for myself and not replacing it, and then becoming defensive because “we’re a family and we share things”. The next morning my in-laws mentioned that the pie was delicious, to which I told them I was saving it to share with coworkers. They were both apologetic, with MIL specifically stating that because were a family, she thought all food in the house is fair game (despite me and fiancée having a fridge that they don’t use). At first I was understanding, but when the pie was brought up again later I stated “I just wish that I had been asked first before you guys ate it” my MIL stated that she allows me to eat any groceries or food that she bought or prepared. While this is true, I ALWAYS ask before I take something, just in case there is a food item being saved for some reason.

1137,Not the A-hole,"8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they’ll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it’s name. It’s hilarious. 
I had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I’ll be chatting to someone that hasn’t met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it’s a dead joke. 
Well, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim’s name, said “what?” So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they “heard about my joke” and that they didn’t appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

I honestly don’t get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog’s dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I’ll accept your judgement on it.

EDIT: it’s a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I’ll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

I should have been clearer, but I guess I didn’t know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

The truth is that I say the word “Askim” multiple times a day. I’m aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it’s just a thing I call my dog. When going out I’m not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn’t trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn’t even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. 

It’s been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it’s very true. I really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community Facebook page, especially now that I know it’s Turkish meaning and that it’s a town in Norway and neighborhood in Sweden.",1870,17940,0.91
1138,Not the A-hole,"Alright, this is going to be a bit of a whirlwind.

So about 10 months ago I was notified at about 10pm at night that my car was hit and my father and his friend were pretty sure they knew who did it from a description of the car that hit me from a watchful old neighbor (Thanks, Greg.) Well, they had found him at the local bar and was already intoxicated when he arrived at the bar, which was confirmed by multiple witnesses. So I drive down there obviously very upset, I had this car for maybe 3 months and it was brand fucking new. However, I was recording, so I kept my cool. We got him to call his insurance company and get me a claim # while also admitting fault on the phone and on my video. 

The insurance agent then called me and we got the car taken to a local shop which they worked with and I happen to know was a very good place for collision work.

Now here's where I feel like I was the asshole. I was absolutely vindictive at this point. I wanted this guy to suffer. So I waited, and waited until I got my car back, as was advised by the legal counsel I was receiving. Once I had it back, we tallied up the costs of me having to pay certain rental fees his insurance didn't cover, the time I was out of my car, plus any other damages associated with this happening, and we pressed charges. 

We went to court and provided video of him arriving to the bar while intoxicated, multiple witness accounts from the neighbor and patrons at the bar, pictures of my car and how extensive the damage proved to be with the receipt  from the collision center that showed it was almost 6k in damages to the bumper and trunk area alone. 

Needless to say, the jury and judge threw the book at him. I was awarded significant compensation that totaled more than what his insurance paid to fix my car, plus the local police got involved and were looking into pursuing a DUI as well as leaving the scene of the accident. 

Now about 4 months later I saw him in public and I noticed the truck he had was full of all the stuff he owned and he had his wife with them and it looked like they were sleeping in the car in the parking lot they were in, and it was the middle of winter. I did a little asking around town and it turned out they had gotten thrown out by their landlord for lapsing on rent shortly after I had won my case against him, and he had also lost his job from serving a small time in jail for the DUI/leaving the scene. 

I went home and felt sick to my stomach, a man is now on the street, homeless with his wife and I haven't seen him since but I hope he's okay wherever he went. 

I really feel like I went too far and like I should give the money back to him as a way of saying, ""Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your life.""

AITA? Did I go too far?",206,399,0.95
1139,Not the A-hole,"I like watermelon on pizza. I was asked to do it on a dare and I really liked it. So I put watermelon on my pizza now. Never had any problems aside from people calling me crazy, until a few hours ago.

I invited my friend, John, over for pizza a few weeks ago. I told him I’d bake one for both of us, because I’m really good at making pizza. 

About an hour until he comes over and I texted him at the store “Hey John. What kind of pizza toppings do you want?” 
He responded with “Whatever you like man. You’re making it.” 
I responded with “Are you sure? I like watermelon on my pizza.” 
John replied “Sounds delicious. Can’t wait to try it.”

I thought he was completely serious so after the pizza was done baking I put the watermelon on. 5 minutes later John knocks on the door. We’re both excited and he screamed “What the fuck!” when he saw the pizza. He was really confused as to why there was watermelon on our pizza. 

I didn’t realize this but John was being sarcastic. I never told him I actually liked watermelon on pizza until today. He was really mad so I went ahead and made him another pizza. We had a good laugh about it like an hour later but I was just wondering was I an asshole for listening to what he said by putting watermelon on the pizza?",84,1569,0.88

1142,Not the A-hole,"INFO: We are both guys. I am gay, my fiancé is bi.

My fiancé proposed to me last month. We’re on a trip to the Netherlands to meet his family. We live in the U.S., his family knows *of* me, but we’ve never met.

My fiancé hadn’t seen his mother since he was 18 (he’s 26 now). He said that he and his mother were never really close.

We were originally planning to stay in a hotel room for the entire trip but his mother insisted that we stay at the house for the night and leave for the hotel in the morning. He hadn’t seen her in 8 years, I suggested that we stay with her.

We arrived and were greeted by his sisters. They were all very welcoming and also seemed happy about the engagement. 

His mother was the opposite. The first thing she did was turn to my fiancé and say,”I thought that you would’ve brought a girl.”

My fiancé completely ignored her statement. She said something about dinner and walked off. I didn’t get to introduce myself.

Dinner. My fiancé’s mom kept making remarks. “Why my fiancé couldn’t ‘at least find an attractive man?’, amongst other things.

This women somehow managed to hit every single insecurity of mine, and I was starting to get upset.

Maybe it showed. My boyfriend excused the both of us from the table and he asked me if I was okay. I told him that I was fine. He said that we can leave if his mother was making me uncomfortable. I inisisted that I was okay. I could last the night.

Then came time to retire. We were going up my fiancé’s room when his mother *kindly* offered me the couch.

My fiancé said that he’d be sharing a room with me, she made excuses, my fiancé walked away. Few minutes later, she swung open the door.!She said something about wanting us to keep it open ? She said she didn’t trust me.

This women was getting on my nerves. I snapped. “We’re not teenagers, but if you want to see us fuck so badly, you’re welcome to stay”, along with a few other choice words. She had a fit. She told me that I wasn’t welcome here anymore.

She told my fiancé to stay, but my fiancé said he was leaving with me. She started yelling at him, mostly insults about ‘his choice in men’. We left and now we’re spending the night in the rental car.

My fiancé told me not to feel bad about what I said, and that she had it coming. But I still feel like a jerk because:
1. I made her cry, like yeah, she was being a bitch but I probably could’ve handled it better.
2. My fiancé ended up getting chewed out for something *I* said. My fiancé doesn’t deal with getting yelled at too well.

I feel like I ruined something. AITA?

1143,Not the A-hole,"I was walking out of Target tonight after checking out and happened to walk by a guy randomly leaning against a post with his phone out. As I walked by I could see he was recording people in the self check out line all of whom were women. 

It gave me a really weird feeling because:
1) I was just in the line he was recording  and
2) I couldn't understand why someone would need to do that in the first place. 

I turned around, walked up next to him and confronted him. 

Me: Hey. What are you doing?

Weird guy looks startled and pulls his phone out of sight: I'm recording my girlfriend.

Me: Really? Which one is she?

WG: The one at the end. Why? Is it really any of your business?

Me: I just want to make sure you're not recording random women.

WG: It's none of your business.

Me: It's kind of weird.

He's getting cranky so I left the store and planned to call from the safety of my locked car to report it. Then I saw them actually walk out together so I felt somewhat less creeped out. I'm not happy that WG has a video of me on his phone but whatever. If you want to record your girlfriend maybe don't do it in a busy public place in a city where human trafficking isn't a real concern.

Baby was fine, thankfully, but I don’t want her holding this baby until it can support it’s own head.

1146,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend has lived in the US for many years and has completely perfect English. When we began dating, I tried very hard to study French, since his family speaks French. For a year, I did duolingo, paid for another app with French lessons, and would speak to my boyfriend using simple French during dinner every night.
 I put in so much work, but being a 30F with absolutely zero French background and a full time job, living in the US and not knowing anyone but him who speaks French, I honestly didn’t get that good. When I met his family, I couldn’t understand anything that was going on and felt extremely left out. Even though they all speak virtually perfect English from studying it for many years and even consume most of their entertainment in English (all their books and tv and movies were in English), while I was a guest they spoke French the entire time. When I tried to speak French, no one was excited or complimentary (not saying they owe it to me but I thought it was nice of me to try) and they acted appalled that I couldn’t understand what they were saying at dinner, even though I worked so hard to learn some French before arriving. I find it very hurtful and after hearing them speak English perfectly, I don’t think it’s fair anymore for them to have the expectation that I will learn French just for occasional visits when I am an American living in the US where their son has also chosen to live his life. Of course they should speak whatever language they want in their own home, but it is a little rude to invite me to visit and then shame me for not being good at French when I practiced so hard and spent so much money and all my vacation days to come meet them.

So we're at a restaurant as a family, wifey, two sons, and myself. It's a decent restaurant, not super fancy but not McDonald's either. We saying at our table and enjoying our meal while some other kids are running around the restaurant. One of the kids throws a straw on the floor. My youngest son sees the scene and immediately friends upon the other kid, then he angrily stands up and goes on to pick up the straw on the floor and puts it on our own table. I told him it was not his responsibility to cleanup someone else's mess in a restaurant and that if some customers are misbehaving is between them and the restaurant manager. My son on the other hand thinks I have an AH mindset, that it was responsible to act, and that he's being a role model. I told him I think that being a role model is to behave properly in the restaurant, not to cleanup the place.

My wife thinks my son is right to cleanup the mess, while my other son thinks like me that this is none of our business.

Minutes before we were talking about this sub and a couple of recent ""cases"" debated here, so my wife suggested I write this post to see what you guys think. So, AITA for telling my son to NOT cleanup the mess other kids caused in a restaurant?

I told her I went to a movie recently too: Midsommar. She said she hadn't heard of it.

I told her ""oh you should go see it! Take your kids, I bet they'd love it!"" (I had a tough time stopping myself from laughing.) She said something like ""oh cool I'll check it out!""

1149,Not the A-hole,"I do not have good relationship with my parents. Growing up the were emotionally abusive (my father more constant screaming in my face, and my mother more emotionally manipulating). I was essentially the crutch/punching bag for my parents growing up.

Currently I live with my SO of 5 years. My mother has been after me non-stop to visit them again since the last time (July 2018). I have been making excuses that are for the most part true. I recently gotten a new job and I have been putting time into that, and don’t really have the money to spend on tickets OR take off of work. 

After months of asking, she texts me in June asking if we would fly out to surprise my dad for his bday Friday, if she would purchase our tickets. I didn’t want to agree, but she made sure to use my fathers heart condition against me and I felt backed into a corner. I agreed reluctantly.  

Up until last week, there was ZERO talk about tickets. I’ll admit I was hoping that it would fall through, but from persistence from my bf I asked my mom what the status was with the tickets. I immediately receive a confirmation code for 2 arrival tickets. I am then given a confusing story of an original round trip being purchased through 1 airline, only for her to realize she had points through another airline with an earlier time she preferred - so she then purchases the arrival flight I received - and says she is going to contact the original airline to see if she can drop the arriving flight and keep the departing flight. 

Over this past weekend I ask again where the return flight is and the story keeps changing or there’s some excuse. “Oh I left my charger at home for my laptop I can’t email you the code” or “I bought it through my work email and I can’t access that from home”. Today I asked her to please email the information so my bf and I can make arrangements for travel as well as make sure we are home in time, as we both work the next day. She finally texts me today saying that the new return flight won’t be purchased until *the night before we leave*. 

At this point my bf and I are getting extremely nervous about this trip. I am having horrible anxiety about being there in general, on top of the flight issues. My parents can be very shady. One of many examples being, when I was still living with my parents, I flew back to the state I live in now to visit my bf. While I was away, my parents sold my car that I paid for entirely myself and kept the money. (It was a long line of made up/constantly changing stories and lies until eventually I never saw a dime from it. Very similar to what’s happening now). 

My bf and I have a theory there was no original round trip purchased. My bf is also saying that if the return flight isn’t purchased before we leave, that we should not get on the flight.

1150,No A-holes here,"I am staying in Kansas on a trip. I was going to stay with a friend in Missouri but it got late and I hate driving in the dark, so I decided to find a cheap place to stay. 
    I found a motel that said $66/night. When the front desk lady was checking me out the total came to $96(fees+pet fee for my dog.) I told her that I wasn't expecting to pay that much, and I'm sorry but I am going to have a look around to see if I can find something more my price. 
     So I go back to my car and am checking Expedia when the desk lady comes knocking on my window. She says one of their regulars overheard and wanted to pay for my room. I was surprised and kinda confused because what motel with no bar or restraunt has a regular? I asked what he wanted in return, and she replied ""nothing, he comes here every week and just said he liked your dog and wanted to help out."" 
   (I didn't even bring my dog in the lobby, so he must have just seen him in my car while I was trying to get a room...)
   So I follow her into the lobby, and the guy is sitting there at a table eating a sandwich. I look at him and say ""Are you sure??"" He says ""Yeah. I saw your dog and like him. Plus I saw you are from(the state I'm from) and I go there with my wife for college football games."" 
   So I said thank you very much, and that it really helps me out. 
    The lady gave me the key to the room. She also said my room number out loud which made me feel uncomfortable because now dude knows....

    I called family and everyone said it seems weird but he was probably just being nice. All except for my sister who said no way don't do it.

A couple weeks ago, we went couch shopping on a weekend and discussed designs we like, our budget, etc. The following day while I was at work, she texted me all excited about the new couch she got for us. I was initially very upset that she decided on it without me, and communicated as such. She knew how hurtful it was to me that she did not consider my opinion but insisted that it was a great couch and I would love it.

The couch is ok. It’s not something I would’ve agreed on had we been out together, but since the deed was done, I wasn’t going to set our relationship aflame because of it. After letting her know that I felt betrayed by her choosing without me, she promised to include me in future decisions and we dropped it. 

I use the couch too of course, it’s in my home. But I am not exceedingly thrilled about it like she is. I also think it was way too expensive, but since she bought it on her own with her own credit I just assumed that meant the couch was fully hers and she would be taking it if we ever broke up. Maybe this is where I went wrong, because I did not establish right then and there that I wasn’t paying for this couch I had no say in.

Today we were discussing financials and I mentioned that I have a little extra cash than I expected right now, and she said that’s great because we can put it towards the couch. It was like I could hear the record scratch in my head. I told her she’s nuts if she thinks I’m helping her pay for it; she can take it back and get something we both like if she wants me to help pay it off, and now she’s so angry with me she doesn’t even want to talk about it.

I did not want this couch. I wouldn’t have picked this couch for us, she knew I was upset that she picked it without me and that it was out of my price range, and now expects me to help her pay for this couch I explicitly told her I am not happy with and cannot afford?

Am I the asshole here?


Update: Turns out there was a lot more to unpack here relationship-wise than I was aware of, but we’ve managed to talk things out. Sucks that we had to have such a dramatic catalyst to open the conversation, but she has agreed it’s fair that she pays the couch off herself and now we’re aware of some things that we need to work on as a couple.

1154,Not the A-hole,"So I'm due to have my second baby in about a month. I don't want my mother-in-law to be there or know until after baby is delivered.

This relates to around when our first kid was born and I'm going to try to make this short. We just moved from out-of-state and were living with my in-laws until we got our own place. I was overdue and induced. When we were on our way around 10 pm my MIL called saying she was on her way too. No biggie, it's her first grandchild so she's understandably excited. She decided on her own that she was going to stay with us overnight.

Fast forward to the next morning. I'm a pretty sentimental person and was going through some depressed feelings about having this baby. I was going to miss my alone time with my husband and wanted to spend some moments with only him. I'm not very outspoken so when MIL was in the bathroom I suggested to my husband that he ask her if she wants to go home to freshen up or eat breakfast or rest. Seriously nothing was happening still besides me laying in the hospital bed and having contractions that were super tolerable. He suggests it to her and she leaves, seemingly no problems.

About 15 minutes later we get a call from my brother-in-law and he sounded kinda pissed. He said that MIL called him bawling saying that we don't want her there and told her to leave. My husband had to call her and apologize and practically beg her to come back. She showed back up as if everything was normal and decided to stay in the room until I wanted my epidural. I wasn't allowed to have anyone else in the room, even my husband, when I was getting it but I learned after that she was going around saying that I kicked her out again. After it was done she came back in again as if everything was fine. Couple hours passed and baby was finally coming, for *months* I had emphasized the only person I want in the room was my husband. Yet again this woman starts crying when asked to leave. 20 mins after delivery there I am laying spread eagle on the delivery table and having my hoo-ha stitched up and bonding with baby, my MIL walks in. The meds finally start wearing off and I am pissed but still don't say anything. I spent the entire time worrying about her and making sure that I wasn't stepping on her toes.

I could probably write a book on shitty things that my MIL has said/done to me. Putting all that aside, this one is the main reason why I don't want her to know when I'm going into labor. My husband really understands why I feel this way and says it is up to me but I have to be ready for the consequences of my decision. She's always been over-dramatic and I don't want to be dealing with her when I'm supposed to be focusing on myself and the baby. I really don't want her to be there. WIBTA?

edit: thank you so much everyone for the responses! I definitely wasn't expecting this much feedback. 
Back when we were living with my in-laws I was severely depressed and felt like since they were sharing their home with us I didn't have a say in a lot and felt like I just needed to be grateful, so I didn't say a lot. We were paying weekly rent and buying groceries but I never felt comfortable there.
Now that we're in our own house my husband and I definitely feel like we're in a better place, both individually and in our marriage. For example, my MIL and BIL used to make shit up and put it in my head that my husband was cheating on me. My PPD was pretty bad because of them. I love my husband and he is also an amazing father. I tell him he's a closet Mama's boy but he just denies it over and over. He's chewed her out before though for stuff that she's said.
I've developed more of a spine now being on our own and realizing how much fucked up shit they put me through and put in my head. I'd honestly have no problem cutting them off but don't for the sake of my baby and husband's relationship with them. Stay tuned for my next post of AITA for cutting off my husband's family?

1155,Not the A-hole,"So my girlfriend and i (both in our twenties) got invited to go on a vacation that her brother, brother’s wife and their three kids (all ages 7 and below) planned to go on for 12 days. I was very happy to go, but since i have a job that is kind of shitty with vacations, i only went for five days. 

At first, my gf told me that i could stay for free, which i was very gracious about, because my job doesn’t pay that much. From the get go i was told I’d have to pay my share of meals, which i found perfectly understandable. 

So it came as a big surprise when my gf’s sister in law sent her a text of what i owed. It included everything from a portion of gas they used, to a portion of the car they rented, a portion of the general supplies they bought, and the biggest shock, a portion of the Airbnb they rented. (All rated for five days of use and a quarter of the five days price).

I was livid to my gf, and she said there must have been a miscommunication between her and her sister about the Airbnb. I was understanding (although shocked and a little pissed) but am even more angry about the other portion of the bill. 

I think that because they would have done things like the car regardless of me (and it was something i had no say in choosing) it was incredibly petty and cheap to ask for me to pay a portion of it. There’s also the fact that they make over six figures, and I’m a recent college grad struggling to make ends meet in my first real job.

1161,Asshole,"I work at a laidback coffee shop in a major American city. I like my shop, have worked there for years and I’m in good standing with the owner and most of the regulars. 1-2 times a week I have to close the shop and these shifts are BORING. It’s 8 hours of working solo just cleaning shit and serving about 1-2 customers per hour. A while ago I got the bright idea of bringing headphones so I can listen to podcasts and audiobooks after I locked the doors. One day I just decided to listen once the shop got relatively slow 4-5 hours before actually closing, and it makes the shift so much more enjoyable. (I remove them when I’m making drinks and talking to customers obviously). I occasionally get dirty looks from people, and I get it, it’s very unprofessional but it’s such an improvement on my day I don’t think I’m going to stop. AITA?

Edit; since it’s coming up a lot I want to elaborate on something. No I haven’t told my boss(the owner ) but I don’t feel like I need to and let me give some context. There was a guy who used to work here who would drink during these shifts and always was still drunk/ hungover for the more busy morning shift and my boss loved the guy. They were like best buds, now he didn’t “know” this guy was doing this but he knew (if you guys know what I mean). I think if the owner did find out I was doing this because a customer told him or something, I might get a talking to (but then again I might not, I honestly don’t know) and I would definitely stop then.",88,45,0.74

1163,Asshole,"For background, I live in a house with 2 other people, and we're all grad students in our early/mid twenties. The oldest of us, call her Sarah, pays a lot more attention to cleanliness than me and the other guy.

Now we come to the trash. Sarah wants us to take initiatives with taking out the trash, so whoever sees that it's full can take it out. (She also wanted us to do the same thing when it comes to cleaning in the kitchen, but since me and the other guy are a lot less fussy about it, most cleaning ends up being done by her, and we all seem to be ok with it.) With the trash, it ends up being Sarah taking it out, mostly just because me and the other guy are more busy/pay less attention to these things. Once in a while she will explicitly tell us to take out the trash, and we do, but she always comes across very angry and hostile when she asks.

A few days ago, in a group chat with my roommates and some other friends, someone made a joke with the point being that women like it when you do things without being asked to. Sarah replied saying ""this is pretty accurate, like with @OP @otherguy and taking out the trash."" Even though it was a follow up to a joke, I thought it was very unnecessary for her to call me out like this, and her attitude regarding the whole thing is unreasonable. I have suggested in the past that we should have a rigid rotation of the chores/trash duty, but she turned it down saying she doesn't mind doing most of it since she has higher standards. But she thinks I should ""grow up and do the adult thing"" which is to take initiatives when it comes to the trash, whereas I think she's just setting herself up for unhappiness with the way she's organizing this, and it's not really my fault that she has to explicitly tell us to take out the trash, so she should cut out the hostility.

1165,Not the A-hole,"We just got back 30 minutes ago from what was supposed to be a ten day trip to my folks cottage (rental) I've been going up for 24 years and my wife and I have been together for 13 of those. We have a one year old who last month managed ten days in France for my brother in Law's wedding without a hitch. 
We got to the cottage Saturday at 11pm. The kid didn't go down for bed. Every time one of us put him in the playpen or packable bed he woke up screaming. At 2 am we gave in and coslept for the first time ever. It was tight being a double bed (I'm 6'1, 275lbs) but we made it through. He napped Sunday in the bed with wifey beside him. Sunday night again, won't go down anywhere except the bed with her. He's up fairly frequently through the night. She gets up at 5 and starts yelling at me that it's driving her insane and we need to go home. I ask her to stop yelling. She wakes my mother up. Wife and kid go to living room, grandma goes too. I wait in bed for 15 then get up. Wife won't make eye contact so I go to dock to throw a line in.
Sometime around 6 she goes back to bed with the boy, doesn't tell me. I see him in Grandpa's arms at 9. 
Wife still won't talk to me except to say she wants to go home. I say fine, if that's what you want you pack. She lies down with boy for another 2 hours. I go outside to play horseshoes with my folks since she demands silence inside when the boy and her are sleeping. She gets up and glares at me. I say ""the truck isn't packed."" She points at the stuff. We take the boy down to the dock to catch a fish with Grandpa, pack up and leave. Total time at cottage 35 hours. 
Why I'm so pissed. Wife tells me my ideas of sleep training are not wanted, appreciated or to be spoken of. Sleep is her domain. Will not try anything but feeding and rocking (until the cosleep Sunday morning)
Additional pissed reason. My dad had cancer last year. They got it, he's had four clean checkups since, but he's 70 with diabetes and a heart condition (bad heart attack 10 years ago, almost lost him)
Next year my folks are going to England for a family reunion, so no cottage, meaning the next chance for family cottage time is 2021, assuming everyone is alive.

1167,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have been married for 2 years. I turned 30 last Thursday. On Friday my wife threw threw me a big surprise birthday party at our house. I was completely shocked. She invited 30-35 of our mutual friends, decorated our whole house, cooked food for the event (and catered some), organized games and even got a friend to act a a DJ. The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated all the effort she put into it. I arrived at the party at around 8:00 and by 12:00 most people had left but there were still a few people there hanging around. She and her 2 sisters were starting to clean up

The thing is I have a good friend who owns a night club. That Friday was the opening day of the club and I had promised him I would make an appearance to show support.  I had mentioned this to my wife in the past but she doesn't know this guy very well an I guess didn't take it that seriously. I had also asked my wife if we had any plans that Friday and she would just say she wanted to go watch a movie, so I figured we could watch the movie and I could still go to the night club with no issue. Well alas, this surprise party happened and although I truly appreciated it, I didn't want to break the promise to my friend so at around 11:45 when the party had winded down I decided to leave to go to the club to fulfill my promise. My wife didn't make a huge deal about it at the time although I could tell she was annoyed.

However the next day she was obviously angry about it and told me she thought it was rude to just leave a birthday party she put so much effort into to go to a club and I made it seem like I didn't care. I again emphasized how appreciative I was of the party but this is something I had promised the guy but she doesn't seem to understand and says I could go to the club ""any day"" and thought was an asshole for just leeaving guests and her sisters there to clean.

Some of our mutual friends are saying the same thing and think it was weird that I just left. I think everyone is being ridiculous. I didn't know about the birthday party when I promised my friend I would show up and I just didn't want to break a promise.

Today, Stan texted the group asking if Kenny or I would switch rooms so he could have a guy spend the night. The other guys texted me separately saying they were uncomfortable with the idea and didn’t want a stranger at our AirBnB, and didn’t want to hear our friend hooking up. 

I was the one that arranged the trip and set it all up so it all landed on me to make a decision. I told Stan that we are all adults and are free to do what we want, but if he wants to spend the night with another guy then to do it somewhere else. 

He argued that we all paid the same for the AirBnB and that it’s not fair. 

I said that even if he had his own room, we would all still be uncomfortable with him bringing guys over. No one switched rooms and he told us we ruined his vacation.

1170,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory “this is a throwaway” and such. 

If you don’t know what a canvasser is, it’s those people who like to get your attention on the street to get you to donate to a cause or something, and they usually start by asking you if you’re nice or have a minute. If you live in NYC (or probably any big city I’m not sure), you know who they are. 

Anyway, I’m a dog walker in NYC. Been doing this a decade. I see the SAME canvassers EVERY DAY. I have the same route on weekdays. So every day I’m being stopped by the same person (sometimes 2-3 times a day) and they like to rile up my group of dogs to get me to stop, or go “Hey it’s you again!/I remember you! How are you?”, or “What breed is this dog?” and i try to be polite by saying, “Sorry I’m not interested,” “My apologizes I’m busy/on a time crunch,” “Please don’t excite my dogs,” and so forth.

Today the same canvasser bothered me THREE times, to/from the dog park with my group of 4, and then again when I was heading with a different group a few hours later. On my way back to do drop offs with the second group, I passed by the same canvasser again, who once again tried to get me to stop. I said my pleasantries and kept moving. 

However, maybe 20ft later, one of the dogs I was walking had to pop a squat for a poop. Totally fine. I’m getting my baggy ready, my other pups are calm. This. Damn. Canvasser. Comes by and stands on the other side of the poop pile, bends down and tries to hand me a pamphlet and tells me “now you have time to talk!”

You must be kidding me lol. 

So, I pick up my little steaming hot mushy poop pile, tie the bag, and look this canvasser in the eye, and tell them I’m going to fling this damn bag of shit into their face they don’t leave me alone.

1171,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. So a little background info about my girlfriend and I: I’m a 25 year old male and she’s a 29 year old female. We have been dating for close to two years now. We have been talking about marriage for the last 6 months and up until this point, have had little to no issues. We both work 6 days per week and live approximately 30 minutes apart. She is very traditional, is an immigrant, and still lives with her parents. In her culture, women live with their parents until marriage. 

About two months ago, We had plans to go on a date at 2:30 pm. That morning I called her to make sure we were still on for 2:30. She asked if it was okay if we met at 3 instead, to which I agreed. At 2:30, I was about to leave my house to go pick her up. She texted me as I was pulling out of my driveway and said that she was going to the store with her dad to get supplies for their family business, but that she would be ready at 4.  I’m annoyed at this point, but I understand. At 4 pm, I’m at our normal meeting spot, but she’s nowhere to be found. She won’t answer her phone and isn’t texting me back. At 4:15, she calls me and is very apologetic, saying her dad took way longer than normal but that she can meet at 5.  At this point, I’m boiling over and I decide to drive back home. I told her that if she wanted to spend time together, she could come over. When she came over, I expressed to her that I felt it was disrespectful to keep postponing the meet-up time and to have me drive 30 minutes, only to find out that she can’t meet up for another hour. She apologized and said she understood my point of view.

Fast forward to today. As I mentioned, she comes from a very traditional household. Her father wants her home by 7-7:30 Pm every night. We had plans to meet at 2:30 pm. Our plans were to drive to a town approximately 2 hours away, eat at our favorite restaurant, and have her back home at 7:30.  called her around 12:30 to make sure we could still see each other. She asked if it was okay if we met at 3 instead.  This only gave us 4 hours together, but I told her it was fine and I would see her at 3. As I’m leaving my house at 2:30 to pick her up, she texts me something along the lines of “baby I’m sorry, is it okay if we meet at 3:30, my mom wants me to go eat with her and my sister.” I’m not a mathematician, but I knew that 4 hours of driving, plus eating dinner would not give us enough time to do what I had planned for us. I told her that I wasn’t upset, but that she should spend time with her family instead and that I would see her next week. She insisted on still meeting up, but I explained to her that because she postponed our plans an entire hour later, we would not be able to do what I had planned for us. I felt this was disrespectful to my time and it was clear that going on a date together was not her priority.

1178,Not the A-hole,"Hello redditors. I hope you like my story. Throwaway because my wife knows my reddit account. 

I'm from a south Asian background. So it's not uncommon for people like me to go through arranged marriages. So about 2 years ago. That's exactly what happened. I got married to a beautiful girl. Yeah it was sudden, and would've liked to get to know her better, before. But it's fine, I really do love her. At the beginning of our marriage we both had a pretty active sex drive. Up until she got pregnant with my beautiful daughter. At this point her sex drive was completely turned off, which I completely understood because she is hormonal and may not be in the mood for it. At this point it wasn't hard to control myself and my urges. I was preoccupied with preparing for the arrival for my bundle of joy. However, during the last couple months of her pregnancy my sex drive went ballistic. I had urges like I never knew I could have. Of course my wife wasn't in the mood for it. But there was something I had to do, so I resorted to masturbating, while in secret. This went on for a couple weeks. Until she caught me....


One day I happened to get off work early and my wife was out with her friends. I took this as an opportunity to relieve myself. I was laying in bed with my phone. My wife came home earlier than I thought she would've. She thought I was still at work and when she came into our bedroom. She got an unpleasant surprise. She was shocked and  crying. I apologized for everything, and after a heated rant she eventually forgave me but told me not to do it again. After that fight it kinda put me out of it for a while.

Now after our daughter was born I was the happiest person in the world and I enjoyed every minute with her. Whether that was changing her diapers, feeding her or playing with her. I enjoyed it all. However about a month after my daughter was born I had these urges again. My wife was still not willing to have sex with me, but I couldn't really control myself, so I resorted to masturbating in secret again.

So we've been married about 2 years now and my  daughter is now a 1 year old. Aside from the month it took to conceive my precious gift, my wife isn't interested in having sex with me. So I continued to masturbate for most of this time.

Last night I was out with a friend and I confided in him about this. He says I'm the asshole, because apparently I'm disrespecting my wife. I didn't know what to make of that.

Well apparently my wife agrees with him. Cuz she caught me again, well, suffice to say I'm gonna Probs be sleeping on the couch for the next century.

1179,Not the A-hole,"Last year my sis got married in my home state. I (28F) moved from my hometown a while back, probably 7-8 years ago. My sister (21F) and I were never close as kids, and certainly not in young adulthood.

One of the times that I came home, while they were still planning the wedding, she completely flipped out at me for a few reasons- that I don’t come home enough, that I share a lot of different beliefs, that my SO was “pretentious and selfish” (she had just met him that day), and that she “thought I had no interest in attending her wedding.” I assured her this wasn’t true- that even though we aren’t necessarily friends, I would be there to support her on her wedding day. I shared my frustration with her speaking poorly of my SO in front of him, and I scolded her for yelling over us and not letting us talk. We left after being yelled at for a bit. 

After a few days had passed, she texted me. She said she wasn’t sorry for speaking poorly of my SO and she thought that I was out of line to scold her. She shared that she didn’t want me at her wedding. Her texts were so intense and rude that I didn’t respond until quite a bit later, to assure her I wouldn’t be attending.

Months pass, the wedding is coming up. I hadn’t heard from her or her fiancé at all, and whenever I talked to my family no one brought it up. It’s 2-3 days before the wedding. My dad texts me and says that he heard that my sister would be okay with me being there if I chose to. I have a demanding job, and certainly couldn’t just duck out. I also communicated that I would feel uncomfortable showing up as I was uninvited. I thought that my sister should have reached out to me, not my dad.

About a month ago my cousin got married and my sister and I were both there. We mainly just avoided each other. A few times, she walked away from the group while I was talking and stated to multiple people that she “didn’t want to listen to me talk” and got pouty and sniffly. I wasn’t talking about anything controversial, purposefully. A few of my family members reassured me that she was being dramatic- but MOST of my family members were gossiping about how disappointed they were in me for missing her wedding and many thought I owed her an apology. Many family members asked my dad how I could be so selfish to not fly home for her wedding, and many gave me shady looks. I’m hoping that after more than a year, this will pass. But since everyone is making me feel like the asshole, AITA for skipping my sisters wedding? 

TLDR: Sister and I were never close, intense Chicago family is making me feel awful for skipping her wedding even though she insulted my partner and I and uninvited us.",65,231,0.96
1180,No A-holes here,"My late mother handed me down a ring that her mother handed down to her and so on, it’s been in our family for over 6 generations. Without going into too much detail, our ancestors had some pretty amazing lives and there is a lot of Masonic lore woven into my mothers side of the family. It’s obviously very mysterious and fascinating but I don’t and have never known much and there are NO family relics of which to speak other than this ring. 

My stepdaughter is in her thirties, so we are talking adults here not children. I have been in her life for 24 years. I would say we are very close, and we do a lot together. She introduces me as her stepmother and I introduce her as my stepdaughter but we get on and are close confidants of one another. 

Before my mother passed away, she asked me to do what felt right to me- whether that was giving the ring to my stepdaughter or whether that was it being buried with me when it’s my time. 

My stepdaughter is aware of the existence of the ring, and knows that it *could* have been destined for her one day. She has expressed an interest in keeping it but only because of its value, not the sentiment. 

I am leaning towards keeping it to myself, and in a poignant sort of way letting it be buried with me- I am the last person I know of carrying my mothers blood, and I like the idea the secrets will come full circle and I’ll take the family secrets- literally- to the grave. 

I told my stepdaughter that I’d like to keep it and she has shown a disappointment and said she’d have liked the history to pass on to her but I’m not sure how genuine that sentiment is. 

My husband has the complete opposite view and thinks I ought to give the ring to my stepdaughter being as she is my child in all but name, but he ultimately supports whatever choice I’ll make. I just want to know if the general consensus thinks I’m the asshole for saying no.",1147,7726,0.95

Just out of curiosity, cause I’m kind of a snoop, I googled the guy’s number and his name popped up. I plugged his name into Facebook and found his profile; and according to his profile, he is married; but not to a Jenny, but to a Melanie. So I figured he must be cheating.

My brother lives at home as an adult (23 years old) and I moved out a long time ago. Right now I'm 26 years old. I can afford to help my widowed mom financially, as well as with my time. Recently, I've taken her to doctors appointments and have had to take vacation time at work in 4 hour increments due to this. A while back I also paid for a washing machine repair for her.

My brother on the other hand, lives at home and works the same hours as me (8-5). He has a license, but refuses to pay a little extra for insurance on my mom's car so he can legally drive it. Due to this, if my mom needs a ride to a doctor's appointment, he can't take her even if he was off work. He also has a lot of money saved up because she pays for at least 80% of his expenses (electric bill, phone, water, etc). I believe he told me he had nearly $7k, a month ago. On top of everything, he takes a vacation (usually over 1k miles away) yearly with his girlfriend and he pays for everything.

Anytime I bring up my concerns to my mom and suggest he pays rent, she says something like ""he probably doesn't care"". This really frustrates me because ""I don't care"" wouldn't fly with my landlord or anyone else's landlord. He's using her and by extension me, since I help her out when she needs it.

WIBTA if I told my mom that unless she gets tougher on my brother, I'm not helping anymore. If he refuses to pay and she kicks him out, or if he begins paying, I'm willing to start helping again. I just believe it's an unfair burden on me when she won't be strict with him. She would have more money if she didn't have all of his expenses.",89,919,0.98

My sister (F 27) and I (F 30) are very close and once a month, we embark on sisterly dates. Sisterly dates involve one of us taking the other out for dinner and then hosting a sleepover of sorts.   


This month, it was her turn to take me out and and we met up last Friday to do so. However, She was acting a bit...weird.   


    ⁃    She picked a place that is way above our usual price range but I figured she was paying so why not?   


    ⁃    She dressed really fancy and went all out with her makeup.   


    ⁃    When we got to the place (a steakhouse) she started speaking to the waitstaff in this strange voice (basically, a hybrid of Marilyn Monroe and Betty Boop). I’ve never heard her speak like that ever.   


    ⁃    When she walked, she strutted, the way a catwalk model would.   


    ⁃    She sat in a weird manner that looked like she was sticking out her boobs on purpose ( her dress showed a bit of cleavage)   


    ⁃    She kept going to the bathroom despite not drinking a lot   


As we were in our cab back, I asked her what all that was about and she handed me her phone. Apparently, she found this ‘dating coach’ online who promised to groom her on how to snag a millionaire husband. The woman is apparently an ‘expert’ at helping women meet and secure rich men and the weird things she was doing were part of the ‘tips’ that the coach gave her.   


    ⁃    Going to an upscale restaurant in order to meet wealthy men.   


    ⁃    Dressing really fancy and sitting a certain way to show off her body   


    ⁃    Speaking in that weird manner (the lady claims that there is scientific evidence that shows that speaking a certain tone of voice makes women more seductive)   


    ⁃    Going to the bathroom constantly as a means to show herself off and get the attention of the men in the establishment   


After she explained this to me, I laughed so hard tears almost started rolling down my face. I told her that the lady seems like a fraud and that her advice is ridiculous and not to waste any more money (the ‘coach’ charges a couple hundred dollars a month for her ‘expertise’)  


My sister seemed offended by what I said and didn’t bring it up all through the weekend and hasn’t spoken about it since.   


While I think the ‘‘ millionaire dating coach’ is a fraud, I worry that I might have hurt her feelings and want to apologize. Am I the Asshole?

I had my husband ring him and tell him how weird it was and he reacted very angrily and offended.  I then made my daughter ring my sister (her blood aunty) and apologise for going.

Before we did this, we asked our closest family and friends if they had any scheduling conflicts with the dates we were considering. My dad and his wife Danielle said they had no scheduling problems. We are also planning to invite Danielle's kids, parents, and siblings, though I didn't discuss the date with any of them in advance. I don't know Danielle's family that well, and if they can come that's great, but I won't be too upset if they can't. 

My dad and Danielle had assumed that I had checked with Danielle's family too, but have found out that I didn't, so now they and Danielle family are mad at me. Danielle's daughter can't come because she has a work conference, and Danielle's brother and sister-in-law have another wedding to go to. I'm not upset, you can't make a date that will work for everyone. 

My dad and stepfamily are saying I was in the wrong for not checking with the stepfamily before I booked the wedding, but I didn't check with them because they're not close family. I wouldn't have changed the date for them, so there was no point in asking.

My dad and Danielle have this expectation that I'll except Danielle's family as my own, so to them, not checking with Danielle's family is equal to not checking with my own siblings and grandparents, but I don't see my stepfamily on the same level since I don't know them well.

I (20m) am a college student and I have a sister (27f) who has already graduated college and has a full time job.

I told her that if I was using it, she was not allowed to kick me off of it, but that she was free to use it if I wasn’t.

1195,Everyone Sucks,"I guess it's relevant but I'm 26f. So for some background my sister is going through an ugly, ugly divorce from her husband who none of us have ever liked. They did however agree that is was best for my niece, AJ, to be somewhere else this summer so I said I'd love to take her with me. I am in a phd program and completely burnt out so I decided to take the summer completely off and just hang out with her. She is an amazing kid and incredibly extroverted and has made a ton of friends her age. She really wants to be 21 and while she's very cute, she's obviously a teenager. 

I live in a rapidly gentrifying college area neighborhood in my grandparents old house. Most of the houses are airbnbs now but a few are still college rentals. Such is the house behind me. It's sort of like a ""frat house extension"" as all the guys that live there are in the same frat. They are totally cool and I'll occasionally hang out and drink beer, watch football, etc... they do have a above ground pool and one or more of them is in the pool near 24 hours a day. 

So last week I did have to go into work and I came home and found AJ and a 2 friends literally peeking through the slats in the fence toward the ""frat"" house. I asked what they were doing and she said the frat guys were so hot. I was like that's normal but peeking is not cool. They sort of giggled and agreed to not to it again. 

I ran into one of my neighbors and he said that he wanted to let me know that AJ and a friend had actually hopped the fence and wanted to ""hang out"" and stayed there for several minutes despite being asked to leave. He said AJ was sort of a teenage version of flirty and made them all uncomfortable but the guys were polite and were able to walk them through the yard to leave. I asked if it was a big deal to them, he said not at all, he just didn't want any misunderstandings. I said no problem. 

AJ's dad (my soon to be ex brother in law) called me this weekend to see how she's doing. I pretty much explained the situation like I did above. He absolutely freaked out and wanted to know what I hadn't called him right away. I said it really didn't seem like that big of a deal to me and she was just being a normal kid. He wanted to know who the ""sluts"" where that were talking her into this, I said I think actually AJ was the one that hopped the fence first. He wanted to know how I was punishing her, I said I wasn't. He screamed at me that he was coming to get her (he lives 19 hours away). So I called my sister and she's mad that I ""created a situation"" that could now be used against her. I told her I was really sorry that I was just gone for 2 hours. Now she claims to be on her way to pick up AJ before soon to be ex can get here.

1196,Not the A-hole,"For context, I have two sons, one is nearly 30 and the other is 22. My older son moved out at about 22, while making about $10/hr. It was his choice because he felt like he wanted to be an adult and experience the ""real world"". He's now very successful, has a great wife, and working in his dream career. The great thing about my older son is that he's helped me financially when I my dog had to have surgery and has taken off work several times to drive me to doctor appointments.

Shortly before he moved out, my wife (their mother), passed away from a chronic illness. While she was alive we were a fairly well off middle-class family. These days I'm barely making it by with my bills. I can usually pay them on time, but I do have a couple outstanding medical bills due to my own health problems. My savings is completely depleted and I'm living off of my fixed retirement income.

I recently told my younger son that still lives at home, I want $200 a month for rent and $60 for his cell phone bill. I decided this a few days after an argument I had with them. The argument was over how he literally spends every moment locked in his room, when he's not working, and never helps around the house. During this argument he told me that he has $10,000 saved up and may move to Europe, where his long-distance girlfriend lives. It shocked me that he has so much money saved up, while I pay for all of his living expenses. He currently doesn't have a car either, so I have to drive him to work each day. He has a license, but when I offered to put him on my insurance for $100/month, he refused.

My 21 year old sister still lives at home taking a decent sized room. Now my 18 year old sister is moving away to Pennsylvania and she has the nicest room in the house, naturally, because I have a small room and will be living here for another 4-5 years I asked if I could take her room because it makes sense, I’m going to live here longer and also I have a dog that sleeps with me in a crate so I’d be nice to have more space for that. I’ve asked her 3-4 times over the last few months so it’s not like some crazy idea to her but every time I asked she gave a dodgey vague answer and she leaves for college in a week. 

And since she’s leaving, and my dad approved the idea that I could move into her room, because it makes sense and he thought it would be fine. Now that my dad is trying to move along the switching process my oldest sister (not the one moving away) is calling me a selfish bitch and telling me I should be ashamed, and that no one takes an older siblings room when they move away (which is that true because I feel like it’s not) etc etc etc her main argument is that she should have somewhere to come home to, which she will, it will just be smaller since she literally won’t live here except for summer and winter break


And another thing about my sister (the one moving) is that even when she lived here, she was never here. She really doesn’t like us so I doubt when she’s finally on her own she’d care to come back every break, probably Christmas and summer but that’s cause she has too

So yesterday even we were all hanging and this guy happened to be there. One of my friend suggests we go out to eat and suggests one of the most expensive restaurants in town. Now I wouldn’t consider myself poor, I work as a lifeguard which makes me a fair amount of money for a college job, but I am paying for everything myself at this point and just don’t feel like having to burn 40 dollars on some fancy shit to have a fulfilling meal when I just can get something equally tasty for much cheaper. I suggest we just go great sushi place instead which is much cheaper, which everyone agrees to.

When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said “Great, now you’re a burden on his parents”, even though my parents weren’t taking care of her and didn’t mind, in fact they were worried. Overall, just not the best mother.

One other thing she does, is not ever really buy my girlfriend gifts or celebrate her accomplishments. My girlfriend doesn’t feel entitled to them, but even just a card acknowledging her birthday sometimes would be appreciated. My girlfriend does theatre and her mom never gets her flowers or cards or anything to celebrate that, if she even shows up to the performances at all. It makes my girlfriend sad, because she feels like her mom doesn’t give a shit. She’s tried talking to her about it, but her mom makes excuses.

The thing is, my mom is very supportive, which is sweet. She’ll show up to every show my girlfriend is in, which is great. But she ends up going over the top, buying her flowers and gifts. My girlfriend is appreciative, but then gets upset saying “Your mom is so much nicer to me than my own mom, why can’t she be like that?”

It all sort of came to a head recently. I knew that my girlfriend’s mom was coming to my girlfriend’s summer performance and that she was giving her a coupon for clothes shopping, which I knew that would make my girlfriend upset. So, I asked my mom to not make a big deal of it and to not get my girlfriend flowers or anything fancy. It was just going to upstage her mom, then upset her and make her go into a tailspin about how her mom sucks, and how my mom loves her more. My mom showed up to the performance with a bouquet of flowers, a pair of earrings and a card. Low and behold, after the performance, I had to hear the same thing. My mom loves her more. Why is her mom so uncaring, why can’t she give her gifts and a card? The same thing, same cycle.

So, I was upset with my mom and my mom thinks it’s ridiculous that I am upset with her. She thinks I should be grateful that I’m so good with her girlfriend. I am, but I am just tired of seeing my girlfriend so upset. Am I being an ass here?",189,1314,0.96
1209,Not the A-hole,"This happened last night and I wanted to post it on this sub to see what you all think. Odd enough this is my 2nd post on here that's related to tipping.

So last night my sister and I were home alone and I offered the idea of ordering pizza for the 2 of us. We didn't want to go pick it up so we got it delivered. In total it was $25. After I ordered and about half an hour later I had to go to the bathroom. I knew the pizza guy/woman was close so I told my sister my wallet was on the table by the door and to use my cash in there to pay for it. I had 2 $20 bills and a $10 bill. I come back to the pizza on the counter. We're about half way done eating, and I asked ""how much did you tip him?"" She says she used the 20s and told him to keep the change. I got mad and went off on her. She tipped him $15 out of my wallet! She didn't pay for any of it, and as I told her how mad I was she just said ""A $5 tip is cheap so I gave him 15. I don't see the big deal."" I told her ""Well then you owe me $10. You saw my $10 bill in there. You should have used that."" She refused to give me the $10. I kept going on and on and wouldn't shut up about it for like an hour until she gave me the money.

She gave me the $10, but called me an asshole for it.  I usually tip decently. The tip she gave was ridiculous for only delivery. My tip was more than fair. It was 20% and hers was 60%. Was I the asshole here?

Edit: Just to add something. She never tips like that. I've never seen her tip more than 20% ever.",59,270,0.96

1211,Everyone Sucks,"Backstory is that I am getting married in October of this year. When we got engaged this past September, we told both families that we are planning a destination wedding for Europe 13 months prior to the wedding. As my fiance and I had been talking about it before we were engaged. Since high school, I have been telling my family that I wanted a destination wedding, so it should have not been a surprise. We gave people the option to come but not obligated. My mom took it horribly and refused to talk to me after the announcement. I eventually talked to her which resulted in guilting comments like “one day you will know how I feel when your daughter doesn’t invite you to her wedding” and “you know that I can’t afford to go to the wedding”. I thought we worked it out by including her in the reception and leading up activities like dress shopping, cake tasting, and her designing the center pieces at the reception that we are holding back home.

At the dress shopping she seemed disinterested and would walk out of the session to walk around the store. She also did not care for any of the dresses I liked and did not seem excited for me. We ended up not going cake tasting and are baking our own cakes. She has not asked one question about the wedding or the reception unless my fiancé is there and that when we asked her to watch our dog when we are in Europe. She said yes which she has watched our dog before. She also has not called and/or text me at all in the past 6 months.

I recently went to her house to work on my invitation with my sister (they live together). I was there for 6 hours and she refused to come down to the basement to see me. I said hello when we went upstairs to get food. She refuse to say hello to me and turn around to acknowledge me. She quickly left the house when we were gone getting pizza, so I didn’t have a chance to talk to her in person. The next day I called her and texted her that we needed to talk. She didn’t respond back until I told my sister about it and responded with “what do you want”. I expressed my feelings of being hurt by her silent treatment and disinterest in my wedding. Which she did not respond back to. I then asked about watching our dog and she stated that she never said that she would watch our dog when she has done it before. The next week we were working on the invitations and asked her for the addresses of her family members. She refused to text back the addresses and my sister sent them to me. Right now I am thinking on disinviting her to the reception due to her toxic energy towards me during it or her being fake like she helped the whole time in front of family members.

tldr: My mother is mad at me that she can’t afford to come to my wedding overseas with 13 months notice. She has refused to talk to me. Is mad at me for not including her in wedding activities. Which I have, even though she refuses to talk to me.",50,37,0.91

1216,Asshole,"Basically, the title, I have two boys who are a year apart, one is going into senior year in high school the other junior.
Let’s call them Bob + Joe.
Joe is my eldest and is definitely more passionate when it comes to school. He works hard and is really active and
College has always been a real dream of his. So we’ve been touring campuses around the north east where we live. He’s expressed interest in some colleges in Chicago and the West Coast, and I figured to book two tickets, for a 5 day trip to go to both areas and tour a couple colleges. Well, in a couple days Joe and I are heading off. It had come out last night that my other son Bob was under the impression that he was going and my wife was under the impression Bob was going as well. And to their surprise I had told them that it was only Joe and I going on this trip. We are doing nothing but touring colleges, we are staying kn cheap hotels and really not doing anything exciting.  I tried explaining that Joe had different  schools in mind then Bob, and I wasn’t going to waste money just so Bob can go see some schools that he has no interest. My wife said regardless that the option should have been presented to him. I love both children equally and have said I am more than happy to take Bob to schools that are within his range. But at the same time I feel maybe I am at fault since it would be unfair to only take one kid on the trip, and should have at least offered. Everyone just kind of separated themselves and I decided to sleep on the couch (litterally). I woke early went to work and have been furiously trying to find plane tickets or looking to book some fun retreat for the wife and Bob. I also offered that Id hang back and my wife could take Joe (sent it over text, no reply).And then I stop, thinking what the hell am I doing, Joe has worked tirelessly to have the ability to consider these schools and Bob hasn’t really done anything school related and has expressed no interest so why waste money. Again love them equally one is just more academically inclined.
AITA? Any advice to remedy this situation would be great. 
Thanks.

1218,Not the A-hole,"I'll be as short as possible, honestly this has been a moral dilemma for me.

I was working at a restaurant over the summer, I was planning on giving my two weeks notice so I could go back to school in September. My original boss got replaced by a new guy and I only worked one shift with him.

&#x200B;

I've been planning a weekend trip to Montreal for a while now and have had tickets booked. This new boss told me I may not be able to get the days off (didn't bother asking my original boss because he was leaving).

Then after the evening person who was going to come and relieve me showed up, this new boss just told the guy to go home expecting me to work 12+ hours!!!! 

&#x200B;

Long story short I just left on the spot, which is not something you can really do when working in a kitchen, I admit I probably fucked over everyone in there by leaving, but given the fact I was putting in my two weeks, and he told me I may not be able to get my vacation days, and plus the intentionally over working me for no reason, am I justified in quitting on the spot?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Working in a kitchen until school starts in September. My new boss would not give me my requested time off (only one day), forced me to work over time after letting my replacement go home when he showed up to relieve me. I walked out on the spot. Definitely fucked over the rest of the kitchen.

&#x200B;

Some extra info that's only slightly relevant:

One of my best friends also worked with this guy in a different restaurant and told me hes a prick. My friend was put in almost the exact same situation. Not given requested time off, told to work overtime after letting his replacement go home early. Fired my friend for not being able to cover the rest of the shift (friend had to live with me until he found another job). So I probably would have been fired the next day regardless.",41,107,0.95

1220,Not the A-hole,"So this is a throwaway because my family knows my main account and I’m not ready for this discussion with them right yet. If this is not allowed, please let me know/delete my post!

So when I was in high school, my family hit a pretty rough patch. I was working at a local store and because of this rough patch, my parents needed financial assistance. 

Right from when they first borrowed money, the deal was that it was to eventually be repaid, it was in fact “borrowing” and not me having to pay to live there. Most of the money went to hydro bills, rent, heat, food, etc. But, occasionally my parents would both spend money on things that weren’t necessities. 

After I left home and went to school, they stopped borrowing money. My mom hasn’t worked for a few years now, and lives on a pension. She’s fully capable of working but refuses to. My parents are going through a divorce, so nearly a year ago I told them that I expected the debt to be split evenly between them. I expected each of them to pay $3500, as all the money borrowed was used pretty evenly. We all agreed that was fair. I agreed that I wouldn’t be charging interest on the money borrowed, despite paying extremely high interest rates on the money I had to borrow to finish my education. We also made agreements on payment plans they could both afford, so that we knew there was both the ability to pay, and the expectation of regular payments being made. 

Since making that agreement, my dad has paid regularly. My mom hasn’t made a single payment, and any time I’ve mentioned to my parents that I had to miss out on a great opportunity because of my inability to afford it, my mom either ignored it or said something along the lines of “life sucks, if you really cared about it you’d be able to afford it”. 

This is especially frustrating as I’ve always had a better relationship with my mom than with my dad, and it’s starting to make me question my entire perception on who my parents were. 

This money has put a serious strain on my mental health and my relationship with my parents. I’m at a point now where I feel hopeless in salvaging the relationship with my mom and want to know if I would be the asshole if I took the plunge and severed relationships with her.

1221,Not the A-hole,"This my first post ever, so apologies for any formatting/etiquette issues.

I was the supervisor of a busy department in well known retail store. This department is notoriously difficult to run. While I was in charge we did excellent in sales and customer service, but our cleanliness and organization often suffered.

I won't bore you with the details, but me and management had a lot of issues. And I was incredibly stressed.

Eventually they hired a new Assistant manager (AM) who would be my direct supervisor. I genuinely tried to make things work, but AM lives in absolutely fantasy world when it comes to what can get done versus what he expects.  I know there are two sides to every dispute but this guy is a straight up pathological liar/scumbag

Also important. My roommate (RM) works in the same department as me.

Eventually the stress was to much and I decided to move on, I found a new job very quickly and put in my two weeks. Things seemed amicable at first. My last two weeks I worked Tuesday to Sunday, had Monday off and then worked the following week Tuesday to Friday (my last day).

AM told me he set up the schedule in my final week that if I no showed the department would be covered.  However If I ditched my first week, it would very much hurt my coworkers because they would be under staffed and some of them would have to come in on their days off.

AM was a total piece of shit to me that first week. And when he wasn't being a pos, him and the other managers were constantly reminding me not to ""Burn my bridge"". I bit my tongue and made it through the first week without exploding (at this point the stress/anger had built up to a near breaking point).

Monday night RM comes home from work after putting in his two weeks. Tells me AM told him not to ""Burn his Bridge"" like I did. What.The.Actual.Fuck. All the shit I took in the name of not ""Burning my Bridge"" apparently meant nothing to him.

I called AM and told him I would not be coming in again. He got pissed and gave me the whole spiel, I hung up before he finished.

Some have told me I'm an asshole for not finishing my two weeks. I don't think it does, but I am curios about what the internet thinks.",16,38,0.91
1222,Not the A-hole,"She is a pitbull/boxer mix so a moderately sized dog, really sweet and protective of the baby but she sleeps completely stretched out. So my husband ends up on my side of the bed (it's king sized but you'd be surprised how little space one can have one there's a person and a dog that sleeps wildly in the bed). I've mentioned before that she needs to sleep in her own bed. My husband sees no problem with it. He's a bigger animal lover than I am, but I have allergies and sensitive skin so that's my main reason of not being crazy about them

Bear in mind I end up on basically the edge of the bed, I'll have to be up every 2-3 hours changing and/or feeding the baby so I get worse and worse sleep while he's sleeping peacefully.

1223,Not the A-hole,"Prior to getting married one year ago the inevitable discussion of last names came up, and as I didn't want to drop my last name entirely, I decided to keep my last name as a middle name instead. So I would go from Jane Doe to Jane Doe Smith (Doe = middle name).

Since then I've been using the name Jane Smith but have yet to update it on all official documents - I've changed it on the electoral register, made a deed poll, and more recently updated bank account, but I still need to get a new passport and driving license. Partly because I'm lazy (multiple documents to complete & send) and partly because my grandfather, who raised me and shared my last name, passed away a few months after the wedding and I've been somewhat dragging my heels as a result. Anyway, it's taken longer than anticipated but I am in the process of updating all official documents.

Over the weekend I applied for a new credit card using my married name Jane Smith and was instantly declined, most likely because my credit rating hasn't updated to reflect the new details. I applied again using my birth name Jane Doe and the application was accepted immediately. Out of frustration, I sighed and said ""Having my last name changed is such a pain"" as I have to wait for everything to update and until then, my married name effectively has zero credit rating. My husband heard and took offense and he is still very hurt/offended by it, as he said that it made him feel guilty, and made him wonder if I actually wanted to change it. I replied that while it was my decision to adopt his last name, it doesn't stop me feeling like the process is a hassle (passport, driving license, deed poll, banks/credit cards, electoral register, national insurance). To which he said that he'll have to update his car insurance with my new details, as well as change his bank direct debits (we'll be getting a new joint bank account) but he doesn't think that it's ""a pain"" because he's excited and looking forward to share everything together.

I said it out of frustration and could not understand why my husband felt offended. To me, looking forward to sharing everything with my husband is not mutually exclusive with feeling like the road to get there is a hassle, but maybe I'm in the wrong? To my husband, the fact that I say the name changing process is ""a pain"" makes him feel that I don't want to change it at all. An example I used was that I dislike frying food, but I will do it because I know the end result is worth it. My husband, on the other hand, thinks that (referring to my example) since I don't like frying food I shouldn't do it, and if I choose to do so then I'm not entitled to complain. I would very much appreciate any thoughts you guys have. AITA?

1225,Not the A-hole,"So I (M24) hosted a party at my house with around 30-35 people. I did not know all of them but I knew most. During the party, my dog a Belgian Malinois (F5), was just walking around looking for and getting attention and love from anyone and everyone she can. At one point, someone spilled a can of Coors Light on the ground and my dog walked up to the spill and licked some of the beer on the floor. It was some sniffing and two licks and I tell her to stop politely and she walks away. As I'm look for more paper towels for clean up, my dog walks back and starts licking again. I didn't see it and this time, some girl I don't know, erupts with the following convo:

Her: WTF, get your dog it's licking up the beer!

Me: Bella, STOP.

*Bella walks away slowly*

Her: You know she could die, right?

Me: What? No. She'll probably feel a bit nauseous and will probably want to poop and it'll be runny for a day. 

Her: Alcohol is toxic for dogs. Why do you have her out when there's all this booze around? Trust me, it's not gonna get you laid. 

Me: It's actually toxic for humans too. Just relax. She'll be okay and don't talk to me like that in my own house or you'll be leaving. 

At that point she calls me an asshole and walks back to her friends and she and another girl leave shortly. I have my dog out during parties because if I have that many people over and she's locked in my room, she gets stressed and starts howling and barking. That and she's a fucking Belgian Malinois. She's smart, tough, and loving. She's the life of the party, genuinely loves the attention and people, and everyone loves her too.

1226,Not the A-hole,"My roommate A[20F]  and I [21F] have been planning an end of term barbecue to celebrate finishing a gruelling summer term. We invited a bunch of our friends (aged 20-25) and are borrowing a bbq from one of them, let’s call him C[21M]. Since we are borrowing C’s bbq, we decided to invite his roommate R[21M] along as well. 

I’ve known C for about 3 years and he is one of my best friends. I’ve known C’s roommate R for about a year, and though we have had our differences I consider ourselves fairly good friends. R and C are very good friends.

R has recently had his long term distance girlfriend move across the country to live with them. I have only met her once and she seems very nice. I told R he could bring her along to the party as well since they are living together and I wouldn’t want her to be left home alone while her bf and roommate are gone to a party. I also know she loves partying and is an avid drinker, something I have no problem with.

This brings me to my dilemma, C has recently informed me that R’s gf is only 17 years old. The drinking age in my country is 19 years old. I’m kind of uncomfortable with having an underage girl drinking and partying in my home as if something would happen I would be liable. My roommate A feels the same way.

My friends group is split on the matter. Some of them understand where we are coming from, but others say we are treating her unfairly, treating her like a child and being disrespectful of R’s “adult relationship”.

The kicker is, she is a busy body and is damaging my house. At first it was things like re-arranging my cellar whilst we were both at work. But she stacked a load of boxes and tables on top of my mountain bike and damaged the derailer and cassette. It cost me £300 to replace it all. Then she came again and broke my washing machine by overloading it. Again it cost my £500 for a replacement.

At this point I asked my girlfriend to speak to her mum and tell her she doesn't need to do work around the house. She can just kick back and watch TV, walk round the town or whatever. My girlfriend thinks I'm being too harsh.

So to cut this short she's broken my dishwasher, kettle, kitchen cupboard door, and a few other things. And finally, she's cut threw a electric cable with the strimmer (still not sure how she's done this) and stripped the gloss / shine off my kitchen worktop by accidentally cleaning it with oven cleaner instead of all purpose cleaner. Oh and I just discovered she's killed the shower unit.

I've just sat my girlfriend down and said if she can't respect what I'm asking her to do then she's not welcome in my house. But as youd imagine my girlfriend hasn't reacted well to this and is saying I'm not being fair and she doesn't mean to break stuff. She's elderly and shes a bit clumsy.

1231,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I met in college at the religious institution that we both attended, although we are both agnostic. 

She is actually sick in the hospital right now and asked me to retrieve some inspirational photo albums that she put together some time ago which were in her closet.

As I was looking through the closet I found this old cookie tin and what I found inside shocked me. She had about 50 communion wafers with sharpie doodles of pentagrams and the days date.

When I returned to the hospital I asked her about it and she told me that she used to steal them during mass when she was in Catholic middle school and high school and even sometimes in college. She would go and then just sneakily pocket the wafer.

She said her reason was to mock them by vandalizing them with symbols like pentagrams which I find horrifying. I am a non believer but I find it absolutely terrible that she would steal what Catholics believe is the body of Christ and then mock them. And even worse save them.

I told her she needs to get rid of them and she wants to flush them down the toilet whereas my gut tells me to bring them to a Catholic priest and ask him to dispose of them in the way according to their faith.

We are actually now arguing over this and I think it is highly disrespectful to flush them down the toilet as she wants.

1235,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway since some of my family knows my Reddit. For context; I (25M) was raised Catholic. I went to church regularly with my mom and siblings from elementary school to high school, and starting in high school at my mother's prompting I began volunteering as a lector (person who reads the readings during mass),  like most people I found some of the bible and catholic doctrine to be unreasonable, but I always got stress relief from prayer and from confession.

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to college where I was exposed to many different points of view, I accepted an atheist outlook about four years ago. It wasn't anything dramatic, I didn't yell at the sky that I had renounced my faith or start hating god or anything like that, I just let go of the belief, and have since based my morals around reason and doing unto others that which I would have done unto me.

&#x200B;

The action up for debate is that about once a month I'll still attend mass with my family and occasionally lector when there's no on one else around to do it. Catholicism is very important to my mom and some of my siblings still, so I've kept my new atheistic outlook pretty close to my vest, I've only discussed it with some close friends. My argument is that my mom and a lot of my family enjoy going to mass together, sharing beliefs and a community, etc., so by not going to mass anymore and making a stink about my new outlook I would be detracting from their happiness and not really adding to my happiness or receiving any benefit for myself. I personally don't care that they don't know about my religious views, and giving an hour a month to an activity that I now regard as a bit nonsensical is a small price to pay for their continued enjoyment of an activity together. My roommate has argued that it's an asshole move to patronize my family and the rest of the congregation by volunteering and leading the church in readings that I now regard as nonsense. I disagree due to the fact that I'm respectful and never mock, I think it would be a bigger asshole move to deprive my mother and siblings of an activity that they enjoy doing as a whole family.

1236,Not the A-hole,"My sister will be getting married in a year, so just thought I’d make a small post about the situation.

My sister got with a very close friend whilst we were in school (we are all mid 20s). For obvious reasons this caused friction as I lost a good friend and I’ve never gotten along with my sister so she lauded it over me. As time moved on we’re all relatively civil apart from sporadic arguments (she’s very childish but that’s probably biased). 

My mum said to me the other day that I have to be a groomsman at the wedding, I wasn’t asked. My issue with this is that surely the groomsmen should be on the grooms side? He has lots of friends who would be more suitable than me. I don’t particularly feel comfortable being a part of their wedding as apart from being related to my sister I don’t have a relationship with either of them.

A couple of days ago, we were at a restaurant together and the topic of keeping kosher came up. I don’t personally keep kosher for health reasons but I have orthodox cousins that do, so I’m pretty knowledgeable about kashrut. 

Ally didn’t know a lot about it and I was explaining it to her. 

She’s a very picky eater who doesn’t eat a lot of meat or dairy.  Ever since then she’s been texting me telling me at she’s kosher and how funny it is. 

It’s been getting on my nerves because she’s acting like it’s doing a trendy diet keto or paleo. 

I love her to death, but she always tries to find ways to be different from everyone else (like saying that she’s pan but also saying that she only finds white guys attractive), even if she’s uninformed about it.  This just feels like the latest thing she’s identifying as in an attempt to be edgy/trendy if I’m being quite honest. 

I’m not trying to gatekeep keeping kosher. In fact, I think that learning about and respecting other cultures is a great thing. However, she’s been texting me about  it like it’s just a trendy diet and it just feels insensitive to me.

1239,No A-holes here," I'm expecting to catch some heat for this one, but I'm genuinely torn on what to do and need advice.

My neighbours a few doors down have a cat that, like most cats do, has made my garden (and others on the street) a second home/shitting ground and is in there pretty frequently. It's annoying, but not the end of the world - until yesterday.

I was cleaning in my kitchen with the door open (I have doors that slide all the way open and open up the kitchen straight into to the back yard) and music on, and had a just filled a bucket with boiling water and cleaning liquid.

I picked up the bucket and stepped backwards with it, but the cat had come in from the garden (didn't know it was there) and entered the house (which it never does), it was right under my feet and I tripped backwards, dropping the bucket.

Awfully, some the boiling water in the bucket spilled onto the cat (the screech was haunting) as well as burning my hand and wrist - but the cat got a lot more of it, almost directly on him.

The cat ran off, but I contacted my neighbours straight away before going to hospital. Later that night my neighbour knocked the door to tell me they had taken the cat to the vet and that while he would pull through, he had been seriously hurt and would be there for a while. I thanked them for letting me know, but was a bit surprised when she said that she expected me to pay the vet bills (they don't have insurance) which were likely going to be around £1,500 - £2,000 - as it was 'my fault'.

I mentioned how it was an accident, the cat had come into my house by itself and that I was also injured as a result and had missed work (unpaid) because of it. She started shouting at me how it was just my hand and it would heal, but the cat might not be the same again - that I should've considered that her cat could've been behind me (?) and that it was totally my fault.

I really don't think I should have to pay - but I do love animals and feel awful about it, so I'm not sure. What's the right thing to do? WIBTA if I didn't pay?

tl'dr - accidentally spilled water on the neighbours cat who now wants me to pay the vet bills. WIBTA if i didn't?",600,1265,0.94
1240,Not the A-hole,"So my sister is 22 and has never been in a relationship. I'll be honest she's unattractive overweight and has no personality whatsoever. Despite all that she has a huge ego. She whines about being unable to find a relationship even tought there were men interested but she rejected them because her standards are too high she expects someone that will take care of their looks (she doesn't) someone who will focus on her and her only. Yesterday I snapped in the middle of her rant about how all men are the same and said to her that she isn't a great catch and should either take care of herself more and better herself or lower her standards because everyone around her is tired of her bitching, she stayed quiet and we didn't talk since.


Edit : Some of my familiy members did try to explain the same thing to her a few times in a nicer manner but she always rolled her eyes and continued with the same ""men aren't shit""

Also I didn't just assume she wants attractive buff men she stated it quite a few times saying that men have no reason to be fat unattractive and lazy


I'm a female just for the INFO


Edit 2 : I never said or tought that fat people are unattractive because they're fat or that they're unworthy etc. Fat people are people and they have the right to love themselves BUT I was just calling out the hypocrisy of my fat sister calling out and shaming men for being exactly that and thinking that fat man don't have the same value as fat women do my problem isn't my sister's weight but her mindset

1242,No A-holes here,"So yesterday we had a baby shower for my brother's wife (non-traditional so men were welcome as well. My sister and Mom set it up at our house (easier for people to get to). First thing that annoyed me was the fact that they had a few months in advanced to plan this all out but everything was rushed three hours into the party. By everything I mean decorations, cleaning, cooking, and baking cupcakes. My sister did about %30 of it and my girlfriend, my mom, and I helped as we could. So finally the day comes and surprise surprise it's chaos running around to get everything done in time. 

 Another thing is that my brother pisses my sister off every time they interact. It was especially bad since he always acts like kind of a dick and she got very upset cause she put a lot of work into this. So people came and went throughout the ""baby shower"" (putting quotes because at this point it was just straight up a party). My sister told me she cried twice because of my brother and was stressing out. So 12:30 comes and o have to wake up early to go to work. This is my usual thing because Mondays we have the most to do at my job. Also my coworker texted me saying he's super sick and probably can't work the following day. Meaning I have to do both our work by myself on Monday which is the busiest day of the week.

My girlfriend and I go out to brush our teeth and there are still about 4 or 5 guests. My brother and his wife left a long time ago because he also needed to go to work. I brush my teeth with my girlfriend and we go to sleep (she needed to wake up early too). We are sleeping when out of nowhere I hear a knock at my door, I check the time and it's 2:45 in the morning. I'm hoping it's not for me and try to fall back asleep until I hear another knock. I go over to answer it and it's my sister, she asks ""can you put the food away"". I just woke up out of a nice sound sleep and said ""no"". She says ""yes, just put the food away for me"" I just closed my door and went to sleep.

Next thing I hear my sister is throwing stuff screaming at the top of her lungs ""nobody fucking cares around here, I do all this shit and nobody fucking cares"" for about an four and starts to cry. I get angry that she woke me up even though I have to be at work and fall asleep. I wake up to go to work and see my dad is up, I say good morning. I ask him if he heard what happened (he always falls asleep early) he said ""why where you nasty to her and closed the door in her face"" I explained my side and he said ""she spent the previous night decorating and woke up early to cook and bake, all she asked was for you to put the food away"" I then stated I had work and he just told me don't worry about it and go to work in an annoyed tone.

So I ask you all AITA here?

Edit/update: I tried to talk to her and she started giving me a speech about how I live here rent free and don't help unless asked to. I got so pissed I walked away, not only does she live rent free, she put 1000 dollar debt on my parents credit card, she doesn't have a job so uses my parents money a lot. I work full time so when they ask me to do things that could be done while I was out at work. They then complain about me just staying in my room. I honestly might just giving my parents 500 a month in rent so she can shut up and stop using that against me. She older than me too, I'm 22 and she is 28.

1243,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been to the gym pretty regularly but have never encountered something like this. Note that the time is 9:30am on a weekday so it’s 20% full. I was at the machine for ~2 minutes doing sets of 10 with five seconds resting in between. Not using my phone, not wasting time, just pacing myself.

This older guy comes up to me and says, “I want to work in.” This where I may have accidentally been the asshole, bc I wasn’t quite sure what he meant and just agreed, saying “I’ll be done with the machine soon!”

He uses the one next to me for maybe ten reps before standing up over me with his hands on his hips, waiting. I pause for a bit then keep going on and off. He’s scowling now and telling me that gym protocol is to let someone use a machine if they ask, and that I’m wasting the space. He tells me to get off. I say, “can I finish my sets?” And proceed to bicker with him while working out because he keeps criticizing me while standing over me. Notable that he’s probably in his sixties, whilst I’m a smaller East Asian woman. 

Because of this I purposefully do like 40 extra reps to be petty, and now my legs hurt but I’m okay with the trade-off. 

AITA for not abiding “gym protocol”?

Edit: more info since I think my comment was buried. 

Thank you everyone for the judgments, especially for those who have helpful information about how I can be a better and more respectful and communicative gym goer. I’m new to working out at this type of more intense gym (private in a big city)and didn’t really understand his inquiry, and will try to be clearer if this happens again in the future.. genuinely wasn’t trying to be malicious or misleading in my first response. 

Just as additional info: the machine was a hip adductor, and I truly WAS resting for five seconds between sets of ten. I prefer lightweight with lots of sets for my workout, and it’s okay if y’all don’t agree with that but it’s my body :)  

With that said, the forty extra reps I did meant I took up the machine for an extra two minutes or so. It WAS petty and asshole-ish and I won’t deny that it felt extra satisfying. I was almost in tears during the encounter when he was standing over me, so I’m glad I stood my ground because he made me feel so small at the time. 

After the incident (and after i posted this), a fellow gym goer told me that everyone else at the gym hates that guy and that he always tries to intimidate people off the equipment. so at least i know I’m not alone!",651,2793,0.97
1244,Not the A-hole,"This is going to be pretty long since I'm going to describe the entire situation as accurate as possible so please bear with.


I'm from a pretty well of European family, not 1% rich but rich enough that my dad has 3 properties in different countries. My dad used to be married to my mother and they had three daughters, I'm the youngest. We're all adults now, I'm 23.

As things go my dad had an affair and my parents decided to split up when the woman who my dad had an affair with send my mother a text pronouncing that she was pregnant.

This already kind of sets the picture of the type of woman that she is.

So now I have little half sister she just turned 9, my father decided to marry the affair lady so she's my step mom now. That would be fine and all but when you look up  evil step mom in the dictionary you'll find her picture.

Even though she's been living with my dad for about 9 years she refuses to learn our native language because it isn't ""useful"", she doesn't want to work, spends thousands and thousands of euros on handbags and clothes and what nto that she only wears once. Me and my sister used to have a room in my dad's new house but we were kicked out so they could make an extra closet for her. Other than that because she doesn't speak our language she doesn't talk to us, she's not very friendly either ignoring us when we come over, we were never allowed to drop by. She treats us like peasants to be fair.

I don't complain about her, my father knows that we're not particularly fond of her but we try to be civil.

So the issue. My dad's mother is a stern old-fashioned lady that rolls in money, she's a bit downton abbey like and she's 100% the matriarch of the family. (I was afraid of her until I was 18). She doesn't like the fact that my dad divorced my mom and she doesn't want to hear anything about his new wife. She never met her and she never wants to meet ""the gold digger"", almost everyone else on that side of the family follows her in her opion, because she said so. She didn't talk to my father for 6 years before they reconnected. She also refuses to meet my half sister. The family almost didn't go to my sister's wedding because stepmom would be there. But my sister threatened to cut my grandmother of entirely so she went.

Because my grandmother doesn't want our families money to go to my stepmom she went behind my dad's back and ""gifted"" everything to my sisters and I.

I'm not a materialistic person, I always lived comfortably but I had to work for the stuff I had. I honestly don't care that my father is squandering his money, it is his.

So the money is in my possession in a different bank account that I haven't touched since I got it. I still don't know how to feel about it.

AITA for keeping quiet about it to my father?

EDIT: thank you everyone for the replies, it helped. I'll keep the money and hope my father doesn't disown me when he finds out. But I suppose I have no need for someone that disowns me for something like that.
Thank you!",85,121,0.92
1245,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while back about 5 or  6 years ago and I was 16 working at mcdonalds for my highschool senior co-op program. ( I graduated high-school at the ripe age of 17).  While working at this McDonalds there were a lot of adults working there and being the youngest one, I was usually the bud of the jokes.  There was this employee, lets call her Ashley who was in her mid 20's and had two kids(this is important).  As I was used to jokes I usually just played along with them be it fat jokes/terrorist jokes.  One day Ashley started calling me a woman beater, which I guess was her trying to make a joke, I didn't really care because I assumed it was a one time thing but boy was I wrong.  Fast forward a week or so and still being called a Woman Beater, I just had a rough day at school and just was not feeling good.  Ashley comes up to me and goes ""Whats up, Woman beater"".  I told her I wasn't feeling it today and told her to call me by my name, She decided that isn't something that she should've done. During mid shift she goes "" Hey can you get me some fries?"" I worked at the kitchen and it was swamped so I told her ""No, You're a big girl go get it yourself"".  Maybe This was my fuck up but she screamed out of her lungs ""If you weren't fucking beating and abusing women all day maybe you would've been laid by now"" ??? As a 16 year old I was just in disbelief, she said all that for fries?? I was an emotional 16 year old so i blurted out ""Why are you abusing me I'm only a child, Are you a child abuser? Do you enjoy doing this?"" When I said this I had no fucking clue that she was a mother of 2 and she started tearing up and started saying I love my Children I would never abuse them.  That is not what I implied by asking her that but thats the way she decided to take it,  She complained to my manager and he called my school and as this was ""co-op for school"" I got suspended for 3 days from school for this incident. so, I ask AITA?",198,1058,0.94
1246,Asshole,"so, i've been a long time lurker but i've never felt the need to make an account until now. also, the title is a bit confusing so i apologise

context:

when my daughter was 13, i got a call from her school saying they were worried about her because some of her classmates overheard her talking about this guy she met online. naturally, both the school and i thought she was talking to someone who wanted to take advantage of her and when she got home, my husband and I had a chat with her. we demanded to see her messages with this man and how she met him. she said they met online in the comment section of a twitter thread about a local DJ workshop, fair enough. the messages were pretty normal. they were sending each other clips of their music and giving each other tips. nothing sexual. we let her have her phone at school but when she got home, she had it taken off her. we checked her phone at night and couldn't find anything so after a month, she got her phone back. she was very cold to us and said we were being unfair. from then on, i tried to maintain a healthy relationship with her, which she has thanked me for.

fast-forward 3 years and she's going into sixth form this September. we're all very excited. her sixth form has requested that students come in for at least 3 days in the allotted time slots so get timetables, meet teachers, new classmates and to address any concerns. we drop her off and everything is fine. a few hours later, i get a text asking if she can bring a friend home. i say yes because i want her to be as socialised as she can before the new year. she brings home a boy that's going to be in her music engineering class. i ask for his name and it sounds familiar but i think nothing off it. at dinner, they are joking about things they said years ago and how their songs were rubbish when they first started out. my husband and i assume that they knew each other before this (from the banter) and my husband asks them if they met at a convention or festival. my daughter looks at me with the biggest, shit-eating grin on her face and says 'no actually, we met online'. it clicked with me. this was the guy she had been talking with when she was 13. i was furious that she continued to talk with guy after we had punished her but i kept it in. when he left about an hour later, i exploded. i told her that she deliberately went against us (my husband and I) and broke our trust. she said that i was being an asshole and that he's not a bad person and her age, and in her school. i'm still furious at her. my husband says i'm being over the top and that we were wrong all those years ago.

I'm not going to ban him from coming into our home because he's super sweet and a gentlemen and he's not the problem. the problem is that she went behind our backs to message this guy who she knew we were worried about for her. AITA for blowing up at my daughter?

EDIT: a lot of people are asking why i'm so angry with her talking to this boy if they are the same age. i'm not. it may seem that way from my wording but i'm not. the reason why i was angry is because when we had that chat with her, we asked her if she knew this person in real life. she said no. we asked her general questions like 'how old is he?' , 'what's his name?' etc. she either refused to answer questions or didn't know the answers which lead us to believe that he was someone who wanted to take advantage of her. we also told her not to contact him again and i made a twitter account so i could follow her. i'm aware that she probably had other accounts and private messages but i had trust that she wouldn't message him again after her punishment. don't get me wrong, i'm happy that she wasn't talking to someone inappropriate but up until that dinner with them, my husband and I were under the impression that she was talking with someone who would want to manipulate her. if she had said in the original meeting, 'he's a 13 yr old boy, he lives locally' etc, i would've set up something so they could meet (safely obviously and after i had met him first etc). hopefully that helps.

EDIT 2: for people who are saying 'they probably talked at school', how? they didn't and wont go to the same school until september. sixth form is this thing where you learn american college level stuff to prepare for university or college. during sixth form, most people from the school it's attached to, go somewhere else and some stay. this leaves room for people to come in from new schools.",227,2446,0.89

1248,Not the A-hole,"Sunday morning my girlfriend (we live together, spend a ton of time together) felt very sick (upper stomach pain, nausea), and so we went to the urgent care, thinking it could be something serious. The doctor said it’s probably a virus and gave some medication for pain and nausea, said to rest for a few days and come back if it doesn’t improve. 

At the same time, we had both been looking forward to a potluck party on Sunday afternoon with mutual friends, and had both spent time planning what we’d bring, getting ingredients, etc. She obviously wasn’t up to go, but I wasn’t sure if I should still go or stay home to take care of her. I think I phrased it (a bit insensitively) like “I’m not sure if there’s very much I can do to help you rest, is it OK if I go to the party still?”. She said something like “you can go if you want… but I’d rather you stayed to help me”. So I said of course, and spent the day cooking soup, bringing her tea, etc. I thought all was good. 

Sunday night as we’re going to bed, she’s feeling mostly better, but says to me “it really hurt that you wanted to go to the party instead of take care of me”. I was caught off guard, as I thought I’d done a lot to help all day and didn’t bring up the party at all, after the first question. It turned out that she didn’t think she should have had to ask for my help, even though I did give it freely and fully when she asked. At the same time I have to admit I could have phrased the question better and I understand why it felt unfair that I was considering still going when she clearly couldn’t. But I thought she was disproportionately upset about it — in tears, accusing me of not caring, and still glaring at me today.

1252,Not the A-hole,"I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

During my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that I was making dumb decisions"". When I spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

Which brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated ""as an independent adult"". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

The neighbor and the landlord said it was alright for us to get it changed, we went with a fairly big, well known company to provide our electricity.

Setting this up we were told the way the house was wired we could only make one account for the whole building which we put into our name.  Our neighbor said this was okay and we could just tell him what he owed and he would pay it.  There are two electric meters at the side of the house, one marked for the upstairs unit (ours) and one marked for the downstairs unit (neighbors).

I've been logging the readings not precisely every month on note cards taped next to the meters, they're not a secret and if the neighbor wants to log his own readings he's welcome to.  Consistently his usage has been more than our, usually around twice as much.  When a bill comes in I'll look at all the standing charges and split them 50/50 between us, I take what's over and split that between us and the neighbor based on approximate percentage of total electricity used for that period.  As in I look at the change in reading from month to month, add those figures together, then divide it by what each of us used and then apply that same percentage to the actual usage listed on the bill.

As this has gone on over the past year the neighbor has become increasingly annoyed at their bill.  It hasn't gotten too ugly by my standards but it's bothered my wife as he's been rude to her about it.  I've explained to him how I measure the bill, and even offered to just split it 50/50 going forward which he declines.  His argument is that A. He used to pay consistently less with a previous tenant years back letting that person handle the bills, B. There are two of us and one of him so how can his usage be more?  (We don't own a TV, have skylights, work long shifts out of the house most days, he has a kid that comes over to live with him as part of a separation and we can hear him using the TV or playing music fairly often)  and C. At one stage he flipped the main breaker to his apartment for the day and the reading still went up a few KwH so he thinks there's something weird going on.

My question is really if I'm doing this meter reading wrong?  Is there some possibility that the electricity going to our apartment is being logged on his meter?  The landlord has said that he wants to stay out of it and will not get involved.  If I am wrong and we've been overcharging our neighbor is it right to go back and pay him some restitution?  The dependency is typically around 20-30 bucks a month more that he pays.",27,30,0.88

1258,Everyone Sucks,"Some background, my fiance moved in with me about three months ago. She lives about 90 minutes from her family now. She misses her family a lot, but her family hates me for unknown reasons to me. I'll regularly take us to visit her family when we have the time and money (About every two weeks).  
When we visit her family, I might as well not even exist. They don't say hi; they don't acknowledge me. I'm a ghost. I try to start a conversation with them, and they shoot me down with one-word answers. Well my finance, when we're just about to leave, has a habit of asking if she may stay the night this infuriates me as if I knew she was going to do that, I would have just dropped her off. I could have gone home, and cleaned up, worked on a personal project, hung out with my friends or family. No, I decided to spent my Sunday being ignored most of the day.  
So yesterday, we've been hanging out with her family since 11 AM, and it was going on 8:30 PM. I have to go to work at 3:30 AM, and we have a 90-minute car ride ahead of us. Fiance knows this, but right as we're about to leave, she decides to pop the question without warning me or asking me ahead of time, ""Hey, may I stay the night?"". When they allow her to stay, I'd have to go home, go to work then when I get off work, drive back down to pick her up then drive back.  
I told her, no before they even gave her an answer, rude of me. They agreed on no since I was angry and was not going to come to pick her up the next day.  
We finally start to head out now, as we're leaving the fiance is now crying because she misses her family, and I'm an asshole because I did not let her stay. In the middle of going back about 15-minutes out I slammed the brakes and did a U-Turn telling her I'll take her back and she can sit there for a week until I have the gas to come back to get her. She then decided she did not want to be there a week and she just wanted to go home with me.  
Her family has labeled me now as controlling, and I'm isolating her. I take her to see her family roughly every two weeks, even though we can't afford it. She has health issues so she can't drive, and can't work this leaves our money very tight.  
So WIBTA? The fiance is close with her family, I try to keep a good relationship with them, and I try to make sure she can see them regularly. I can't always keep making 90 minutes trips back and forth though. I drive an old 2000's van that has 209,000 miles on it. I bought it for $700.  
Update:  
More people have been asking for more info so I thought I'd update the post with some answers:

\- The only reason why I can think her parents do not like me is that once she moved out. She stopped getting an SSI check. She never got to use the money as her parents had access to her checking account and would withdraw the money on the day it came. I also made sure she created a bank account only she had access to and not her parents.

  
\- The fiance has random undiagnosed seizures sometimes she'll have one a week other times she'll have three a day this stops her from being able to drive or work. She's been seeing a neurologist to get this fixed. She can't drive herself. I'm her only source of transportation when it comes to getting to and back to her family.

  
\- I have learned that slamming the brakes is not a good thing to ever do and,  I'll make sure to apologize for that when I get home, and to never do that again ):",981,3174,0.96
1259,Asshole,"My mom and I do not have the best relationship and butt heads a lot. It’s extremely complicated, and she has been known to be abusive and manipulative in the past. I’ve been in town over the last few weeks since I have time off between jobs. The first week in she already started getting to me. I went to visit my brother and SIL one day and unloaded on them about my irritations with my mom. I might have said a few choice words about her too.

Anyway, things have settled the last couple of weeks and I’ve actually been enjoying my time at home. My relationship with my mom has been on an upswing. We decided to book a trip together for a few days since this will be the last time I’ll be home for a while.

When I told my SIL, she seemed shocked that I was going on a trip with my mom. I assumed it was because the last time I saw her I was upset and venting. After a couple days I received a phone call from my brother. He requested that I no longer discuss the “drama” that goes on between my mom and I to SIL because it colors her view of my MIL and she has a hard time compartmentalizing her emotions towards her when she knows what she can be capable of. He also said it makes me look hypocritical to complain so much and then go on a trip with her.

I thought we were just having sibling talk and a rant session, and I feel like my SIL is being selfish with not wanting to hear about my issues and difficulties I experience with her. Reddit, who is the asshole here?",24,148,0.93
1260,Everyone Sucks,"I get the same bus every morning and get on early on the route so I always sit in the same place where people don't constantly knock into you during the mad early morning crush on the bus, it's a really busy bus and is always full within a few stops of mine. Recently, somebody started getting on soon after me and sitting beside me as its usually one of the last seats available.

The problem is - the guy *stinks* of cigarette smoke. I smoke too (this is not an invitation for people to tell me to quit, I know it's bad for me and I'm in the process of getting off them), so not only do I have a really bad sense of smell anyway, I'm also not very bothered by the smell of stale smoke like an average person would.

I cannot express how awful it is. I can fall asleep with my ashtray on my bedside locker and not even smell it. But this guy eminates the smell like nothing else. I tried sitting further back, but his smell reaches at least 4 rows behind him (and sitting any further back is difficult, as the back fills up first and its really hard to squeeze past people when I get off at my stop). 

He doesn't get on every day (fortunately), but when he does sit beside me, I spray a little perfume up my sleeve (just one quirt, and directly up my sleeve) and I'll rest my head on my hand and basically bury my nose in my sleeve for the hour long journey. At first it was fine, but he's started giving me filthy looks. We get off at the same stop, and last week he was huffing and puffing after I put on my perfume and as we got on the bus he muttered 'fucking asshole' under his breath while looking at me.

So I asked 'hey man, is there a problem?'. And he had the gall to say it was bullshit that I put perfume on myself, and that it smells horrible and I shouldn't force other people to smell it. Oh the irony of that.  I kept calm, and explained 'I' m sorry it bothers you, but I'm not sure if you realise how strongly you smell of stale smoke. You wear the same overcoat each day, so maybe the smell is trapped in it, but it seriously overbearing and I can smell it even when I'm further back on the bus. I put perfume on my wrist so I can try mask how bad the smell is. I'm a smoker to, so I'm not some asshole lecturing you about smoking, but I think you need to wash your coat because it's pretty bad'.

He, unsurprisingly, got really defensive and called me out for commenting on his smell, that he has a right to smoke and I don't have to sit beside him and be an entitled asshole. I pointed out I'm on the bus before him, I can't choose where he sits, I've never complained to him about his smell, but he absolutely reeks and he can't go off yelling at me trying to deal with how bad he stinks when he's the only reason I put perfume on. Note that it's a really light perfume, I specifically asked my mom if she thought it was really musky or strong. 

AITA For telling him he smells really bad and that he's the reason I use the perfume in the first place?",66,305,0.95
1261,Asshole,"Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",4217,22106,0.89
1262,Not the A-hole,"I work casual at a supermarket, and we have a promotion where for every $30 you spend, we give you a small Lion King token (something you can stick on the end of pens).

As staff, upper management told us to mark off customer dockets when they get the toys. They're strict on this promotion, because we always run out when we have these events, and with the new Lion King movie, it's expected we'll run out even faster.

I'm busy operating the self-checkout registers when a lady approaches me. Initially, she asks politely to have some extra tokens even though she spent ~$40. At first, I apologise, and give the response of these tokens having a low supply and high demand, giving these out for free would be unfair to everyone else who wants these as well.

However, the customer then says she has 3 kids, and just needs 2 more tokens so each kid could have 1 token each. I paused, considering giving extra tokens because I have given extra tokens before to families with kids, so each kid has x number of tokens. However, the customer doesn't have her kids with her, and interrupts me with an annoyed tone:

""Am I supposed to go home with only one token and tell them to share?!""

I repeat to the customer, that I'm sorry I can't help them, and that we'd run out if we gave them away for free.

""This is ridiculous! I'm going to see the manager!""

She goes to the front desk where the manager is, and I go back to operating self-serve. I look back to see my manager giving a handful of tokens to the customer and looking at me disapprovingly.

1263,Not the A-hole,"Just wanting a little insight on something that happend recently.

My bfand I had not had a fight until this past weekend and I still feel a little weird about it. We both still live at home so most weekends we sleep at each others’ place, more often than not my house. Each time my bf comes over he brings 4-6 beers and sometimes a bottle of wine or cider as well.

It didn’t bother me at first but recently I’ve started to notice some things. Note that I don’t drink alcohol, so I don’t really know much about what is considered normal when it comes to drinking habits.

Last weekend he stayed over, we planed on going to dinner with my parents and he took a shower before he left but he took a cider in the shower with him. He even told my parents he was taking a cider into the shower with him because he likes to drink something cold when he’s having a hot shower. Again I don’t drink so I don’t know if this is a normal thing people who drink do. Before we left he had 3 drinks and 2 at dinner. 

After his 2 drinks there he had his head in his hand and tried to stay awake. We asked him to take a break from beer and have water which he did, but would have sips of my mother’s drink. Not ask her, but would look at her and slowly slide her drink towards him without verbally asking if he could have a sip.

We came home around 10:30 pm and by this time he sobered up a bit and grabbed his last cider in the fridge. I asked him if he thinks he should have another one since we were all going to bed soon and he already had 5 drinks. He snapped at me in front of my mother, I told him to have the cider if he wanted and we both went to my room. He did drink it later.

We talked about what happened right away and I told him that I didn’t like him snapping at me. He said he was sorry but he doesn’t like it when people tell him what he can and can’t do. I told him I wasn’t trying to tell him what to do but I was concerned with how much I’ve seen him drink; kind of like how he’s concerned about me and my eating habits (I don’t have the best eating habits which he did criticize me about the day before, I am aware of it and it’s something I am working on improving).

I asked him to honestly tell me how much he drinks a week and he said he has about 3 drinks a day on days he’s not working (about 3-4 days a week) and that the reason he drinks more when he’s around me is because he feels relaxed around me and he likes to drink when he’s relaxed. He then went on to explain how many standard drinks are in what he has and says it’s mostly out of his system within the hour so he can handle alcohol more than I think.

Ultimately he told me he knows how much he can handle and that night he was fine and I shouldn’t have to worried like I did. I said okay and we have seemed to move past it but it’s still worrying me. As I said I don’t know what’s considered normal when it comes to drinking, so AITA for telling my boyfriend I’m worried about how much he drinks?",58,36,0.86
1264,Not the A-hole,"This happened awhile ago, its all resolved now, but its stuck with me because I didn't have the balls to stand up for myself.

So for Christmas last year I bought my partner a cool gamer chair for his office. It's not a super fancy one, but it was $150 AUD.

Enter my best friend of nearly 20 years who was living with us at the time, and her psycho, nervous-wreck (but admittedly cute) ragdoll cat.
Cat has peed, vomited, and shat on my own, and my other roomates' possessions many times before this (including beds) and my BF never really made an effort to take responsibility. She would offer to clean it (quickly wipe it down with a cloth) but thats it. She always insisted that it didnt smell, but myself, my partner, and our 2 other roomates smelt nothing but cat piss constantly.

So when the cat pissed over the entire exposed surface of the new office chair in some strange nervous fit, I was pretty angry about it. Mostly because it was brand new, and also because my partner was also upset, but didn't want to start drama.
So eventually i confronted my BF and really calmly asked her to pay me back the $150, since the chair really wasn't usable anymore.
She freaked out and stopped talking to me while she huffingly grabbed a cloth and surface cleaner and proceeded to wipe down the surface of the chair. (The pee was already soaked into the plush of the chair and dry on the surface so this really did nothing)
She then proceeded to try and turn the conversation back on me and my partner, shit talking us and bringing up personal flaws that she didnt agree with. Literally all i wanted was for her to take responsibility for her psycho cat, and she was asking us to be more open with our feelings. She also said ""anything can be cleaned, its a waste to buy a new one""
Granted, she was very low on money at the time, living off the government while going to uni. She recently moved out of her parents house and insisted on bringing the cat because her parents' house ""wasn't a good environment for her"".
We argued for awhile but I eventually dropped it because I was embarressed and just tired of her shit. This happened over 6 months ago and the computer chair still smells like cat piss. My partner has to put a blanket over it to use it otherwise it makes his clothes stink.

1270,Asshole,"So I \[25F\] work in a fairly big company in the IT department and have done for three years. I like my job, I'm happy here, the people are great and the pay is good. I guess I talk about it a lot, because my friend has recently been applying to a looot of jobs my company has advertised, and I've been helping her out as much as I can by referencing her to recruitment each time she applies. She says she wants to get into the industry my company is a part of and I'm happy to help, and it's always easier to get a job where you know an employee already. She has also applied to other companies, though.

She doesn't have many qualifications, but she has enough to get into customer service / receptionist / administration jobs so that's what I've been suggesting but she's been applying for more senior roles. The most recent job she applied for has to do with analytics. Here is the issue and where I become the maybe-asshole.

I took the Google Analytics exam and passed it recently, just to have another certificate on my CV. I studied for it and passed it and I'm really proud. My friend saw I posted it on my LinkedIn, and decided she wanted to do it as well and I encouraged her to because it's always good to add more to your CV. But... she decided to just Google the answers. She ""passed"" the exam by just Googling all the answers, therefore not actually learning anything.

So after posting that on her own LinkedIn and CV, she wrote an entire segment on how great she is with analytics, how experienced she is etc and wrote all of that on her cover letter. She also managed to get two other employees who she briefly knows to reference her, and she got an interview for the analytics job. Instead of minding my own business, I went over to talk to the man she'd be reporting to, and told him that she's a liar but not in such a brutal way. Essentially I just said she faked her way through the exam by just Googling the answers, she does not have the experience she says she does and she probably doesn't know much about analytics at all. He decided to arrange a phone call with her where he asked her basics about analytics and she did not know much at all. He decided not to interview her.

I told Employee #1 who also helped said friend, and he told her I'm the reason he no longer wants her. She says I am a terrible friend, I should have just allowed him to figure it out by himself in the interview, and said she can no longer trust me and no longer wants to work with me OR be my friend. I told her I just didn't want her getting stuck in a role she hates because she knows nothing about it.

1271,Not the A-hole,"My best friend is getting married to his second wife, who was his mistress when he was still married to his first wife. He asked me to be his best man and I refused.

I told him that didn't want to do it because it felt like supporting their 'regularized' adultery. It was found out that he had been cheating on his late wife with his current fiancee for years. His wife died last year, now he is free to marry his mistress and wants me to be there to celebrate with him? It just feels wrong.

He was disappointed and said that he just wants his best friend to be there for him, not to judge him. He also defended that the fact that they had a relationship while he was still married is irrelevant because they are both single now and are free to marry each other. Furthermore, I didn't even like his late wife that much.

Yeah, I didn't like her, but that doesn't mean I would have supported my best friend cheating on her and that doesn't mean I'll feel comfortable watching him get married to his former mistress.

Edit because I'm getting tired of explaining myself. 

I consider him my best friend because we have known each other for 20 years and were really the best of friends during that time. 

When I learned about his affair, I gave him a piece of my mind about what a POS he is for cheating on his wife and told him I would never look at him the same again. 

A lot of people cut him off after learning of the affair. I would have done that also but he lives far from family and has three young children who are suddenly without their mom. We live five minutes away. If he needed someone to look after the kids because he was meeting with his lawyer or working late, of course I didn't say I hate the fact that you cheated so I'm cutting you out of my life.

I help him and check on him and the kids but we don't hang out socially because as I said I can't look at him the same. Which is probably more than our other friends have done because they cut him off.

1275,Not the A-hole,"I graduated high school this year. For senior prom, all the girls had a Facebook page where we could all show off our dresses prior the date and make sure no one had the same one. I struggle finding dresses that fit me well and anything I really like. When I went shopping, I finally found a really nice, white dress. I put it on the page while shopping and a bunch of people said “This is the same dress as Kelly\*” (not her real name). I am not friends with Kelly, but we’re also not enemies or anything. I saw her dress and it was the same dress, but a different color (hers was pink). I messaged her on FB and she asked that I not get my dress, because she spent so long looking for hers and she wanted to feel unique. We went to a small school so the odds of anyone else having the dress were going to be low. So, at first, I said okay. But the more I looked, the more I really couldn’t find a dress that I really loved. I kept thinking of that dress. So, I ended up buying it but not saying anything. I just told some very close friends that I was getting the dress in question.

Come prom night, I show up. Kelly doesn’t seem me at first, but one of her friends does and screams “Kelly!!!” She turns around, sees me and makes this angry face, but doesn’t say anything to me for the rest of the night. A lot of people said they were proud of me for not listening to Kelly, because she shouldn’t get to dictate what I wore. Especially as we weren’t friends or anything and it really didn’t matter. I had a really fun time at prom and there was no drama.

However, even after graduation, Kelly is still pissed about it. I ran into her recently and she was ice cold. Like I said, we were never friends, but we were at least cordial prior to this. However, she acts like it’s an ultimate betrayal. My friend, who is friends with one of her friends says, that Kelly feels I ruined her prom.

1277,Asshole,"So quick context : was out to dinner with my gf, her sister and her sister's SO,  at a decently well known place in town 

Anyway we had been having a wonderful day hanging out around town, this place is known as kind of expensive but we budgeted so we had plenty of money to eat here. We got the the place round 730 pm. It's dusk and we didn't know there was a wedding at the venue.  However the restaurant had outside seating which was not part of the wedding. So we agree to still eat here.  it wasn't super hot but warm enough to sweat a little and a lot of bugs cause it's on the water.  

So we as a group decided right after we ordered our entrees that we wanted to leave and eat somewhere else, the water smelled of dead fish due to the tide receding, the bugs were crazy and they didn't even offer bug repellent candles. So right after ordering like 1 -2 mins I go to track down our server to cancel the request.  Due to the wedding happening and generally not being able to find this guy it took around 10 mins to find him. By which time he said the entrees were basically ready and I needed to speak with the manager. 

So I wait another 5 mins and then the manager comes over basically picking a fight with us because ""well the food is here what do you want me to Do? Is that what you people do you come to restaurants order and then want to leave"" he seemed to be confused that we wanted to leave because of the wait which was not the case we wanted to leave because of the bugs and the bad fish smell. So the owner keeps just arguing with my GF and I refusing to even listen to our complaints. Finally after a bit of a back and forth he storms off and tells the workers now standing with my food ready to place it as I tell him I don't want it.  

I ended up paying for the whole bill plus tip, but I can't shake the anger that I should have just walked out and said fuck it. Especially since I had to find my waiter so I could attempt to cancel the entrees and pay the apps and drinks. 

So Reddit am I the asshole for wanting to not pay for food because of a shitty location and service


Edit : this seems to be coming up a bit so I'll answer it here: no we did not still eat the food, no we didn't take it to go.

Also the bugs and fish smell happened 30 minutes or so after arriving, not immediately.

 I was angry because the owner instead of listening to why I didn't want the food immediately just started being argumentative with me and my party.  Which at a certain point I told the manager "" I don't want to argue with you I've been trying to find the waiter to cancel the order so I can leave and pay for the appetizers and drinks "" to which his response was "" I don't care I want to argue with you because the wait wasn't that long"" yes he really said he wanted to argue, but my issue was **not** the wait of the food, my issue was the **bad smell of the dead fish and the constant bugs biting and flying by** and the fact that I tried to cancel the order 1 minute after ordering and I couldn't find the wait for another 15. 

That said I'll accept whatever judgement comes down.


Edit 2: last edit then I'm logging off,  a common theme in the comments is that I should have just taken the food home,. I agree I paid for it should have just got it boxed if the guy would let me,  But my issue is that I went out to this place for a ""night out"" not a ""night ordering expensive food to have to drive all the way home and eat in my own kitchen ""  maybe I'm just still salty about the ordeal and not thinking right, but a night out to me is supposed to be out. That said I'll answer any more questions that haven't already been asked then log off, thanks for reading guys guess I shoulda planned it out better before going to this place lol

Final edit: slept on it, kinda surprised to see everyone down voting me for having the nerve to respond to questions and clarify things.  Guess all those meta posts in the last couple weeks mean nothing lol. 

But that said it looks like I'm the asshole. Was nice hearing different perspectives but lesson learned and for the future now I know. Thanks for reading everyone 😊 appreciate the constructive feedback.",81,109,0.86
1278,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently a senior at my school, percussionist in marching band, been in band for about 7 years now.

On the last home game of the football season, parents walk their senior child(ren) down the field, with an announcer talking about favorite moments, future plans, thanks to teachers, blah blah blah.

My grandfather, who at one point had custodial guardianship of me, has made it clear that he plans to be the sole parent to walk me down the field.

My problem? The past 2-3 years, he has wanted nothing to do with me. He's not once helped to pay for school supplies or fees, offered to help me get to practice, or even came to a single game or contest in the 6 years of me being in marching band.

I'm conflicted, because on one hand, he is the person who at least kept me in his care for at least 15-16 years. On the other, he has been very vile towards me and my mother, who now has custody of me. He'll swear and scream at us if we don't do what he asks, and at one point told me (at age 17) he'd have me thrown into foster care if I didn't do what he asked.

So WIBTA if I refused to have him walk me down the field during my last home game of my time in high school?

Edit: Forgot to mention a few things.  
My grandfather is 59, and he's very bi polar.  
Also forgot to say that while he never came to any games or contests, he would always make it to the band banquet/music boosters banquet every year. Weird, huh?

Edit2: One other thing I forgot to mention. I'm 18 years old, and my mother now has full legal custody of me (has had for at least the last year).",20,57,0.95

1283,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been with my fiancé for six years. He’d been planning to propose for awhile but w/o going into detail I had a family tragedy, lost a family member, & had one of the worst years of my life. Thanks to a great support system (including below friend) I’m doing better now. 

Last month now fiancé and I were at the beach & he proposed. I love him, but was upset at the last year ruining the joy of the moment. We talked more and I said yes because I want to stop putting my life on hold & want to marry him. After enjoying the engagement and deliberating, we picked next Oct. It was a big deal for me to feel confident in picking a date & I’m so excited. I’ve always dreamed of leaving for my honeymoon from my reception & also picked Oct because it’s the best time to visit the place I want. It sounds selfish, but after my year from hell I want my dream wedding (within reason, since we are not getting any help financially so we’re keeping it smaller). 

One of my best friends is about 10 years older than me and has been with her bf a few years. She is older than she wanted to be when she got married and she’s desperate to have kids. She wants to get engaged and they will soon but he’s dragging his feet so even though they’re together & have a house they aren’t engaged.

When I got engaged she told me they were looking at rings and she wanted next Sept. I was SO courteous to her & never even consider Sept. I double checked and she said if anything she’d go earlier to Aug.

The other day I told her excitedly that I picked a date and she said “well you’re shit out of luck if mine is the week after yours”. I got upset but she insisted that she always said Oct. She was also telling me I should delay my wedding a year because of the issues going on in my life and kept asking me why I wanted a fall wedding and explaining the reasons she did and that she couldn’t wait longer because she’s running out of time for kids. I ended up crying because she was being so harsh.

She apologized and said she can’t claim a date because she doesn’t have a ring yet but he’ll ask any day and we’ll figure it out. I’m anxious now & feel pressured to pick a date before she swoops in & takes mine even though she said she wouldn’t. We’d have some of the same people at both & I don’t want hers the week after mine- she wants me to be a bridesmaid but I’m not delaying my honeymoon for her (we have limited vacation days and I don’t want to get married and then go to work for a week). I don’t want her to steal my thunder.

She’s been there for me a lot & she’s a great person, I just think she’s under lots of stress & pressure. 

I found a place I love but the only day they have is her first choice date/a week before her second choice. She isn’t technically engaged and won’t start planning until she is, so I put a hold on the date. I’m worried about taking what she wants but I’m also angry that I was being so courteous to her and she wouldn’t return the courtesy for me.",64,48,0.92
1284,Not the A-hole,"A group of mutual friends chipped in and we all rented an Airbnb beach house for the weekend while we were all attending the same conference.  One friend booked it and paid for it up front.  Then the other friends and myself were to reimburse him.  It was a 4 bedroom house.   A week before our conference my friend texts me specifics.  He says “the total cost was $1280 and there will be 4 people, therefore $320 per person.”  I said great I will have cash upon arriving.  Upon arriving (I was the last one to get there) there were four people there already and I was the fifth.  Three people had their own rooms and the fourth person was in a room with a bunk bed.  I was directed to join the person in the room with the bunk bed.  The bunk bed turned out to be too small and awkward (I’m tall) so I ended up sleeping on the couch.  

The next morning the friend asked for the cash that I owed him.  At first I said I wasn’t going to stay there and instead get a hotel by myself.  It seemed to me he had his four people.  He said he wanted the full $320.  He explained that the fifth person was to be ‘comped.’  In other words the other four should pay for the fifth persons share.  The fifth person was the oldest at age 68, retired and perhaps on a fixed budget I really don’t know.  The rest of us were all aged 45-55 and employed.  

I determined that getting a hotel was highly impractical.  I offered to pay him $256 which was fifth of the total.  He condemned me and chastised me for not paying the full amount we agreed upon.  I brought to his attention the text he sent me which he said 4 people 320 per person.  He insisted that he said 4 shares.   

Ultimately I paid him only a fifth share of $256.  Our relationship was strained over the weekend and many people heard about me from him.  How I was being difficult and such.  Am I the Asshole for paying an amount I thought was fair, even though it was different from originally agreed upon amount?",20,41,0.96
1285,Not the A-hole,"For context, my girlfriend has an extreme phobia of shots. She’s not an anti-vaxxer and she is up to date on all her vaccines for the most part although she doesn’t normally get flu shots because of her fear. It’s seriously pretty bad. When she was little she had to be held down by multiple people to get even one shot, which I think is where the phobia began. She cries every time without a doubt, and she has multiple panic attacks when she knows she has a doctors appointment coming up. She’s never passed out but there was a certain time (the most recent and worst) where I took her to the doctor and she wouldn’t even get out of the car she was so upset. It’s an irrational fear. She knows and has acknowledged such. She’s had a conversation with my mom about it and everything she’s done to try and cope with her phobia, but not much works. 

The worst part about it is she lives through me when I get shots, in that she freaks out and cries and it’s basically like she’s getting a shot rather than me. I remember specifically when it first happened, I was annoyed at the fact and shared this with my parents. Because of this, my girlfriend and I decided that I wouldn’t tell her whenever I had to be vaccinated at my doctors appointments, or even when I had appointments at all.

Tonight at dinner, we were seated me, then my girlfriend, then my mom. There were a few other family members of ours there but that doesn’t really matter. My mom leaned over and said to me I had to be ready to leave by 7:30 tomorrow with my younger brother as I had to take him too. Me, being an idiot, said for what? As I didn’t take the time to think about what I had, but I remembered almost immediately after that and told her oh yea I got it. My gf asked what it was for and I told her I had a physical (true because that is part of the appointment since I am leaving for school in a few days, I just left out the part about the shot). My mom then leaned over to her and said ‘he has to get shots,’ which came off to me as pretty mean considering she knew about everything, and the way she said it was almost like she was rubbing it in her face, at least that’s how it seemed to me. I was pissed because I knew she was going to start feeling out and all that and among other things I said ‘you ruined everything’ to my mom (which is what she’s most upset about now). I’ll admit, it wasn’t the nicest thing to say to her, but it ruined the rest of dinner for my gf. She didn’t say two words the rest of dinner and I was just as upset for her. AITA?",68,178,0.91
1286,Not the A-hole,"My bf and I ordered postmates super late last night. We’re on the third floor so we took the elevator down to the first floor. There were no issues, we got our food and we’re heading back up to our apartment. We go to take the elevator to head back up to our floor and the button for the elevator doesn’t light up and the screen that says the floor number is just blinking. Originally we were really confused and waited a few minutes because we had NO idea where the stairs were.  After a while we realized the elevator wasn’t coming so we started walking around to try and find the stairs; after about 10 minutes we made it up to our floor but had to walk past the elevator to get back to our apartment. I heard an alarm going off in the elevator so my bf and I started knocking on the elevator door and saying hello to see if anyone was stuck (Side note: I know that elevator doesn’t have cell service just from using it over the few days we’ve been there). We didn’t hear anyone in the elevator but this complex is 5 stories tall and it could have been at any level. My boyfriend mentioned that we should call the non emergency police to ensure no one is stuck in there because it’s 1:45 am and we’re the only people awake and walking around. So I call the non emergency line and tell them the situation and they transfer me to the fire department. Again I told them there MIGHT be someone in the elevator, the alarm is going off etc. so they say they will have someone come and check it out. About 5 minutes later they show up so My bf and I walk to go see the officers. An officer asks us what level the elevator was on and we said we had no idea and so we take him back up to the third level to show him where we hear the alarm. He uses his key to open the elevator then asks us to take him to the first floor. Well the stairs are super far away and so we try and find a faster way down all while the officer starts complaining to the other officers behind him how we can’t figure out how to get down. I thought that was rude but whatever I ended up just taking them back they way they came and going around the building to the main entrance (the only way we knew how to get in; we’re renting the place for 4 days). It turns out there was no one in the elevator, I felt bad about all the fuss, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. Well, the officers were pissed. They looked at us like we were stupid and wasted their time and all were complaining to each other. I apologized and instead of getting an “It’s okay, thanks for calling it in just Incase,” like I was expecting, they were rude, snarky, and pissy. I’m not exaggerating I was shocked, I’ve never met any public safety officers so rude and my bf thought the exact same thing. As we were walking back to our apartment We talked about how we shouldn’t have even called it in. So are we TA? Am I acting naive to think the fire department should be happy to hear that people are looking out for one another?",27,53,0.9
1287,Not the A-hole,"  

  

Bit of back story - my brother has four kids, the oldest of which is starting high school next year and he needs a laptop for his classes. Bro and his GF don’t have a lot of money and they were really stressing about buying him a new laptop. I’m much better off financially than them, so I said that I’d buy him the laptop for his birthday. So I went out and bought him a Lenovo ideaPad for about $1600 - not top-of-the-line, but certainly more than enough for what he needed.

So Friday was his birthday and we all went to their place for dinner and the kid was basically vibrating out of his seat with excitement over his new laptop. First chance he gets he rips into it and immediately his face just drops.

“Oh, a Lenovo”

“Something wrong?” I ask

“It’s just - ya know - not a very good brand”

“Oh, alright”

He then moves onto his other presents - without saying thank you - and I just sat there completely dumbfounded. He’s usually a good kid, which is exactly why I thought he deserved it in the first place. So this completely threw me but I decided to let it go for now because I didn’t want to ruin his birthday. 

But he kept making these little backhanded remarks, like when he was finished opening his presents, he plugged in the laptop and started to set it up. Now, obviously, it’s a brand-new laptop booting up for the first time, so it’s taking a while.

My mum says “How’s the laptop, \[Name\]”

“Yeah, it’s booting up ... extremely slowly”

So after 3 or 4 of these little jibes, I snapped and just took it from him.

I said -

“If you’re going to be an ungrateful little shit, then you get nothing.”

And I put it back in the box, apologised to Bro and GF for making a scene, and left.

So now it’s 3 days later and I’m wondering if maybe I could have handled the situation a little better. Bro and GF completely support my position and are mortified by his behaviour, but my parents think I’m being too harsh.

I’m completely torn. On the one hand, he did act like a little entitled brat and I think he should be punished for his behaviour. He refuses to apologise because he thinks I’m the asshole who ruined his birthday. I must say that not only am I angry that he wasn’t more grateful, I’m actually quite hurt that I went out of my way to buy him an expensive gift that I thought he’d love and he completely snubbed it.

On the other hand, I feel bad for making a scene at dinner and calling him a ‘little shit’ (as I said, he’s usually quite a good kid). I also feel bad that his parents are now going to have to scrap and save to get him the laptop that he needs for school. I was thinking of maybe giving them the laptop. Then they could sell it, buy him a shittier one and pocket the rest of the money for themselves?

1290,Asshole,"I (40F) visited chocolate shop with my kid (6F). The employee asked if I needed help, I distinctly said “no thanks, I will let you know if I need any help.”  I planned to discreetly select a sugar free box of chocolates, as I am pre-diabetic. My kiddo asked me if they have a kind of chocolates I know she loves, one I *knew* they make a *sugar-free version* of that I wanted to steer my kid to. Unfortunately, the employee answered the question my kid asked *me* and pointed to the version *with* sugar. I explained to my kid I want to get a box of *this* kind *not *that* kind knowing there will be no significant taste difference, and that she and I can share them. I didn’t specifically tell kiddo they were sugar free: I knew she’d like them and didn’t want to make this a teachable moment. 

At the register the employee says “just so you know, these have NO Sugar in them” in a not-at-all-positive-tone. My kiddo is crestfallen because to her sugar=yummy.  I say “I know that, and I wish you hadn’t said that out loud, because if you look at my kid she is now nearly in tears.”  I pay anyway and notice they have a sink and I have an empty water cup. I ask if they can fill the cup, since kiddo is thirsty.  The employee says they *don’t have any water.* I say incredulously “you don’t wash your hands?!” And she replies that of course she does, but all they have is tap water, and I’m like, “yes, that’s what I want, please.”  Thankfully she fills the cup.  Meanwhile I’m trying to comfort my kid, who is quietly crying. Another employee comes over and assures my kid the sugar free kind tastes just as good.  With this new employee, I’m say, “you know what, can I just return these or exchange them?” The first employee interjects that they don’t do returns because it could have been opened. It is a *sealed box* and I say “are you serious? Clearly nothing has been opened.” The other employee says under these circumstances they will exchange it. I explain I just wanted to discreetly buy the sugar free kind due to my health condition so we could share.  My kid hears this and tearfully says it’s fine to keep the sugar free kind. At this point I just want to walk away, so I tell them not to bother with the exchange. We leave the store and I tell kiddo I’m sorry about getting the not-sugar kind, but they are the kind I can eat too, so we can share. I say let’s try them and if she doesn’t like them, I can find her another treat. We taste them, they are delicious and she is happy.",755,2201,0.88
1291,Not the A-hole,"I'm a med student in my last year and recently got a new roommate, Bob. Bob is starting med school after taking time after college to work and live with his family to save money. It's a big transition, but he seems to be struggling with the change from living with parents to living with another independent adult. I want to be kind and accommodating while also setting reasonable boundaries. For context, I'm a woman.

Healthy food is important to me. For lunch and dinner, I do weekly meal prep. I don't enjoy cooking, and I hate all the planning that goes into it. It's worth it, but I don't like doing it. It's annoying to plan things out based on what I have in the pantry and what's on sale and how much time I have to cook that week, make sure I have the right quantities of everything, plan ahead for days that I'm traveling or will have free meals so I don't let food go to waste, and spend my limited time off cooking when I don't enjoy it.

Bob has not cooked for himself much in the past. We previously agreed that we would not share groceries. The other day, he casually offered to me that he would be willing to ""pitch in"" for ingredients for my meal prep if I prepared meals for him too, ""since \[I'm\] already making it anyway"". 

My immediate gut reaction (processed internally, not verbalized) was *no.* I don't even like doing this for me! Adding another person's schedule and preferences into planning, plus additional cooking and clean-up time, when he has the ability to do it himself but just doesn't want to? Miss me with that, thanks. If you can figure out how to be a doctor you can figure out how to make dinner your d@mn self. 

Instead in response I did politely offer that while I would prefer to keep meal prep separate, I would be willing to consider a situation where I was fairly compensated for not only the ingredients but also the planning and preparation, if he wanted to discuss further.

Bob got upset at this - namely, that I wanted more money than his portion of the food would cost. He was okay with me not wanting to share meal prep with the logistics of planning with different schedules, etc., but he was put out that I would be willing to do it if I was paid. To him, that confirms it wouldn't be that much more work and feels I am just using an opportunity to make an extra buck off him when he's on a tight budget. My perspective is I'm also on a budget, my time is worth something, you're asking for a service, and should expect to pay for that service. However, Bob is usually pretty level-headed so I'm wondering if my gut reaction colored my response too much and it was a TA move to counter-offer. 

I don't want Bob to feel I'm taking advantage of him, but I also feel like he was trying to take advantage of me with his original offer. So Reddit, AITA?",62,118,0.96

At first it seemed like they listened, but after a few weeks I noticed them sneaking food to him. We tried asking them again not to and they just lied to our faces saying ""oh dont worry we dont feed them"" even though I have literally seen them do it.

Now my dog has started begging and jumping on people if they have food in their hands, even jumping on the tables and taking food from there too. Hes never done that before until now.

A couple nights ago, I went to a concert with the above mentioned. It was the first concert I’ve been to since I got a considerable raise at my job, so having the extra money was nice. I bought some merch and decided to drink. Quite a bit. Well, before the headliner came on, I went outside and sat down since all of the alcohol was setting in. I ended up passing out for about 10-15 mins at a time, and my s/o came out a few times to get me to move; I told them that I couldn’t because I would’ve thrown up, and they said I was embarrassing them so I apologized. Well, the concert ended and we all walked to my car, I got in the back seat to lie down and my s/o drove for about 5 minutes before I had them pull over for me to throw up. I apologized again and we headed home. Once we got home, I grabbed all the stuff from the concert and went inside, setting it down before going to take a shower. I bent some of the posters we got and my s/o got mad at me for it, so I again apologized for it. They’ve done some embarrassing things before, so I don’t know if I’m fully in the wrong here.

1295,Not the A-hole,"I have a “friend” who is a serial scammer and shoplifter, always wanting to get one on the store or the person.  She steals wine glasses and nice knives from restaurants, sheets and towels from hotels, pens from the bank, asks the bag boy to bring things to her car but doesn’t tip them, eats a protein bar at the grocery store and hides the empty wrapper, buys clothes from REI just for a trip and later takes it back for a refund... and lately, buys something expensive, returns it with something else in the box, so she gets to keep it, for free.  

It’s not like she needs the money or the things, “friend” is an ER surgeon and makes more than 10 of us on here combined. 

The last shenanigan was this one— she’s staying at our place for the week and the air mattress she’s sleeping on gets a hole in it.  It’s a fancy Aerobed.  She has the idea, to go buy a new Serta air bed at Target, use it, put the old broken one in the box, and return it for a refund.

I am a roomate here, the house and Aerobed belong to my guy friend, “Bob”. 

Bob likes his Aerobed, thinks he can patch it, and doesn’t want to lose it, but is too much of a wuss to stand up for himself.  He stays quiet.  He complained to me in private.  Maybe he also wanted a new bed for free.  * Here is where I don’t know if I’m the AH or not.

When she tells us about the planned scheme, I joke that this is how Target goes out of business.  The end of retail.  That I’m not bailing her out of shoplifter jail. 

She doesn’t care.

New air bed is purchased, for like $200, used for the week, and the broken one put in the box.  At the end of the week, off goes the old bed in the new box, to Target, returned for a full refund.  Target gets screwed over by the scam queen.  Bob gets to keep new bed.  

Not entirely sure why, but I’m pissed.

We have a stolen air bed in the house now, and I’m embarrassed to have this person as a friend.  ”Bob” tells me he felt bullied because the new bed is not as high quality.  But he didn’t stand up for himself, so why do I care, right?  

I care because this kind of stuff happens over and over again.  My friend is “proud” of her scam.  I know she’s going to keep on doing stuff like this.  At a macro level, stealing from stores makes goods more expensive, as they have to hike up prices to make up for losses.  It’s just wrong.

So.

I called Target and told on her.

Manager thanked me, said employees were supposed to verify the contents of products when it was a high-value return. 

I’m not sure what’s going to happen here.

I wanted the manager to call her attention to stop a brewing problem from boiling over.  I asked what she would do, and she just said, she will take it from there, that they have a Loss Prevention department, and thank you.

I immediately felt 50% hopeful and 50% like shit.

Guys— am I the asshole here? 

Was this any of my business, and/or am I helping a scammer learn their lesson in time, before she goes on to straight up robbery?",191,435,0.93

1300,Asshole,"This’ll be quick and dirty. 

This happened a while ago but watching a review on YouTube recently got me thinking...my niece loves YouTube, one day she was excited to show me a funny video and I love the kid plus she’s very funny for an 11 year old so I was ready for a real treat. 

She shows me a video of this woman Lele Pons pretending to be in high school and mad at her teacher for having a pop quiz or something (it was some nonsense about high school) and man...man this was some of the cringiest shit I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t believe it, the video had something like 6 million views, a bunch of likes and she’s got a ton of subscribers. 

My niece was watching me watch it and I didn’t say anything but I was *not* laughing. I’m pretty sure my face was contorted into a real stink face. So she says “Wait this one isn’t great, let me find another one.” And she does. And it’s about the same or worse. I love my nieces and nephews and have 20 years of laughing at the dumbest shit they do but I just could not...it was painful to look at frankly. 

She tries to show me another and then another until finally I say “This is what kids watch these days? This isn’t funny to me sweetie...I don’t understand. Are children really watching this?” At this point I wasn’t even talking to her I was just thinking out loud. I take the tablet from her and look up Lele Pons on YouTube because I am *incredulous*, how is her channel so popular? This is what the youths watch? I grew up on Sesame Street and Reading Rainbow, this is VERY different. 

Anyway looking back she looked so defeated, probably because I’m her uncle, she thinks I’m funny (naturally) and wanted to show me what she found funny but I was so caught up in how unfunny I found it that I didn’t even think to go along to get along, you know what I mean? Am I the asshole for not laughing to be polite? Usually I do when one of the kids shows me something but I was so taken aback, I don’t want my niece to think this is what constitutes humor.

1302,Asshole,"I’m often at my local Target and almost every time I go there is someone with their dog. I’m a dog owner and lover, so I often talk to the owners and pet the dogs. None of the dogs I’ve encountered have been service dogs. I’ve seen dogs of all sizes, from purse dogs to quite large dogs walking on a leash (including a Newfoundland). 

Months ago I was running errands with my mom, and we had my dog who is a 20 pound terrier with us. Every where we needed to go was pet friendly so we brought with her us. I remembered I needed a couple of things at  Target and I thought it would be fine to pop in quickly since I have seen so many dogs there. I was unsure of their formal policy, but I thought it would be ok due to what I have seen. I also figured if any employee or person told me she wasn’t allowed, I would leave immediately, no problem. 

We put her in the cart and I tried to be quick. I don’t think we were there for more than 15 minutes. Plenty of people petted her and said how cute she was, including Target employees. No one ever said anything to me and I never saw anyone give me a bad look. 

At one point, my pup looked so sweet with her paws up on the cart, my mom took a photo and I shared it to social media later that day.

Since I’ve posted that photo, I keep having random accounts telling me that dogs are not allowed at Target. Good to know. Now I know and I won’t be bringing her back, but it’s a cute picture so I have not deleted it. Plus, for once my caption game was on point with, “Bitches be shopping.”

 However, I have had some accounts call me insensitive to the disabled and basically call me an asshole. Some have even reposted my picture, insulting me.  Am I the asshole?",611,881,0.89
1303,Not the A-hole,It just so happened that one morning I was walking behind a young Chinese couple. The guy tried to repeatedly kick a seagull for whatever reason. He must have been a foreign student as us locals know not mess with fucking seagulls. The seagull flew in his direction which made him fall over in the most hilarious fashion. I recorded this masterpiece and posted it on my local Facebook group. He got identified straight away and contacted me to remove the video. I refused to do such a thing despite his shit legal threats. People are saying I'm being an ass as it is really embarrassing for him. Lmao. So AITA?,157,124,0.91

1305,Not the A-hole,"A friend and I decided to live together when I returned from a business trip. I was not on the lease and would give him my portion of the rent prior to the due date. He would pay more since he had the master bedroom. We also added a garage, which I would pay for because my car was going to be parked in it while I was away. Roommate had 1 pet, which was okay with me, so I decided to move in once I got back.

While I'm away, roommate asks if I would be okay with him getting another pet. I said no and he said okay and that was the end; however, a little while later he posts a photo of his new pet. Honestly, I wasn't that upset about it, but I did confront him and he tried saying that I agreed to the new pet. I never agreed and I was clear the first time we discussed it. Ultimately, I dropped this issue as I wasn't too bothered by it. Also while away, roommate took my car out of the garage and started parking his car in it. He didn't tell me about this, someone else informed me. I was heated by this because I was paying extra for that garage since we agreed my car would be in it.

Upon returning, there were more conflicts. Whenever he'd have friends over, he'd expect me to let them use my bathroom, which was accessible from the hallway, but was also connected to my room. If these were both of our guests, I would have no issue with them using my bathroom, but if he invited them and I wasn't participating, I didn't want them using mine. We argued and he tried telling me that my bathroom was the ""public bathroom"". I didn't appreciate this, and I stood my ground about his guests not using my bathroom. I also didn't like that he would emphasize that it's *his* apartment. One of our friends called him out on this and said, ""OP lives there too,"" and then roommate said, ""He's not on the lease."" Although I wasn't on the lease, it would upset me that I would pay my fair share of the rent, clean up after myself, and help around the apartment and this guy still had the audacity to use the fact that I wasn't on the lease as a power move.

The final straw came when I was going to have a visitor for a week. Visitor was going to stay in my room. I would have accompanied visitor in the apt at all times. Once I sorted it out with visitor, I told roommate. Roommate got upset and asked me who it was. I didn't feel the need to tell him and asked him why he needed to know. He used the ""It's *my* apartment"" argument, and this is what drove me over the edge. I walked away from the argument and cancelled my plans with visitor. I realize that I should have consulted with roommate first. After considering all of our issues, I decided I was leaving and informed roommate that I'm moving out in 30 days and he needs to find a new roommate. I didn't want to live in someone else's apartment and since it's his apartment, he could deal with it himself. With our salaries, one person paying for that apt alone takes a chunk out of the monthly income. AITA?",22,70,0.95

My fiancé’s mom really hates him. She has long list of reasons. She thinks I’m q gold digger, finds it unacceptable that I’m 5 years younger than my fiancé. I’m 20. And the most important one, I’m a guy. Her son came out fairly young as bi but she still thought that he’d marry a girl.

So, my fiancé proposed to me few weeks ago. I said yes ofc. The ring is really expensive and you can tell. He told his mom after I said yes. She wasn’t  that happy. 

While my fiancé wasn’t home she came over. I said hi politely, she sat down and started asking me some questions.how he engaged, when etc etc. then she saw a ring and asked about it. I didn’t tell her the price, but I told her where it was from. She huffed and said “of course, you wouldn’t take anything less from my son”. I got really upset and said that I wouldn’t care if he proposed with a fucking onion ring and that she needs to get it through her head that I’m not with him because of money. Then I told her to leave. She was pretty shocked and left fast. She called him, she was crying apparently, saying that I disrespected her.

1309,Not the A-hole,"For most of my life I have had a coming-and-going case of eczema. There are certain triggers that set off breakouts of rashes and eczema spots on my skin. 

I currently work at the deli department of a grocery store. Since I've started working there (about a month ago), I have been having an eczema breakout on my hands and especially on my wrists. This is due to the cleaning chemicals used during the closing shift that I am usually scheduled for. I've told my managers about this, saying that it is a concern, but not something that has actively prevented me from working (until now, I guess.) They've expressed sympathy and offered solutions, but have taken no executive action since the problem began a good 4 weeks ago. I still work the exact same closing shift in the exact same department, with the exact same conditions that got my skin acting up to begin with.

Now, the deli is a rough place to work in general. People quit all the time, the department is understaffed, and my managers in particular seem to be in a constant state of stress. However, lately, my skin condition has been getting worse and worse, and today it had gotten to the point where I felt genuine concern for my skin's well-being if I close again today, which I was supposed to do.

My condition isn't contagious, obviously, and aside from that, I am of decent physical health. However, in light of the current severity of it, I decided to call in sick to take the day off. This was also admittedly a silent rebellion towards my managers for not doing anything about my condition. I ended up calling in sick two hours before my shift, and although the manager on the phone accepted my answer, he did not seem happy with me. I've felt guilty ever since I made the call. I just can't help but feel bad for whoever had to cover my shift. In spite of my grievances with management, I still can't decide if I made the right choice here. So, AITA?

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your input! It's nice to hear some unbiased thoughts on the situation. I definitely don't plan on calling in sick regularly/being passive-aggressive on this, only did it just this once. Now that I've heard reddit's thoughts, I definitely know what to do going forward. Thank you again!",29,99,0.96
1310,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: so i left out details that people keep saying are important. The groom has verbally abused me multiple times including calling me a faggot and saying that he would rather kill his son than have him turn out like me. He also stated ""no wonder your dad never wanted you"" when ive left pots in the sink for one night. Along with a string of other verbally abusive moments. So i have tried to reason with him but he is agressive and unreasonable. I was also kicked out of the house as soon as my brother was born and my mum stated the reason being she cannot look after my brother properly with me being there. Her husband (at the time bf) moved in a week later and my old room was redecorated immediatly which made it all feel preplanned with the speed of everything. She also only asked me to be a bridesmaid after another one dropped out of the wedding. 
My mum got married this weekend and all of our family travelled up for the event. Bit of backstory i dont like her now husband hes rude , obnoxious and seemed to think he could take the role of stepdad on straight away as soon as they became official despite me expressing my lack of need for a father figure. Hes very controlling and his family are all assholes who have treated my mum like shit because she stands up for herself. 
I respectfully rejected the position of a bridesmaid as it would be unfair due to my lack of support for the marriage. On to the day , preperation and ceremony went fine. So did the starter and main of dinner. Then on to the speeches. The best man , groom , my mum , nan (who raised my mum) and auntie all did speeches. Several mentions of the grooms family and friends were made and several of the brides family members including the two children my mum has had with the groom. All this talk of the children both being there for them both and all the hard times my mum has been through. However there was no mention of me at all. A lot of people including people who werent part of the wedding party recieved gifts at this point and i recieved nothing. I was there for my mum through a previous divorce. Suffered through a lot for her happiness with several of mims exs who were all complete idiots. I put my needs aside for her. After dessert i asked my grandad and his partner to come for a cigarette to their car out front. I bawled my eyes out and felt so depressed that despite my severe depression and anxiety i have been with mum through it all and helped her so much but got not even a thank you . It honestly felt like the final nail in the coffin and i have been pushed out of their ""family"" i decided to fake illness and leave with my grandad back to the hotel.

1311,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post on here and I’m not quite sure how to do this properly. But just to be clear I’m not trying to get compliments or validation or whatever. It’s just a weird situation that I don’t know how to feel about. So here it goes:

Some backstory: I’ve accepted the fact that I’m not a very “attractive” female. I’m bigger, not like overly unhealthy, but not incredibly fit. I’m just not naturally pretty or anything. It didn’t really bother me, until I had some interactions in high school and then at my work. 

In high school, I tried wearing makeup. It wasn’t something I really liked or wore every day, but one day I really wanted to feel nice and wear it. Then a girl told me I looked like a “guy dressed in drag.” I stopped wearing makeup. And just flew under the radar until graduation. 

Fast forward to my work. I work in customer service and, long story short, a woman got incredibly angry at me that I wouldn’t bend the rules for her and she called me an “fat, ugly, piece of shit, transvestite.” It was one of the worst customer interactions I’ve had. I was devastated and embarrassed.

This is where my conflict came in. I was obviously hurt by both of these insults. I was talking to someone about how much these comments affected me and my self esteem and how hurt I was that people thought I looked like a guy, and they called me transphobic. They asked me why I would be offended to be called a guy. Or why I think being a transvestite is a bad thing. 

I didn’t even think I was being remotely insulting when I told my experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with drag queens or trans people or anyone. I’m completely supportive of all of that. But this had me questioning if I’m being an asshole by believing that it was insulting to me. They also asked me if I would be offended if someone thought I was gay and I said no. I am a straight female and I’ve always identified as such. They said that this is no different and I shouldn’t be offended. That made me feel like a complete asshole. But I still feel really bad about those comments to me. Am I just ignorant? Am I an asshole?",279,1367,0.95
1312,Asshole,"I’m going to make this short, mainly because it’s fucking ridiculous this is even an issue. I went grocery shopping this morning and spent over $100 on groceries for the week. My household consists of myself (24f), my husband (26m), and our daughter (4mo). I don’t buy many snacks because my husband works and I’m a SAHM, and he usually only eats one large helping of dinner while he’s at work since he sleeps in as long as possible. So the fridge has food in it. 

Fast forwards to just now, I was sort of hungry, but not enough to cook a whole meal and decided I would go get some sushi as a snack from the store. It costs like $7, I was going to hold me until I start dinner probably around 7 or so. I announced my plans as I picked up my keys, and my husband asked if I would bring him back something also. I said sure and asked what he wanted. He asked if I would bring back hot wings and an oven pizza. I told him to pick something else, something smaller, and he demanded to know why. I said bc I just spent $100+ on groceries: if he wants a meal there’s food in the kitchen. I’m just going to grand a small snack - my item will be $7, his would be $15+, and it’s not like we’re rolling in money - we live paycheck to paycheck, and there’s been several times where we have no food at the end of the month while we wait for the next payday. 

Anyway, he gets pissy and says he doesn’t say that to me when he goes to pick up McDonald’s or something for us. I said yes, but in that situation we’re getting the same amount of food for the same amount of money, when there’s no other food around. We have food, I’m just getting a snack. I can get pizza and hot wings the next time I go grocery shopping, though. 

Well he goes off. Starts saying that I’m calling him fat and I’m being a hypocrite and it’s okay for me to go get myself sushi and he can’t get what he wanted. I tried to re-explain but it’s like he was only hearing what he wanted to hear. I got so fed up I just walked outside to cool off. I feel like I was being fair, am I the asshole here?",101,77,0.86

1320,No A-holes here,"My sister is getting married in our backyard this fall. It is going to be very small and intimate, but my dad is worried that people will be doing yard work during the ceremony (one hour from 1500-1600). The reception is going to be held somewhere else in town so we only need about one hour of quiet time.

We live in a subdivision where all of the houses (about 8) backyards face each other. There is a lot of landscaping that minimizes the view into other peoples yards, but you can still hear when people are outside doing yard work. 

We would absolutely not tell our neighbors they have to participate in the quiet time, but we would really appreciate it being that we are trying to have an intimate ceremony. We would also invite everyone to the reception that will be later that evening where we are serving free beer & wine. 

My mom thinks it is unreasonable to ask our neighbors to do this favor. While My dad and I think that it would be reasonable to put a note in each one of our neighbor's mail boxes asking them to please refrain from using any loud yard tools for one hour on a Saturday this fall (with more than a months notice).

1322,Not the A-hole,"Now I know how the title sounds, but bear with me here. 

I (24M) have been working at a local restaurant for the past year as kitchen staff. Recently, last month or so, they hired another guy(40’sM) who is a little bit handicapped to be a dishwasher. Now I say a little handicapped because he’s capable of holding a normal conversation, he’s had previous jobs with no issues, and he & his wife, who is also mildly handicapped, have been perfectly fine raising their daughter. He just has issues with things like doing things quickly & remembering all the tasks he’s supposed to do in the position. 

These issues have lead to our boss feeling that he needs constant assistance doing his job which then requires myself and the other staff to split our time between our actual jobs *and* helping him, staying later than scheduled to help him finish or even coming in on our days off to watch him, which if you’ve ever worked in a kitchen you know how gruelling it can be and how much you’re waiting to just go home lol, and that it’s simply not an option to have him scheduled to do the job by himself.

My thoughts are that if they genuinely feel as though the guy isn’t capable of completing his tasks without taking away time from the other employees then maybe he just isn’t cut out for the job and should be let go, or at the very least moved to a position that is a lot less demanding.

He abuses my grandmother on a daily basis. It used to be physical, verbal and financial abuse when they were younger but now it's come down to verbal abuse. He has 0 gratitude for anything anybody does for him. My grandmother has literally slaved away 75 years of her precious life, being that jerk's caregiver. He is older but is in perfect shape, much better than her, mostly because he takes excellent care of his own health and exploits his wife to do everything for him. His children are useless and for as long as I can remember I have just been told to be respectful towards him because he's older, but he's nothing but a horrible human being and I'm sick of nobody giving a shit about my gran who has seen no enjoyment in her life. This man doesn't even allow her to spend time at her children's houses. I'm tired of trying to convince relatives to help improve gran's life atleast now. I want to take things into my own hands and apply for her visa and bring her to the US to spend time with me and my sister's family. When I informed my parents that I was planning on doing this since nobody seemed to be giving a shit about her, just because she was silently taking all the abuse, they think I'm being inconsiderate and immature because I'm suggesting that we leave my grandfather at my uncle's house and have them take care of him for a couple of months and bring my granny here. They think it'll be hard for him to adjust to a new environment i.e moving to the city from the town he stays in, and for the uncle's family to take care of him and all of his 1000 daily needs (mind you these are not patient-like needs like dressing his wounds or something. These are his stupid needs like tea, milk, snacks, food, walk, etc. On time that he's pampered himself with for the past 80 years, because he had an innocent wife to cater to everything). Also note, that since it's a patriarchal society here, my uncle is literally getting all of my grandparents' property. Imho, he literally has an obligation to take care of his parents and shouldn't even be saying he can't put up with him for a couple of months. I know all kids have a responsibility to take care of their parents, but I think he is more obligated than the rest because he didn't even offer to share with anyone and gladly accepted everything that was given to him. Moreover none of the other kids can take him, because 2 are abroad, one is financially very unstable and that just leaves him.

1331,Everyone Sucks,"For simplicity reason I'm going to name this friend Troy (not his real name). I transferred to this university and have already made a good amount of friends. One of my close friends at the university lives next door to Troy. We saw Troy in one of our classes since he is in the same major as us so we thought we'd introduce ourselves. He tells us he does not have a bunch of friends which motivates my friend and I to help him make friends. At this point, Troy seems like a cool dude so far. 

We start inviting him to parties and other social events to help him make new friends. Almost every time he gets to the parties we invite him to, he goes off by himself to socialize with other people, which is good. But I noticed that when we meet up with him after Troy's wandered off, he acts differently. He acts as if he we were friends for a long time and becomes rude to us in front of his new associates. For example, when we tell him that we are planning to leave the party, he tells us to stop trying to rush him or says something like ""does it look like I want to leave with you guys right now?"" in front of his new ""friends"". Like bro, we are just telling you we are leaving. He would talk down on us as if he has superior intellect compared to us, always sounding condescending.

Couple months pass and Troy takes some classes abroad in Europe for like 2 months. Troy comes back from Europe and he starts saying stuff to us in Dutch (he's not European) and talks with a Dutch accent. Fast forward 1.5 years later, we all have summer classes together. We invite Troy to a kick back with a couple of my other friends. He still brags about Europe and talks with a German accent. My friends and I find it very annoying that this guy clings onto this one thing and talks as if he himself is German.

 Like dude stfu, it has been so long since you've been there, Stop clinging onto that ONE thing. So I tell him  ""no on cares that you have been to Europe for like 2 months that happened more than a year ago and stop trying to be something you are not. No one finds it interesting that you do that. Not only that, you are always acting like you are smarter than everyone else when you're not. Sure you got the academics, but you are a social fuck up. No other people are trying to hang out with you but us because we feel sorry that you have no friends. Like we are trying to help you make new friends but you keep throwing us under the bus and being a douche to us, how do you think we feel when you do that? You think people wanna be around a person like that?""

After that day Troy hasn't talked to us aside from school stuff. We haven't hung out ever since. My friends says that I was to harsh on Troy but I told my friends that he needed to hear what I said in order for him to change and realize why he is not making friends.",61,217,0.96

1333,Not the A-hole,"A close friend (A) has been dealing with a medical condition for a little over a year now. It’s a somewhat common condition for women, but at times can be debilitating (requiring her to work from home for 1-3 days sporadically), and the semi regular visits to the doctor and medication she takes make her quite depressed.

Our friend group all feels for A; people take turns bringing her dinner or groceries if she’s unable to cook/shop, and keep her company when she’s feeling unwell. However, it’s gotten to the point where A is so obsessed with her condition that it’s *literally* impossible to have a conversation with her without her somehow bringing it around to her health and how miserable she is. To the extent that if I’ve had a rough day at work and need to get something off my chest, I can’t say anything to A because I’ll get something back along the lines of “well my medication makes me so depressed, and I’ve had 3 doctors visits in the last two weeks, and I’ve been sick for so long...”. (As a side note, she is not sick. It’s not a disease, it’s a condition). Others in the group have been dealing with their own personal struggles but can’t discuss them because nothing can compare to the state of A’s health.

Recently, some new friends who don’t know A very well have entered the group. On several occasions, they’ve made a comment to her about something unrelated (ex. about a book they’re reading or restaurant they recently went to), and A had managed to bring up her health and how miserable she is completely unsolicitedly. They were both too polite to say anything to her but told me after it made them extremely uncomfortable. Many of our friends in the group have started avoiding A because it’s so hard to stay upbeat or avoid discussing her health constantly. 

WIBTA if I had a conversation with her and asked her to stop discussing it so frequently and unsolicitedly? I want her to feel supported and loved but I truly do not want to discuss her health on a daily basis.",31,60,0.93
1334,Not the A-hole,"I know this sounds really bad. Context: im 15f, friend is also 15f.

I was holding my birthday party at this bakery, they had produced a specially made birthday cake for us. It had luscious gold frosting with blue insides, and oh my gosh I'm rambling about the cake. 

Anyways, my friend asked me to get some cake for her because she has bad social anxiety. I said yes, and got a big slice for her. 

While she was eating it, this big rash started to appear on her arm, I asked her if anything was wrong. She said that there might've been peanuts in the cake and she would get out her epipen. This was news to me, as I didn't know she was allergic to anything besides pollen.

Before I knew it, she fell out of her chair and started to cough really loudly. My bf and 3 of my siblings who were in the room started to panic, and one of my siblings had an anxiety attack. My other two siblings busted in the room and my oldest sibling (20f if ur curious) managed to get the epipen and injected my friend with it. 

Thankfully, the injection had its effects right away, and my friend stopped coughing. 

My family called me a major asshole, and that I should've checekd in with my friend first. My bf doesnt think that I'm an asshole since I didn't know that the cake would cause such a bad reaction. My friend is neutral on the matter.

I've felt soo bad, and know I feel like I can't give anything to my friend without her having a bad reaction, even if the stuff in question has no peanuts in it.

1341,Everyone Sucks,"I'm at the wedding right now, in the washroom feeling totally embarrassed and ashamed.

I wore this dress to his cousin's wedding.

https://www.prettylittlething.ie/black-sheer-strappy-textured-glitter-bodycon-dress.html#

We're not rich, I don't own much dresses. This was the only one that fits me well and I didn't think it was at all inappropriate for a church wedding.

There's going to be a reception tonight too, obviously some women will change but I don't know where I'd change, secondly i don't own any long dresses.

In sat at the wedding and said hi to a few people. Everything was fine until an hour ago.

The bride's mother came up to me and asked who I was. This was the first time I met her btw. She then said, ""You knew you were coming to a church wedding right?"" 

I was a bit confused, but feared she was talking about me dress since no other woman was wearing such a short dress.

I said yes, but I don't have a huge wardrobe right now due to us paying off student loans. I then asked her if my dress was ok. She said, ""oh it's fine hunny, but not for this church. Would you mind sitting at the back so people won't see you? Also, if you want you can talk to my niece about finding something more appropriate for later, assuming you're staying. It's a bit distasteful how you're dressed for a wedding"".

At this point I'm on the verge of tears. I tell her ok and walk off. I haven't told my husband, but I want to leave.

I'm hiding in the bathroom for the last 30 mins now. He hasn't seen some of his cousin's in a while, I'd be an asshole to make him leave.

Also, I don't think my dress is bad at all. These overly religious backward thinking morons have the gall to say it's inappropriate. I'm also pretty sure I know why, and it's because I look sexy in this dress. I'm 32DD-25-37, anything form fitting looks 'too sexy' to some women apparently.

Yes it's a church and a religious wedding, yes there's a late lunch at this church (outside) then we go to the groom's home for a reception that's from 5pm till.

I have almost 2 more hours here, I just want to leave.

I really don't think anything is wrong with me attire, I'm not even wearing heals, just a show with a 1.5"" because I expected to be out long.

Update:

So no awkward situation developed after I posted and replied to my original post.

A few women complimented me and told me how amazing my dressed looked.

My husband's cousin said it's fine what I wore because not everyone had the ability to find somewhere to change for the reception (which we're at now).

Lots of women are wearing similar dresses at the reception, especially on my husband's side of the family (groom).

I told one person (his cousin) about what the MOTB told me and she was appalled and said, my dress with the jacket was 100% fine for church.

I just met the bride's sister who apologized about what her mom said and told me, they're just happy I came and hoped I have a good time. Very pleasant person.

I definitely no longer feel like a whore. Everyone else is being exceptionally nice and no woman is giving me the stink eye either.

I don't think anyone really cared what i wore in church, pretty sure most didn't notice because what I wore isn't that short and I had a blazer on.

Really surprised at how many YTAs I got, I genuinely thought this dress was fine. It wasn't what u planned to wear, but my other more conservative dress couldn't fit and this was my only option.",557,871,0.79
1342,No A-holes here,"My sister moved out 2 months ago but is visiting right now so it wont be an issue again. But I’m curious about whether I’m justified in feeling like she is TA here. I stream on twitch as a part time job, it makes me some money and I don’t make a lot of money at my regular job. I also consider it a huge passion and hobby off mine. Back when she lived here, she lived on a floor above me in our house and always claimed she could hear me stream late into the night. 

She’d bang on my door during streams, send me aggressive texts, and even stomp on the floor above. It was embarrassing to have my viewers witness it so I would always log off my streams early and eventually I gave up streaming. Take in mind my sister has supersonic hearing and she freaks out at the sound of a bathroom DOOR lightly clicking shut at nighttime and gets up and causes a scene about small noises all the time. For example weekend when everyone was up at 11 am having breakfast on the kitchen shed be screaming from her room that she’s trying to sleep. 

When she moved out I finally got a chance to get back into it. However because of her wedding festivities and other family visiting I didn’t get to this summer. This week I finally got to stream again. I work full time so weekends are my only days to stream. I streamed last night for the first time in FOREVER and it was an amazing stream. I requested beforehand to my sister that if she needed me to lower my voice she could text me and I’d go as low as I could, but that I am streaming and that’s that. She said fine. 

I had a good stream with tons of hosts, raids, new followers and subscribers. Really really good for my twitch to grow. I was having a blast for ONCE doing something I loved. It was a 10 pm to 2 am stream. People who go on twitch know that streams are on average 3-5 hour. 

But, she didn’t listen to my request and kept aggressively texting me many times throughout the night to lower my volume and to just stop streaming. She knocked on my door hella hard at one point so I had to mute my stream for a while. the  later she stomped super hard on the floor above a BUNCH of times.  

Finally I texted her “I’m getting off stream, happy? Don’t be a psycho. This is my house, not yours.” 

I feel mean for calling it my house not hers bc she moved out of state and I know she misses being here a lot too. But shes leaving in 2 days and has her own apartment to be quiet and comfortable in forever. She can’t accommodate for ONE night on a Saturday for my hobby? *I* live here. Its *my* weekend when she doesn’t even work! And my parents and other sister literally DO NOT hear my voice or get bothered by it even though their rooms are just as close. The game volume is in my headset. There is only the noise of my voice. 

AITA for streaming late? I did do my best to make my voice as low as possible and keep my mouth close to the mic. I guess I strongly feel like she’s TA for making something I love so miserable for me even though it’s my house too.",42,28,0.86

1344,Not the A-hole,"
I work at a job where I was harassed pretty badly by a senior engineer, it escalated till he groped me and I had to hitt him to stop it. And HR didn't handle it well. I filled a police report too but there wasn't enough evidence for the police or court to do much. My boss knew and he just towd the company line. My coworkers knew and thought it was funny, or thought I was being a crazy bitch. A couple other managers at work were creepy fuckers too, and HR just brushed everything under the rug

Thatt, plus some other experiences in my career, permanently put me off engineering and I decided to quietly work on transitioning to another career field. I started taking night classes, in accounting, passed my CPA exam, and got a job offer as an accountant halfway across the country. I kept all this quiet. 

It was just the type of new start I had needed. 

I was afraid of quitting my stable job and going into something totally new, across the country, with no support network, so I had an idea to cut down on some risk.

I told my engineering job I was taking the month of July off. And I told my accounting job that I was starting the first week of July. 

So for that month, I still technically had that engineering job to fall back on, just in case. But my new job was going wonderfully, and still is. So at the end of July, I sent an email to my old jobs HR department saying that I resign, effective immediately. I didn't say why, but I figure they knew why. They'd have to be dumb as bricks to not figure why.

I got an email back saying that I would need to come in to next day for the exit procedure of turning in my laptop, ID, company credit card and phone, filling out an exit survey, etc. Closing out loose ends and turning over my in-progress work to someone else. And I replied to  that to say that my laptop, phone, CC and ID were on my desk, and I would not be available to come to the office.

Since then, I've gotten a lot of emails asking me details about my work; procedures only I knew, where I had saved documents or work that I had in progress, etc. I haven't answered any.

I've been doing great; it's such a weight off my shoulders to be out of an environment that I always feel stressed and unsafe. And it's a little satisfying that my old co-workers, including the one who i went to the cops and hr about, missed a major deadline because they didn't have some of the knowledge or documents that only I had in that group.

But I feel like kind of a dick because there were a few kind people in my old team, and I guess my old boss wasn't too shitty; he just had his hands tied by company procedure.

1346,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account and I’ll try to keep this short. 

My roommate asked me to drive him to his girlfriends apartment. I agreed but I was almost out of gas so we stopped to get gas on the way. At the gas station, we decided to split the cost of a scratch off with the condition that we would split the winnings if we won. 

My roommate is one of those people that never has any many money to pay people back but has money for eating out every night and alcohol. So I bought the scratch off and he told me he would pay me back (the scratch off was $10 so we both agreed to pay $5)

We usually do the scratch off together but he was already late so he told me to just drop him off. When I got back home, I did the scratch off and it ended up being a $500 ticket!

Now this is when things take a turn. My roommate and I have “split” the cost of probably dozens of scratch offs at this point and he rarely pays me back. So when he got home I told him that the ticket was a dud and asked him to pay me back the $5. He says the usual “oh I’ll get you back later this week just give me some time” bs. 

I asked him multiple times within the last month to pay me back for his half of the ticket and he never got around to it. So I ended up cashing the ticket and keeping it for myself. He found out about it through mutual friends and was absolutely pissed about it and saying I stole $250 from him. 

I told him the agreement was to split the cost of the ticket and then split the winnings if we won. Since he never paid half of the ticket, he is not entitled to half of the winnings whatsoever. If he paid me back just the $5 he owed me for that ticket I would have given him his $250. So, am it the asshole?",551,6156,0.98
1347,Not enough info,"Few years ago, my parents got a divorce. I kinda saw it coming, my Dad sat in my room and said ""Son, me and your mother have decided to divorce"". My response was literally ""Oh. Um, okay.""

The whole divorce took a year and a half for them to figure out, because there were a lot of complications. Anyways, over time I learned a lot of things my Dad wasnt helping my Mom with. Like the bills. He would lie to my Moms face and say ""I dont have any money."" But he actually made more than my Mom. (Shes at about $50K/yr while hes at around 70-80k/yr)
One day his car broke down. He decided its time to get rid of it and get a new one. So he buys a used Lexus for $9000, in cash. A personal car was pretty unneccessary for him because hes an international truck driver. At least, in his financial state he was claiming he was in. ubering or getting some old $2000  Toyota or something wouldve made more sense. And he was only home for a week or two every 3-4 months. Theres more stuff like this, but I dont want to go on and on.

Fast forward, divorce happens, and a good year or so goes by. My Dad texts me and tells me he'll be in town, and he has a new girlfriend. He tells me its an online relationship. It made sense because of his job. We go get dinner and he starts telling me about her. She lives in Nigeria..and shes 21. Im 22 at the time. My Dad is 52. They now have a baby. Hes working to get her moved over here. He really wants me to meet her, and I REALLY do NOT want to. I feel terrible for my half brother.

He tells the waitress while shes dropping off the check ""Yknow, my son is single."" I felt very embarrassed. I think she could tell I wanted nothing to do with this, because I was glaring pretty hard at my Dad.",44,114,0.95
1348,Not the A-hole,"Hi all,

Throwaway account here because everyone I know is on Reddit. I'm 28, M.

My sister is getting married next month. Back when the invites were sent out I was single but I was given a plus one. My parents said, back in March, that I had to let them know if I was bringing a plus one for catering purposes. Not wanting to go alone, I asked my friend, let's call her Anna, if she wanted to come with me, and she said yes.

Anna and I have been friends for eight years. We have never had any kind of relationship other than platonic. It's also worth mentioning that for the past five years we've lived on different continents so have only really seen each other once or twice year and just chat through Skype once a month. I'm back in my home country, she continues to be abroad.

Anna has basically scheduled her summer holiday around attending the wedding, so logistically it's been rather complicated for her to get to it.

Inevitably, back in April I found myself in a relationship with Sarah. It's only been four months, but we've grown very close over that time. Of course, the subject of the wedding came up and everyone's been wondering if I'm going to de-invite Anna and take Sarah instead. For me, there wasn't really any wondering - I'd already invited someone who's making a big effort to attend (and brought a wedding gift despite me saying she didn't have to), and my girlfriend and I have only been together for four months.

Sarah, understandably, is very upset about this. I tried to be as diplomatic as possible. I've spoken to my parents and sister, and there just isn't space. However, they've said if there any cancellations Sarah can join the meal. Sarah has been invited to the wedding service (i.e. the bit in church) and the party - the only bit she can't come to is the formal meal.

Sarah now thinks that I secretly love Anna and I always have done (they've never met - Anna's met my immediate family and a few close friends, but no one else). It's emphatically not true. I've even said I would get Anna to confirm it. I said I would love it if Sarah came to the wedding with me.

I have offered to buy dinner for Sarah and a couple of her friends in a nearby restaurant so they can have a nice meal together and then join us at the party (her and her friends - the party bit is open to anyone who wants to come). She thinks it would be weird. It's been suggested that I make this offer to Anna instead and take Sarah to the meal. The issue is that Anna isn't local to the area and doesn't know anyone else, so I have no idea who she could go out to dinner with. Still feels rude to de-invite her at any rate.

I feel like shit over this and I'm just digging myself a hole. AITA?

Cheers.

EDIT: So this kinda got a lot more attention than I was expecting and, while I've read all the comments, I haven't got the time to reply to them all. Thanks to everyone who replied! 

General consensus is that this is a case of either NTA or NAH. There were a few YTA exceptions and I think those comments make valid points. Some people made the point that I am treating this wedding as a reunion with Anna which, in fairness, I kind of am - I haven't seen her in a year and geography makes it difficult to meet up. I pointed out in one of my comments that she is putting quite a lot of effort (and money) into attending as it will involve taking an extra flight plus three days of hotel accommodation. Anna is typically extrovert (I am not) - she'll talk to anyone and generally doesn't have a problem in these sorts of situations. I don't think she'd feel alienated if I didn't hang around with her all night. Perhaps Anna was the wrong choice of invitee - I do in hindsight see this and I could have seen her at some other point while she's back in the country. That's not really something I could have foreseen though. I'm not someone who needs to be in a relationship and I wasn't looking for one either - it just happened. 

I haven't had an opportunity to talk to any relevant party since posting this thread, but there has been a lot of useful advice given here as well. I may post an update later on if it's appropriate.",163,545,0.95
1349,Not the A-hole,"This happened few hours ago. 

Without getting into too much detail: I told my mom that I prefer my friends over my big family (excluding my parents and siblings), because even though all my uncles, aunts and cousins are nice and loving, we have absolutely nothing in common and all our relationships are about few family gatherings a year and happy birthday texts.

On the other hand, my friends are also nice and loving, but we do a lot of things together and we share quite a lot of things. We are much, much closer.

Mom got very upset when I told her this and she can't understand how I can prefer non blood-related people over her own brothers and sisters. 

I can see that family bounds are almost sacred for her but it's too late to take back what I said if I am the asshole. But am I the asshole?

My parents are  fairly well off and really have never struggled for money for me and my 2 sisters. 

Today my mum comes to me and states that she wants me to pay her rent of £150 along with putting £500 each month into my savings account.

My roommate Max is at work right now, and his gf, Emma (who lives with us), has a friend over. They've decided they want to paint outside on the back porch, and are currently having a wonderful time.

My problem is this: the painting supplies are all Max's, and there's about a 15% chance that Emma will actually clean up and bring them back inside when she's done. Bonus: it's supposed to rain later.

Max has had at least two go-rounds with Emma over not taking care of his painting supplies -- she leaves them laying around, leaves the bottles open, etc. Furthermore, there have been a series of paint-unrelated incidents over the last few weeks that have put Max at his breaking point; he's just about all done with Emma's shit. 

Emma's going to leave this stuff outside to get rained on, I would bet money on it. Max is going to throw a fit. 

I could step in. I could remind Emma to bring in the paint when she's done, or just do it myself, and keep this relationship limping along a while longer.

But part of me says ""This isn't your problem, don't cover her ass. She's a grown woman who has already been told about this issue, she has no excuse not to know better.""

UPDATE EDIT: Turns out I was worried for nothing. Emma brought the paints and supplies in without me having to say anything at all. She gave me a scare for a little bit when she and her friend left for lunch and the paints were still on the patio, but when I saw the clouds gathering and ran down to get them, they were already gathered and inside.

What killed me inside was that she also had a party. Lots of drinking involved. Including my vintage whisky. They cost me around £7000 and were near full. So I demanded that they pay me back. 

My sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. Her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. He is now thinking about breaking up with her over this.

I went to tossed the trash and left without keys and left the door unlocked (it takes about 5 minutes to walk to the dumpster and come back in a very safe part of town).

1365,Asshole,"I know how it sounds, but bear with me here.

I'm depressed, to the extent where getting up in the morning, showering, seeing friends or eating at meals time is just really hard. This hasn't been going on for very long, only a few weeks, and I've had a history of dipping in and out of really difficult periods for several weeks at a time every year or two. Publicly I put on a brave face and do my job, then come home and just wait for the next day to start. I would go to therapy, but right now it's just not a financial possibility. I'm really not here for advice on dealing with my mental state, I'm working on it the best wya I know how with the support of those around me, so I'd respect if people could keep their opinions on my health to a minimum unless it's part of their judgment. 

I'm in my own place but spend half the week with my family, and I have a long time boyfriend, Mark, who comes over to stay half the week with me and half with his family. We don't pay rent as its a family home I'm looking after. Since we spend equal time here (roughly) we do pay bills etc together.

Generally, we share the chores equally (the garden, trash, cooking, hoovering) but I'll do the deep cleaning and general tidying as Mark doesn't really notice or care that much once the place isn't a complete sty. So, lately I've been letting things slip a bit. I don't ask Mark to do anything extra, I either ignore it or just push it into a spare room or press, but I know that isn't necessarily fair. The house certainly isn't filthy, but it's not up to usual standard either. Sometimes when I feel down like this I'll have a manic clean and everything wi be spotless, but I'm not there just yet.

Mark contained that I'm not doing my share. He isn't wrong. I apologised and explained what's up (he knows about my past issues with my mental health) and just asked for some support and time. Again, the place certainly isn't that bad, but I wouldn't be inviting guests over either if you know what I mean. 

He said I'm being selfish about it, making him do an unfair amount of work. I said I haven't asked him to do anything extra, I'm just struggling with my responsibilities and if he wants he can just leave off his chores and take some time at his parents so he doesn't get bothered by the mess. Again, it's just untidy - certainly not unhygienic or filthy. I feel like I don't even create much mess in this state - I don't use the dishes, I have my own laundry basket, once I come home I basically don't move until bed. Not that that's much of an excuse - it's both our job to keep it tidy regardless of where the mess comes from. 

AITA for hoping for compassion? If I had a roommate feeling like this, I would think I'd be supportive. I know it's not his problem or his fault, but I can't really help it right now. I don't want to sound like it's a cop out,  but I know I just need time (a few weeks) to get myself back on track.",48,42,0.83

1369,Asshole,"I had recently finished reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to my 7yo daughter (I always told her its a real story) and she loved it. Yesterday she asked my wife something along the lines of ""when is she going to Hogwarts"" and her mom told her that its a fiction book and isnt actually real, so she went really sad about me lying to her.

I did what I thougt I should do and told her that Harry Potter is actually real but that we are muggles, next moment she burst into tears and didnt stop for a good 10 minutes.

Now my wife is telling me its all my fault. 
Am I the A-hole?

Edit: Im seeing mostly YTA here and I get it, but i will add a little bit more context:

When my wife told her that the wizarding world was fiction, she got sad because we lied to her and told me she didnt want me to read more HP to her, also I didn't tell her directly that we are unable to do magic, what I was trying to do was to tell her that her mother was indeed a muggle and she didnt believe in wizards, as I was trying to make her regain her interest in the book series (because they are wonderful). But she assumed it meant we were all muggles, and cried (made me feel like a real A-hole).

This all happened yesterday. My wife and I decided to talk with her and we had the classic talk, we told her it may or may not be real, depending if she believed in it or not and she took it really well and regained her interest in the series. 

Tonight I'm gonna start reading The Chamber of the Secrets to her. But yeah I guess IFU a little but it didnt go wrong at all.

Edit 2: She will eventually know its all fiction, but my main goal is for her to be interested in literature an to use her imagination as much as she can. She is just a child and we think its the best for her.",387,1071,0.9
1370,No A-holes here,"This summer, I started to notice that my sister’s eating habits were out of wack. I never saw her eating breakfast, understandable for days she’d sleep in until noon, but even on the days she had dance in the morning, she’d maybe grab an apple before, but eat only a bite and then throw the rest away. 

For lunch, she’d sometimes nibble on something, but not much, and when I asked her about it, she got mad and said that she doesn’t need as much food as me and my brother since she’s a girl. 

And then at dinner, she’d always tell my parents that she wasn’t hungry, that she ate a lot that day, and at first, I thought maybe she was eating snacks and stuff without me seeing, but soon it was obvious that she was lying. She lost some weight, which I thought was from her dancing so much, but I’m not sure.

I told my parents what I had been seeing, and now, they have her in therapy for an eating disorder, but the worst part (for her at least) is that they pulled her out of dance. She is very upset about that, and she knows that I said something, and I feel awful that I caused her to get pulled out of dance. She’s miserable without it and I hate seeing it. Things seem to have been going fine for her, I don’t know if my parents are overreacting, but I feel like everything got turned upside down and I’m the asshole for saying anything to begin with.",135,996,0.96
1371,Not the A-hole,"Hi I’m at writing in perspective of my older step cousin . Just to let you know I did not attend this event as I was I’ll .From now it is cousin writing 

So I had my wedding a couple of days ago and I want closure if I’m TA 

In the beginning, the day was brilliant very one looked beautiful the ceremony was perfect and everyone was looking forward to the reception . I think most wedding do this I’m not sure but after the dinner the best man will give a speech along with other people. My brother was the best man and at the end of his speech he asked his girlfriend to stand up I was so confused he then proceeded to propose my mother started crying tears of happiness and everyone was so happy apart from me , my husband my dad and husbands family . 

The rest of the night was all about them me and husband just faded into the background so I pulled my brother and his now fiancée away from the crowd into a deserted room and started yelling and crying at them saying how could they make this day about them this was the following conversation 

Me-HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME 

Brother- what do u mean does my happiness mean nothing to your stop acting so selfish

Me-(now crying)what do you mean this is my wedding that me and husband paid for this is supposed to be our special day we shouldn’t be outshined by you

Then my dad and husband came into the room and saw me crying

Dad- What the ....... brother are you thick what on earth made you think to propose at your sisters wedding 

Brothers fiancée- can everyone please calm

Me - (angry) shut the ....... up you ...............

I have to admit that was not my proudest moment. His fiancée stood there shocked that I would say something like that to her 

Brother -what the ........ do not talk to her like that 
They both then left 

We still haven’t spoken to them and my mum thinks we overreacted but my dad hasn’t spoken to them either
 
So AITA for being angry at my brother?

Edit: I plan to reach out to my brother and explain my feelings clearly and include your points as well .

Edit2: hi it is op again not my cousin however she has told me she will be going to speak to her brother tomorrow and she hopes to have an update.

Edit3: I just wanted to clear up the confusion I’m female.

Edit 4: my cousin has just been to brothers house with her husband they talked for a while then came to an agreement.Brother didn’t do it to spite but her thought it would be nice and no one would mind.Then fiancée ran down the stairs in her dressing gown and demanded they leave straight away and went in a rant about how dare they enter her house (it was the brothers house ) however then the brother stuck up for op so the fiancée went back upstairs in a mood",972,4562,0.93
1372,Update,"https://np.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ciziiz/aita_for_not_telling_my_sister_about_my_nephews/

I want to thank everyone who commented on my original post and thought you all desvered an update. I got way more responses than I ever imagined. 

I also want to apologize to everyone who thought that it was a validation seeking post. I never intended to waste everyone's time. As I tried to explain in my post, when you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started walking and talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. 

I have decided to start therapy to help me overcome my nature of second guessing the decisions I make. I have also started following the ex Mormon sub on my main account, which has showed me that I am not alone. So many ex Mormon women struggle with confidence after leaving the church. This is something I always knew I needed to work on for the sake of my kids but it has been amplified. I didn't think I made the wrong decision in not telling my sister about my nephew's boyfriend, but there was that nagging thought in the back of my head. The overwhelming NTA responses combined the amount of people who thought I was the asshole for even posting because it was so obvious, I realized that this is more serious than I thought. If some many people can see it clearly, why can't I? I am hoping therapy helps with that. 

My nephew will also be continuing therapy. He started when he moved in but stopped going because he adjusted so beautifully and didn't think he needed it anymore. He has been great but he has next to no contact with his parents and siblings and one of the few contacts he has from back home showed his mom the instagram post featuring his boyfriend, so he has a lot of emotions to unpack and agrees that therapy might help. 

I am also starting the process of filing for child support. I don't want my sister's money but I am a single parent in a pricey California town. I have a good job but supporting 2 teens and a preteen isn't easy, especially since the oldest will be going to college soon. He will qualify for in-state tuition at UCs and Cal States, which will cut down the cost if he goes to one of those schools but the extra income will be nice for him and I have to put my pride aside to do what's best for my nephew. He is entitled to that money. 

Other than all of that we are still doing well. School starts in a couple weeks and my nephew has been out practicing with my son to get him ready for middle school football. My nephew is looking forward to being the school board representive for his high school and thinks he has a shot at captain for his water polo team. We are taking one final trip before school starts and I fully expect the kids to argue the entire 3.5 hours there but it's fine. That's what siblings are for. I'm not happy about the situation that landed my nephew here but we are thankful that he's in our lives. Thanks to everyone who commented. Things will only get better from here and it's thanks to you guys. I wouldn't have sought therapy if I didn't make that post.",228,7294,0.96
1373,Not the A-hole,"So my new band just recorded our debut EP. It sounds amazing. But one song in particular just doesn’t sound as good as the others, especially because my singing on it just isn’t that great. I had an epiphany last night that I should get the person who co wrote the song with me to do the vocal track because she’s much better than I am. 

My current girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 months. She doesn’t like to hear about my ex’s and that’s fair. I don’t tell stories about the past or talk about them anymore. This particular ex and I have been broken up for almost 3 years and she lives half way around the world. We couldn’t get along at all and are a bit better as distant friends. She even has a new boyfriend who is perfect for her and they love each other very much, so there haven’t been any romantic feelings since we broke up. 

After telling my current gf that I wanted to get my ex to sing on it, she stopped talking to me and is seemingly upset about it. I told her that my only goal was to make the best song possible and this person had the right sound.  That’s it. 

TLDR: AITA for wanting my ex from 3 years ago to sing vocals on my track, even if it upsets my current gf who is much better for me?

1374,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if I will not be very detailed for the sake of anonymity. 

I had a party in my house last week where I invited my friend James. James arrived with his friend Jack and both of them ate the food I served. About thirty minutes later, Jack started getting dizzy and said he couldn't breathe. We called emergency services and he was brought to the hospital were we found out that he suffered an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the food I served. 

Jack wants me to pay for the cost of his hospital bills, because it was my food that caused his allergic reaction. I don't think I should pay because 1. I believe it's not on me to ask every guest and their plus one if they are allergic to anything in the food I am serving, 2. He is the one with allergies so he should have asked if my food had the ingredient he was allergic to, 3. It turns out he did ask James and James told him that my daughter is also allergic to that ingredient so we don't use it. Which is true, my daughter is allergic and we don't use it when she's there but she is away in college right now so we do use that ingredient. 

My husband thinks we should just pay since it is our food that caused his reaction, we are liquid enough to pay for everything and to not make things awkward with James.

1375,Not the A-hole,"I'm 29M, she's 28F. I come from a poor family but am highly educated, she comes from a rich family but has never had a job. We're both only children. We became engaged last Christmas but have been seeing each other for 5 years. I only learned her family is wealthy about three years into our relationship.

She sprung on me two days ago that she and her family want me to sign a prenuptial agreement before we get married to ""protect her"". The prenup details are essentially that we retain financial independence and neither of us are entitled to whatever we make during the marriage, with assets split accordingly. This was never mentioned before so I assumed there would be none. We talked a bit and I decided to call off the engagement and wedding (more like postpone it until we can work it out) and everyone from all sides is calling me an asshole. I'd love AITA's opinion on if I am being one or not.

When we get married, it was floating around that her parents would buy us a house in a more rural area near them. My fiancee was all raring to go with this idea but I'm apprehensive, especially with a prenup as they described. My job prospects dramatically diminish if we do, because my job is very technical and really only found in bigger cities. Unless I could find remote work, my options are either not following my degree's career path or commuting 6\~hr each day, the latter of which is impossible I think we all can agree on. Signing a prenup means my capability to make money is diminished with zero security yet it would be foolish not to take that opportunity as it would eliminate rental costs from the equation.

Say I can make $90,000 in the city but only $40,000 where she wants to move. If we lived there for 10 years then get divorced, that's $500,000 of potential earnings I've lost. Signing the prenup means I can recoup precisely none of it. I would sign the prenup if we stayed where I can make the most money, or I would move if I don't sign it. I just won't do both. It would put me at a disadvantage because in a divorce in that situation, I'd be out of work in my career field, no house, and 10 years behind on my career. No one is going to hire a 40 year old with little experience in my career path.

I'm not a gold digger, if her parents pass and give her their vast wealth, I would hope in the event of a divorce that she kept the lions share. I would never expect 50/50, but I would expect compensation for my losses. To get married and move to where she wants to move, I need to give up my career, basically, something I wouldn't do otherwise. I love my fiancee but I need some kind of security in that I don't give up my career for nothing. My earning potential would be more or less halved if we got married and moved, and I want security in that I'm not giving up that opportunity for nothing.

I tried to compromise in two ways: I'd sign a prenup that said it was dissolved after five years. Her parents are worried we'll get married, I'd ditch her in the first year, and take their money. At least this shows commitment on my end. I also considered a prenup where it becomes dissolved if my fiancee shows infidelity, something she was vehemently against. I don't know why that would be a problem, but the fact she won't is a red flag. I can't sign a prenup that benefits her if she can ruin our marriage at any time.

Ultimately, I thought our love was unconditional but apparently not. Because I won't sign a prenup that's not in my best interest, I don't want to get married. We can remain common law forever, it's not like a wedding is necessary or mandatory, anyways.",1296,6921,0.96
1376,Not the A-hole,"Ok so full disclaimer. This happened a few years ago but it has never sat well with me. Keen to find out what popular opinion says.


I (M) was single, was visiting my friend (F) in another city. We had been friends for over 10 years.


We got talking about we should travel more, and we should plan a trip! We decided on Paris because neither of us had been and it was pretty accessible to both of us. We got a pretty good deal on a hotel and booked travel. This was in November, I think. It just so happens that the date of this trip was just after Valentine’s Day.


In early Jan I got into a relationship with a girl, and it got pretty serious pretty fast. I told her about the trip and she was adamant that I should cancel it as she’d never met this girl and she’d been “saving up” Paris as a holiday destination for when she got into a relationship. I thought that would be a total dick move on my friend, as it would mean she might have to cancel too. Also I thought saving up Paris was rubbish, it wasn’t like I was going to do every possible thing there was to do in Paris in 4 days, was it? 


So I went. Was I an asshole?


Tl;dr - booked a trip to Paris while single with a female friend. Got with a girl before trip, she wanted me to cancel. I didn’t want to so I went.

1383,Not the A-hole,"So I am pretty sure I am not the asshole but she reacted so fiercely I started doubting whether I over reacted.

So I have been going out with this girl for a week or 3, grabbing coffee, hooking up, watching a movie, nothing serious or exclusive since we both had long lasting relationships before and well were just scoping eachother out more or less, not sure whether to commit to anything but kissing and touching etc are normal at this point.

So I take her back to her place this morning, we enter and her dog jumps up at her, she pets him and so forth and then she allows her dog to lick her face and mouth a do let me be clear she was speaking whilst he did this so no doubt his tongue even got in her mouth, well I am just grossed out at this point, so I wait a moment given I want to say goodbye before driving back home and she pretty much walks at me thanks me for the nice evening and goes in for the kiss.

Well I obviously push her away(not hard or anything just to keep my distance) and say, yeah it was lovely, well she starts raising her voice about me not allowing her to kiss and asks me why, so I tell her the dog just licked her mouth so thats gross, she starts calling me names saying I am being a douchebag and a pussy and every other name in the book to the points where tears well in her eyes and all her neigbors are probably awake, so I just walk out and go home pretty stunned about the whole situation.

Yeah I am just confused, I dont think I was being a douche and I have never seen her act like this so maybe I was a douche somehow?

Edit: There seem to be a lot of dog owners/lovers responding concerning dog saliva being cleaner then that of humans. This is a myth, they simply carry different bacteria and such but they are not less gross by any means. But that aside having had dogs all my life, they also eat and lick gross random stuff they find from poop to garbage, their food in general is gross from a human perspective, clean themselves with their tongues including their arse and genitals etc, so yeah its unsavoury even if you buy into the myths.",460,1605,0.94
1384,Not the A-hole,"My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I’m mild-mannered, and they’re taking advantage - that since I’m not a tough guy or something (I’m a young woman), they don’t care.

1385,Not the A-hole,"**Disclosure:** I put this post together with my friend, uploading it on my account. She isn't exactly my best friend (Alex), but someone I used to be a lot closer with (she kinda (not exactly) did the same with me, but this is only a part why I am no longer as great friends with her.)

My friend of 3 years has been god awful at handling this sort of relationship and the past few sort of relationships (let’s call her Alex).

Alex here, has been on dates with a few of my friends, and it sort of has been a pattern of:

1. someone shows interest
2. she responds with interest
3. goes on a few dates
4. gets bored of them
5. ghosts them
6. complains to others that they are not working hard enough towards this relationship
7. chases the next best thing (e.i. someone showing interest in her)

No surprise here, she’s currently on step 7 with a friend of ours, that I don’t think deserves to be in this situation.

This friend (we will call him Mark), messaged me to ask me on my opinion on the situation (as far as he knows Alex still likes him, but isn’t as interested as he is, little did he know she’s chatting up someone she met at a music festival). Mark and Alex are technically not dating, but they are seeing each other exclusively and have been on dates and plan on going on more (basically, they are seeing each other and we all know that there is something going on, but there is no label and there is not too much physical affection).

I feel the need for Mark to know that he’s looking for a serious relationship in the wrong place because Alex has explicitly told me that she doesn’t want anything serious with him, especially now that she’s showing interest in another guy and acting on it.

Alex has done something similar to our other friends and I know that I can prevent it this time. I just don’t know if I have the right to tell Mark of this because while Alex never told me that I couldn’t tell anyone about the things she tells me, I think it’s not right for me to tell Mark about it when Alex could do it herself. However, I’m not confident that she’ll ever tell him.

Me and my ‘Girlfriend’ we’re together for almost 2 years, So I invited my friend to stay over at my house since he got kicked out of his (Didn’t ask him I know). Mind my Girlfriend lives with me also. So as usual I got up, my girlfriend was already gone to work so I made breakfast for my so called ‘friend’. I worked as usual and I was meant to come home 10pm while my girlfriend finishes of at 7pm. There I am, working my ass of to feed my friend, giving him a week to find a job for which he already applied for some. I got nauseous and my head hurt like shit, I could barely even concentrate on my work. So I asked my boss if I could drop home early and I’ll compensate for tomorrow. He replied telling me to not worry if I’m sick and it’s alright for tomorrow. So I get home (my living room is directly in front of my front door. (I think they forgot to lock it, mind my girlfriend would dodge my kisses and say she “didn’t feel like it” all the time.

I told both of them to get the fuck out and I never wanted to see them again. I broke down after they went. How they fuck could they do this to me? I gave my friend a place to stay in, fed him and so on and they betray me.

A week later guess who showed up to my house. My so called ‘friend. I told him to get the fuck out. He told me to listen out and I did. He asked me to stay in my place for a week. U serious? He told me he’s homeless and he needs 2 weeks to figure things out. I slammed my door and went to family about it. After a full day they convinced to let him in. For 2 weeks. I was disgusted to even look at his face and I didn’t make eye contact. After everything of that I asked myself. Why did I let him in? Me, being the ‘nice’ person he remarked me as. Decided to let him stay.

Next morning I wake up, annoyed as fuck get up. And guess what. My fucking house was trashed and there he was, in the middle of it. I asked him what the actual fuck did he do. We had a big scream match and basically the gist of what he said was “what the fuck can I do in 2 weeks. Give me more fucking time u ungrateful piece of shit. (Mind I got him to do chores for what he has done.). There and then I told him to get the fuck out. I got this clothes and threw it the fuck outside. I pushed him out as he didn’t budge. I slammed the door in his face. Went to my kitchen and broke down. I’ll be seeing a therapist. I couldn’t cope with my Girlfriend leaving and then doing all that shit. So much things happened within a week I couldn’t process it all. I felt guilt and thought to my self, what if the 2 weeks were a little amount? I just got him to sleep in the streets as he wasn’t on good terms with his family. 

Maybe I should’ve giving him more time? I had a mixed feeling of guilt and being angry. I just let him sleep in the streets? AITA? This guilt.",34,54,0.78

I roll down my window and the coworker asks if I’ll go to Walmart for some romaine lettuce complete with a pouty expression. I smile and chuckle as I respond asking for $15 in compensation for my time. She looks really surprised and my roommate begins laughing.

1391,Not the A-hole,"Throw away, first time posting, I’m on mobile blah blah blah.

I’m 21(f), and I live in a trailer with my mom. I got home late from work and my dog hadn’t been out to potty or play all day, so I went outside with her to play and let her relieve herself. My dog is an old, and if I’m honest with myself, this is probably her last month around with us. The bad days are getting too frequent, and I can’t just keep medicating her forever. So I want to enjoy my time I have with her.

Halfway through the hour I wanted to spend with her, my mom comes out to tell me she has this guy coming over to hookup. 

The only way to not have to meet her fuck buddy or whatever is to quickly rush me and my dog inside, cutting precious time short, and hide in my room.

The walls are practically paper. This situation has happened before, and when I went to the bathroom I could hear it. So I’m stuck in my room with earbuds, unable to use the toilet in fear of hearing, which would already be awkward for the average Joe, but I’m also a victim of incest. So, hearing about a relative’s sex life (let alone hearing it real time) can be very triggering for me.

I ended up needing to use the bathroom trapped in my room, unable to leave, cutting time short with my sick dog, and terrified. I’d been having a day long anxiety attack, as I had told my mother when I got home before she even invited this guy over, and my door doesn’t lock. So safe to say I am uncomfortable with having a strange man in my house.

The last time this happened we got in a huge fight where my mom guilted me for making her feel guilty that I’d been uncomfortable and upset. I didn’t want a repeat of that, so instead of talking I tried to eloquently write out in a message why I was upset. I tried to explain that I don’t care if she has sex, but that I’d want more than ~6 minutes of warning if she was having someone at our place that I don’t know late at night. If I had even a few hours of warning I could have gone to my cousin’s place and just avoided the situation to begin with. I asked if she could going forward either give me enough time to get out or go somewhere else with whoever she fucks if she can’t.

However, this didn’t go smoothly. She yelled, claiming that I’m being controlling, stating that she can have sex in her own home if she wants and she doesn’t have to give me any time to get out- that she COULDN’T give me warning because “that’s just how hot sex works, op, it just happens.” She told me I need to grow up. She was also mad that I was uncomfortable with strange men in the home because he isn’t strange to her.

Am I the asshole? I know because of my past trauma I’m weirder about this they of thing than most, but I’d also think that that’s exactly why this isn’t an overreaction. Should I just grow up and suck it up, or am I in the right to want the time to leave a potentially triggering situation and not have time with my dog cut short?",52,178,0.91
1392,Not the A-hole,"My whole life I have had 20/20 vision and have never had any concerns (until later years, family members commonly lose sight rapidly in my family) about vision care or anything along those lines. 
I recently bought a pair of blue light filtering glasses for work and the first time I put them on I loved them truly a lot. I thought they went well with what I look like. I dont wear them obsessively but I frequently wear them if I'm on my phone for an extended amount of time but mostly at work in front of a monitor. 
I then started immediatly recieving flak from family members and friends for wearing them even though I'm not ""physically impaired"" or having ""disabled vision"". 
AITA for really not caring that people around me are mad because I'm treating a vision handicap as a fashion piece I enjoy?

1393,Asshole,"My ex fiancée and I split up a year and a half ago after six years together. She is now married to the guy she left me for and pregnant with their first child. Through a common friend, I saw pictures of her baby shower and learned that they will be naming their child Kalle Henrik (name changed). This makes me uncomfortable for a number of reasons. 

Back when we were together, my ex fiancée and I chose names that we wanted for our future children and Kalle Henrik is one of them. There is a personal significance to this name – my family has a tradition that the oldest son names all his children with names starting with the letter K, which is why my ex fiancée chose the first name Kalle. Kalle is actually my grandfather’s name and Henrik is my father’s second name. Don’t ask my why my ex wants to name her son after her ex fiancé’s grandfather and father because I really don’t know.

The man my ex fiancée married is the best friend of my younger brother. I never told my brother to cut his best friend out of his life after my ex fiancée left me for him, and my brother has invited them to some special occasions in the past (his housewarming and his daughter’s birthday) where I and my other family members saw them. This will probably continue in the future, and I think it will be a bit awkward for all of us, knowing she is my ex fiancée and for some reason her son with another man is named after our father and grandfather. 

I also want the option of naming my own future son Kalle Henrik, since it is my grandfather and fathers names. For those who will say that there’s no problem with our children both being named Kalle Henrik, as you can see it is a distinctive name and not common in the US at all, I’m sure people in our town will notice and wonder why they have the same uncommon name.",86,63,0.83

1399,Not the A-hole,"For some background, I am male and my friend is female, we are both in our early-mid 20's and she has been with her boyfriend for 6 or 7 years. We both work in the same office together and have been friends for roughly 2.5 years. Everyone at work is in a tight knit group and the majority are women, I am one of only 3 men in the friendship group while the other 5-6 are women.

Recently, my partner miscarried our child and it completely destroyed me, I felt like my world ended. I haven't been able to talk about it to anyone because it just tears me up to even think about it. After a while I told my friend about it and she was very supportive and nice and everything was good, I asked her to not tell anyone as I never announced the pregnancy and I'd rather not have anyone bring it up or pitying me.

So my friend, her boyfriend myself and a few other friends from work were at a BBQ together last weekend and we're all having a good time. I am not particularly close with her boyfriend and I am aware he is a bit protective of her and he isn't a big fan of me or any of the other boys in the friendship group.

Midway through the gathering the boyfriend pulls me to one side and says he is sorry to hear about what happened. At first I was confused but then it was clear what he was referring to. At first I was just shocked and then it turned into anger. I didn't know what to do so I just left and stormed off home.

I confronted my friend the next day and she said that she lets her boyfriend read through all her messages and he must know from that. I was even more upset that she lets him read all of our personal conversations. I am a very private person and I'd rather not have my extremely personal business being snooped on.

Since then I've refused to discuss anything personal with her unless it's in person as I don't feel comfortable that anything I say is going to be snooped on by someone else.

Now everybody in the office has turned against me and has started to exclude me from events, generally being off with me and over all making me feel now very welcome.

So AITA for being upset? Is it normal for partners to read each others messages? I'm starting to feel like maybe I'm being over dramatic and should just get over it.

TLDR: Friends boyfriend brings up very personal point that he could only know from reading me and my friends messages. I got upset and now refuse to discuss anything personal over message with my friend, now everyone in the office is against me.",26,53,0.88
1400,Asshole,"A bit of context before I get into the situation.
My brother is 2 years younger then me, yet he acts like a child in any serious argument. He says he has anxiety problems and get nervous really easily.

Now normally I would support him through this no matter what he did, but the problem is that he's doing exactly what I used to do to get out of situations, but I would use this kind of behavior when I was 10 or 12, He's 15, and uses this self diagnosed ""Anqxiety problem"" as an excuse to be lazy, even though we have taken him to multiple therapists and psychiatrists, taken multiple tests and even let him get away with it thousands of times, he doesn't seem to change.

Now I should also mention we recently moved to the UK, and I can understand a bit of nervousness to get out, but he has been dodging any form of activity for a good month now, and I've had it.

Today I've asked him to tag along with me in the town center, and if he said I'm nervous/anxious about it, I would at least understand, but he had a full blown ""panic attack"". Started crying and went up to his room, I could tell he was faking it, because I would.

I go up to his room and tell him I can see through his bullshit, and that I won't tolerate this anymore, and he had to grow up or lose my support.

He chose to keep acting this way, and has lost my respect. Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Probably should respond to some of the comments, so here,

""What if he isn't faking it?""

1402,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I moved into a small block of flats last October. The neighbor across from us was frosty, touchy and a bit peculiar from the get go. One of the first things she asked us was if we would have a moving van parked in the communal drive away all day for moving - and no we didn’t. She also pointed out that the though balcony was communal the plants and furniture on it were hers- we’ve never used the balcony. 

Our flat has its own bin in the communal bin area and we share larger recycling & green waste bins with the 3 other flats. The bins are taken out on to the street weekly. We’ve always assumed that someone was paid by body corporate to do it as we don’t have a key to open the gate onto the street and our bin has always been put out and always been brought back each week. We also have a gardener for the common areas, so I figured it was something to do with them. 

Today we were having a few people over for lunch and had the front door open. I noticed the neighbor, who I rarely ever see, walk out of her flat so I called out hello. She stopped to talk to me and asked me why we never took our bins to the street. I was shocked and explained we can’t open the door and, as it’s always been done, assumed that someone was paid to do it or there was some sort of arrangement with body corporate. She proceeded to berate me for not realizing she was taking them out each week and when I asked her why she didn’t bring it up before now she thought we know she was doing us a favour.

Several times, we've tried face to face or letters to ask the offending person(s) to please quiet down. It never works for more than 5 minutes. Our landlords have never cared too much either. (Disclaimer: my husband and I are both 23, so it's not like we're grumpy middle aged people). 

I just called the cops on some young people who actually climbed over the locked fence around the pool outside our apartment window. They have no right to be there, as evidenced by the lock on the gate! They were also loud and playing loud music. Fairly sure some were underage and therefore breaking curfew, because the cops checked everyone's ID.

So, AITA for giving up on interacting with my neighbors who are being too loud and going straight to the cops? I'm sick and tired of the loud music, screams, and underaged drinking. Especially when it's in the middle of the week!

Living in this house is me, my girlfriend (L), my two roommates who are married (X and N) and my last roommate (Z). 

Z has had OCCURING problems with the rest of us, long story short they're rude and manipulative and I can't wait for our lease to expire so they'll move out. One recurring problem is that they expect everyone to make them food and will literally never cook food for us. So I guess this is a stand-in for every time this happened. 

Today I was going to make some supper for me and L. I went to make some pasta, and intended to make two portions. It ended up being 3, so I offered some to X as he was hanging out with us. 

Since me, L, and X hang out most every evening we tend to make each other supper in turn. Not to mention Z is allergic to pepper, which is already in the pasta. 

The 3 of us were eating on the couch, when Z came into the room and asked, ""Can I just ask why I didn't get a serving of this?"" 

I stuttered for a second because of how accusatory they sounded, and said ""I was just going to make supper for me and L, but then there was one extra serving and I offered it to X. I had already put pepper in it so you couldn't have it anyways."" 

They scoffed and left, at which L and X both looked at me like I was a camera in the Office. 

Z has basically refused to talk to me for the rest of the evening. 

We've talked to them many times that we make each other food on the condition that we return the favour; as they never cook for me, I don't care to cook for them. I'm not their mom. 

From Z's point of view: cooking food is an expression of love and care. By not cooking them food, I'm essentially telling them that I'd be okay if they starve.

So I'm obviously biased, but I want to get an outside opinion. AITA? I was already making pasta, so it's technically easy for me to just throw in extra noodles and sauce. I often make pasta for the whole household, and X just got more because he made me and L supper earlier this week.

Edit: someone brought it up so I'll explain, L and X were not angry at me. They were shocked at what Z had said and looked to me with the look of ""Okay what the fuck just happened?""",85,210,0.9
1413,Not the A-hole,"I’m friends on FB (acquaintances in real life) with a woman whose young son was diagnosed with cancer. The survival rate is 0%. There is some experimental treatments, but he didn’t qualify for it, so they are only giving him steroids in hopes the tumor doesn’t grow. The steroids have left him much heavier than he once was, and he now cannot walk. He doesn’t completely understand what’s happening, and his mom is constantly keeping him busy with having friends over, movies, treats, etc. He seems to be really happy despite the circumstances. He can still talk, eat, breath all on his own. His brain is still fully functional.

Last week the mom posts about how they had a fun night eating snow cones with the family. Some lady (not sure how or if she knows the mom) comments on the post telling the mom that she is being selfish by keeping her son alive. Other commenters were telling her how horrible it is to say something like that, but she went on saying that the mom needs to stop being selfish and let him die. 

The following day the mom blocked her and made several posts (with screenshots) about the comments this woman made, asking for support, clearly still distressed and upset by it.

I checked the woman’s profile to see her work place was clearly stated. So... I contacted her work and sent them the screenshots of what she said. I didn’t demand any action, but wanted them to know what was going on. I felt it was the only way to see this adult was held accountable for her actions. The company said they would report it to HR.

The things that later made me feel like I’m the asshole
1. I didn’t ask the mom’s permission blessing to do this.
2. I feel like maybe I was playing some dumb SJW.
3. This could come back on the mom.
4. It wasn’t my place to do something.
5. She didn’t mention her work in the comments, so the situation didn’t really have much to do with her workplace.
6. She could have gotten fired.

The ways I justified it at the time
1. I’m not going to waste this mom’s time dredging up these awful feelings and asking her to make a hard decision by asking for her blessing.
2. I felt like I was doing the right thing.
3. The lady was obviously horrible for saying what she did, but she definitely did not strike me as someone who would harass this mom after being reprimanded at work. That was just my gut feeling. I was right though, she has not harassed the mom further.
4. I was trying to be someone who tries to make sure awful people are held responsible for their actions.
5. Don’t be a shit person, especially if you’re going to list your workplace publicly. If you want to list your workplace publicly, understand that you now represent them when you comment.

1414,Not the A-hole,"Basically title. This happened earlier today and I didn’t have enough time to post it then so I’ll do it now.

I have this friend that I’ve known for about 4 years. We live super close and have a lot in common. When she was younger, she had an incident (that I cannot say for personal and private reasons) that ended up with her wheelchair bound and unable to walk for... forever.

She used to be able to use stairs before her accident and has often told me she misses them because she’s normally now forced to use elevators or one of those motorized chairs to go up a staircase.

Today we went shopping together to pick out from clothes and jewelry for when we go back to school, but the brand of clothes she really liked was on the second floor. The mall we were in had two escalators and an elevator to help people like her out. Of course we go over near them and she says she wants to use the escalator.

I thought she was joking, but turns out she wasn’t. When I asked her to clarify she says she wants me to push her wheelchair on the escalator so she can pretend she’s on a staircase again.

I seriously thought she was still joking until she said that she wasn’t. I told her I wouldn’t do that because she could roll backwards and/or damage the escalator.

She began crying and saying that she just wants to relive a moment where she could be on some form of stairs, free from her wheelchair. I felt super bad but I refused to let her go on them and forcefully pushed her into the elevator.

She’s been refusing to talk and text me, even though I’ve apologized to her many times already.

TL;DR: I refused to let a disabled friend in a wheelchair go on an escalator even though she wanted to remember a time where she could go up something stair related. She began crying.

Edit: for those saying it’s fake, she used to be an avid runner and would run up stairs anywhere she could (especially a nearby library) to help workout her calves. She told me it makes her feel restricted in a wheelchair which is why she misses stairs so much.

Edit 2: wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did! Thank you all so much for your feedback! I feel better about the situation and hopefully I can post an update when my friend finally responds. I also do take the YTA tag for pushing her forcefully. I understand it was rude but it’s better than her wheeling herself over there. I have apologized to her since because she hates being wheeled around like that.",106,273,0.94

Anyways Sara had invited me over to hang out at her place today, John is there with a friend, small talk happens and Sara and I breakaway into the kitchen and John and his friend are in the living room. Sara starts telling me about their “ date night” and the “extra curricular activities” they did after so we’ll laughing and giggling. Then Sara brought up what happened in the morning, apparently John wanted to continue last night’s  fun and woke Sara up by going inside her. After she told me that the only response my brain came up with was “ did you want it”?

She says she wasn’t really in the mood to have sex specially being woken up by it but he had already started so she let him finish.

1419,Not the A-hole,"So this has been going on for a long long time in my house. At this point I'm tired of it and just want to know if I'm in the right or not.

I've been a gamer all my life, and more recently I've been getting into more team based games that require a lot of communication to succeed. My parents understand the idea behind it, but they always get mad when I go to unplug my headset/mute myself when they enter my room. My mom more so than my dad.

For example: I'm playing a game with 3 other friends and we're in a very intense situation, we're all communicating and focusing trying to come out victorious. Queue my mom entering my room to tell/ask me something. In the moment I'll unplug my headset/mute myself so my friends can focus without having to hear my mom in the background talking about something and having us potentially lose.

Ever since I have started doing this my mom always makes comments when I do this. Something along the lines of, ""Oh am I not allowed to talk in my own house anymore?"" or, ""Geez its like I'm a slave in my own house I cant even talk"" Now keep in mind this is only when someone enters my room or is trying to get my attention. I haven't ever just flat out told my family to stop talking while they're in another room. My friends all do the same because we believe its just respectful to one another. I've tried to explain it to my mom but she just says the same thing over and over again.

So, after years of having to put up with this, AITA for muting myself when someone comes into my room?",52,42,0.93

1421,Not the A-hole,"My cousin’s wife (25F), Jazz, is a vegetarian (going vegan, but she is having a hard time giving up eggs lol). I (21F) am an avid meat-lover; however, I really like vegan and vegetarian food, so I often go out to eat with Jazz. I also spend a lot of time with her in general, so I was going to have to get used to it whether I wanted to or not.

Because she’s vegetarian, she usually brings her own food to family get-togethers. Her husband (who usually cooks) is pretty accommodating when we’re at his parents’ house. He’ll usually bring ingredients for a dish to cook for her, rather than have her bring something pre-made or purchased.

However, our other family members are less accommodating. Culturally, we’re known to eat a LOT of meat. It’s in pretty much every dish, so she definitely has to bring something in that case.

We recently were on our way to a different family member’s house, so we stopped to pick up food for her. The restaurant had meat and vegan options. When we entered, there was a large sign for a delicious-looking, non-vegan dish. Since Jazz was already ordering something, I decided to get the dish.

Fast forward to us arriving at my family member’s house. They expected Jazz to come with a meal, but were surprised to see that I had one too.

They had cooked for everyone, but Jazz and I came late because of her work schedule and a prior commitment of mine. No one other than Jazz and I were going to be eating at that time, so I didn’t think it was a big deal to bring my own meal. Also, they’re notorious for making a specific meal that I just really don’t like.

As soon as they found out I had brought my own meal, they hit me with the evil eye. I could tell they were really upset while I was eating, but I didn’t know how to rectify the situation. They had indeed made the dish that I really dislike, so it wasn’t as though I could eat some of that with the meal I brought.

The night ended with my other cousin telling me that it was extremely rude for me to bring my own meal. I mentioned how Jazz had brought her own meal because she didn’t eat what they made and how I’ve made it clear that I’m not a big fan of the dish they had made, so it made sense that I brought my own.

They said it was different because Jazz did it from a “moral” stand-point not because she was picky. Jazz only switched to vegetarian because meat hurt her stomach, and she has only begun to switch to vegan because she’s lactose intolerant anyway. She did not do this for her “morals.”

My cousin still holds that it’s a whole different thing and has pretty much said not to bring my own meal to her house ever again.

So AITA for bringing my own meal to a family get-together?

Edit 1: I probably should make it clear that I dislike the dish they make because it makes me sick. I’m not “allergic” to tomatoes, but they make my stomach upset, and I end up in the bathroom for the rest of the night.

I’ve mentioned this to them before, but they only make THAT dish, so I figured I’d bring my own meal. If I was to go earlier when everyone was eating, I would’ve considered making a dish for everyone, but everyone had already eaten by then.",109,69,0.86

According to her, when your parents or grand parents stay over at your house you are supposed to give up your bed for them to sleep in because it's the best bed in the house and that's just what you do. Apparently that's how she was raised.

I, on the other hand, have never heard of this and was a little put out that she committs us (me) out of our (my) bed when her parents are in town. I explained that the way I was raised guests sleep in guest beds, which we have. Moreover, I told her I'll consent to giving up our bed for a night but would like her to at least talk to me about it first.

1426,Asshole,"We kinda just got into a huge fight and she told her friends what I said. They all think I'm a huge controlling asshole and it's ruined our Saturday night.

How did this get started.....

We met her friend Kavita for lunch today. Kavita just got back from Toronto's carnival and was showing us some pictures. A few of them were her wearing basically a thong.

Now for those who don't know, Toronto carnival or Caribbean style carnivals are not like Brazil's carnival. Brazil is very very tame in comparison, yes the costumes are skimpy but it's a parade.

Caribbean carnivals start off pleasant enough but end up being a public 'orgy' of grinding and dry humping.

Now her friend is married but her husband didn't go with her and she's there telling my wife about how many guys she grinded with (dozens) and how sexy it all was.

Anyway, when we got home I causally mentioned to my wife, if I were Kavita's husband, I'd never even let her wear such a revealing costume in the first place. I said what she did was extremely inappropriate and that if she wanted to go without him she shouldn't have been wearing a thong.

My girlfriend immediately retorted saying she disagrees and that if she wanted to wear a thong in public without me, she can and doesn't need my permission.

I argued back saying, if she did then she'd be single. Thongs send the wrong message to other men. It's effectively like her going somewhere and advertising that she's single and looking to hook up.

She said, that's not at all and that my way of thinking is archaic and sexist. I said that's the reality of how people and guys think.

She told two of her friends and they both sided with her saying I'm way too controlling and insecure.

My argument is that wearing a thong without me present is basically her signalling to other men that she wants to be approached and even hook up because she's being sexually explicit with her own body.

It's not that I don't want to be with a girl who'd do this, it's the fact that she doesn't understand how men think and that women themselves will think she's a whore. If she were to wear a thong on a beach or carnival party without me, I'd have a really hard time believing she didn't do it with the intention of attracting male attention.

1428,Asshole,"Throwaway because friends and family know my actual Reddit handle.

I used to date a girl and we broke up close to a year ago. It was an amicable break up and we still talk from time to time. I have a new girlfriend and she has a new boyfriend. Last Thursday we ran into each other at a local concert. After the show,  we all went and got some drinks (me, my girlfriend, my ex and her current bf).

We were all pretty amped up after a pretty great show. Plus we were drinking a lot. I'm normally pretty reserved but I guess because of the emotional high from the concert and the alcohol, I became more chatty than usual. I spoke quite a lot with her ex and he honestly seems like a pretty cool guy who shares a lot of interests with me.

I honestly don't remember what was said exactly but at some point I must have told him that my ex (his current girlfriend) used to be a sugar baby. I don't recall him getting mad about it or acting surprised. Everyone seemed happy at the end of the night. I was pretty drunk so my memory from the night is a bit hazy. I had assumed he knew. I assumed this because the ex was was upfront about it with me.

Basically she was having a hard time digging herself out of college debt. She deleted her accounts after we started seriously dating. She told me she didn't have sex with any sugar daddies. I don't know if I believed it or not but I didn't really probe further.

Yesterday evening, I received a lot of furious texts from my ex. She told me that I had no right to reveal this information to her current boyfriend. She accused me of trying to ruin her current relationship. She tried calling me a few times but I didn't pickup. It looks like her boyfriend wasn't too happy about this revelation. It looks like this has caused a serious problem in their relationship.

I feel bad about it. Honestly, had I been sober I probably wouldn't have told her ex. I can be a Chatty Cathy when I get some booze in me. Looking back, my current girlfriend tells me that the guy seemed to be pissed off at the end of the night but I personally didn't notice. I'm not great at reading subtle social cues.

But on the other hand, my ex never told me it was a secret. She was very upfront about it with me. I had no reason to believe that she didn't tell her current boyfriend. If she wanted it kept a secret, she should have clearly told me as much.

1429,Not the A-hole,"So my mum pays for Netflix and has made an account for three people; herself (obviously), her boyfriend, and me. 

I LOVE Netflix, I use it a hell of a lot and I’ve logged onto it at my dads house a couple of times before so we could all watch movies together. (Me, my dad and his gf) and I don’t usually log out so I forget that they can use it at any time. One day I’m at my mums house and I see a bunch of new programmes on my ‘continue watching’ list despite the fact that I’ve never even clicked on them before. Obviously, my first thought is ‘what if I’ve been hacked’, so I tell my mum, who changes the password. I then realise it’s probably my dad or his girlfriend. When I think about this more, I still feel it’s right to change the password as they should not be using something that my mum pays for. 

Now this probably seems trivial and you’re wondering why it matters that my dad only seems to be watching a few movies or whatever. Well, firstly, my mum financially supports the two of us single handedly (she has a boyfriend but doesn’t live with him so he obviously can’t really contribute much) and will always make sure I am well cared for. My dad however, is a person who has spent his entire life saving and scrounging up money, (which there is nothing wrong with doing but I’m just pointing it out), not even mentioning the fact that his girlfriend has the money to buy a 5 bedroom house for them both to live in. And while they’re not certainly not rich, they definitely could spare money to pay for a Netflix account. 

A couple more points on how a Netflix account works; now, I’m not sure about the details on this one but the Netflix plan my mum is on means only two people get to watch at a time (which is pretty stupid ngl). So what if one of the people who actually has an account wants to watch it but can’t because others are already on it? It’s not particularly fair. Also, when my dad asked me about why he can’t log in anymore he states that he liked having an account ‘free of charge’, which kinda made me feel like I made a good decision not letting them watch it whenever they want without having to pay for their own. 

I’ll admit it was a petty move. But it’s up to you to decide if it was an asshole move.

I'm just gonna beat you to it, yes, this is a literal shitpost so warning. But anyways, I don't know what brought us to this topic but it makes me uncomfortable. I'm not one of those people who get grossed out by girls pooping, I just find it gross in general, like I do with blood.

Growing up, my mom would always talk to me about her dad. He seemed to be the only good person in her life as her own mom and brother were mentally and physically abusive. Unfortunately, my grandfather died (illness related to exposure to chemical warfare) while my mom was still young, so I never got to meet him. Still, I kind of looked up to him and felt kind of close. He left behind a folded flag among other things.

My mom died several years ago and I snatched that flag up before anybody had a chance to find it and claim it.

Now, my grandmother is asking about the flag’s whereabouts on my uncle’s behalf. I NEVER want them to have that stuff and I feel like they don’t deserve it.

But then I started to feel like an asshole because that’s my grandmother’s late husband and my uncle’s late father. Surely they have more of a claim to it and who am I to keep it from them? Maybe I should practice forgiveness and let them have it.

Or maybe it would be a dishonor to my grandfather’s memory to let either of them lay their abusive hands on that thing. Maybe it actually is better that I have it.

I’m legitimately not sure what to do. I very much want to keep it, but maybe that’s not the right thing to do.

After that she again resorted to dirty tricks saying that she'll be sick if I don't eat because she'll worry about me too much and that it might trigger her panic attacks, I retorted that she should then follow her own catchphrase ""It's all in the mind""...meaning, control your thoughts and you'll be okay.

She said she prefers children from her time when they would just follow there parents, and then warned me that there's been numerous cases of children getting fucked up because they don't obey, and then she told me how the internet is poisoning the minds of people.

She's obviously very insecure and wears baggy boy clothing to cover herself up. When her younger (15), thinner cousin came to visit recently she was pretty noticeably insecure.

When she was a toddler, we fed her very healthy foods and tried to teach her good habits but it never stuck. Her father is an avid runner and all-around athlete who has stayed incredibly fit into his fifties, but he subsists entirely off of pop tarts and trail mix. I was always overweight and binge-eating for her childhood until the last few years when I lost \~100 pounds by running. Between our conflicting lifestyles and the influence of her extremely obese grandparents who practically raised her from two to five, she never learned healthy habits. When she was a little kid we put her in running clubs. She hated them, but little kids need exercise. It's our house, so we made it mandatory for her to join running clubs wherever we went (we're a military family). She tended to want to eat like her father because they spent a lot of time hiking together, but she wasn't an athlete so she had a bit of belly chub in her pre-teen years. I tried different diets for her like going gluten-free for a little bit and she became vegetarian of her own volition. But during middle school, she would closet binge and undo anything we'd tried. She was struggling with a lot of mental health things that we didn't notice at the time and she's still resentful about it. Her father was working a lot and most middle schoolers are angsty so I didn't recognize her anxiety and depression for what it was.

When Mila got into high school and college, she started to gain weight a lot more quickly. She'd just been a little bit chubby before, but now she is officially overweight (bordering on obese). She's become extremely defensive about her fitness and eating habits. We would bring it up and try intervention after intervention for *years*, but she would just deflect and go back to what she was doing. When I tried again recently she said that I don't have the right because she's eighteen. In her words, she thinks that we're overbearing and ""toxic,"" and that we gave her an eating disorder in middle school that she never got treated because we were too busy worrying about ourselves. She thinks that we started worrying about her weight too young (5), but I think her current situation proves that we were right to be concerned all along. She says she's working on it, but we never see anything. This whole thing is a huge source of contention and resentment in our household.

Am I the asshole for worrying about her health?

edit: a word

edit 2: I meant that we moved around a lot because we are a military family, we didn't force her to join running clubs because of it.",379,594,0.89
1445,Not the A-hole,"I live in a 3 bedroom (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs) house with 2 room mates, one of which is my partner. I was the last roomie to move in when their previous friend moved out. When i came into the house i assumed all of the old room mates bills for internet, utilities, rent, etc. Our room mate (T) lives in one of the bedrooms upstairs and my partner and I sleep in the bedroom downstairs together, and I have kept the other room upstairs (that is technically the room that I am renting) as mostly a sensory/decompression/meditation/reading/crafting space that doubles as a guest bedroom for when friends come over. It doesn't have a lot of things in it, just a mattress and some personal items of mine that I use when it's time for some ""me"" time. T is a bit of a hoarder and has stuff overflowing from his bedroom (upstairs) into the hallway, lining his living room space, stuffing his cabinet space, the garage etc. I don't mind the clutter as he keeps it organized and keeps it in his own spaces.

I had fallen into a depressive state the last few months and had not been using the room much because i had lacked the motivation to do the things I enjoy.

Upon going upstairs I saw that T has started moving his crafting supplies into the room, completely lining one of the walls and making the room smell of leather, dye and other unpleasant chemicals. I was never told, asked or even aware that he had started doing this or when exactly it occurred. His crafting supplies also fill the garage, upstairs hallway and most of his own personal space. It had even been brought up in the past when he asked a few months ago what we plan on using the room for and suggested a crafting room and he was told sorry, no, it would be a personal decompression space.

I am a person that takes my coziness very seriously and I can not use the room for its purposes when I can barely breathe when I walk into the room, so just pretending it isn't there is not going to work for me unfortunately. The room may not have been used much over the last several weeks, but I do not believe that makes it free storage space. Luckily, I am also on the tail end of this depressive cycle and can see the room being in use in the very near future for my own projects. I am at the point of telling him to remove his belongings or be prepared to pay for that space's rent as well (i wouldn't put my portion of rent on him just for the room, but I think he absolutely should be paying more rent for using more space.) I have been forgiving about the space he and his belongings take up until this point, but I think I have reached my limit on this one. I do not know if he took it upon himself to move his things in there or if he asked my partner who said he could (still waiting on an answer before I tell T to remove his things) but I don't think that really matters, if he was told yes it was a miscommunication and the situation still needs to be rectified.

T needs to move his stuff, or he needs to pay more rent. AITA?",24,45,0.92

Today I worked with A and she said she was uninvited because she's gay and her wife would be a distraction. I had volunteered to shoot photography for Bs wedding. I made the decision to not go because why the fuck would I? That's bullshit.

I messaged B and told her I wasn't going and didn't agree but it would not affect our work relationship. I wanted to tell her asap so she could get another photographer. She responded that she lied to A and it was because she didn't get along well. Her fiance offered to be the bad guy. I told her if she chose to not tell A the truth I couldn't go. If she was honest I would consider it. She said she wouldn't and we wished each other well.

I know A is crushed and humiliated. Her relationship with B will only be worse. To me, the truth is not much better than the lie. I'm not sure why B did not just use the 'we invited too many' excuse instead of using a very vulnerable aspect of A's personality to scapegoat. I am suspicious that both reasons are true for uninviting A.

I had a massive hangover all day because I drank too much the night before with another friend, but I didn't want to cancel on this friend last minute on the plans we had made beforehand, so I stuck to water when we arrived. 

Well, my friend gets his drink and I ask for a water. The bartender hands me a water on ice and I give her a dollar as a tip. She looks at it and says to me ""really, a fucking dollar?"" 

Having a headache still, I got annoyed more quickly that I usually would and looked at her like she was nuts and said ""What's 20% of free? Nothing. You're lucky you even got that."" She huffed and puffed and then left to continue doing her job. 

My friend later told me that I was a little harsh. I felt kinda bad later, but I still kinda feel like she wasted more of her own time bitching about the dollar on a free thing (I had made sure it was free) than made a point. Am I in the wrong here? Should I have tipped her more?

We eloped because of basically not having time for a real wedding. We talked about it for a while and eventually set a date to formalize it. I liked doing 3D modeling so I designed and had his ring CNCd before spending a few days hand finishing it. It was a pretty neat custom design I was proud of. I told him the kind of things I liked and asked him to buy me something he would think I liked.

A few days before the elopement he told me he hadn’t been able to buy anything. I bought a $20 titanium ring off amazon so we’d have something to use in the ceremony. 

Over the years I’ve mentioned many times how I’d like a ring he chose for me. He’s talked about it but has never bought anything because he’s convinced I “won’t like anything he chooses”.

A while back we were in a bad argument and the subject somehow came up. I got angry and took my ring off and threw it into the woods. He was enraged and threatened to do the same.

1455,Not enough info,"My mom and my dad always had a bad marriage, they fought a lot, but I loved them both despite their flaws. My dad died of an OD when I was 13, and I'm 16 now.

Several weeks ago, I was messing around in the basement looking through all the ancient books someone left down there. Some are as old as the 1800s which is pretty cool. 

In one old book, I found some letters from some guy ""Steven"" to my mom. I found out they'd had an affair, and I was Steven's daughter. My mom wanted to keep that secret from my dad, and Steven also wanted to keep that secret because of his family. The letters stopped soon after my birth. I only saw Steven's side of the conversation, but it said enough.

I wanted to find this guy, I was honestly in shock and just wanted to know more. In some of the older letters, before the one about me, her talked about the college he went to, the frat he was in, his job. And with all that, I looked him up and I was almost positive I found him on Facebook. 

TBH my first reaction was anger, he was really wealthy. Like his kids have ponies and college wealthy. He has 3 kids, a 14 y/o, a 17 y/o, and a 21 y/o. And I just couldn't understand how someone could father a child, know about it, and not give any support even though my family is on food stamps.

I know he's never given my family a cent; I've helped my mom balance our family's budget for years because she's not good at it. I know every dollar that comes in and out of this house

I wanted to be sure though, so I messaged the 21 year old son, and said I thought I might be his half sister, and asked if we could talk. He said yes, and I cross checked a few things to be sure. I asked if he'd tell Steven, and he said no. I don't know what's going on there but there seemed to be some bad blood.

Then, I dwelled on stuff for a few days. I had a lot to say to Steven but I was also scared. Then, finally, I reached out on Facebook and sent him a message saying I know he's my biological father, I know he knows who I am. And he's shitty and a coward for keeping up his white picket fence life, buying some of his daughters ponies, while his other daughter he knew about was trying to budget for the bare necessities.

I stressed about it for days, then got a message back saying that my mother had decided to ""go it alone"" and to not harass him again.

I was shocked and disgusted, that he'd lie to my face when I knew that it was just as much his decision as hers, from the letters. And in that moment, I was so pissed that I took a screenshot of the conversation and sent it to his wife and his other two kids, both on Facebook, and their other social media that I could find, just to be sure it got seen.

And then I uninstalled Facebook and Instagram and closed out of the rest. I'm freaking out and don't want to see if anyone replied.

1456,Not the A-hole,"So I have always had a rocky relationship with my family, childhood was tough and I acted out. After moving out I was diagnosed with BPD and took it upon myself to try and have a better relationship with my family. My parents where not open to this, so I tried to get closer to my brothers. My youngest brother, who turns 20 today, has always been very hit or miss with me. Either we get along really well or we hate each other. He has always been a lot like my father unfortunately, where I was much closer to my mother and grandparents. This resulted in multiple incidents in the past few years, involving him and his friends coming to my house and apartment, drunk, refusing to leave, harassing and insulting my girlfriend, and ultimately fighting me. I always saw these incidents as an opportunity to be a big brother, and try to steer him in the right direction since I had failed growing up. Anyway, fast forward to a few months ago, I come to give my brother a ride back home, he has been drinking and is starting to get belligerent. I hate dealing with him when he gets like that but I grit my teeth and tell myself it's only 12 miles. I've made the same trip hundreds of times. Not a mile from my friends house, as we are approaching a store I hear deafening pops. I look over and he is firing a .45 at the store. I yell at him to stop, grab the gun, throw it down and take off. Well surprise surprise I get pulled over. Racked with guilt I refuse to speak to the officer and I spend the next month in jail, with the same charges they put on him. He also says nothing. Now that I am out, the DA wants me to testify against my brother. He only spent two weeks in jail before my father bailed him out, and now my parents are refusing to speak to me and all three of them are acting like the entire situation is my fault.

She said that was fine and she was still learning herself. My sister and I have had some severe rough patches So I was flattered she invited me and agreed to come. 

So there were 5 adults and I think 6 kids or varying ages and we were camped by a lake in tents. Maybe 11 this morning my sisters father in law said there was a storm coming and fo he safe he wanted to pack up the tents and canopies. I had no idea what to do so I just grabbed a chair and parked it under the awning and played on my phone so I could stay out of the way.

I was oh my phone when my sister slammed open the door just screaming at me that they needed my help. I told he I had no idea what to do so I wanted to stay out of the way. She said “you’re fucking kidding me right? We just lost $1000 worth of camping equipment and we needed everyone’s help?” I asked her “what in the fuck did you want me to do?

She said again that I was a stupid asshole and we were all driving to a hotel because all the tents were ruined by the wind.

I have been a few times before and know a lot of the surrounding areas, which has been nice for my partner to have a bit of a guide! We have visited various attractions including fantastic cafés and restaurants however today whilst visiting the Louvre we went in search of somewhere to get food and found our selves at a lovely looking bistro/restaurant. 

It had a wide selection for myself (vegetarian) and my boyfriend (vegan) as such places can be difficult to come by, Especially in France! despite the price (€10 for a cola and ice tea) we happily sat down and ordered our drinks and then food with a friendly waitress. We both ordered pizzas expecting them to come quickly as the restaurant wasn’t very full. Unfortunately this wasn’t the service we received - we happily waited outside in the sun chatting for what ended up being some time around 35 minutes when the waitress notice our table and seemed to head inside so as to check the order, The but as it would turn out it seems she forgot to put the order through. We then waited for around the same amount of time as she passed us by she assured us our food would be “2 minutes” but we continued to wait much longer. Me and my partner have both previously worked in the industry and were a little taken aback about how annoyed she sounded when she passed us.

After some time we finally decided to cancel the order and go elsewhere as for the price we were paying we expected much better service particularly for a high quality restaurant which was not particularly busy, my boyfriend went inside and spoke to a waitress who directed him to the manager and explained the situation, there seemed to be little understanding and it seemed like we were being made out to be unreasonable and the pizzas were rushed out at the bar and seemed to be undercooked, after a brief discussion as whether to stay or not we decided to stick to our decision and the manager reluctantly and quite aggressively cancelled the order and my boyfriend payed for our drinks we had and we left. 

We have both worked in the service industry as waitresses and waiters and understand the difficulties and stresses it comes with the job, I would have been fine  if she came back and apologised and said she forgot but we ended up waiting for around an hour before we ended up leaving, and for the price for the pizzas (nearly  €50) are we just being obnoxious tourists or were we right to leave?

I was making dinner (pasta) and it wasn't finished yet (pasta was a little underdone still but the sauce was ready to go) and I realised we were out of milk. I said to my brother ""I'll go, can you watch the dinner? You don't need to touch it or do anything to it, just make sure it doesn't burn and maybe give it a stir"". The store is at the end of the road, I was there and back in less than 5 mins. 

In the 5 mins I was gone, mum came in, relieved my brother of his duties, and added a buttload of pepper, salt and tumeric. There was already pepper in there, so now it's got way too much, there's loads of salt (the salt cellar was half full earlier and is now nearly empty), and IDK why she thought tumeric would go in a pasta dish, but the sauce was completely ruined.

She does stuff like this all the time and she's really heavy handed with seasoning, and even on the night I am meant to have total control of the kitchen she still comes in and messes with the food (changing oven temp, adding herbs, even throwing out stuff that I'm using (she threw out 3 chicken breasts once because ""I thought we agreed on beef"")). 

Mum left the kitchen, I went to make another sauce, and then she came back in and saw the first sauce put on the side. She asked why and I just said ""too much pepper"". She then went on a rant about how she tried to do something nice and make it better, and I was being ungrateful. She said she did it to help, she wasn't being malicious or trying to sabotage it or anything, and everything she did it was to help me. My little brother said I should have just used her sauce, but it really did taste bad.

FIL came to trust and rely on her rather quickly.  As none of his adult children live nearby, we were all initially pleased that he'd found someone he liked to look after him in his later years.

However, as time has gone by, some disturbing details have come to light.  We recently discovered that FIL had been giving Connie monetary gifts despite her contract which states she could not accept gifts from employers. Apparently her co-worker turned her in and she was fired by the agency. So fine, she's out of the picture, right? Wrong. My FIL then hires her as *hi*s employee and now she seems to run his life and home.

Since we live in another state we can't visit often but during the last one, we were shocked to see photos of Connie, and Connie with her children, displayed around the kitchen.

Haha I know guys, I'm dumb for not catching on. But it's a hella busy work environment, line was out the door, every conversation is 90% the same and my transaction time needs to be like 2 minutes to do everything. I was focused on saving the guy the £17 admission fee cus he already had a pass 😂🤷‍♀️
***

I work on the front desk at a tourist attraction that has a membership scheme, if you pay once you become a member for a year. This means my till will pop up with a returning customers information so they can get in faster. 
So basically, a couple came in today (on a very busy day) and wanted to sign up for the free membership. As I was putting in their details, my till notified me that the guy already had a membership pass. 

I said ""Oh hey, looks like you've already got a membership!"" 

But he looked alarmed and muttered ""No I don't."" I brought up the information and saw he had last come in June, so I informed him of this. 

""Have you been here before?"" His girlfriend asked him. He shook his head no. Thing is, we keep photos of everyone for their pass and it was definitely this guy. I thought he'd just forgotten, so I insisted; 

""Yeah, you're right here! This is your photo! Your name is 'Gary' right?""

He looked me dead in the eye and shook his head. I thought he'd just forgotten, people forget all the time so I really thought I was being helpful, so decided to look at the whole previous transaction and noticed he'd been there with someone else. 

""Yeah says here, you came in with an 'Alesha'?"" I told him. His girlfriend slammed her hand down on my desk and snapped at him; 

""You were here with 'ALESHA'?!"" 

She was pissed off. Went through the rest of the transaction in a very awkward atmosphere, and they hurried off. I saw the girlfriend leave alone a half hour later, clearly flustered and upset. 'Gary' left about an hour later, and glared at me as he left. 

My boss found it absolutely hilarious that I didn't get the hint that 'Gary' was probably trying to cover up that he'd been there with 'Alesha', and I probably should've helped the guy out. I don't know how I feel about it now, but I do feel quite bad that I failed to pick up on the hints; he wasn't just a forgetful customer on a busy day, he was trying to cover up something that probably destroyed his relationship today. 

TLDR; I accidentally outed a cheater at work, probably breaking up a relationship.

I have broken no rules or laws by seeing that this guy has a group membership pass with another woman, it's just on the system that he signed up for.

Later he mentioned in his speech about it. I was confused cause everyone was laughing and I was embarrassed. About an hour later he called me rude. I'm pretty sure my dad or uncle had a go at him cause he was acting like a two year old and pushing people's buttons way too much.

I also have a dog who unfortunately, even though he's gone every 3 months for his entire 9 years, is god awful at the vet. He needs to be muzzled and used to crocodile roll whenever touched. He has gotten better in his old age slightly (no long crocodile rolls) but it still muzzled. He only needs me to restrain him and the vet can successfully get the blood work. 

He went today for blood work and didn't see his usual vet. He's much easier to handle with his usual vet but what are ya gonna do? This new vet brings in her young male tech wo has restrained my dog in the past and I did not like it, hence he is now only restrained by me. He put him in a *very* firm chokehold ( I suppose it's a normal hold but is not good for my dog). That first time I let him just finish and the vet got the blood work even though I was very uncomfortable with how he was handling my dog. But I realize he needs to take his own safety into consideration so didn't say anything. 


This time I'm trying to position myself in front of my dog so the tech doesn't put him in a choke hold again but he asked me to turn my dog around. I did so cause I didn't wanna be annoying. He put my dog in such a firm chokehold that he started snorting and crying- he literally could not breathe properly and my dog does *not* cry. I've never heard him make those sounds-ever-not even at the vet. So I'm also holding my dogs face and say can we just stop for a second and the guy doesn't stop so I say ""Can I just have him please?!"" I did not yell but I did say it firmly. I'm almost crying (I know I'm a baby but I was scared that his trachea was getting crushed or something) and he gets up storms out saying ""Nah let her do it."" When the vet asked him to try a different hold. 

In the end I restrained my own dog and the vet successfully got the blood.

1478,No A-holes here,"So me and my mother moved in a rural area around 1 year ago, she always loved animals and decided that she's going to grow some chickens.
3 weeks ago she bought 130 baby chickens and started caring for them, in the first 2 days around 11 chickens died and she was very sad so i decided to check up on them before leaving for work and throw away any dead chicken so my mother doesn't have to deal with it. She was very happy about her chickens not dying anymore but yesterday she moved them to a bigger space and counted them, she was expecting 119 but there were only 102 left so i had to come clean and tell her about what i did, now she's pissed at me for hiding it saying that if she knew about it he could've done something.

1479,Not the A-hole,"So my wife and I and friends of ours (4 couples total) rented a cabin on AirBnB for a few days. We are all in our mid-20s and my wife and I have been together for 2 years, married for 6 months.

The cabin is kinda weird, there is 1 tiny shared bathroom/shower, and  aHUGE bathroom/shower connected to the master bedroom. Like a big glass shower with multiple shower heads. A huge jacuzzi bath. Two sinks. Etc..

Because of all the people, and everyone wanting to shower after hiking / swimming in the lake, there was always a big line for the shower.

This is where things got awkward. Because of the big line for the shower, and the limited privacy, we'd sometimes shower at the same time, in our bathing suits. My wife decided to shower in the nude. In full view of whomever else was in the shower / bathroom. She'd also do her makeup / get ready / dry her hair in the nude, while others were in the bathroom.

Not only was she the only one naked. She was also quite obviously getting a thrill out of it. She was talking fast and loudly and just in general being very excited of being naked in public like that.

I should add that we have never gone to a nude beach or done any sort of nudism before. My wife rarely even wears a bikini.

Now, we are good friends with the other couples, and my wife especially is good friends with one of the guys, let's call him Mike. They always seem to have something to talk about. I don't necessarily mind, and his wife doesn't seem to mind at all, but I always kinda got the feeling that she has a bit of a crush on him.

It really bothered me that she was naked in front of our friends, especially the other guys. What really did me in though, was at one point she was talking to Mike while she was completely naked and he was clothed. His wife didn't seem to mind, but she is a bit of an airhead truthfully and never seems to care about anything.

I got mad and told her PRIVATELY she should stop being naked all the time. She told me it was no big deal, that she would never do anything with Mike or anyone else because they are not her type, and that I was ruining the trip for her for being such a prude, and that no one else minded except me.

AITA for being mad at my wife for being naked in front of our friends?

&#x200B;

EDIT - I told her privately to stop being naked, not publicly. My intention was not to embarrass her in front of our friends or to even let them know that it bothered me. I am not a very confrontational kind of person.

EDIT 2 - Pointed out that she was not naked just when showering.",407,1297,0.96

1481,Asshole,"The other day I (19 M) went to a local coffee shop with my mom who lives in the area. We were planning on spending an hour or so there to talk. When I ordered my drinks, the guy serving us at the counter (who I know to be the manager, from having gone there many times in the past) told us that they’re closing in 15 minutes.

This surprised me, because I’d just double-checked their hours this morning since it’s been a while since I’ve been here, and according to their listed online hours, they should have been open for another 2+ hours. I politely pointed this out to the manager, and he said they recently changed their hours.

I told him that their official Google/Yelp listings list their hours different, and then said to him, “I’m going to need you to change the hours on those sites so that they match your new hours.” I said this politely but in a serious, business-like tone; like a teacher might tell a student “I’m going to need that paper in by Monday,” or a doctor might say to a patient, “I’m going to need you to start taking that medication tonight.”

He responded well, but once we got in the car my mom started getting really mad at me, saying I was disrespectful to him. She went on and on about he’s a “fully grown man”, how this is his business not mine, and how a young customer like me doesn’t have the right to “command” and “boss him around” and tell him how to run his business.

1484,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the formatting and any grammar or spelling errors. 

So to give context to this situation my older sister gave birth to a baby girl five years ago and during her pregnancy decided that since she could barley take care of the child she already has that the best thing for her life and the child’s life was to put the baby up for adoption. My sister worked with an agency and choose a wonderful family, it’s a semi closed adoption so every year my sister will get some pictures and an update on the child. The child’s parents made it clear to my sister and my family that they raise their children knowing they are adopted so that as they get older if and when they decide they want to know about the biological family there are no secrets. Because of this my family (mom aunts grandma sister and myself) put together a scrapbook of photos of all of us from that time and brief descriptions of who we were.  As the years have gone on my sister has chosen to have more kids. She now has 3 daughters and a son. 2 of the daughters and the son were born after my sister gave the baby up for adoption.  Now here’s the issue I’m currently planning on getting a familial tattoo for all my nieces and nephews. I have quite a few as I’m the baby of 7 kids from a blended family. When discussing my plans for the tattoo around family my sister over heard and asked if I was going to include the baby’s name as I did for my mother’s bracelet. (I gifted my mother a bracelet with all the grandkids names and birthstones for Christmas and included the baby’s name and birthstone as my mother chooses to include the baby in with the other grandkids). And I answered that I had planned to leave a space in the design for her name to be placed if she chooses when she is older to have a relationship with me as my niece. And that until the baby is old enough to decide for herself I don’t consider her my niece because while she is biologically my niece I am not her aunt.  She knows whom I am as I know is who she is but we have no relationship. My sister than freaked out stating I can’t leave out one of her kids but include all the others that regardless of the baby being put up for adoption that she is still my niece and should be recognized as such along with the rest of my nieces and nephews.  I tried to explain again my reasoning behind just leaving a space instead of automatically putting her name in the piece is because when the child is older even though she is growing up knowing she is adopted she might choose to not have a relationship with myself or the rest of the family and I don’t want to add her name listing her permanently on my body as my niece if she doesn’t want to be known as my niece just because we share DNA.  Sorry this got so long!

1485,Not the A-hole,"Hey everyone,

I am an ex-Muslim (F19) living in the US. But even though I am theologically not really a Muslim (I would say I am agnostic-leaning), I have no interest in shedding the cultural aspects of my upbringing and I still see myself as a cultural Muslim (think secular Jew or a socially liberal cafeteria Catholic)

So Eid is coming up, and I thought that in order to go help raise the image of Muslim Americans, I would go and give out eid hugs to random passer bys. Traditionally, Muslims would give these to each other, but only to those of the same gender (outside of family). Now I see no issue with hugging guys and think that hugging guys would be great for good will. It is how I want to celebrate my cultural holiday.

However, my sister, who is practicing Muslim is against this, saying that this would amount to a mockery and misinformation campaign on Islam and Muslims, since opposite-gender hugs are against the mainstream POV. Furthermore, she said that if my parents find out I am doing this (I plan on doing this where my college is, about 2 hours away form home), it would be bad for me (since they don't know my views) and for my family as it would shame them that their daughter is ""whoring around"".",31,42,0.91

1487,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds awful but there's a reason I did it. There's a Facebook friend who likes to post jokes about Irish and blondes being stupid, fat people being greedy and so on. Around Christmas last year he shared a ""joke"" about a fat woman falling downstairs, oh how I laughed. 

Then he shared a picture of a bigger lady (not as big as me) who cosplayed Laura Croft. I personally thought she looked amazing and if I looked that good dressed like that I would refuse to wear anything else. Work? Kindly pass me my shorts. Funeral? The things on my legs are black so I'm practically wearing mourning clothes, I feel so Victorian! Simon says pass me shorts, I can see them behind your back!
I then noticed there was a caption that read ""Fridge Raider!"" Now his jokes aren't directed at a single person but this was. It was cruel and nasty. I hoped the woman hadn't seen it but it had been shared a LOT so I'm pretty sure she did. 

The thing is that he weighs a damn sight more than her, I'd say almost twice as much. He had tagged me in the post so under his comment I write ""Ok so put the same clothes and let's see how YOU look"" 

Someone recently bought it up and said I was TA, that I had fatshamed him and if I don't like something then scroll by it. Said I had embarrassed him. I asked about ""Laura's"" embarrassment but I got no reply. 

I Had he posted a cartoon of a bigger Laura Croft I wouldn't have said anything but if that was me and had read the comments i would have been devistated, yet was I just as bad? After recently being called a stupid fat bitch while driving I'm starting to believe I should have just commented that the post was hurtful and how would he feel if someone shared his photo insulting him rather than putting what I did. AITA?
EDIT: I didn't call him fat, just suggested he get those clothes so we can see what he looks like, but I didn't say anything else although god It was tempting.

1491,Not the A-hole,"I (70F) unexpectedly inherited $1.1 million from my aunt. The money is unexpected because it is more than we thought it would be and because I and my brother (68M) had always thought that our aunt would leave the money to both of us to be split evenly.

My brother is quite wealthy and has always lived a very affluent lifestyle, taking many trips around the world and to his condos in Florida. He is a successful professional and has always been much wealthier than me. He has no children. I have 2 children, both in their thirties. Both of my children are happy and well but neither of them is wealthy. Like me, they both are working ordinary middle class jobs that pay far less than what my brother has been able to earn throughout his life.

A complicating factor is my brother has suffered from depression for most of his adult life. He became extremely despondent when he learned that my aunt had left all of her money to me. My first reaction was to tell him I would give him one half of the money as we had always thought that both of us would split the inheritance. Now that it's been a few weeks, I'm beginning to have second thoughts. I wonder why should I give my brother over a half million dollars when I could be giving it to my children who need it far more than him?

My brother has loudly complained that life is unfair and my aunt must have hated him. He also says or implies that I don't deserve the money because he did much more for my aunt when she was alive than I ever did. I can't be sure if he is saying that due to his depression or if he is trying to manipulate me. He seems to want me to feel guilty for having inherited all the money. I do love my brother very much and sincerely want him to be happy.

I am not rich but I'm well enough off that I don't need the money for myself. I am content to continue living as I have been.

If I give the money to my children instead of my brother, I am all but certain that I will destroy my relationship with him and may even be forced to move away from the town we both live in now. I enjoy my social life in this town but my brother is central to it. If give the money to my children, my brother may isolate me from his social circle, leaving me with a much poorer social life. Not to mention he will be very unhappy. I dislike being afraid of that, but I am not as young as I used to be. At the same time, if I give the money to my brother to retain his affection and my social life, how will I be able to enjoy it?

If I give my brother less than one-half of the money, in some ways it all seems even worse. $100K is nothing to him. I wish my aunt had left it all to him instead of me.

1492,Not the A-hole,"So first a bit of background: I'm in high school. It's currently summer, and we just came back from a few days vacation so I'm at home for almost the entire day. My grandparents came over this week.

My bathroom's door has a broken lock, so whenever I go to the bathroom, I can close the door but can't lock it. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but again, my grandparents came over to our house.

I was going to take a ~~shit~~ poop yesterday morning. My bathroom door was closed, but my grandmother just opens it without knocking, pokes her head in, and starts making funny faces at me, expecting me to laugh. Like, do I look 6 years old? I get pretty annoyed so I tell her that my bathroom lock is broken, I need privacy, and please knock next time she enters my bathroom. My grandmother mutters something about me being ""no fun"" and ""entitled"" and then goes away.

Then, yesterday afternoon, we were watching a movie. My dad feels the need to explain every single fucking detail in the movie to me, as if I didn't know English and have never watched a movie before. I tuned him out for a little while with occasional nodding and periodic bursts of ""yeah, mmhm..."", but his voice is so loud I can't even hear the movie anymore. Eventually I get so ticked off I tell him that I know what's going on and please stop talking over the movie. My dad gets mad at me and gives me a rant on being an ""ungrateful teenager"" which obviously ruined the whole movie for me since I missed about 10 minutes of the climax.

FURTHERMORE, yesterday evening, my mom, my dad, me, and my grandfather were playing cards, and my grandmother was watching a TV show. For some reason they all insist ""going easy on me"". Every time it's my turn to play a card, they peer over at my hand and start giving advice like ""you should play a joker"" or ""you should play this ace"" or something. They purposely let me win every single round. Again, I'm not 6 years old, I don't need you to go easy on me. I know strategy and how to count cards. It's so boring to win every single round that I eventually get my grandmother to play with them and I go off to my room to play Dota 2 with my Steam friends.

1493,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway obviously 

For some fucking reason, my mother in law casually mentioned in a room full of people that she’s going to divorce her husband in 2 years when their youngest kid (my wife’s sibling) graduates high school. Hey only reason was the she wants to move to a different state to retire and she doesn’t think he’d ever agree to leave their current house, which has been in his family for something like 3-4 generations. Nobody really reacted the way I thought they would, a few people laughed and said some encouraging words but nobody said anything like “What the fuck why would you string a good guy along all these years if you’ve already decided on a divorce” which is what I wanted to say but kept to myself. 

My father in law is a good guy, he’s done a lot for me and my wife and he seems to be a good dad to the many younger siblings (they had a lot of kids). I don’t think he’s really done anything to deserve being divorced and I REALLY don’t think he deserves to get played the way he’s going to for the next 2 years if nobody speaks up. I got into a small argument with my wife over this because she already knew about her mom’s plan and told me not to say anything to anyone. But I just think this is so fucked up to have everyone know this secret except the one person it will hurt the most. My kids call him “Pop Pop” and now I’m going to have to sit here and pretend everything is fine for the next 2 years and just wait for this clock to strike zero on Pop Pop’s marriage.

We had a small get together at my apartment last night with some friends, it went well, fun was had, but at some point my girlfriend told me that she liked that i was a ""safe"" option. It bothered me to the point where once everyone was gone, I brought it up again and we had a horrible fight about it until the wee hours of the morning. 

She told me it was a good thing. That I make her feel safe and secure and loved. That the other people shes dated never made her feel secure in that way.

1497,Not the A-hole,"Using throwaway.

Im 42, married very happily with two great kids aged 13 and 11. When I was 16 I slept with an adult volley ball coach (complicated but she was essentially a coach at a summer camp my little sister was attending). I actually enjoyed the experience but really didn’t understand all the implications and implosion possibilities when I was 16. Well woman got pregnant, swore left right and center that it was her fiance’s baby and I went about being a kid (and didn’t have sex again until I met my now wife). 

Out of the blue in April...I got the “surprise I’m your son call” from a 24 year old guy named Traycon (or that’s his gamer name). I wanted to throw up because all the timelines matched up, he shared my general physical characteristics and he knew all about me. My wife was livid and moved out with the kids and threw my life jntl total turmoil. I tried to convince her to please know that while I was responsible, I was a kid at the time and had never done anything like that ever again. She had since moved back but we are in couples counseling because she feels very betrayed. 

Not only did all that happen but Traycon is an absolute asshole. Ice tried to get to know him (he refuses a paternity test until we have a relationship—backward ass logic that I feel trapped by) There is no other way to put it and he openly asks me for money, wants me to pay for his college, gaming, cars and a vacation to “our” home county in Ireland. Of course all this is driving my wife insane and she’s threatening to leave again. I feel trapped by all of this and feel actual despair like there’s no way out. The only saving grace is Traycon lives 5 hours away so most of the time I can tuck it away but he texts, calls and emails at least 5 times a day, usually more. 

Would I be the asshole I just tell Traycon that he made it 24 years without me, he will be just fine without me for the rest of his life. If he wants more he can stop the games with the paternity test and let us both know the truth. Would that make me the asshole?

Edit: wow this blew up like crazy. I left because the early  shitpost comments about my real life really hurt and I felt like I didn’t need to put up with that (yes I made a mental error because he is turning 26 I don’t know why I said 24. I’ll read all comments but in the mean time I decided to call Brian (I decided if he’s going to be in my life I’m going to do us both the dignity of not calling him by that ridiculous gamer name) and told him we have to do the paternity test to continue. He told me to go fuck my self and would never consent to it. I’m going to go talk to a family law lawyer first thing Monday and find out what my options are. I don’t feel as bad seeing all the NTA comments.


Edit: people are being very harsh on my wife, she a great mom and incredibly hard worker so I should have been more clear. She left and feels betrayed not for what I did when I was 16 but because I panicked and so readily allowed Brian into our lives with no proof, let him meet (and scare the crap out of) our kids, let him stay over and that sort of thing. To her it was as if I was allowing a complete stranger in our house. I guess I was. She really is not an asshole in this and I didn’t describe her part in this correctly.",660,3539,0.96
1498,Asshole,"For two reasons really but my main reason is potentially AHolish. I've tried to compromise that he just comes to the reception but she's really upset that I didn't want him there at all.


1. I don't like her bf. I've had to pick her up crying at midnight because of him and when something like that happens she says he's abusive, and when they're happy again she says she was just exaggerating. Not just that though, I just don't like him, there's just something off about him and I really don't want him there at my relatively intimate ceremony. My partner and I are paying a lot of money per person for ceremony (with limited capacity) and wedding breakfast attendance, and it would mean someone we actually want there wouldn't make the list.


2. If she's my maid of honour she's supposed to be helping me, checking my hair is still in place and makeup isn't on my teeth, and would likely be running around sorting out last minute things to keep me less stressed on an already stressful day. So he'd just be there like a lemon on his Todd all morning. And if she has to babysit him as well she wouldn't be focussed on me like a maid of honour would be. I was so torn between my sister and best friend anyway and my best friend would most likely make up the slack but without the recognition which I think is unfair to her. My mum doesn't like the idea of me having a head bridesmaid and a maid of honour as well. So I've said if she really wants him there she can't be a bridesmaid let alone my maid of honour.


Am I being a bridezilla if I want my maid of honour/bridesmaids focussed on me for one day whilst we're doing wedding party things like photos and getting ready? 

We're sisters so we fight and make up but this has hurt her feelings. However, I don't feel like I should compromise much more and have to invite someone I don't like to my wedding. AITA?



Edit: we're operating generally on a kind of ""no ring no bring"" type situation. I didn't know that wedding party members were supposed to have plus ones - I think that might be an American thing?

Edit 2 for info: they've been official for 6 months.

Edit 3 verdict: turns out I'm an AH. I've discussed with my partner about giving wedding party +1s and we'd rather be AHs together about this. Funnily enough the reason most people think I'm an AH (the secondary reason) is the reason that my parents thought made the most sense, since they're of the mind I should just suck it up and invite people we don't like.",144,254,0.91

So basically she contacts me every day or so and I really cant be bothered to talk with her because I dont like her as a person. She never has ANYTHING to say about herself, always asks questions about my life and then, later, she doesnt remember anything I told her. For an example, i spent an emotional 30 minutes ranting about my new job and the colleagues and, as per usual, I was met with her fake-nice ""ahem, good"".

My friend is working a stable job and have a bit of savings but just a month ago, she was planning on going back to school, we're planning on travelling together (I'm gay btw) and just so many plans to do as we go along but I don't think it is possible now that she is having a baby. When she asked me about what to do, I have told her that she is not ready to be a mom and that she has a bright future ahead of her so I suggested abortion. My friend is a hardcore Christian and she believes that it is a ""sin"" to have one. But I have told her that being mother is not that easy coming from a big family. Her boyfriend does not want to be involved, her mom is disowning her and basically telling her to have an abortion. I am not suggesting it cause we had plans, I was suggesting it cause I think a baby at the moment and raising it as a single mom is not very practical and will not be a burden for her.

I [24M] met my wife [30F] in college. She became very insecure about her age after our first year together, and whenever I would talk to other women at school it would make her jealous. She was also afraid that I would leave her for a younger woman. I almost broke up with her because it was a constant issue, but then she went to therapy, and eventually overcame it.

It was her 30th birthday yesterday and I made a light-hearted joke that she was old now. She started crying and had a nervous breakdown. I apologized for my joke and tried comforting her, but she pushed me away and said I was right about her being too old for me.

I told her that I was extremely sorry for ruining her birthday. She said it was okay, but she cried the whole night, and didn't want to sleep in the same bed with me.

1503,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account bc SIL knows my reddit and I fear for my life if she knows I'm posting about her lol. 

My older brother is getting married in September. His fiancé isn't exactly my favourite person. She was three years ahead of me at school and, while I hesitate to call it ""bullying"" because it wasn't *that* serious, she and her friends definitely gave me a rough time throughout school and needless to say I've always kinda resented her a bit. 

She's been super stressy about the wedding, to an extent that I feel is unnecessary. She'll stomp her feet and pout over the slightest thing, from the venue not having the exact right shade of off-white for the seat covers, to my brother suggesting a different flavour of cake to the one she picked out (he slept in the guest room for three nights after that one). Like I said, to me, it all seems very unnecessary and OTT, but for the sake of keeping the peace I've kept quiet thus far. 

Two days ago, however, I'd kinda had enough. Our cousin is also getting married in two weeks, and my little sister is being bridesmaid at both. SIL was already pissed that cousin's wedding is so close to hers (even though cousin's was booked first), but she absolutely *lost it* when my sister showed her the bridesmaid's dresses for cousins wedding. You see, they're blue, and SIL wanted *her* bridesmaids to wear blue. She went off on this huge rant about how cousin is trying to upstage her and stealing all of her ideas. Mind you, cousin's bridesmaid's dresses are a super deep royal blue, and the ones SIL was considering are a very pale baby blue, as well as being a completely different style. Maybe I'm just being a fashion-ignorant man, but I really don't see why they can't *both* have bridesmaids in blue, especially when the dresses are so different. 

Anyway, when SIL stopped ranting and calling our cousin every name under the sun I kinda rolled my eyes and went ""They're just dresses, no need to go all Bridezilla about it."" As you can imagine, she didn't like that. She stormed out of my mum's house in a huff, sent me a number of abusive texts, and has been ranting about me to my brother and trying to convince him to drop me as a groomsman ever since. He's pissed too because now he's getting an earful because of me, my sister says I could've ""said it better"" and my mum keeps telling me that I'm being insensitive and that planning a wedding is super stressful for a bride so I should be more considerate about why she's so highly strung at the moment.

1504,Asshole,"Excuse my English, I am not good at it and very tired at the moment. I have been browsing this sub for a long time now and I think its time I give something back. 


My wife is sick, and without details, is on her way to inevitable death. All I can do now is to make her pain more endurable. My 14 year old daughter used to be taken care of by my wife, but she has gotten weak, so we had her moved to her parents place where my in laws look after her.


I have taught my daughter to look after herself and manage the housework when I am working. I work 6 and a half days a week and take extra jobs to pay for my wife's medical fees and living expenses, so I don't have much time for my daughter and usually so tired and just sleep after work. I also have given her only enough money to buy groceries and she had to cook her own meals and bring to school. 


My daughter had been good for some time, until recent, she has become lazy. I often return home seeing no house work done and the place in a mess. Sometimes I would do it myself, but when it becomes a pattern, I would scold her.


She has become rebellious and complains about her life, whatever her friends do she couldn't and stuck at home because she has no money and had to clean the house like an old wife. She also said that her mother would not like how I treated her and would complain to her. I warned her not to, my wife is troubled enough without her daugher giving her more.


She yelled at me again earlier when I told her not to leave food as it may spoil. She said she is d(e)pressed because I made her so, and she hoped I was not her father. I lost it and told her that her problems is the least of our problems now, it is a luxury we cannot afford. And if she is so unhappy she can leave, but will expect no money nor help from me ever again. As long as she lives in, she has to go by the rules, and it is to simply look after herself and the house.

1506,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my ex and I broke up at the beginning of the year. (but things had been bad LONG before then) We have two kids together and I have them during the week and he gets them every weekend. 

A couple months ago I met a guy and we became friends. We got along really well and I was interested in starting a new relationship quite yet, so we decided to JUST be friends. So after a couple weeks he meets my kids and they both love him and he’s great with them. 

For a little back story before I go on, my ex is in a very bad money situation and is still living with his parents because he doesn’t know how to budget. So I am always having to fight him for child support (which is WAY less than the state minimum usually requires) 
That being said, my friend started helping out every now and then with dinner or gas, sometimes groceries, just little things here and there. 

Well, after about a month and a half we realized we have feelings for each other and decided to start dating. He has already met the kids and been around them (and we haven’t changed our behavior around the kids) 

My ex found out and told me that I cannot have him around the kids anymore because he “doesn’t want a bunch of temporary men around his kids” and “doesn’t want him or them thinking he’s daddy now”
I told him that I would have him around the kids less, but they already had a bond and a relationship that is good and that I don’t feel that his place in our life is “temporary” and nobody is thinking he’s “daddy”

So, am I the asshole? Should I keep my friend (now boyfriend) away from my kids until things are more serious?

EDIT: 
Since so many of you are a bit confused I should have added that this friend lives in my apartment complex, he’s worked at the gas station by me for a year. I had known of him. We were acquaintances. We discovered we had mutual interests, became friends. At the time I was having a difficult time coming to terms with my sexuality and I was confused and wanting to date women. (I was talking to one, who did not meet the kids, because that’s not usually how I would like to go about things) he was a big supporter during this time because he was one of the first people who knew. 

After a couple weeks he came over one night for dinner. That’s when he met my kids (him and I had hung out without them a couple times by this point and I’d done thorough SM and google stalking) 
It wasn’t until another month and a half or so later that we decided to pursue things further. At this point I had come to the conclusion that I am bi, and not lesbian. (Also not trying to “score points” with my sexuality. Just thought it was relevant) 

I also want to say that, to me, my exes concerns do not come from a place of sincerity when it comes to the kids. He made several comments about me “having temporary men” in my life (which is not true. Him and I were together for six years, and this is the first person I’ve actually dated since and the ONLY person who has met my kids) and then went on to say that I crash and burn every relationship I’m in due to past trauma. Never once did he ask about how the kids felt, or how my friend is around them, or even to meet him. (Which is something I’m going to suggest to maybe give him peace of mind) 

Also, for those of you saying you shouldn’t introduce ANYONE to your kids for at least six months (even friends) that’s kinda silly imo. Dating, I understand. And I do say that I would not have wanted to introduce my kids to someone I was dating so soon. I’m not trying to excuse my actions, but I truly did not think (at the time) that we would be anything more than friends.",114,209,0.9

-We could have easily taken his car but my car has better air conditioning and ‘is fun to drive’ (his words)

In general I think he is a good driver which is why I trusted him to drive my car and he was doing me favor by driving. I don’t think it would have happened if we took his car (my car is easier to speed in) or if I drove.

I understand ultimately I’m responsible for the ticket because it’s my car. But I feel since he was driving he should carry some or all of this price.

To be quite honest, objectively we don't have good genes. I feel a lot of guilt for how much I knew and just... didn't care the first time around. I naively thought age would make it fine. It obviously didn't. This child is a light and I love them, but I should never have had children. I do everything I can, but on some level nature will ""take care of it"" much like I thought back then, but it's horrifying now.

We toyed around with the idea of a second child, but I demanded full PGS testing, IVF, and being open to a termination if necessary. I brought up an egg donor, anything to help the future child have a better chance. He refused all of this, and we were at a standstill. I ended up having another accidental pregnancy, and I am freaking out. I'm having all of the tests, including those I have to pay out of pocket for, and termination will be happening if there's even a 50% chance.

She had been 18, she'd been approached by a much older man, about 40s, at a cafe. She decided to go out with him and see how things went even though she wasn't sure about the age difference. 

They had a dinner date, he was pulling out all the stops to impress her, and afterwards they went for a walk along the river. He bought them ice cream, and when he was paying, she thought she saw a wedding ring hidden away in his wallets card pocket. 

She didn't get a good look, so when they were sitting on a walking bridge over the river eating their ice cream, she had the idea to shift the conversation to bad drivers license photos, to get a look in his wallet again. It worked, he took it out and she got another look... Sure enough, the guy had a wedding ring taken off and stuck in a card pocket. She grabbed the wallet like ""WTF is this"" and the guy just looked at her dumbstruck and then babbled something about how he hadn't meant for her to see that. She was so mad she threw the wallet into the river, ring and all.

At this point in the story, I asked ""what happened next"" 

Claire got the giggles and said ""I chucked my ice cream into the river too, and ran all the way to the train station. Swear I ran for miles; got more cardio that day than all year.""

I got the giggles too then, the story was just that ridiculous. I said ""That's some poetic justice, I wonder how that fucker explained it all at home"" 

Claire went ""Maybe he said a fish ate it"" and we got the giggles again.

My boyfriend then said that ""it's not that funny"" and when I couldn't stop laughing, he said that it wasn't funny to throw something that cost thousands into a river, like it's 'justice'. That shit was illegal.

I was a little annoyed because Claire has just been telling a funny story about when she was young and dumb... So i told him to chill, all I said was that it was poetic justice, it's not like I think that's legal.

Claire was looking hella embarrassed by that point but Dylan didn't want to let it go, to the point where I decided to take him home because he was ruining the vibe. On the way home, he was irritated with me for having laughed so much at Claire's story.

For my birthday last Thursday, I had my girlfriend and several close friends over for pizza and beer. They brought cake and gifts for me, which I opened after we ate.

From my girlfriend Allie I got a check for $300 with paperwork to open a mutual fund. She said that she was giving me seed money for the fund and I could add my own money to it to grow it for future needs. J doesn't come from money and is saving up to go back to school full time so I know she must have adjusted her spending to save this money for me - of course I was grateful to her for her gift. I thanked her, kissed her and told her that I would do my best to grow the fund.

From my friend Erica I got gift certificates for freediving lessons. I love to swim and recently got interested in freediving, but lessons are so expensive and I won't have the money for them after buying the needed gear, which can also be pricey. Needless to say I was jumping for joy when I saw Erica's gift because now I could do something I've always wanted to but couldn't afford.

I noticed that Allie was a bit quiet after so when she went to the kitchen I followed her and asked her if everything was OK. That's when she said that she was upset that I would show everyone how much happier I am with Erica's gift than hers. She also said she is hurt that she spent months saving to get me the money while Erica, whose family is wealthy, didn't have to make any effort to buy me her gift. 

I told her that I am equally happy about both their gifts, but she insisted that I am obviously happier about Erica's. And to be honest, I guess I am - but it's not like I don't appreciate Allie's gift, I was just more excited to get something that I've wanted for a while  compared to something that I have not wanted, though I know it's a very useful and thoughtful gift.

My husband's parents were always very dismissive about our rules.

""Give them the healthy snacks I prepared"" they give sweets
""Dont give him that"" gives him that
""No more than X amount of tv"" the entire day in front of tv

Every single time they would say "" i raised your husband this way and look how well he turned out!"" And my husband would say ""they are grandparents, they are suppose to spoil them""

Which fine. Fair enough. My kids still followed the rules at home (though a day after they visit they would always be bratty) and I had to admit it was mostly harmless.

But they crossed the line. See, my husband's father is the type that laughs when a kid says a bad word, hits/breaks something or has a tantrum. For him it's ""cute"" when children do adult stuff. 

So he taught my 6 year old son to cuss. Not just accidentally cussed in front of my son. After my kids' 3 day weekend stay he went in for some tea when he was dropping them off and suddenly went ""[Son's name] come here! Show what me and gradma taught you! Come on honey"" while grinning. I listened excitedly thinking it will be a nursery rhyme. And yeah it kinda was. A rhyme. Full of cussing, mentioning things like ""fucking strippers"", dicks, drinking vodka etc. 

My FIL laughed, said he taught my husband the same thing when he was young and it was hilarious. I was fuming. I told my son to leave and I ripped my FIL a new one. Telling him that until he learns to respect my rules of raising kids he wont be allowed to see them and that this IS the last time they ignored me.

Who the HELL teaches a 6 year old this kind of a thing? After I explicitly asked them multiple times to not swear in front of my kids?! Do they even realise what will happen if he says that in school in front of other kids or teachers?

My husband says we shouldnt outright ban them from seeing kids, that just a stern talking to will suffice, besides ""it's only a stupid rhyme honey"". I disagree. I think they need to understand and that if they do get banned for a bit (not permamently) it will drive the point home.

It's a sort of passion project/space to vent my frustrations, so it's all very genuine. It's like a rant against people I don't like, and people in general. My usual material is a lot more palatable, and fairly non-serious, but this is a song I have genuine love for, and worked hard on. 

I brought it to my bandmates, they read the text and looked disturbed. They then looked at me like I'm some psycho, and said ""we can't play this"".

Last week, the topic of what we would name our potential children came up and she is under the impression that they would take her name.

This caught me off guard (I assumed she would take mine) and set off a long heated discussion on the prospect of her taking my name.

In the past when I mentioned my desire to not have a wedding, buy an expensive ring etc. her argument would boil down to ""tradition"" and ""feeling loved."" My unwillingness to compromise has damaged my past romantic relationships and am really trying with this one so I pushed all that down and agreed with a smile on my face.

Essentially, what happened was this. I (22M) went to the store with my sister (26F). 

While we're in the store, we see a guy in his 30s in a fancy suit with a boy who looks to be 12 years old. He's pushing around this kid, saying ''I'm going to beat you so hard'', etc.

I start smiling and my sister gets more scared, the dude fesses up and says ''Relax, its just a prank. There's a camera over there'' and my sister is relieved. 

Well when we left the store, I started laughing and my sister gets angry, she calls me an asshole for smiling about that. But I thought it was funny, moreover I asked her, what the hell is CPS going to do against a Mafiosa? Nothing. I just found the whole thing funny. AITA?",31,92,0.82
1520,Asshole,"For some background my girlfriend (Mattie) and I were crazy in love back in April. I mean it was everything I could have asked for in a relationship and she was who I wanted to be with forever. She broke up with me and I know it's been a few months but I'm not over it, I may never be over it.

She had baggage (like we all do) and had gotten out of a relationship with a fiance named Alan. Alan is a piece of shit. He's a liar, he's manipulative and he's just an asshole. Well during the month that We started to get super serious with her he started creeping around again and just caused all sorts of emotions to well up in her and she broke it off with me because she said she was so confused. I was deviated but tried to move on.

Last night I saw Alan at a club and it was just too irresistible to not say anything so I walked up to him abs said ""I know who you are mother fucker."" He said ""I don't know you, maybe you have the wrong person."" I said ""you're the piece of shit who got Mattie to break up with me."" Of course that got his attention and he said ""dude I really don't know you but I don't control Mattie."" I said ""mattie was my lady and she dumped me because of you."" He told me whatever man and walked away. I was just happy I got it off my chest. 

He came to me like 10 minutes later and he said he'd just talked with Mattie and lied to me and said she had told him I was a major creep, an asshole and my actions tonight proved it. I told him he was a gaslighting fuck and obviously lying because she would never say that about me, what we had was too special to be disrespected. Even after breaking up. He said Mattie told him to tell me to forget she ever existed and move the fuck on. I told him he was a fucking liar and if we needed to settle thus another way, I'm game. He and his friends walked away laughing so I went after them but a bouncer said I needed to calm down or leave. Since I was still waiting on my friends to show I decided to let it go even though he taunted me from across the club for an hour or so (which to me shows his character that he just couldn't  let it go).

My best friends FWB got there and I guess she knew he and his group of friends and she came back and said what I did was a major assholish thing. So that's why I'm here, was I the asshole?",196,52,0.75
1521,Everyone Sucks,"When I was 18 my parents wanted me to go to University and I didn’t really want to because of the expenses involved in doing so. They said they would take care of it all as long as I went, and I didn’t have a choice in this decision so I ended up going. 
During term time my university forbids us from getting a job so the only money I can make is usually during the holidays, that is if I can find a job. The rent for my university accommodation is due soon and “our” cat has gotten sick, I placed our in quotation marks because it’s really the neighbours cat but they don’t care about her. She’s 16 years old and has been blind for a year so her health is unlikely to get any better . My mum took her to the vets and she paid £500 for a consultation and for her to stay there overnight. The cat is back with us and her condition hasn’t changed. My mum is now blaming me that she has too pay so much for my rent and everytime I mention of doing something like going to visit my friends who I haven’t seen in a while she blasts me and say there’s not enough money to be doing stuff like that. I’ve gotten a part time job but it doesn’t pay enough to fulfill all of the rent payment. I told my mum that she made a mistake in taking the cat to the vet and that we could’ve taken care of her here at home and she’s angry at me for even suggesting such a thing.

1523,Not the A-hole,"First some info: 
I live with my roommate in a 2 bedroom apartment 
I work night shifts so I dont know who he brings home at night
He works a regular daytime job so we barely see each other or talk
He has (had) a longterm hs sweetheart gf that I know personally

Now for the main part:
Around 10am, so at a time I was sound asleep, I heard an insistent knocking, followed by my phone blowing up, followed again by knocking and so on. I go open the door and there's my roommate's gf, looking like she ran here. Im not very friendly when rudely awoken so i just barked ""what"". She apologised a 1000 times and asked if she can get a pendrive she gave her bf and that it is VERY urgent bc she forgot to copy something that was on it. I admit I was barely listening but she looked in a hurry and I just wanted to go back to sleep so I let her.

My friend is not a tidy person exactly so I wasnt surprised when she couldnt find it on the desk and just started going through his stuff. I just went to living room and sat on the couch until she finally left the room (i kinda fell asleep so idk how long she was there). She acted weird when she woke me to close the door. I asked if she has everything cause ""I am NOT leaving the bed again"" and she just said that she is not coming back for sure and i just let her out and locked the door and went back to sleep.

Later that day Im at work and my phone is blowing up and it's my roommate (weird bc he never calls me at work). I call him back when I have a sec thinking someone died or smth and he's screaming and shit.

Long story short (bc that was a really long and confusing convo) - he brought some girl home (as he aparrently sometimes does), did the deed and she left some evidence behind that he didnt bother throwing out because he never expected anyone to go through his shit, much less the gf. Well his gf broke up with him later the same day and he blames me for her finding out and ruining the relationship.

So like, AITA? I mean yeah maybe I shouldnt have let her in or should watch her do wtv she did but I was sleep deprived and I didnt know he even was hiding something, yk?",453,4265,0.95
1524,Not the A-hole,"So I live in area that has a high volume of cold callers/canvassers knocking on doors and junk mail being posted. I find this very rude and annoying and plus my dog starts barking like crazy every time this happens, so I bought a sign to put on my letterbox (right next to the door knocker) that clearly says 'NO COLD CALLERS OR JUNK MAIL'.....so I was relaxing at home last Saturday when I heard the letterbox bang (my dog started going crazy again), so I went to investigate and noticed it was a leaflet that said 'Avon will be posting a catalogue at this address next week', so I opened the door and saw a woman with a satchel full of said leaflets, so I said ""Why did you just post that? Can't you read?"" whilst pointing to the sign. So she said in a rather smug and smarmy tone ""I didn't see the sign, and they don't apply to Avon anyway, we can post wherever we want thanks"", so I said ""Clearly I don't want anything from Avon if I've gone to the trouble of putting this sign there"" so I then handed her the leaflet back and said ""Do not post anymore junk mail here in future as you have set my dog off"", so she snatched the leaflet and said ""Whatever"" as she sulked off.

So fast forward a week later to today, and I'm sat here relaxing again, and again there's a bang at the letter box, and again my dog starts barking like crazy. So I go to the door and unbelievably there's a damn Avon catalogue laying on the floor, so I opened the door and it's the same damn women again, so I said ""What the hell are you doing?? I told you last week about this!!"" And she said ""And I told you that Avon can post wherever we want, signs don't apply to us thank you very much"", so at this point I threw the catalogue into a bunch of mud next to her and said ""Take your crap and don't ever come back here again ok?"" so she said ""What's your problem? I'm just trying to make a living like everyone else.....and if that catalogue is damaged, you'll be paying for it!!"" before picking the catalogue up and storming off.

 I really have zero  issues with her working or not working. But I need to have a properly planned financial setup after wedding.

One day she tells me that she will continue working and I make plans accordingly such as budgets etc. Another day she tells me she want to be Stay At Home Wife(SAHW). This is happening for last couple of months almost everyday and I yelled at her for not taking a decision and holding on to it.

I want her to tell me if she would be working after wedding or going to be SAHW.

She replied back saying I am expecting her to work and not giving her freedom to do what she wants. I responded saying that she is not letting us plan our future by being indecisive. Also I told her that I will assume that she is going to be a SAHW and make my plans so I don't ruin anything by planning big.

1533,Asshole,"My brother (22M) is currently in his first relationship. He's a good guy but a little naive and inexperienced when it comes to girls/relationships.

My boyfriend and I recently met up with them for drinks and we were both caught off guard by how different she looked in person compared to the pictures on her Instagram. We were also surprised by the number of selfies she took. She had my brother take multiple pictures of her too, all from specific angles and the poses had to be just so (or the picture was taken again). It was pretty awkward but they seemed oblivious. She's definitely trying to portray a certain image online.

Before leaving I took a picture of them (with permission) and sent it to our mom. Her response was ""Who's that with Nathan?"" She was just as ~~I was~~ surprised as I was to find out it was his GF. We texted for a bit and came to the conclusion this was odd, my mom even said she felt bad that he got ""catfished."" I'm not sure I fully agree on that, she does look very different but he seems okay with it. I'm just not sure if that fits the definition of catfishing.

So considering my boyfriend, our mom, and myself all agreed she looked totally different I decided to ask my brother about it. I started off by confirming they met online (he said they did). Then I asked if he noticed she looks a lot different in her pictures than she does in person. He got nervous and asked what I meant, so I showed him the picture I took and asked him to pull up her IG. He immediately got pissed and said I was being a stuck up bitch and accused me of not wanting him to be happy. I told him that wasn't true and it was just something I noticed, I told him if she had showed up alone I wouldn't have known who she was. He stormed off and hasn't talked to me since.

I had planned to tell him it was okay to break up with her over something like that and he didn't owe her anything. I was trying to help, not make fun of the girl or ruin his relationship.

Was I being an asshole here?

**edit**: she used the same pics/poses/filters on Tinder (where they met). I paraphrased our conversation to try to keep my post short.

**edit**: We've spoken through text, I apologized and he accepted it. I was rude and out of line to bring it up to him, thanks to all of the sincere, well thought, replies that went beyond name calling for helping me see that. You helped me realize I was in fact being an asshole.",249,798,0.95

1538,Not the A-hole,"Burn/throwaway account. This was last year and I thought about it again since school is starting.

In my highschool, we have 'starting the year' field trips. The way it works is that you go to your homeroom class for 1 week to get to know your classmates and homeroom teacher for the year. During that week, the homeroom gets a budget and gets to plan where to take a field trip. We basically get to pick whatever. 

The teacher grabs a cup and tells us to write down, on a piece of paper, where we want to go. We all do this and she organizes which choice had the highest vote. The following choices were hiking in a mountain/ forest(forgot the place's name) with a BBQ, Pool, Baseball park or we could head to a chocolate factory (not a GIANT one, just one that was nearby). 
Chocolate factory wins by majority and most of the class is excited (although we had to put in some of our own money). Free chocolate. The teacher asks if anyone has any concerns like allgeries (the factory made peanut-butter chocolate too) or medical issues and want to object to the trip idea and if they feel uncomfortable, they could talk to her in private. (if anyone has an issue, the trip is canceled and a new choice is selected. Mandatory). No one objected.

On the day of the trip, everyone has their bags ready and everyone is excited. A girl I know, I wouldn't say friend since we talked maybe once or twice, goes to the teacher and tells her something. Then the teacher announces that we can no longer go on the trip. It was obvious what happened and everyone, including myself,  was mad at the girl. Teacher tells us to throw away any food with peanuts so some people were even more upset. The girl gets upset and says we shouldn't be mad at her for having what she can't control and although we ending up going to the hike/ BBQ, most people ignored her. Including me. During the trip, she asks me a question and I ignore her, she tries talking to me and I ignored her. She blew up and got angry that ""you're mad at something I can't controll!"". I angrily (but didn't scream/yell) told her that she had lots of time BEFORE the trip to tell the teacher and did a douchebag move by saying something ON THE DAY OF said trip.

He was going to get married small in a registry office when I offered to pay for a bigger venue in order that all the family and his and his fiancees friends could attend. The wedding is in 2 weeks, and hes decided he does not want to invite his brother (27M). He said about not inviting him at the time of me offering to pay and he decided he would as I assured him he would not make any off the cuff comments to my soon to be daughter in law and/or her family. My sons stag do was last night and it ended in my son who is getting married telling his brother 'where to go' and leaving. His brother does try to wind him up (has digs about his fiancee and her mother) but he does this for a reaction, I don't believe my son (26) is a nasty person but he does push boundaries of winding people up for his enjoyment.

I've told my son if he does not invite his brother, I will not be going either. Hes said so be it, as he cannot risk this day  being ruined. WIBTA if I no longer paid? Is he TA for not inviting his brother when the rest of the family will be there?

Edit: thank you for all your replies and I will certainly not  be suggesting not paying for it (to confirm I hadn't said this to my son, only that I will not be there if he doesn't invite his brother).

The weeks leading up to the trip, though, my daughter started acting like a nightmare. She argued with me about every rule in the book. She snuck out with boys, she came home drunk on multiple occasions. I warned her, if this kept up, she wouldn’t be visiting her mom. This wasn’t supposed to be a random punishment; my reasoning was that I need to trust that she won’t party and drink while with her mother, as her mother is not the best influence, and if she continued to party and drink at home, how could I trust her not to do so across the country? I don’t think she believed me, and she continued to go out, coming home after curfew, yelling at me when I said something about it. So, I put my foot down, and said since she could not behave at home, I couldn’t trust her to behave away from home, and that she would not be visiting her mom on the other side of the country.

I didn't know my girlfriend very well back when she lost her arm but from stories I've heard I know she took it like a champ and has never let it hold her back. >!Not that it could physically hold her back, since it's not there!< She and I make jokes about it all the time. For example sometimes when we're watching TV or something she'll randomly go, ""OH MY GOD! WHAT HAPPENED TO MY ARM?!"" or the classic ""No I'm not all right, I'm all left"" while waving her nub. I join in on the jokes and it's never a problem between the two of us. She and I were over at her mom's house last night because her garage door was stuck and she needed help fixing it. After I fix it I went back in the house and go up to give my gf a high five (on her right side of course) and her mother got pretty upset about it. ""How could you say something like that?"" was among the things she said to me. She just seemed really disappointed and sad about it. I sheepishly apologized and after going home and talking to my gf, she said that it wasn't the time for it. Even though we make jokes like this all the time, LITERALLY on a daily basis. She's asleep and I feel really bad about it now, but I'm not so sure that I'm a bad guy for this. AITA?






Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the feedback. I was feeling a bit like a bully and that maybe the jokes had been one sided all along but after talking with my gf about it again she explained that a friend of my mother's son had recently gotten a staph infection in his leg after undergoing a surgery at the same hospital where her arm was amputated. (My girlfriend lost her arm because of a staph infection in her wrist that spread.) Her mom was talking about it when I entered the house so yeah you can't have much worse timing than that....My gf was angry because this hospital has become notorious for it's terrible service and people getting staff infections left and right without much being done about it and her mother was also flustered a bit so I was only adding fuel to the fire. I haven't contacted her mom for an explanation and extended apology just yet, but I will just to make sure there's no lingering resentment about the whole thing.

There was one instance where he must’ve taken a photo because his phone flashed. Everyone sort of shrugged it off and ignored it but were definitely more cautious of him. Again last week he had his phone resting on his arm, so I made an excuse to leave the room which requires me to walk behind him. I looked at his phone on the way out and sure enough he was filming videos of the girls for his Snapchat. I casually asked what he was doing which made him quickly slam the phone face down. I mentioned this to our supervisor later on, she said she’d keep an eye on him.

Fast forward to today. The room where our training class is located, is on the second level. The stairs to get there are those metal stairs with gaps so you can see up through them. A few of the females were wearing skirts which is no big deal I guess, power to them. BUT I spotted the creepy guy from our class beneath the stairs with his phone out again, filming the girls from below. I snapped and raced down to grab his phone off him. Snapchat was open so I checked his stories to see up skirt shots of the women. I told him he’s a creep and smashed his phone onto the ground. I don’t know if it’s completely broken but the screen was shattered. Of course this little scuffle caught everyone’s attention so I explained what was happening. The supervisor kicked him out of the course and told him to leave. He kept demanding me to pay for a new phone or get his fixed which I’m obviously not going to do. 

I told this to one of my friends later on and they called me an idiot for getting involved. He reckons it probably ‘wasn’t what it looked like’ and I should’ve just informed the supervisor instead of taking things into my own hands. She didn’t take it seriously the first time though. AITA here?

Last week when I got home my roommate's (19F) little brother (10M), who I didn't even know existed until then, was playing it. I was really uncomfortable with the prospect of some kid's sticky hands all over my console but let it slide that time since my roommate didn't know. When I went to play it later I noticed that at some point he went on my BotW save file and used all of my good weapons until they broke.

I had a conversation with my roommate about this stating that I was very uncomfortable with this and for her to please let me know when she's babysitting again so I can temporarily remove my Switch from the room ahead of time. She said that I'm making a big deal out of it and he's just a kid and it makes him happy and I should be ""excited to bring joy into a child's life"". I disagreed and said that it wasn't going to happen again or I'm taking back the Switch and not putting it back. She rolled her eyes and said whatever and walked off, so I thought that was the end of it.

Today I left my room and saw the kid, again here without notice, playing on my Switch again! I walked over and took it out of the dock and then held out my hand and told him to give the joycons back or he'd be in very big trouble, which he did. Roommate walked into the room after hearing the commotion and asked what the hell I was doing. I told her I was making good on my word and now nobody can use the Switch.

There have been times, after we’ve fought, that he’s gone to showering immediately before we get intimate and when he’s done that, he smells absolutely fine-like soap even. That makes me think it’s an issue of hygiene. He also has an actual diagnosed memory loss issue (which is why he sometimes forgets if he’s showered or he wears dirty clothes) so I have a feeling it’s that disability that is making him unable to remember to keep up his hygiene down there also. 

I’ve asked him to go to a doctor to get checked and make sure there’s not a medical issue/STD that’s causing it. (I’ve been tested recently and don’t think an STD is likely but good to rule it out). He says that’s too embarrassing so he’s refusing to go. 

I’ve brought up circumcision before and he’s (understandably) said he’s afraid of it hurting and so we haven’t really discussed it in depth. 

I fully understand that circumcision is a major alteration of his body and ultimately he has 100% say over what he does with his body. His poor hygiene, however, is significantly affecting our sex life and just relationship in general. After 2.5 years of gentle reminding, pleading, cajoling, and even arguing, I’m sick of being repulsed by him sexually. I love him so much and want to spend my life with him but I don’t know how I can live with this forever. Would I be the asshole if I ask him to get circumcised?",492,801,0.89

1552,Asshole,"Background: My sister and I have never gotten along. I don't know why, I wish I did so I could fix it but so it goes. I had invited her to come country dancing with me every time I was home, but she never wanted to go.

My date for the wedding was my swing dance partner. We tore up the floor all night long. Any time a country song was on, we'd go dance whether the dance floor was empty or full. We were having a blast which was great because I really didn't want to be there since my sister put my ex of 7 years in the bridal party (the groom didn't really know him at all and turns out he doesn't really like the groom). My dance partner asked my sister if she wanted to dance at least three times, she declined, and danced quite a few times with the maid of honor who doesn't swing dance, but can sure follow a lead and killed it!

A few members of my family have told me that my dancing at the wedding was inappropriate and I should have toned it down. They have even gone so far as to tell me that I hired a professional dancer to be my date (he isn't... I met him Jr year of college when we started dancing weekly together at a bar)

So my question is, am I the asshole for dancing like I know how to dance or should I have dialed it back a but for the wedding?

Edit: Just so it's not hidden in the comments because it's been the center of why most think I'm the asshole, we were doing aerials, not every song, but they were there. 

I've seen some follow up with thank yous and such on the AITA posts, but since this is my first timing posting I'm not sure when to do that. Thanks everyone, you all are right, I didn't think that I had done anything wrong coming into this, but wanted to get the crowd opinion. It seems like popular vote is I made an ass of myself. I just wanted to say thanks for the perspective check. You all gave me some stuff to think about. I had never heard the etiquette rules about aerials either, so that's good to know now too. I always thought that was just a bar rule.",1963,15218,0.86

1556,Not the A-hole,"I work as a pet sitter for a local agency run by one person (let's say Ann) picking up jobs she doesn't have time to attend herself. We drop in on animals while their families are away, give them food, take them for walks, etc. I love this job and find it fun and rewarding. Today I was exposed to the first bad situation. Ann sent me information about a job, with specific instructions and a warning that mostly prepared me for what I would find.

The home is a smallish three or four bedroom house with a small basement room. There are ten cats and six dogs living there. There are also two caged rabbits, two guinea pigs, and a hamster. The main floor where the cats stay reeks of cat urine, and is scattered with litter, pet food, trash, and family belongings. The litterboxes are overflowing. One of the dogs stays on the main floor with the cats, but five large dogs are being kept in the basement - one room, maybe 12x10 feet. The basement smells so bad that I couldn't go down there for very long today - I bought a N95 respirator for when I go back tomorrow, so I can clean a bit and fill their water and food fully. 

I honestly think those animals' lives are at risk. Half the cats are sneezing or have facial discharge, two of the dogs breathe ragged, several animals are limping slightly. Nothing seems to imply an extremely severe illness or injury, but there could be a lot I'm missing. Nothing points to these animals being physically abused, but neglect to provide a sanitary, spacious environment is still neglect. As soon as I walked out today, I wanted to call the humane society and ask what to do.

What's holding me back is I have no context for the situation. Maybe all the animals normally roam free on the large property, only closed up now so they don't get attacked by wild animals while the family is away. Maybe a friend with several pets passed away suddenly and the pets had nowhere else to go, creating a cramped situation. Ann says she's spoken to the family about it before, and they've already rehomed several cats and are trying to rehome some of their dogs. I don't think there's enough space there for even half of the animals they have now, and if Ann's information is right, they previously had twice as many cats (that's twenty! twenty cats!!). With the info I have, the family seems like irresponsible and unsuitable caretakers.

I'm returning tomorrow to feed the pets and take photos of the situation. I want to give this family the benefit of the doubt, because I have no idea who they are, but these animals are in danger. I'm hoping to talk to Ann before I do anything, so I can get a bit more context. But would I be an asshole to report this to the humane society or ASPCA if she can't give me more information? I've never reported anything before, but this is bad.

[update] I spoke to Ann. When she first discovered the situation, she did take the information and evidence (photos & video) to the humane society, but they told her since there isn't a cap on animal ownership in the city or county, there was nothing she could do aside from bring the family in for advice. All the legal enforcement goes through the sheriff. Ann is working with me to research the laws further and see what we can do - there are sanitation requirements, and I'm looking into the details. We'll bring what we find to the sheriff's department.",16,43,0.94
1557,Not the A-hole,"I am currently in college, and every few weeks my friends and I go out for dinner or drinks or brunch. I would always  be handed the bill and my friends would pay me back through venmo. It never really bothered me until I slowly started to realize everyone had pre-decided I would be the one paying any time we all went out together. So, the next time we decided to get dinner, as it came time to pay the bill, I asked if someone else could pay it. I even suggested to make it more fair we could rotate through who is paying. 

They both refused. One of them came up with some lame excuse that he didn't want his parents tracking where he goes through his credit card purchases, the other one pretended she didn't hear.

At this point, I was really annoyed. I decided then and there that this was the last time I would pay for all of us and would not go out to eat with them anymore.

Later that night, I texted both of them that I wouldn't be joining them unless we actually start rotating through who pays the bill. Honestly, it's not even the fact that I have to pay the bill that I have a problem with, it's that they just refuse to pay and expect me to every time.

Both of them said I was making a big deal put of nothing and that I was being a bitch and ruining the friend group. I just think it's unfair, and although it's a small issue, it really does bother me. I am not stopping being friends with them, I just won't go out with them until things change. 

So, AITA for making such a big deal out of this situation and possibly ruining an otherwise good friend group?




EDIT #1: 
My friends do pay me back eventually through venmo. It's almost always never immediately though. I usually invoice them and then a couple days later remind them to pay the invoice.

They find paying separately more of a hassle and it's just more quick to all pay together.",41,34,0.95

1559,Asshole,"So this is a pretty straightforward story. My wife and I are out at dinner and we both order sandwiches. When they come out I realize that they had gotten my order wrong to the point where I wasn't going to eat what I was served. I don't like vegetables on my sandwiches so I asked for it without them, but this sandwich was covered in lettuce and other things. Normally I could just scrape them off but they were covered in sauce and between all the meat so it wasn't coming off. Anyway I asked that my sandwich be remade (obviously they have no problem with it) but then they told me it would be roughly 20 minutes before I could get another one. At this point my wife and I requested that her meal be remade as well because we wanted to eat together and hers would be cold by the time mine was ready again. The restaurant at first refused and I told them that since I had already paid for my meal (which is normal for this restaurant) that I insisted. I told them that I expected to be able to eat WITH my wife, not next to her and that if they wouldn't remake them both then I was going to get a refund for both meals and leave.

  I was not rude, but I was stern. Somebody was at fault for this mistake and it was not me. After this whole ordeal though the worker gave me some dirty looks and I thought that maybe I had been a little too inflexible and should have just dealt with it because that's how restaurants are sometimes. My wife thought I was overreacting a bit but ultimately didn't care one way or the other. 

TLDR I asked a restaurant to remake the incorrect dish and the correct dish so my wife and I could eat simultaneously and I got dirty looks for it.

Edit 1 - the restaurant is kind of like an upscale sandwich shop. A ""hip"" place in my area. All sandwiches are meant to be served hot for the aesthetic and taste. Mine was specifically their meat lovers style sandwich and my wife's was a specialty one with multiple meats, cheeses, sauces and vegetables.

Edit 2 - My wife said I was overreacting in reference to my attitude about how annoyed I was, not about actually asking it to be remade.",95,53,0.77

She said at least 5 times in our date that says basically black and doesnt consider herself Indian.

I'm all for culture and being proud but if you look like a particular race it's weird to keep pretending you're not.

When the topic of dancing came up, she said how most people can't move their hips like West Indian or black people.

She says, I've danced with many men, and black men dance the best. At this point, I remind her, you're not black you know, so you're insulting yourself by saying other races can't dance.

She got upset and said she wasn't speaking about women and she said it's culturally she's West Indian and it's not genetic it's just how they grow up there.

I told her she sounds borderline racist and why even go out with a guy who isn't black. She said she doesn't see race as a barrier and she can be attracted to men of other races, just not me apparently. That's when our date ended.

I'm trying to give both sides here, I would never have called her out of she didn't say she can't identify herself ever as being Indian. Excuse me miss, you look Indian. It's just a physical description of your ethnicity not your culture or nationality.

1563,Not the A-hole,"Ok the title makes it seem like there’s an obvious answer to the question but there’s really not. Here’s some back ground info.

A few years ago (not exactly sure, maybe 5 years ago?) my mum introduced my family to an old friend of hers. She was so nice to us. She stayed for family dinners, brought cake, went on trips to the beach every weekend, and even took my grandparents on a trip to Italy. We considered her family and it stayed like this for about 3 years. 

Then, almost two years ago now, my parents informed me and my sister that she and my dad were seperating. I was obviously upset about it, and then we found out the reason. My dad had been having an affair with my mums close friend for two years. My first reaction was to be extremely mad at her and I still am. I haven’t talked to her since. My dad moved into a new apartment and I learned to forgive him because after all he’s my dad. To me, he’s a better dad now then he ever was before.

Recently I went with my dad on vacation and he told me that he was done feeling sorry for himself. He told me that he was done feeling like he’d done something wrong and wanted to be normal. He said he no longer wanted to live in an apartment alone and eventually wanted to move in with this ex family friend because he loved her. He told me that I’d have to learn how to be in the same room with her and that if I had forgiven him, I had to forgive her as well. He was frustrated that his partner had to take all the blame and that we had to accept that it was his fault as well. 

I don’t think I’m ready to forgive her and I don’t know if I ever will be. She ruined my life for a good while. My mum had constant break downs and I was often the only one able to comfort her.  My dad simply won’t accept that I’ll forgive him and not her and makes me out to be one sided. 

Am I the asshole for forgiving my dad and not his partner?

EDIT: wow. So many conflicting answers. It was really interesting to read them all and see how you  all interpret the situation. One of the most common responses I’m seeing is that I shouldn’t forgive my father, which simply isn’t an option. I haven’t fully forgiven my dad and I don’t know I ever will but he will ALWAYS be a part of my life. He makes a huge effort to be there for me, my sister, and even my mum. He purposely bought his new apartment five minutes from our house so that he’s always available to help out if he needs to. As I said before, he’s a better dad now then he ever was before. Before he revealed his affair, he’d come home at 9pm, and be upset whenever we went to greet him as he was tired and didn’t want noisy kids jumping all over him. He would be gone by the time we woke up. He put his job before us. 

After he told us about the affair though, and he knew he was gonna lose his kids, he completely changed. He stops by the house to see us after work three times a week, has me and my sister over to sleepover at least once a week. Takes us out on vacations and drives to the country every weekend. He really loves us and although this situation is obviously not a great presentation of that, he really does. My mum even told me that she thinks he’s a better dad now and even though it had to come to this for him to change, he’s glad he has.",169,677,0.96
1564,Asshole,"Last weekend we had a small family get-together with maybe ten people eating over at my sister's place. She spent most of the day cooking with her daughter, making appetizers and a large enough dinner to feed everyone, and I didn't really see her until we were settling down to eat in her front yard barbecue-style. We had been eating finger foods all day and dinner was a seafood pasta dish in white sauce with assorted vegetables. I noticed she had a bandaid on one of her fingers and offered sympathy that she cut herself making food for all of us and didn't even get to hang out until now, and she brushed it off saying she had burned herself making dinner the night before for her family and the bandaid was just holding burn cream on the blister until it went down. That got my attention, and I asked if she had worn gloves when she was making food.

Her response? ""No, I washed my hands. This isn't a restaurant"". I immediately told her I wasn't eating food she had made with burn cream and an unsanitary bandaid on, which could have at any point come in contact with the food. She rolled her eyes and said I could do what I want, but she wasn't making me anything else-which is fair, the rule in our family has always been you eat what you're served or you make your own. So I did. Since then, though, many close family members have texted me saying I overreacted and it was rude to dismiss food she prepared for me after she had been cooking all day to the point of not having time to socialize. I explained it was unsanitary and I would rather be safe than sorry, and when I pointed out no one would have said anything if I refused a meal at a restaurant on the same grounds my mom replied that it wasn't a restaurant and it wasn't a stranger, it was a family event with my sister and I should apologize. I don't think I did anything wrong-I didn't demand she make me other food, I just didn't eat what I didn't want.

1569,Not the A-hole,"to put it in perspective, this happened like ten minutes ago. i’m a 13 year old and very paranoid but also very empathetic person. i’ve been very nervous about strangers lately because our car was robbed recently. 

so like two hours ago i went down to the local gas station and bought some snacks since i don’t like what my parents left my (12 year old for anybody who cares) brother and i (they went out with friends.) 

so now up to speed like 20/15 minutes ago i was sitting in my living room practicing my song for the school’s musical auditions so i wasn’t really aware of my surroundings (lol i try super hard and get into it.) when my two dogs start freaking out. 

they do this a lot because they’re both super protective and one is very big so everybody knows us as the people with the scary dogs. well anyways i thought this was normal because they always do that at cars passing by but i got kinda nervous like always. then my dogs started kinda throwing themselves at the door and growling and trying to get out so i was like “what’s happening.” 

well i peered out through the glass part of our door and some guy was there so i ran to tell my brother to take his headphones out and look out the window (which views onto the end of our porch where we can see the back of people who come overs heads and decide if we want to open the door.)

the guy wasn’t leaving and just kinda stood there and i knew he already saw me because we made awkward eye contact and he had like no expression so i kinda got nervous. 

i called my dad and asked if he invited a younger guy with dreads (trying to give description) over or something and he said no and that he’ll call the neighbor across the street to check out what’s going on. 

my neighbor came over and told him to leave and asked why he came over. the guy said i dropped a dollar at the store and he was going to give it back to me which i felt really bad that i overreacted if that was the case. 

then i realized i has been home for like two hours before he showed up so did he follow me home and then memorize my address?? i feel really bad and stupid and like i was being dramatic for panicking and like i was being kind of rude. also before anybody calls racist (as i mentioned he had dreads and some people have said that to me before) i’m half black so that’s not it. 

anyways i’d like to know your thoughts. sorry for any bad grammar or formatting i’m on mobile and just rushing through.

EDIT: i just looked outside and my parents cars are there (ig they took an uber or got picked up.) i don’t really think that changes that he literally showed up at my house two hours after i dropped a single dollar, but it might so i thought i’d add it in and also sorry for not mentioning before but i simply didn’t know and never bothered to check before typing this

EDIT 2: however if i opened the door, adults home or no adults home, if he was armed he could have still easily gotten in since all of my family’s guns (mom is a veteran) are locked away and we wouldn’t have time to access

EDIT 3: so i just checked the prices in my mind of what i got (i always get the same things so i did
the math in my head lol) and I NEVER DROPPED A DOLLAR!!!! i had the amount i needed the whole time never dropped one!

EDIT 4: thank you for all the responses! i am safe as my brothers friend and his older sister and i’m friends with picked us up. they were worried since they learned i never actually dropped any cash

FINAL EDIT: so today he either came back or i missed it before but there was a paper on my porch that my dad found. it was literally his snapchat. so we looked him up and learned that he is about to be seventeen and is a popular basketball player at his school. also he is my dads friends neighbor and knows my brother so that’s an oof. thank you all for the kind words and suggestions. still a bit creepy what he did but he’s young and it’s just a learning curve for him. i hope in the future he learns not to approach girls like that and i will not be contacting him on snapchat. please boys if you read this do not do this to a girl no matter what, because it was a super scary feeling for me. i’m still kind of scared but i feel safe with my dogs and dad also knowing he is just a kid (although a bit older than me) and probably didn’t think what he did was creepy. again thanks all for the support it meant a lot to me. bye :)",57,37,0.8

My husband and I had about 2 weeks to plan our wedding, we had originally planned to elope and then go to dinner with our parents at a nice restaurant. The friend in question let's call her S mentioned that she would like to be part of our special day so she wanted to join our dinner party, my husband and I discussed it and decided to have the courthouse wedding Friday and plan a small get together for about 20 people in my house instead of the dinner. We asked everyone we wanted to attend and told them we understood if they couldn't come due to the short notice. Everyone showed up except for S, she didn't show up or answer any messages that day. A few people traveled from out of town to come and be with us, except her who lived the closest to us. I wrote her off as a friend then and moved on. A few days later she called to apologize saying that her child had a really bad meltdown and that she didn't want to leave her dad with the problem hence why she was unreachable. I said I see and then cut the conversation as quickly as I could, since I didn't feel like that was a good enough reason.

1575,Everyone Sucks,"My youngest daughter was born with a hemangioma on the center of her forehead. For those that don’t know, it’s a bunch of blood vessels under the skin that bunch together and it forms a red-looking birthmark. It is technically a non-benign tumor. The doctor told us that it’s not hurting her in anyway, it’s purely a cosmetic thing. It would grow, then shrink as she got older. It was possible it would never go away completely and then we could discuss surgery to remove it if we so chose. They also added that there might be a mark or scarring in the future.

My daughter is now a year old and we do get lots of questions, which I don’t mind. Knowledge leads to less ignorance in the world. I did end up putting a PSA on my Facebook page saying “I get a lot of questions about \*Youngest Daughter’s\* forehead, she has a hemangioma”, explaining what it was and that we don’t want to make a huge deal of it, for our daughter’s case. I put a link to more information. I also said, no matter what, she’s beautiful and we love her just the same, even if it never goes away.

Now, my dad and I are not close, at all. We see each other maybe a few times a year. He divorced my mom when I was young and he’s just not a stable person in my life. That being said, I know he loves my girls and I never want to discourage him from seeing them.

On that post, however, he put “Yeah, she’s a cutie, but she’ll look even prettier when it goes away.”

I was livid. I get that maybe she’s not going to win any Gerber Baby contests and I wasn’t doing the post for validation, just a PSA. And then he had to say that. 

Now, he has also dealt with weight issues as of late and has been posting his latest diet/weight loss/exercise routine on Facebook. I don’t care what he weighs, that’s his life and his business. However, he attacked my daughter and like I said, I was feeling some sort of way because he’s been feeling self-conscious about himself and he says that about his granddaughter? 

I know I probably should’ve left it alone, but I replied “Yeah, well, I’m sure she’ll feel the same about grandpa when he loses those extra 50 pounds.”

He got mad and texted me saying I was being disrespectful. I said he insulted his granddaughter’s looks, so what did he expect from me? He deleted his original comment on my post, but then made his own about being attacked for his weight (not mentioning me by name or anything, just using general), to get support.

1578,Not the A-hole,"I look after a 9 year-old girl from time to time with severe birth defects to her legs and spine. She is forced to use a wheelchair every day... lets call her Lacy. I am a family friend, and not an official caregiver, but i've been taking her out for walks and ice cream on Saturdays while her siblings are at camp on the west coast and her parents work their business. 

She does great, and i rarely need to help her along the pathways or off the curbs when we are out and about. However, often we will walk through public parks and she is scared of dogs... but is completely fine if they are on a lead and the owners are present to restrain them.

On this Saturday we were lined up outside of a very popular ice cream shop. It was extremely busy and has an outdoor service window so people can order outside instead of going in. We were lined up with a bunch of people who had dogs and Lacy was fine. However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind us, the girl that ended up behind us had a very aggressive terrier. I am not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but I could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty. For some reason the dog was taking a special interest in the wheelchair, and not a pleasant one. He kept barking incessantly at Lacy and grabbed a hold of my jeans with his teeth when i stepped between him and Lacy as a barrier. He was gnawing away at the wheels and i would gently brush him off. Lacy was actively trying to move away from the dog, but as she moved up, the girl behind us moved up too, while still paying absolutely zero attention to the dogs behaviour and chatting to her friend.

Eventually I tried to get the girls attention, as she was deep in conversation and clearly used to tuning out the barking and growling. Instead of looking at me when i said ""excuse me..."", she just held up a finger, as if to say ""one second"", and then proceeded to keep on talking. It was such a rude gesture that my ears actually burned with fury. I pushed Lacy up a bit further and then the guys in front of us asked us ""is that dog bothering her?"" and just as i was about to answer the terrier jumped up and nipped at Lacys fingers and she screamed. Reflexively I swung around and grabbed the dog by its abdomen as it was just about to jump and pushed it away, probably a little more aggressively than i should have  (it fell over).... while nearly spluttering

“NO!!! SIT!!!”

The dog immediately sat. and whined... Nearly everyone in line stopped talking and watched.

The owner absolutely lost her shit with me, and told me I had no right to touch or handle her dog. Her friend absolutely lost it too and called me an animal abuser.

We managed to get our ice cream and unfortunately just threw mine out because Lacy was so shaken and I felt so sick.",41,72,0.88

1585,Not the A-hole,"Just bear with me. I’ve been seeing someone for over a year.  I’m in love. It’s cute. Cue the Pixar romantic music. They have a dog. A lovely, sweet, large dog. I am not normally a huge gigantic pet person (Love animals, I’m just picky about my actual pets), but I fell for the dog. 

But... here’s the thing. 

He’s loud at night. He walks around often. He drinks water like there’s a horse drinking from a trough 2 inches from my face. And the LICKING. He licks all the time. ALL the time. Himself. The floor. His bed. Anything that can be licked. It’s always annoying. But it’s unbearable when I’m trying to fall and stay asleep. 

I have misophonia and it’s mostly chewing, smacking, mouth sounds that make me want to pull out my hair. How bad is it, you ask? It’s so bad that I’d literally rather be deaf than listen to this big, beautiful dog lick himself at 3am again. I’m kidding (sorry to anyone who deals with deafness), but I’m not who you want to tell government secrets - it would only take a licking dog to break me. 

He’s never spent a single night outside of my SO’s bedroom. If my SO has to travel, dog gets a dog sitter to sleep in the room with the dog. 

I’ve used ear plugs. They hurt, but they work. I’ve gotten a pretty severe ear infection from the use of the ear plugs. I’ve seen a doctor and am being more careful with them. But they still hurt. I’ve offered to sleep on the couch. This bothers SO. I’ve tried talking with a therapist about treating the misophonia - it’s too expensive. I’ve talked with two dog experts - apparently the dog can be trained not to lick. When I try to redirect the dog, SO feels like I’m not being nice to the dog. I’ve asked to use a white noise machine. SO doesn’t like them.

I’m at a point of desperation. I have a theory about Van Gogh. Maybe he took that ear bc of a dog’s late night licking. Am I completely TA because I think the ridiculously simple solution is for the dog to sleep in another room? SO thinks this is a hard line, that only an A would put the dog out of his own room. 

Dog people of reddit, I’m no expert. Is my SO right? Am I being TA to this poor dog? I NEED your judgment.

EDIT: I sure appreciate that so many of you are on my ears’ and sanity’s side, truly. But this is nowhere near bad enough for me to give up on the relationship. Remember the Pixar love music? I’m not leaving my SO because of the licking. I might go crazy and have to be institutionalized, but I’m sure my SO will visit. Or I’ll use the headphones, diet/exercise changes, and allergy medicines and see if doggo and I can’t solve the problem.

I am 28F, married with 30M, for about 3 years now. We have had our relationship since past 4 years. We had a boy about 4 months ago, and he is the delight of our lives. Things are going good in our relationship except for the sex, as I have forbidden him until our child grows a bit more. He seems a bit irritated about it but the rest is fine. Yesterday we were having a normal discussion wherein he divulged to me that he got a paternity test on our child before signing the birth certificate. I was flabbergasted. It felt as if the roof came crashing on me. I never expected him to go to such a low level to test my faithfulness. I am having conflicting views, whether he actually did it, or he was just spiting me because of his irritation about not having sex. I am not unfaithful to him, and this child is his.

1597,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago and it turned into the first of many issues I have with my Step-mother.  I was already an adult in my own home and married with a child on the way when my dad married her and she moved in. I had two siblings still living in their home. My brother was 13 and sister 14.

 They wanted money for extra things so they were allowed to get jobs to pay for those extras. Being underage they did odd jobs as most kids that age. My siblings were very attached to me as I mostly raised them, and then when my son was born you couldn't keep them away!  So they often stayed the weekends with me. Just siblings hanging out. Occasionally I would need them to babysit so if they were there for that purpose they were paid.

 They got in trouble here and there for things and were grounded. If they were grounded they didn't get to come hang out and stay the night with me. I totally get that and agreed completely. They were staying to have fun. No fun for them they are grounded.  Now onto the main event. 

My husband and I had an important thing we could not cancel and scheduled ahead for my sister to babysit on a sat. My sister had got in trouble and was grounded. I get that 100%. But this was a babysitting job. Not fun. We knew she was grounded but didn't make other arrangements, because this was never something that occured to any of us. 

My step mother informed us that Friday night my sister couldn't babysit for us sat. Because she was In trouble and grounded. No one was consulted about it. Just told. So I went over to talk to them to figure out what was going on and why she couldn't still do her ""job"" and babysit for us. They had been grounded before for things but were never made to cancel their jobs. Infact my brother was grounded but was still allowed to do the lawn mowing job he had set up. But my sister couldn't babysit for us, even though that was her job.  The reasoning was because she goes to my house to have fun.  I addressed with her that I realize that and that's why they don't get to stay the night when they are grounded or come over to hangout or anything of that nature. It just happens that her job and her fun are the same place.  If she had a job lined up to watch someone else's kids would they ground her from that? It's a scheduled responsibility that would screw people over especially last minute. Like it was doing to us.  AITA for insisting that this was my sister's job and unfair to us that it be canceled in this manor? I can see clearly that this is a job but my step mother couldn't.

1598,Not the A-hole,"I work at a car dealership as the parts shipping and receiving manager. (Not sure why I get that title as I'm the only person) The dealership is split into 10 different buildings depending on what type of car is being sold. Volkswagen, Audi, Mazda, Volvo, Hyundai, you get it. I work specifically at VW. It is split into two buildings. One for sales and everything else a customer would see and one for the parts warehouse, repair shop, and the shipping bay. I'm one of the lucky few who gets to run paperwork between the two buildings. This guy I am having trouble with works in the main building. 

This whole bit of drama stems mainly from two incidents. 

¹ I was breaking down boxes and packing bubbles out by the dumpster when this guy comes booking it across the lot and gets well within my personal space with the creepiest grin I have ever seen. He starts using his hands to pop the packing bubbles while staring at me, not breaking eye contact. Keep in mind, I have a very sharp knife in my hand and was very close to stabbing him and making a run for it. My mind kept running through the worst possibilities. Being a girl and being isolated with a guy I had never seen before who was creeping me out didn't help either. Before I finished panicking/deciding what to do he ran back across the parking lot and dissapered into the main building. I stopped breaking down boxes outside after that.

² I was running paperwork to the main building. He comes out of the detailing bay and tried to block me from getting through the door. Intentionally standing in front of me to block my path. I was slightly more prepared this time and pushed him out of the way and went inside. He ran back to the detailing bay. 

Our other few interactions consist of him trying to approach me and me turning tail and speed walking away. 

Thing is I didn't even mean to report him in the first place. I was considering it but hadn't made up my mind yet. I made an off hand comment about him being creepy and everything exploded from there.

I had a meeting with HR discussing what to do about this situation. This is where I found out he is mentally disabled but they didn't say specifically what he has. All I want is him to stay away from me. 

The few people I've talked to about this issue think I am an asshole for ""discriminating against the mentally disabled"" as they put it. I disagree. That behavior is unacceptable for anyone. So, I ask the question, am I the asshole?

EDIT: instead of replying to every single comment let me address some common concerns

1. I do not want him fired. I hate workplace drama and I don't want to be involved.

2. Some people seem to think that... I just want to stab people? I don't. I was referring to that particular moment in time. I do carry a pocket knife as well as a box cutter when I'm at work. I work in a male-dominated work environment and don't want to take any chances. But I don't want to have to use it.

3. When he approached me by the dumpster I wasn't even sure he worked at the dealership. There is no standard uniform and he was in street clothes. Talking isn't really an option when your having a panic attack so that's why I didn't try and talk to him.",49,36,0.85

1601,Asshole,"TL;DR at the bottom.


**I will also likely post a question regarding my legal liability to /r/legaladvice** - but I have checked with my insurance agent, and he said it wasn't a concern from his side. Edit: We're in the U.S., and my agent is of the opinion that my neighbors insurance would cover any damage


Last year I bought my first home with my girlfriend (yay!). 


The property has several 75+ foot tall oak trees, and one of them looked to be in poor health (but still had new growth) when we made the purchase. When fall/winter came around, however, the tree did not drop any of it's leaves - a sign that it was dead/dying.


This year, the tree failed to put out any new growth at all, and it's rather apparent that it has completely died. The tree is one of, if not **the** largest on the property (it probably approaches 100 ft)


The tree does not endanger my property in any way (other than the clean-up cost if it were to fall in my yard)


However...the tree does have a lean to it...and that lean is in the direction of my neighbors garage/house. There are also large limbs that hang directly over the garage. The tree is near the property line, but is undoubtedly on my side of it (entirely, even the edge of the roots fail to visibly cross the property line).


For what it's worth, the house is far enough away that it doesn't appear to be in direct danger of being hit by the tree (if it does, it would be a glancing blow by the top branches) - but it would absolutely decimate their garage. (The garage is not attached to the house)


Due to the location of the tree, access is limited (Both due to my neighbors garage, and other large trees nearby). I've had two companies estimate the cost of removal, and both were over $4,000. This is simply not something we can afford at this time - it will probably be at least another year before we can afford the removal.


So WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to assist with the cost of removing the tree? I would probably phrase it as ""I am going to remove this tree eventually, but it's going to be a year or more before I can afford it...if you help with the cost, we can do it in a few months""


TL;DR: I have a dead tree on my property that doesn't endanger my house, but would destroy my neighbor's garage & potentially damage their home. I can't afford the $4,000+ cost of removal in the immediate future - WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to assist with the cost to have it removed sooner?",56,37,0.93

1603,Asshole,"So, me (35 M) and my wife (37 F) are making plans to go to dinner with some family friends.  Now, my wife is originally from Turkey and sometimes going out to dinner in her country/culture...run a bit looonnnggg.  However, its usually because people socialize during dinner, not because people eat slow!  

When I asked who is joining us, she names off three couples (changed their names to American for simplicity) .  Couple A (Jones), couple B (Davidson), and couple C (Mattis).  Now, couple A and B, I don’t have an issue with and get along great.  Couple C though...Kelly  Mattis...is the slowest eater I’ve ever met!!!

Back story: The first time we went out with the  Mattis couple at a chain restaurant known for its pasta, she was SLOWLY eating her salad.  She ate each thing... ONE AT A TIME!!!  When the main course was brought out, she wasn’t done with her salad.  Then when everyone else had finish eating the main course, she was not even 1/4 into her meal.  She is taking tiny little bites of her meal!  Meanwhile, she is engaging in the conversation at the table with smiles and laughter...but everyone else ate and finished at a normal pace.  Our plates were taken away and her’s remained with most of her food remaining untouched.  She even got offended when the check was brought out and a server asked “can I box it up for you?”  In which she replied “I’m still eating!”  Almost 30 minutes later of us just sitting there, she only ate half her meal and said “oh I’m full!” 

Even at dinner parties, Kelly still eats painfully slow!  Its painful to watch her take tiny little bites on kebabs, even though shes engaging in whatever conversation is going on at the table.  Even when the coffee and dessert is brought out, she literally nibbles at her cake or fruit!

So I told my wife NO to Mattis couple.  I explained why and she kinda agreed with me but explains: “its almost a cultural thing.  People take their time with family and friends at the dinner table in Turkey.”  However, I stood firm saying no because I don’t want the dinner to be dragged out longer than it has to be.  My wife is kinda upset because she really likes Kelly’s company and friendship.  I ask if Kelly has a medical condition or social condition where she has to eat slowly and take tiny bites.  Her response...not that I’m aware of.

So, I again say no to the Mattis couple.  This is the first time I down right do not want someone to join us for dinner!  I like Bob Mattis, but can’t stand his wife eating so fucking slowly!  

Am I the asshole for not inviting this couple because the wife is a painfully slow eater?

FYI...dinner was great and everyone ate a normal pace with no complaints!

Edit:  Okay, so I asked my wife again if Kelly has a medical condition that makes her eat slowly.  The answer is no.  So out of curiosity, I texted Bob and ask him the same thing.  Again, the answer is no.  Then I ask (politely) why does Kelly eat so slowly and how Kelly does eat at home?  According to Bob “I know how my wife eats food and I ALWAYS dread it when we dine out because shes incredibly slow eater.  You are NOT the first to point this out.  It could be just us or out as a group with friends, she eats very slowly because when she’s talking with others, she is focus on others and not on the meal.  I didn’t mind in Turkey because we would go out and have dinner for 2 or more hours, but here, it feels like we are rushed out whenever we go and I have to tell her to eat or she’ll just sit there and talk all night.  When we’re at home alone...we don’t talk at all when we eat!  I don’t even look at her!  It forces her to eat at a regular speed.”

Our eldest daughter is starting kindergarten in a few weeks. Our districted school is low rated and honesty not the best. We were looking into other options and there was a high rated magnet school in the area.

They typically have a specific focus, even though they teach the kids everything. For example, this one is science. We really wanted our daughter to go there. It runs on a lottery system, broken down by race. I was told by someone I know that works at the school that if we put her race as white, then she would be on the bottom of that lottery and her odds of getting selected would not be that high. However, applying as Hispanic/Latino(a) or other would nearly guarantee her a spot, because the school looks for diversity. Because our kids are Puerto Rican, even though they don’t look it, we put her there and she was selected.

Our kids don’t speak Spanish (my husband’s dad left the family when he was a kid so he never learned, we hope they can take classes one day), we don’t really celebrate the culture much because my husband never did, etc. She says we’re abusing a culture we’re not apart of stole a spot that we wouldn’t have otherwise. And since they didn’t see my daughter’s face, just her name, it was an unfair advantage.

Was I wrong to do this?",620,1158,0.93

1610,Everyone Sucks,"I met my girlfriend Stacey a year ago. We are both 21. When I met her I knew that she had a kid that she had when she was 16.

We have a strictly fun relationship and she knows I have no interest in meeting her son. Matter of fact I even said to her once we realized we wanted to see more of each other that if she wanted someone that could build a relationship with her child too, she should re-think about being with me because I’m not ready for that kinda commitment. She assured me it was just fun and she didn’t need anyone around her kid. 

She lives with her mom and her mom takes on a lot of childcare but Stacey is hella involved as a parent so whenever we spend time it’s usually after hours for some naughty time. 

Lately Stacey has been asking me to go on more and more ‘day dates’ with her and her son. Stuff like going to the playground just to chill out, farms, etc. I keep saying no. I don’t want to do it, I just want fun, and to keep telling Stacey I just want fun and not to do family related stuff. She accepts it but she’s not happy with me. 

AITA for refusing to meet her kid or spend time with him?",143,268,0.91
1611,Asshole,"An update to my post.

Firstly, I would like to say that I think quite a lot of people here misunderstood what I was trying to say. I explained in the comments that I never had any intention of actively preventing my husband from spending time with his child. I wouldn't do that. All I did was voice my opinion to him. I even told him that ultimately it's his choice what he does regarding this, I will still love him regardless. 

Several hours after I created my post I mentioned in the comments that you have convinced me to be OK with my husband spending time with his son. A lot of these comments weren't just answers but also solid advice on how to proceed with this. Thank you. 

A few hours ago I talked to my husband about this. I told him how the comments on my reddit post have changed my opinion on this matter. He of course is now overjoyed that I support him in his effort to establish a relationship with his son. We agreed that after he's forged a good, strong relationship with his child we will then introduce him to the rest of the family and work from there. A few comments on my post mentioned other women who have also done the same and how they are now happy, that made me hopeful that this situation could have positive effects on our family as well. In the meantime my husband and I will construct a plan on how he will be spending time with his child and how we will talk to the family once we're ready. Once again I would like to thank you for the helpful comments/advice I received. 

Original post below
...............…................................................................

I think I already know which way most people here are going to lean.

My husband(45) and I (44) have been married for 19 years. We have 5 children together. 7 years ago he had an affair with a woman he met at his workplace( she didn't work there however) and he got her pregnant. He told me the truth about all of this when the woman was about 6 months pregnant. He also got a paternity test to make sure the baby was his. When he told me this I felt betrayed and destroyed but after marriage counselling and the fact that I still love him, I decided to give him another chance. He's been absolutely amazing since then and has given me no reasons to suspect he's up to his former misbehavior. We are going to celebrate our 20 year anniversary in 2 weeks. 

After the woman gave birth to the baby she kept custody of him and my husband has been giving money to support the child. We have rarely heard from the woman since then until last week when she approached my husband at his workplace. My husband told me that the woman wants him to be in the child's life and be a father figure to him, take him to sports games, play with him, go to school related things etc. I told my husband he has no legal obligation to do that and I didn't want him to. If he did so then he would be spending less time with our children and it would make things in our family and extended family a lot more awkward. As of now nobody else in our family know about the affair and the illegitimate child except me, my husband and his sister. Also, he has never had a relationship with this child so why start now and add even more responsibility to himself. The incentives I provided him are ones that are beneficial to him and to our family. He told me that it would be best for the child if he was in his life and tried to be a father figure. I told him I see where he's coming from and it's very commendable(my husband is a very good person) but by doing this he is detracting from the love and attention he will show the family he knows and has been with for a long time. This may also make things awkward between him and our children. Additionally, someone in our family or someone we know might see him hanging out with the child and that might lead to the revelation of his affair and damage his relationship with my family members and maybe even with his own family. I told him ultimately its his choice but I am firmly against it. AITA?",1561,4089,0.93
1612,Asshole,"My main group of friends is 4 other women I met at university 10 years ago.

We all met basically on the first week of the first year and have stayed tight with each other done then alive 10 years ago.  I used to think they were all bad ass and looked to them for advice for a lot of stuff including relationships.  I started seeing my now ex-husband 6 years ago, we got married 2 years ago got separated 1 year ago and now divorce is final.

A lot of the problems we had was me acting on, what in hind sight seems like, bad advice given to me by my friends.  Examples:

* Just after our engagement they convinced me that I shouldn't change my last name or hyphenate because it was old fashioned and oppressive, even though Mark told me early on that it was an important thing to him

* They planted doubts in my mind about how what originally I thought were innocent comments by his mom were jabs she was taking at me and pushed me to force Mark to stand up for me to his mom

* convinced me that I need to ration sex because some stupid reason that I bought into then that doesn't make sense now.

* Convinced me that when we have kids they should take my last name because I would be giving birth and again we shouldn't support old fashioned traditions.

With the last fight Mark had enough and said he wanted out and initiated the break up.  I was devastated, I foolishly thought he'd never leave me because again my friends convinced me that I was way out of his league and that he would never leave me.  

I decided I can't be friends with these women any more because not only did they give me really bad advice but when each of them for married none of them followed any of the advice that had been SO important when they told me.  They each took they husband last names.  They all bend over backwards to get along with their in-laws. No rationing of sex. No more kids need to get mother's last name talk.

This just pissed me off and I confronted them,I told them they were just using my marriage as a playground to test their stupid relationship theories and that they only started really thinking things through when it came to their own relationships.  I told them I couldn't be friends with them any more.

  They are saying I'm being unreasonable and that they told me what they thought was best at the time and that no one held a gun to my head.  They said now that they've been in the position things are different and that they're saying it's a lot more important to go along to get along.  

That's true, I'm probably going to be regretting for the rest of my life not using enough of my own judgement in my own life decisions.  But the thought that I had a good guy that I pushed away because of their advice is just too much for me.  WIBTA for cutting them loose?",413,2559,0.89
1613,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: I have made a conclusion on this. Thank you everyone for responding. I will no longer be reading nor replying to comments as I am completely happy with the conclusion I have come to after reading comments from all sorts of differing opinions. Again thank you - goodnight :) 

I've never posted here before, also on mobile. This isnt anything big or major but from this persons reaction I'm just wondering if I was somehow out of line??

So basically over the last few months, me, my fiance and my parents have been busting our asses working on mine and my fiances new home. I'm pregnant and we wanted a fresh start to bring up our little one in. 

So anyway, we have repainted the whole house, changed the whole kitchen, and bought brand new furniture. I was super excited for when I can finally have someone visit because I'm proud of the hard work it's taken. It will be finished in roughly 2 or so weeks, so I offered the first friend a chance to come spend the night, and even let a close friend of hers tag along.

They're very big smokers. Cigarettes nothing else. Me being pregnant, the smell when someones smoked recently is enough to set me off and feel sick, which comes as part of the reasoning for this rule. But the bigger part is all the new fresh paint, new furniture and just the effort it took to upkeep it. And the rule is no smoking at all while visiting. Smoke sticks to skin, clothes, hair etc and all of that gets transferred into a house. So with everything being so fresh and new, and how much work it took, it's especially important to me and my partner to upkeep the quality, especially because my parents have helped pay for most of it. Not to mention my pregnancy and feeling sick if someones smoked is something I wanna avoid the discomfort of when I'm in my own home.

My friend jokingly said ""me and (her friend) will try not to"" and I let her know it's not a matter of trying, it's that they really cant and that's just the rule. And I tried to explain why. And her bitter response was ""well I just wont come round your house then and you wont come round mine"" (she lives with her parents so it's also not her home). And I responded with ""lmao K"" because I couldn't understand that not smoking for one day was really so bad she cant even see her friend, and we have been friends for over 5 years. And also; I used to be a smoker, a heavy one, and it's not hard to not smoke around someone for just a day, or even 2 days. It made it feel like I'm less important than her smoking habit? I just feel like no one needs even a reason for a rule like that, it should just be respected, because no one should have to deal with another persons bad habit. 

But her response is making me wonder if I somehow said or done something wrong? I'm just interested to hear someone else's perspective on it and wether or not I was the asshole in this scenario.",137,106,0.88
1614,Not the A-hole,"I am turning 30 on August 24.  On August 20, I will be transferring an embryo for IVF (without getting detailed there is a 0% chance of us having kids w/o IVF.)  On August 21, my husband has a surprise planned for me.  Then on August 24, I'm having a small daytime get together.  My doctor says I have to ""act pregnant"" during this time- zero alcohol or caffeine, limit stress. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm an asshole for doing IVF, that's not something I want to debate today.

A lot of our close friends are long distance (male, ages 34-37).  When they found out I was throwing a party for my 30th, they offered to fly out.  They're more my husband's friends than mine, but I still consider them my friends. I didn't ask them to come out but I am happy they're coming out.  My party is a small day party, there will be alcohol there but I can't drink any of it.  We are also all going to brunch together earlier that day, where there will be alcohol for them.

Today my husband warned me ""My friends are excited to come out for your birthday but they're not going to want to be homebodies.""  I wasn't asking them to, but now my husband is saying everyone is going to want to go out late at night on both friday and saturday night after my party, and that I shouldn't be a ""downer"" about it.  I'm not opposed to joining them on a night out, BUT, because I can't drink caffeine or alcohol, I can't imagine I'll be a lot of fun at 2 AM so I asked if we could put some kind of limit on it, or just not go out past midnight.  He thought this was unreasonable because ""They flew out for your birthday and now you're telling them what to do.""  I also suggested they go out as late as they want, but my husband and I go home a little earlier (ie: 11 PM or so) when I start ""fading"" and he said ""So you're telling me I can't go out with my friends now?""

I could just not go and let them all go out without me, but it seems super depressing to be alone on my birthday while my husband and his friends all party without me (something he suggested as an alternative.)  My doctor asked me to avoid anything stressful, and I anticipate that being a more stressful experience than just going out with them because I also have anxiety.  So I said yes, I would come (doc says it's OK) but I was a little bummed that my husband and his friends were dictating the activity when it was for my birthday weekend.

My husband's argument is that he's already doing something special with me earlier that week (I don't know what it is yet) and I'm having my party earlier that Saturday, so this is just an added thing and my birthday shouldn't dictate it.  My argument is, I'm fine joining them on a night out but there's a high chance I won't enjoy it very much because I'll be tired AF so I'd like them to be understanding if I'd rather it not extend to 2 AM and to basically not have it turn into a sloppy college party.",51,86,0.9

1617,Not the A-hole,"My husband’s family had a reunion this weekend. Part of that, was renting out a room of this restaurant on Saturday afternoon. It had a really long oak table where we were all seated. My daughter (10) kept tipping her chair backwards and forwards throughout the meal. I told her several times to not do that, because she was going to get hurt. She would stop for a bit, then do it when I wasn’t looking or I would hear her trying to impress a cousin or something. Finally, I just figured, natural consequences are going to happen. I had warned her enough times and she’s not a toddler.

Sure enough, she ended up bashing her chin on the table. She wasn’t hurt badly and she didn’t require stitches or anything, but she was bleeding a bit, it’s left a mark that’s shown for a few days. When it happened, she looked at me wide eyed. I got up, said “I’ll get you something to clean it up, but this is what happens when you don’t listen.”, before walking away to ask the waiter for some wipes and a band aid (all it really needed upon inspection).

Now, I’m going to say that my BIL (husband’s brother) and SIL (that brother’s wife) are very close with my kids, they love ‘em to death. They’re childless by choice but they’re their godparents and if anything were to happen, they’ve said that they’d take them. So, I know they just love the kids. However, my SIL got mad at my reaction. She said I completely undermined my daughter’s “feelings” and that I should’ve shown her more care. For context, when I came back to the table, she had been fussing over my daughter and my daughter was crying about how much it hurt, something she hadn’t been doing when I walked away. In my opinion, she only did that because SIL made a big deal of it and I told my SIL so. She was fine and even when I talked to my daughter later, she said that she was fine, she was just overwhelmed. If my daughter had been crying when it happened, I wouldn’t have been as harsh as I was in the moment, but we would’ve had the talk later. My SIL still thinks I was an ass.

Am I an ass here?",216,954,0.95
1618,No A-holes here,"Alt account because people involved know my main blah blah blah you've read it before. This is a pretty cut and dry situation as far as I'm concerned, but others don't seem to think so, so I'm coming for the opinion of strangers to settle this whole conundrum.

My [23M] girlfriend's [25F] sister [32F] is getting married. Now, I don't believe that she and her fella are ""childfree"" in that they actively dislike children or anything, but I do know that they have no plans to have any children themselves and have elected to have no children under 15 attend their wedding. That's fine, it's their wedding, they can choose to invite who they wish. The only slight issue is that my girlfriend has a 4 year old daughter from a previous relationship, who is obviously not invited. 

This in itself wasn't even an issue until very recently. GF and I often struggle to find babysitters for various reasons (most of them monetary tbh). Generally we rely on three different people: her mother, a family friend of hers or the teenage girl who lives next door. We've known for a while that neither her mum or the neighbour were viable options for babysitying on the wedding day as obviously her mum will be attending and next door neighbour is going to be on vacation. The wedding is now two weeks away, and the family friend has just informed us that she won't be able to sit either, as she's going for hip surgery two days prior and will not be mobile enough to look after a young kid. 

We spent some time contemplating what we were gonna do, and eventually settled on her attending the wedding and me staying home with kiddo. This isn't a big deal as far as I'm concerned; I love the kid and love spending time with her, GFs sister has made it plain as day she doesn't care for me anyway, and we save money by not having to pay a sitter for a full day and overnight and bc she's now splitting a hotel room with her mum rather than us paying for one (wedding is in a different city). Everybody wins, right?

Apparently not. The sister and her man are super angry at me because they think I'm ""disrespecting"" them and ""bailing on short notice"". They've even accused me of disrespecting my gf by ""making"" her go alone (it was her idea). Important to note I'm not part of the wedding party, I'd just be attending as a guest if I went. My view is that the kid is more important than a wedding, but apparently our ""refusing"" to find another sitter is hideously selfish on my part. Is it really a dick move to stay home with the kid?",109,127,0.86

1621,Not the A-hole,"Last week was our 25th high school reunion.  I still live in the general area of the school, am social media friends with a ton of my old classmates and friends, and like to be social so I planned with a bunch of old classmates to go and have a good time.  We were a very tight knit group that spent an exhausting amount of time with each other getting in to trouble.  It was at a upper scale bar in our downtown and was very well put together.  Tickets weren't cheap but they weren't expensive either ($50) and that did not cover alcohol, only finger food/appetizers and non-alcoholic beverages.  

We are getting to an age where we are not young and invincible anymore, and recently one of friends that was in our core group died of a heart attack, lets call him T.  There was a small table at the reunion dedicated to our deceased classmates (there were 5 honored, total).  Our friend T had a picture on the table and our group each took turns going over, some cried, some didn't.  I thought it was very tasteful.

The night continues, everyone is getting sauced, we are having a good time and remisiniscing about times past.  At one point in the night, someone started buying rounds of drinks for the table and it just continued, next person buying then so on.  After 3 rounds, I volunteered to buy the next round.  There were 10 of us give or take, so the tab each round was came in right below $200 with tip.  I start taking orders and a friend, let's call her A, suggests we buy T a his favorite drink as a memorial.    There was no real response from the group at large, some kind of nodded, but it wasn't seemingly a big deal.

I probably looked like a deer in headlights, but I took the orders and then went to the bar.  I was fighting back and forth in my head whether to relent and buy the drink, or refuse and save the $15.  I will save what i feel are unecessary details regarding my financial situation and my relationship with the deceased as I feel this would make the post more a validation that an AITA, but I decided not to buy the drink.

Getting back to the table, A soon figured out I did not buy the drink.  She got visibly upset and crying, took a trip to the bathroom with her girlfriend.  I got some glares from other friends, but overrall none of my other friends seemed to think it was a big deal, but A crying seemed to escalate the situation and I apologized to A and politely explained that buying a $15 drink that no one is going to drink is not how I wanted to memorialize T.  The night went on but A would not come near me or talk to me.  Otherwise the night was a blast, we caught up on old times and shared real honest to god developed film photos with each the group all promising that we need to see each other more often.

Went home, talked to the wife, and she was kind of up in the air too, but told me I probably should have just bought the drink.

So.....AITA?",83,257,0.95
1622,Not the A-hole,"This probably sounds obvious, but there is more to it. Our sister passed 3.5 yrs ago, and my sister is just now coming back into my life since she has “straightened” herself out.  

My younger sister Marty took a different path in life. She got expelled from school for vandalism, dropped out of high school multiple times. She got into heavy drugs and drinking. She ran away from home because my mother said it was drugs or family. After the first time she ran away, we allowed her to move back in when she saw the error in her ways. That lasted about 3 weeks and she ran away again the day before Thanksgiving. This always rubbed me wrong because thanksgiving is the most family centered holiday my family does. 

I was in college when she finally came back home a third time. She had, again, reportedly changed and my mom was really trying to support her getting her life straight not that she was 19. She enrolled in online high school and got a job. She still smoked like a chimney but promised she had stopped popping pills and smoking pot. She stopped talking to her bad friends. She seemed like she was trying. 

In Feb 2016, my sister Angie passed away unexpectedly at 15. She had a chronic health condition but was stable and improving. My parents were out of town and had to drive 5 hrs back knowing that their daughter had died. I was 8 hrs away at school and came home the next night. My sister Lisa had been watching my younger siblings and felt responsible because she hadn’t checked on my sister until it was too late. Once my parents got there, they called an ambulance and the police. 

Marty came into the house (having walked past the ambulance in the driveway and police cars in the street) high as a kite and drunk. She proceeded to throw up on the police chiefs shoes in the hallway and walk to the living room. When she was told my sister had died, she laughed and told them to quit pulling her leg. She thought it was a joke and we were pulling a prank on her. It was clear everyone in the room was distraught and upset, so I don’t know how she thought they were faking it. The entire family (including our older brother in the military) came together to mourn, except Marty because she wanted “to be with her friends to grieve”. 

Since then, Marty has had 2 kids a year apart with different dads. She did drugs while she was pregnant and couch surfed at friends. She has moved back in with my parents while pregnant the second time. She has finished her high school diploma in July and will be attending community college this month. My mom and some friends insist that I give her another shot, she is a different person without the drugs and it was years ago. They think I should forgive her because she wasn’t in a right mind. 

AITA if at family gatherings/holidays I ignore her/don’t engage her because I am still so upset that she thought we would lie about my sister dying?",274,858,0.89
1623,Not the A-hole,Im a magician and in the weirdest possible request I’ve ever had I was requested to perform at a funeral but I wasn’t aware of what I was attending. They paid me via credit card beforehand and told me to show up and perform at a park. I go to the park and a man greets me and tells me the event has moved. I was suspicious that something was weird because of how they never told me what type of event it was like wedding birthday etc. he leads me to the cemetery and I see people in black and he tells me I’m to perform there. I felt this was very unsettling and I politely told him I’m very uncomfortable doing this and I want to leave. I thought it was very disrespectful to the dead both buried and the other funeral services going on. The people there start to get very angry at me and are cursing me out and as I feel threatened I leave. I get angry voicemails and emails from them. I tried to refund the money but there was some sort of issue with the senders card and it won’t let me return the money to him. After all the angry voicemails calling me a asshole for refusing to perform I don’t feel like getting in contact as I’m uncomfortable with them.

I’ve been vegetarian my whole life and went full vegan about a year ago. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now. During this four years he’s lived with his mom and family and later his sister and her family, I’ve lived alone just me and my daughter. We’ve started to get more serious in the last 6 months or so, with him staying over almost every night and we’re talking about upgrading my studio to a two bedroom so he can officially move in and we’ll have enough room. 

When we go out to eat, he gets whatever he wants to eat of course and I don’t make any sort of judgment on his food choices. We had leftovers once and I asked him not to store them in my fridge and take them home, since I like to keep my home meat free. He understood and did so without hesitation. Early this year we had a trip to Miami planned and this was when we really started taking about him moving in with me. He said that he wanted to start eating healthier and when we came back from Miami he would adopt a vegan diet so I could cook for all of us. I was glad to hear this, but when we came back from our trip he didn’t change his diet at all and started staying over at my house more so at least that part was still on.

Earlier this week he went grocery shopping for us and brought home some frozen shrimp and chicken breasts to cook for himself. I know he’s been staying at my house a lot lately but I thought this was disrespectful towards me and my home in that ended up causing a huge fight between us since he thinks I’m forcing my lifestyle into him. I really did hope he was going to stick to what he had said about going vegan, but I haven’t been giving him any flack about his diet. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for him not to bring meat into the house to cook on the same stuff I use for my food, and the smell of meat cooking (depending on what it is) makes my stomach turn.

I feel bad because I knew him well, always spoken to me even after our break up.

My anxiety is bothering me and I know it's because I care what people would think of me if I don't go. 

Would I be an asshole if I go and go against my gfs will? Or do I just don't go, I messeged his wife expressing my condolences. She accepted and said thank you.

I went it was great and sad at the same time I got the closure I wanted. I spoke to my ex but she wasn't to happy which I wouldn't expect, I just expressed my condolences to her and her mom. 

I was fine until I saw his wife in which I started to cry when I hugged her I now know first hand what's it like to lose a partner😭😭

After catfishing David he said some very mean stuff about Hallie, which led to screenshotting the texts and sending them to Hallie, who became angry at me for sexting his boyfriend even though they were fake photos.

1628,Not the A-hole,"Ex husband was abusive during our marriage and suffers from a winning combination of mental illness and addiction. He’s currently homeless, has spent time in jail for holding one of his paramours and her child hostage, and last I had heard was off the wagon & indulging his addictions again.  
The courts granted me sole custody and visitation is at my discretion. He in the past has told me he wished death on myself and the kids.  
It seems pretty straightforward to me that my job as their mom is to protect them from bad people, including this person who their father has become. But they miss him (we left when they were 2&3, they’re 6 now). He’s recently started asking to be involved in their life for the first time. My friends all understand why I haven’t immediately jumped on the chance to re-establish a relationship between them but my family is somewhat of the mindset that knowing their dad isn’t the worst thing that could happen. Side note: my dad grew up without a father and seems to think that a shitty dad is better than no dad. Any visitation would be supervised by an armed court appointed officer.  
I’ve been told that the fact I even entertain the idea of a visit means I’m being overly dramatic about the past, but I live with family right now and the pressure is *intense*, and hearing from the kiddos that they miss their daddy makes the momguilt kick in something fierce.  
  
  
TLDR. AITA for not wanting to expose my kids to a mentally unstable addict who has a criminal history of kidnapping and abandoned his kids (who he wished were dead along with myself) for multiple years while in and out of jails and homeless shelters? I feel like I’m taking crazy pills when my family tells me to do it, and the fact he and the kids both want to see each other is contributing to my feeling like TA.",34,35,0.81
1629,Not the A-hole,"I hate conflict. I think shouting matches, gaslighting, and ultimatums are crap ways of communicating, and shouldn't be used by adults, much less on family members.

I(M28) am the eldest son, for context.

A while back, my dad threatened to disown me due to my dating of a girl that wasn't the type of Asian we were. He said that his trust in me was in question and that family assets held in my brother and I's name should change to reflect that. He went so far as to say that had I continued to date my gf, he'd cutoff all contact and forbid even my siblings from contacting me. At the time, to prove he didn't have to worry, I did as he asked and signed power of attorney over to him. But I still continued to date my gf, because Asian traditions and bullshit idioms sounded like ways to justify control and discrimination.

Its nothing to do with my gf. She wasn't as well off as we were, but she was smart, funny, and charming and had a promising career as a nurse. But rather my parent's experience with my older sister who had a history of questionable boyfriends and frequent arguments about said boyfriends.

My gf was adamant that she'd win them over, given a chance, but my parents didn't even bother meeting her. When I suggested a dinner, they refused, saying that she'd never get their blessing (They had however tried this with my sister's bf and it went terribly). And they made repeated efforts to deny that I was dating to relatives and sprung surprise ""arranged dates"" during what I thought would be normal dinner outings with friends and relatives on my off days.

My gf and I ended breaking up anyway, as long distance during my military service turned out to be too much strain on the relationship, on top of all this. And I can't say I blame her. 

Shortly after my service ended, I told my dad I accepted his terms and would be leaving the family. I've living off my savings and income, and I'm moving out next week. After next year, where I'll be heading to the UK to pursue a Master's program, I've also decided I won't come back.

I was very close with him before but I think seeing the change in our relationship, he has started to regret his words. He has tried reaching out, giving gifts, trying to get me to share beers with him, etc but I haven't been responsive. I think the loss of trust he communicated to me spent too long pinging around my head during my service and I haven't been able to forget it.

I admit I am stubborn as hell, but I don't like the thought that if I do come back into the fold, he’d pull this shit again. Maybe not on the same issue but possibly on something else.

It was father's day where I'm from, so I've been doing some self reflecting. I've also been watching The Crown rather masochistically.

So reddit, AITA and a shit son for not reconciling with my parents?

1630,Asshole,"Just want to apologise in advance for any bad grammar, English isn’t my first language. 

A few days ago I was on a long flight, from Paris to Tokyo. It was a 13-hour flight, and my mum had booked seats for us in the premium economy section of the plane. If you don’t know what that is, essentially premium economy is one step up from economy but one step down from business, people in that section are usually afforded the same perks as business class (e.g good food and priority boarding) but just have seats similar to those in economy. 

So onto the actual incident. It was hour 7 of the 13-hour flight and it was pretty much 3AM in Paris time. The way the bathrooms are laid out in the plane is there’s one in the first class cabin, then one in the business cabin, premium economy is directly behind business, and then it’s the larger section of the plane (economy class) with two bathrooms at the absolute back of the plane. So essentially if I were to go to the bathroom in the economy section I would have to traverse through the massive economy section in darkness. 

I decided I didn’t really want to walk through all of the economy section to go to the bathroom, so I just went to the one in business section (which was like two meters away from my seat). I went, and when I got out, there was a lady standing there, looking super huffy about having to wait for the bathroom. There are curtains separating the business section from the premium economy section, which are directly next to the bathrooms, so I was basically halfway out of the bathroom and pushing the curtains away when she kind of pushed me away from the bathroom and said: “Business class people only!” 

And I didn’t really hear her, so I turned back and I was like “sorry, what?”. And she was like “This bathroom is *business only*”, with a disgusted look on her face. I was so angry, I pushed back into the bathroom and I said “sorry, got to take a huge economy-class dump. My bad”. 

I stayed in the bathroom doing absolutely nothing for another five minutes. I fiddled with the toilet paper, I washed my hands ten times, I washed my face, etc, I took my sweet time examining a pimple on my chin. And then I finally came out, and the lady was MAD. 

I got back to my seat and told my mum what happened, and she told me I was being rude. She said that the lady was right, the bathroom was just for business class. 

But in my defence, first of all it was like 3AM and I didn’t expect somebody to be waiting, secondly I didn’t even take that long and the lady was being pissy and rude, and thirdly whatever. However now I wonder if I was overreacting. The lady was right, that toilet was meant for business class, and it wouldn’t have killed me to just be like “yeah, you’re right” and gone back to my seat.

1631,Asshole,"My wife (22F) and I (24M) have been in a long distance relationship for about two years now, we’ve known each other for three. We’ve been married for about three months now. 

A few days after our vacation together, she went home and texted me asking me if I mind if she has lunch with a friend. Of course I say yes, because I don’t mind that she goes out with friends and I trust her. Not trying to pry or learn alternative motives I ask her which friend (I don’t know all of her friends). She just tells me it’s an old friend of hers from her university that wants to catch up. I’d be a liar if I didn’t say I thought it was a little weird that I didn’t know about this old/great friend of hers. Before I even said anything she said not to worry and that he was like a brother to her and that he’s just an old friend. I asked why I didn’t know this friend and she said that I did. She then tells me about how it’s the guy we had problems with the year before.

I would also like to add that on two occasions he has commented “😍😍” and “😏😏” on two separate Instagram post. Which bothers me, but it’s whatever honestly. 

Some backstory on this guy: 
This guy had invited her to a party where she was the only girl. This made me nervous, because I don’t know these men and there was alcohol. I trust my wife, but I don’t trust a group of men I don’t know. This also upset her as she didn’t know she was the only female invited. She soon left after about 30 minutes. 

Needless to say this guy already rubbed me wrong, but I was just a boyfriend at the time so I don’t mind at all. But she respected me enough to leave without me suggesting she leave, because I thought they put her in an uncomfortable position. 

Back to the lunch date they had scheduled without me knowing. After telling me who the guy was she told me she had no intention of telling me who he was, because she knew I wouldn’t want her spending the evening with him. She was right, it made me very uncomfortable that I haven’t heard anything about him and suddenly they’re hanging out in a couple hours. I was also insecure, because she had just left me a couple days before and it felt like she wasn’t thinking about my feeling when she planned that. She started begging to see him after I asked small questions about who he was. 

They ended up having lunch for two hours after I spent about two hours telling her how uncomfortable I was with it. I called her and said I felt disrespected and like she didn’t care about how I felt in this situation. To me even if he is totally fine, he made a bad impression and I’m her husband. The main problem is that I feel like my feeling should have been taken more into consideration on this matter. She believes this is unreasonable of me and still thinks it’s wrong that I’m bothered by the situation. 

So, AITA for asking my wife to go home instead of having lunch with another man?

1633,,"Situation:

I come home from work, found that I had sometime before prepping dinner, decide to clean the bathroom sink and the unwashed dishes in the kitchen sink. I do so and happy to find out I have 20min before I have to make dinner, decide to fire up my playstation.

Not long after this my wife comes home. I hear her step in the kitchen and scream my name. I immediately get up to see what happened. 

It is at this point she berates me for washing a cardboard plate, the kind you get at the bottom of the store bought carvel birthday cakes. Admittedly I just finished a 15hr shift so I overlooked the fact that it wasnt an actual dish or plate. I apologize but seem unsure why all the anger I said that we can simply throw it away or do whatever. I honestly didnt care. She continues to berate me for wasting her time since she wanted to recycle the cardboard and now that it was wet she cant. 

Not wanting to escalate any further I walk out of the room without saying anything and hop back on the playstation, at this point I was already about to lose my temper. She walks into the living room and  announces that she will not make dinner. Cool, no problem. I say this and ask her what she would like to eat. She ignores.

She walks into the bathroom and once again screams my name. Once again I get up to see what is wrong. 

She starts yelling at me for not placing her 3 tooth brushes in the correct order (she has a system where she uses a specific tooth brush for each part of her mouth) and doesnt like the fact that I touch her things on the account that I'm dirty. I shower everyday and wash my hands like anyone would.

I advise her they got moved because I relocated all bathroom items on the sink to clean the sink and might have placed them incorrectly when placing them back after the cleaning.

She then goes off into a tangent that I dont know how to clean and there's no point anyway since we live in a ""trashy piece of shit"" apartment. Ive spent many hours hand building every piece of furniture, painting the walls, whatever else to make the apartment the best that it can be ontop of holding down a 70hr/week job. This is where I lose my temper.

I know I yelled very loudly at her but I didnt curse. I told her firmly that her issues with me are so minuscule it's actually hiding the fact that shes not happy with how her life turned out. I told her that she pissed away a full ride scholarship to college, got fired from numerous great jobs simply by not showing up, now stuck in a dead end low paying one and it's all finally dawning on her the reality of her situation. 

I told her that I tried my best to be supportive and that she needs professional help to address her depression. She calls me an asshole for bringing up the past and I'm rubbing her failures in her face. That I'm heartless and that I'm mean among many other things and storms off to the bedroom.

So reddit what's the verdict?

Update: Firstly I want to say thank you to all who commented with your inputs, I've read through most of them.

Secondly I had a long discussion with my wife, we are looking for therapist and will move in that direction to address our issues. 

Lastly I fully own up that I should not have said what I said and definitely not how I said it. (Context below if intrested). On my end going forward I will make a verbal cue to excuse myself and to regroup at a later and calmer time, a redditor mentioned this so thank you.

Hopefully this is a new start, thank you reddit. Fingers crossed.

Context:

Berating: Saw some discussions on the nature of what she actually said to me. I neglected from the original post since I felt like it can be summed up as something negative hence using simply ""berate"" to describe it. What she actually said isnt important anymore, honestly I dont remember all the insults, but it should be noted that it took a few minutes and I just stood there and took it before trying to explain myself.

 What I said to her concerning her past was something I've mentioned before to her in hopes that she will stop victimizing herself and that she needs to own and learn from her past. a redditor mentioned that there is never a good time for such talks. This is true I've tried many times prior to have a candid discussion of this and have failed. These past experiences contribute to her depression and I was frustrated to see her like this and reacted the way I did both trying to ""wake her up"" and out of anger/frustration. Again I own the fact that my timing couldn't have been worse. That's on me 100%

Again thank you all.",368,1441,0.94

She is living with my brother currently.

I am 22, still studying, due to finish my studies in a year, and am considering moving from my current town to another town 5 hours away to finish my degree. I told my mum this and not surprisingly she said she was considering moving to the same place, which I thought was a great idea.

This caused her to break down and state that my brother (who she currently lives with) and I don't love her, and that we just want to get rid of her.

She ended up staying for 40 days before we finally sat him down and asked what was up because we couldn't take it any longer. He never offered any compensation or even thanked us for letting her stay and we were all sick of them together. We told him we thought it was fair if we split rent for this month 5 ways instead of 4 because she stayed 30 days longer than we said was ok. He completely blew up saying we are trying to take advantage of them and are bad friends. His argument is that they shared a room so it shouldn't cost more.

When I met the kids, they were in a disadvantaged situation. My husband was a single dad who worked full time, a bit out of his depth and relied on his mother for help. She spoiled the kids for attention more than anything. 

After I came along, I used money from inheritance to help my husband move into a better neighbourhood. The kids go to a much better school, where it was discovered they were two years (!!) behind! Their ADHD was discovered and treated. Both kids caught up in a year. When the kids are with us (50/50 custody for all kids)  I mostly care for them. The kids have a healthier diet, a better sleep schedule, and  a better control over technology. 

The kids hated all these changes. I don't blame them. In the kids eyes, they all suck. They fought me, argued, and tried to call cps for abuse to try and live with their mother. (She 100% supports me and worked with me to make these changes, and has implemented some of them in her home.) I love these kids and will support them and give them the best future I can. 

BUT... I love my daughter more. I can't help it. Looking at her sends different chemicals in my brain than my other kids. Its hard wired. Maybe it would be different they were smaller when i met them. Whatever it is, my lizard brain won't love them the same way. They have the same opportunities now. The same food. The same chores. The same punishments for wrongdoings.

1640,Everyone Sucks,"Backstory: I am from Ontario Canada. Everyone goes 20km/hr over the speed limit. Its a $200+ fine and 2 demerit points if you are going below the speed limit; known as 'impeding traffic'

Event that I am questioning if I am an asshole: I drive the same route to work every day, it is a two lane road that goes down to one lane and then goes back to two lanes again. The speed limit is 50km/hr for most of it. I know exactly where all of the potholes are on the road. I have blown out a tire in the past on a bad pothole. I was driving along and caught up to guy doing the speed limit. I leave a respectable amount of space between us. He slowed down to doing 35km/hr. I was getting a little annoyed because that was much slower then the speed limit so I went to pass him when the lines went from solid double yellow to dashed yellow. There was no traffic coming in the other direction. When I started to move into the other lane to pass, he swerved in front of me so that I couldn't pass him. I moved back into my proper lane & followed behind the guy again. I would have just kept following him but he slowed down to 20km/hr. After the car passed us by I went to go and pass him again, and he swerved in front of me again to keep me from passing.

When it starts to go back to being two lanes again, there are nasty blow out potholes in the right lane. We hit the area where it becomes two lanes and I am thinking, okay. I am in a higher vehicle, I can survive the potholes if I'm careful. And I get into that lane. EXCEPT; I know that this asshole in front of me is going to get in front of me to cut me off...

Well yesterday was a night that ended up drawing 14 people some friends brought their other friends and well you know the drill, so I was supposed to be there at 6:30 PM but I call ahead to my friend let's call him Tom to tell him I won't make it at that time and that they should just start and that I'll be there for the main course, since I had to pick my friend Jenny up last minute.

So after about 30 minutes me and Jenny arrive at the restaurant{A seafood restaurant} And a few minutes pass before the waiter comes out with the main course without me or Jenny having ordered yet.

Well another few minutes pass before they come out with the rest, placed in front of me is a huge pile of mussels, now let me be clear I am not a picky eater but Mussels are one of the few things I just think are absolutely disgusting.

Me: Uhm, Tim why did you guys order me Mussels, I mean you all know I hate Mussels?

Tim: Well we told Stacey she should wait but she wanted to order for you guys.

Me: Well I get that but you know I hate Mussels so why not order me pretty much anything else?

Tim: Well we told her but she says Mussels are great and it's fine.

Me: Well I guess you guys can eat this then and I'll order something else?

So at this point I decide it is not worth bringing it up and possibly ruining a good dinner, I simply shove the mussels to the middle of the table and announce that someone else can eat it if they want

So I order a crab dish and assume given it was Stacey's fuck up she'd pick up the check for the mussels. The rest of the night was fun untill the check comes and Stacey starts saying what everyone has to pay and comes up with 60 euro's for me. When in reality the crab was like 20 and my drinks were also around 20.

Me: 60 Euro's? It's more like 40 Euro's I only had crab a few drinks and no appetizer.

Stacey: You had the Mussels, that's 20 Euro's.

Tim: Yeah but I told you not to order for him and Jenny and we told you when you ordered the mussels he dislikes them.

Stacey: He didn't even try them so how does he knows he doesn't like them?

Me: That is irrelevant, they told you not to order it and you did, so you can pay for your own dishes, that includes the mussels.

At this point I just got annoyed, tossed my 40 Euro's on the table, stood up, said bye to my friends and I dropped Jenny off at her home and went home myself. So I get a few calls and app's later on 90% siding with me but Jenny seemed a bit peeved about how I reacted to her friend and well Stacey pretty much made a huge deal out of it and kept whining after I left. Now most of my friends are on my side but Jenny is peeved I was rude to her friend{Stacey} So I am wondering if I was a tad too harsh?",279,1407,0.96
1649,No A-holes here,"So my roommate had some friends over last night, which is totally fine with me as I also have friends over frequently. The problem came this morning though when I was leaving for my doctor's appointment. All of her friends had went home last night except for 1 who drank too much and spent the night on the couch. Again, this is also fine. What's not fine to me is that since she left for work at 6am that morning, and with me going to my appointment, he would left completely alone in the house. It just bothered me, nothing against him, I just prefer not to have non-residents over for extended time without either me or my roommate there. So I woke up him up and had him leave as I was getting ready for my appointment. As I drove to it my roommate called me from work and asked why I did that. It wasn't a big argument or anything, but I'd like to know if I'm in the wrong here so we can talk it out later today.",18,29,0.91
1650,No A-holes here,"I am a female in my mid twenties and I've been working for five years with my co-worker Dan, a married guy in his early forties. We are quite close as we have similar personalities and interests, and we get along really well.

Last week one of our co-workers, Barb, approached me and said that she hopes I don't take it the wrong way but she is concerned about my closeness with Dan. She said that she knows we are just friends, but thinks that we are putting ourselves in a place where we could cross a line eventually. 

I was stunned to hear this because while I am very fond of Dan, I really don't see him as anything more than a friend, and I'm sure it's the same way with him for me. I asked Barb where this is coming from, and she pointed out things that we do that to me isn't anything out of the course of things you would do with a friend. Additionally, while we are BFF's in the office, it's not like we text or hang out a lot after work or during weekends. 

I stammered an assurance that Dan and I are really just friends, I would never be involved with someone who's already committed to someone else, and the way I know Dan he is not the kind of guy who will cheat, much less shit where he eats.

Barb said she means well and talked to me because she cares for me and doesn't want me to be in a bad situation. She said she hopes I will remember our conversation and be more conscious about my closeness with Dan. 

Yesterday Dan told me that a client he's friendly with invited him to lunch, and he invited me to go with them as well. We have done this a couple of times and it's one of the things that Barb pointed out as the cause of her concern. Barb is asking why Dan wants me there when I'm not needed there. Personally, I think Dan just wants another person from 'his side' there for livelier conversations with his clients. The lunches are casual and in public places, and we really don't do anything other than eat and talk.

I don't really see anything wrong with accepting Dan's invitation again, but part of me feels bothered because this is one of the things Barb talked to me about.",191,503,0.95

1652,Not the A-hole,"I have a guy in my circle of friends (let’s call him Andy) who’s fallen on some really hard times lately. Both parents passed within months of each other leaving behind sizable medical debt , he lost his job, he’s barely getting by right now. 

So the group was getting together the other night and we got hungry. Someone suggested we go to a restaurant nearby. But as they were saying it they noticed Andy looking uncomfortable and  realized he probably couldn’t afford to eat there so backtracked. 

Andy says don’t skip the meal on his account, this next part is verbatim “I’ll find someone to cover me.” 

I don’t know if it’s a joke or if he’s saying he needs us to pay his share. I don’t really think about it.  

We go, we sit down, Andy orders and he says to the waitress, loudly enough for the surrounding tables to hear “I’ll have the porterhouse. Now, it’s a little out of my budget, but **I just got back from a tour in Iraq**, so I’m gonna treat myself.” 

Andy definitely never served in the military in any capacity. 

I’m glancing around awkwardly waiting for him to come clean or for there to be a punchline of some kind but it’s not. The waitress thanks him for his service and she’s telling him about her boyfriend who’s over in Kuwait. Andy is like “yah I totally get it my girlfriend felt the same way.” 

Finally I’m like “Haha, ok Andy, very funny” and he’s giving me a death glare. The waitress thinks I’m making a crack about a veteran so is like “what’s funny?” And I’m so taken aback and confused and uncomfortable I’m just like “Come on Andy, you weren’t in Iraq, give it a rest.” 

Everyone is super uncomfortable now, especially the waitress, understandably. Conversation comes to a screeching halt and it’s so tense I actually just go home. 

The next day I‘m supposed to head to the gym with a guy from the group and when I see him he says “You know what you did was really shitty last night.” I figure he’s an outlier since he’s close friends with the guy. But throughout the day I get texts from everyone saying they feel the same. 

Basically everyone feels like Andy was just desperate to protect his pride about not being able to pay and is under stress so made a bad call but didn’t mean any harm, so I’m an asshole for embarrassing him. 

They agree it was a bad call but feel like I should’ve taken him aside in private rather than call him out in front of strangers. 

I feel like he’s an asshole for trying to take advantage of the goodness of other people, especially a girl whose boyfriend is actually serving. And that my friends are kind of assholes for enabling that behavior. 

But it’s five against one right now, so AITA? 

*tldr: I was out to dinner with a guy who pretended to be in the military to get a free meal. I called him out on it in front of the whole restaurant But he’s broke and wouldn’t have been able to afford the meal otherwise, so my friends think I should’ve worked it out with him privately.*",79,90,0.91
1653,Not the A-hole,"So basically, my dad passed away when I was a little child. I was so close to him and I miss him everyday. Some years later my mom decided to marry another dude. She asked me if I was fine with it and I obvioisly said yes, as the guy has been pretty nice with us this whole time. 

As soon as they got married, the guy wanted to have a chat with me. He basically said that I shouldn't call him by his name from then on, as he was married with my mom, and that is not the way it's done in our culture ( African Muslim, although I was born in Spain and I dont believe in Islam, im for the moment in the closet). I was about 12 and I felt like I didn't have enough maturity to debate with him about the matter, so I agreed. Even though I never felt comfortable calling him 'dad', my mom was on his side so I just had to accept it.

So now, I'm fed up of family. First of all because I have to fake being a Muslim and I'm tired of living a double life. Secondly, my mom is always telling me how great this guy is, which is true, but she constantly refers to both of us as 'father and son'.   I have nothing against this guy but the thing is that we don't really talk about anything besides football, he does not speak Spanish fluently (that's where I live and where I was born) so we tend to speak in our African language, which I'm not fluent at.   So yesterday I told her that I feel that by calling him 'dad' I am being disrespectful towards my dad and she got mad at mea dn started telling me (again) how amazing he has been with us.  Am I the Asshole?

1657,,"I have nothing against foreigners. In fact my parents are foreigners and have thick accents, though having known them all my life, I have no problem interpreting what they’re saying. Others are a little harder for me, but I’m usually pretty okay with it UNLESS I’m speaking on the phone. 

I was speaking with a customer service representative over the phone for my airline. Won’t go into details, but it was urgent. I was put on the line with a thick-accented lady and I couldn’t understand a damn thing she was saying. I really had to strain to hear her. After going around in circles, asking her to repeat herself a bunch of times, I said as kindly as I could muster: “I deeply apologize, but I’m having trouble comprehending you. Would you mind connecting me to someone else who can speak clearer English?” 

She seemed pretty offended over the phone and said there’s nothing she can do for me and hung up. My friend was sitting next to me the whole time and told me that was rude of me to say. But I wasn’t trying to insult her. I just think it’s pointless and a waste of time staying on the phone with someone that I can’t understand.

1658,Not the A-hole,"New user here, so I apologise for any mistakes.

I’ve had tics for a few years now. They aren’t bad enough to be classified as Tourette’s, although they can be slightly annoying at times. My tics include jerking my head to the side, clicking my tongue, clapping, slamming my hands down on a flat surface, and saying loads of random words. Normally I only do one of these and then carry on as normal, but around once a month I get something I refer to as a “tic attack”, where I have non stop tics for around 5 minutes or so. I should also point out that I’m incredibly vulnerable during one of these attacks, as I only have a minimum amount of control over what I’m doing. I can usually control my hands but that’s about it. If someone decided to steal my bag or attack me I don’t think I’d have enough control to defend myself during this. 

My boyfriend studies psychology, and funnily enough he was recently studying Tourette’s and other tic disorders. I gave him permission to film one of my tic attacks, so that he could show his psychology teacher/class, as they don’t actually get to see what tics are like. We agreed that when I got the attack, I would give him a thumbs up if it was okay to film. A few days later I get an attack while we are hanging out with friends, give him the thumbs up, he films part of it and all is good. 

Now a few days later, I get another tic attack. This is unusual to have them this close together, so I’m already a little startled at it. Then I notice that a friend has pulled out her phone and started filming me, while laughing slightly. I can’t do anything while I’m ticking, but as soon as it’s over I ask her what the fuck she was doing.
“Oh well you let your boyfriend film last time so it’s obviously fine.”
I’m pissed as hell, I explain that I had explicitly given him permission for his class, but that doesn’t mean I gave her permission. I told her to delete the video.
“No, if you agreed once then it’s fine all the other times. If you don’t like it then you shouldn’t have agreed the first time”.
I completely lost my shit. I yelled at her that it was an extreme violation of my privacy, that she should ask every time, and that me agreeing once doesn’t mean I agree every time. She eventually deleted it, but is now telling everyone that I went back on my word and that I double crossed her.

A lot of people have told me that I should have let her keep the video, as it was harmless fun and my boyfriend already filmed it anyways. While at the time I thought I was right, I'm now wondering if I overreacted because I was startled and stressed out. AITA for yelling and telling her to delete it?

Edit: so the general consensus I’m getting here is that I need better friends 😂. I am leaving in September for university and have decided that I’m definitely going to be cutting her off, as well as some of the people who tried to defend her. I posted this as I’m autistic and had no idea if I’d crossed a line/broken a social rule, or if I was justified. Also to be clear, everyone in this story is around 17/18, in our last school year before uni. I know teenagers can be crappy af sometimes and it feels like this is one of those cases.

Edit number 2: a couple people have messaged me to let me know my symptoms sound like full blown Tourette’s. While I did originally go to a GP, he wasn’t very sympathetic and did not refer me to a neurologist as he said it wasn’t enough symptoms. Once I move and have a new GP, I will go and try get a referral, if only to see if there’s anything else I can do to manage these tics better. Thank you all for your advice, I’m fairly shy so I don’t think I would have ever gone back without people altering me that this is unusual! (I mean obviously tics are unusual, but I assumed that if the GP said I didn’t have an issue then it was fine)",477,4551,0.95

1660,Not the A-hole,"My ex an I have an incredibly long history. We met when I was 18 and he was 19. He was my first love and we dated about a year. But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...

He was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

When I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I’d be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child’s life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn’t an option. 

I myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it’s a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.

After begging him to be in the baby’s life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

At first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

I took sole custody of course. It’s been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven’t seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. 

I get a call and it’s my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can’t just say no because he’s gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

I was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he’s ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. 

I’ve told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I’m just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this. AITA for being so against him getting any custody?

Edit: for all the people that are confused about age. We met in late teens. Got pregnant when I was 23 and he was 24. I’m 30 now and he’s 31.

Edit2: for all the people that are saying I’m TA for not getting an abortion. Thanks! BUT I remember asking if I was an ass for telling my ex I’ll fight him over custody. Please stop telling me I should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. It’s very much too late and I never asked for your opinion on that matter.",3918,15239,0.9
1661,Asshole,"On mobile, first post, shitty writer, blah blah you know the drill


A little bit of background. Let me start off with saying I love my [24M] girlfriend [23F] with all my heart and am still attracted to her. We’ve been together for 2 years and have been living together for almost 1 year. During our first year together we couldn’t keep our hands off of each other. However, something changed in the first year that ended up slowing down my libido a great deal. I contracted herpes from my girlfriend. She never knew she had herpes and ended up having an outbreak which caused me to get herpes as well. She felt horrible and was in tears over the entire situation telling me how she hurt me. I still have outbreaks but take medication to control them. 



Now onto the story. For the past couple of weeks we haven’t been having sex and the reason is because of me. I had an outbreak about three weeks ago and told her no to sex because I wanted to wait till the outbreak was over then we can have sex without causing her an outbreak. Outbreaks for me usually last a week so she agreed to wait and we went on with our life together. The thing is every time I have an outbreak I completely lose my libido and don’t feel the urge to have sex. My girlfriend doesn’t know that. It also doesn’t help that she has a very high libido. The past couple of weeks my girlfriend has made it known that she wants to have sex through her actions and well even flat out tell me she wants to have sex. Every time this happens I always refuse by saying “Sorry but I’m not in the mood” or “I still have [outbreak] going on and want to wait”. Last night was one of those nights. Things ended up getting steamy and before it really took off I told her I wasn’t in the mood for sex. She proceeded to get annoyed that we weren’t going to and went to bed. No words were said just huff and puffs. After she went to bed I ended up masturbating. Not because I was horny from earlier or anything else we did but because masturbating helps relieve stress for me. Its more of a relaxer for me than anything else. Sex is different and has more passion. 



I love my girlfriend and give her foot/back rubs, surprise her with flowers, cuddle with her, and give her anything and everything she wants right now. Except sex. I feel bad because I don’t want her to feel unwanted or that she’s unattractive in anyway. I would tell her it’s because I lose my libido after an out break but all she’ll hear is “The reason we haven’t been having sex is because of the herpes you gave me” I know her well enough to understand that she’ll end up blaming herself for giving me herpes and how she hurt me. Lastly I don’t want to tell her that I masturbate because I don’t think she’ll understand my point of view as she doesn’t see the point. I feel bad that I can’t give her what she wants but at the same time I don’t want to force myself into having sex. AITA for refusing sex only to go masturbate?",28,36,0.86
1662,Not the A-hole,"All my life I've been constantly sick. I've had dozens of blood tests, x-rays, and specialists appointments. My health is beyond a joke at this point and it affects my day to day life. I'm currently 16 years old and I have a massive pain tolerance. Because of this, I don't start to notice the pain until it's incredibly bad. My whole life every time I address these health problems I've been laughed at and the appointment with a medical professional doesn't happen for a long period after pain was first present. Here are the main 4 times RECENTLY this has happened:

1. I had a toothache. I told my Mother. My mother ignored me to the point I had to spend Christmas in the ER because I couldn't bear the pain anymore. I was given morphine. When finally taken to a dentist the damage to the tooth was so extreme I had to be put under laughing gas in order for the tooth to be removed.
2. I had tonsillitis over a dozen times within the span of a year. My mother told the doctor removing my tonsils wasn't an option. I no longer live with my mother, but my father hasn't made any attempt to get my tonsils removed despite repetitive episodes. The size of my tonsils is effecting my breathing. I am constantly short of breath despite being incredibly active (gymnastic type stuff and jogging). Before getting tonsillitis I was able to partake in Tennis every weekend to clear my mind and destress. I am no longer able to do this.
3. My joints are awful. Specifically in my hips. They lock up and I'm unable to get up or move for hours. Not only am I denied going to a medical professional, but I'm also mocked for walking around with crutches despite the pain of moving my joint unbearable.
4. I get seizures whenever I get super stressed. I'm usually pretty good at functioning in my day to day life but when the stress becomes too much I lose control of my head and it nods up and down violently. I become unable to balance and I often fall over. This has been swept under the rug and labeled as ""normal"".

I'm at my breaking point. My parents act as if I'm not really in pain because I'm good at hiding the pain but I'm sick of them only taking action when I literally ghost white and passing out. I'm sick and exhausted and stressed. My attendance at school is currently less than 50% because I'm so medically drained and constantly in pain or completely out of it on pain killers. I could really use some perspective since my parents are so insistent I'm being unreasonable.

&#x200B;

We live in Australia, so going to a medical professional is usually less than $200 for a specialist. Often it's free. We have private health care and we aren't struggling financially.

&#x200B;

Edit since this is locked: A lot of people are calling this post out for being fake; it's not. To confirm, I've been put on several prescription and non-prescription medications. Non-prescription things are stuff like birth control (for the back pain I get which is period related) and iron supplements. I've had far too many prescription medications to list them here and I rarely pay attention to what I'm given, I just take the pills.

&#x200B;

As for people bringing up my old post history out of context... why? Just why bother? I mean, a user quoted a post about a random cut that kept appearing on my leg... A cut that I had no part in creating. I was suicidal in the past and I did relapse recently after a friend passed away. If I could prove all of this stuff is real without getting DOXXED I absolutely would, but as an already paranoid person, I won't. As well as this, I deleted past posts FOREVER ago. I haven't been replying to messages or really being active because I'll be completely honest, I've been sleeping all day. I'm tired and it's the weekend, sue me.

&#x200B;

I agree, my medical history is all over the place. It's fucked up and I usually write these posts mid-breakdown to vent. It relaxes me. A lot of people are also bringing up the fact I used to do tennis... Like yeah, before my joints got bad. I still do MILD gymnastics at home at my own pace. Nothing insane like going out to a club. I have been to a physio in the past who recommended stretches but I haven't been back for a LONG time. I am still able to walk and be active sometimes, it's just that a lot of the time my joints lock in place for long periods of time. My joint will randomly lock when I'm still for long periods of time. It's not all the time.

&#x200B;

For those of you unaware, in order to Uber you need to be 18. Not 16. Cabs are pricey as hell (I looked into it for the same friends funeral, it was going to be over $100 for a 10 minute ride) and I don't feel comfortable walking long distances due to previous life experiences involving assault. 

&#x200B;

This whole thing is an absolute shit fest. I'll ask my Dad for my medical notes from the doctors so I can prove how frequently I actually go to the doctors, but that won't really prove what for, just that I was ill enough to need them.

&#x200B;

To those of you saying I'm not really sick, I get it. I've gotten it my whole life and your words, however hurtful, won't change the fact that I can't fake tonsillitis or an ear infection or whatever it is. The ""seizures"" are stress-related. Truth is I don't know what they are, just that they started around the time my Mother started threatening to sell all of my birds. My mental state is fucked up. Completely. My parents thought I was a sociopath until a few years ago (my Uncle on my Mom's side is a sociopath and apparently acted very similar to me) when I got into animal keeping. After that, I became more stable.

  
I don't care about internet points, if I did I'd just post pictures of my pets on r/aww constantly until I farmed enough karma to do whatever. I certainly wouldn't be posting late at night (for me at least) about my shitty medical problems. I'd post something more uplifting, like with my birds dancing. It wasn't serious and it was incredibly stupid, but I got dozens of messages from people having their days made. That's the only type of post I really care about.",168,388,0.81

1665,Asshole,"I've been married for almost twenty years so this issue is long dead, but my brother recently told me I was an asshole and i want an unbiased opinion. During our engagement, my now wife, told me that she wanted to hyphenate our name because she is an only child of an only child father, meaning that without at least hyphenating, her fathers family name would die out. While our discussion never got heated, we definitely went back and forth on it. The mere thought of our possible children having a last name like that was unacceptable to me and we almost called the wedding off. Ultimately, I refused, she conceded, and we've been married for 20 years and have 3 children all carrying on my families last name. My wife has never brought this up in all that time, but during a recent family cookout my brother randomly brought it up when we were talking and said ""I was a dick because our family name continues through my kids, you could have let hers live on through her."" This has led me to reconsider, so AITA for not wanting to give up my name?

---EDIT UPDATE---


Wow ok, a heck of a lot to unpack here. 1st I never expected this to blow up like this and there's no way I can go through it all in a timely faction, so I just want to thank everyone for the responses. While the consensus is a little split, the majority say AITA, so I think it's safe to say that I am indeed an asshole. You guys have given me a lot to think about and I've got some soul searching that I need to do. I truly do appreciate all the advice, criticisms, and encouragement from all of you. That said, I wanted to let you all know that I sat down with my wife and brought this all up with her and even showed her this thread. I told her that I was more than willing to discuss making any changes that she would like to make regarding changing not only my last name, but our children's as well. When she could tell that I was serious about this, she started laughing hysterically, I mean a solid few minutes of uncontrollable laughter that lead to her crying with laughs. I have to say as this went on that I started to get rather pissed off, when she realized this she finally calmed down enough to explain what was so damn funny. So it turns out that she NEVER wanted to hyphenate our name, it was something my Father in law tried to force on her, and she didn't want me resent him for it, so she posed it as something she wanted. She went on to say she was so happy that I was so against it, which is why we never got into a real argument about it. It wasn't until I put my foot down that she was finally able to get her dad off her back about it. Well reddit I have to tell you that the relief I feel is just fucking amazing. We did talk about asking the kids if any of them would like to take on their grandfather's legacy, and we are going to find a way to do that.

Thank you all again so much.

1666,Everyone Sucks,"Housemate plays his radio loudly in the shower at 8, and works different days so will consistently wake me up doing this when I'm trying to catch up on sleep. 

Asked him politely would he mind not playing his radio outside my room, he is a stuck up prick and refused, giving me a self rightous speech about it being working hours and he was entitled to make as much noise as he wanted. I'm a more recent grad so included in the speech was bullshit about me needing to wake up to the real world and not sleep in (none of his business)

I also get up at 6 every working day, so I started playing my favourite heavy metal (sabaton and Rammstein are doing well at the moment ) and lifting weights before my shower .

Gave him the same words back when he complained about being consistently woken up early, losing him ~2 hours sleep before his work

1667,Asshole,"So, here's some backstory. I (23TM) had my partner (21F) of a year move in with me last month. She works online for a local office, and I work 30min away at a fish hatchery. I have epilepsy and can't drive, and until recently I had been paying a friend quite a bit to drive me to work because my apartment isn't by a bus. Leading up to moving in, my girlfriend had been giving me rides more often, and seemed happy to help. We've never gotten into any argument we weren't able to solve within half an hour or less. We are both very peaceful, we have all of the same hobbies, and just generally get along great.

&#x200B;

We both like more traditional relationships. I would never expect anything of a partner other than being equal, but right from the start she made it clear she wants to be a homemaker, cleaning and having me come home to hot meals every day, and eventually we want to adopt and raise kids with her at home. It is a relationship dynamic that works well for both of us as she doesn't do well with traditional jobs (anxiety), and most of the time I don't have it in me to cook or clean when I get home. I do not ask her to pay rent because she doesn't work very many hours, but she does pay for our groceries, our cell phones, some dates, and is all around a very helpful person.

Today, she brought up how it is inconsiderate for me to assume she will give me a ride to work every day since she moved in. She isn't even mad that I didn't formally ask her, she just that she thinks it's too much for me to expect. I tried to explain how I felt to her and apologized for assuming anything without talking about it first. I also mentioned I felt it was something you should just do in a long term relationship. I did NOT say that I feel I deserve rides because I pay rent, or say/even think anything like that, but the way she reacted made me feel as if I had shamed her or something when I have never mentioned anything like that, just the rides. She shut me out for the rest of the day, and I had to pay my friend to drive me when I really didn't have the money. When I got home, she was asleep.

&#x200B;

My least favorite thing is being shut out and not being able to resolve things immediately, and she knows this. There is nothing barring her from being able to do this, she can work whenever she wants so it doesn't hinder that, also it's not money because she is able to save tons by not paying rent. She often goes out when I'm at work (which I don't have any problem with, she can go out whenever she wants), so she is driving anyway. I don't think it's too much to ask for, but she does, and even said that she doesn't want to feel used for rides, but I don't want to feel used either. I do realize that she would be spending 2+ hours a day driving me which is the reason I'm questioning if I'm completely wrong on this one.. So AITA here, or is she being unreasonable?",56,111,0.93

1669,Asshole,"I will keep some parts vague for obvious reasons. Long background here please have patience. We are from a country where there are lots of stray animals. There is a rule among an organisation animal activists(lets shorten it to OAA) that forbid roaming pets, meaning pets are to be kept strictly indoors and outdoor pets are considered strays, regardless of microchip or collars. That is only applied to that OAA, not recognized by the law, but laws here don’t protect animals much in the first place, OAA has become its own “animal police”. Once they act, unless it cause serious damage the real police just chill.


My friend’s cat broke out and went missing for 2 weeks. She put up posters and social media posts, searched high and low and finally found it when somebody notified her that they saw its picture on the OAA group among rescued cats for adoption. She then tried to contact OAA but they refused to return it to her, saying that she had failed as an owner to expose it to dangers outside and proceed to block her. She tried to call the police but at the rate they’re going its likely to either be forgotten or take months. I decided to take action myself. 


I contacted OAA and offered to adopt another cat, the one kept beside my friend’s cat which had one eye blind. They were delighted as an one eyed cat is harder to be adopted. We then exchanged messages and phone calls for long hours about info regarding the cat's health and personality, what I should prepare and look out for, financial status etc. Finally after 2 days I requested to pay the cat a visit and they gave me the address of the fosterer.


Sure enough, the one eyed cat was in a cage right next to my friend's cat. It was almost too easy to ask for some alone time with the one eye cat, grab my friend’s cat and leave when the fosterer was not looking. I blocked all the contacts from OAA and my friend got her cat back. All information I gave were fake and they could not track me down without calling police, which, would either be forgotten or take months. My friend can back me up anyway, she has all evidences that I am just returning a lost cat to its rightful owner. The only regret was that the one eyed cat was left behind, I had no intention of adopting it in the first place. 


AITA though? For doing what I did? I sure hope not but I shall leave it to you.


Edit: TLDR: Animal activists detained my friend's lost cat and refused to return, I tricked them by pretending to adopt a one eyed cat and took my friend's cat back. Police are useless in my country.


Info: For those asking why not ask to adopt my friend's cat in the first place

1. My friend had already contacted the OAA and got blocked, so they were likely to screen carefully for potential adopters on that cat

2. The one eyed cat is harder to be adopted than my friend's black long haired cat, so I figured they are more likely to let their guard down and let me visit it.


Update: Just recieved info that OAA microchipped my friend's cat(it was not microchipped, but had collar with name on it) after its ""rescue"" and they are currently looking for us online for ""theft"" and ""microchip fee"" and cooked up post of a sob story of an abused and abandoned cat rescued but stolen by an evil fat woman(hey thats rude). We sure blew a hell of a drama, but my opinion is WTF who gave them the right to microchip somebody else's cat? My friend keep quiet about its return at the moment and they had no proof that she got anything to do with it. Let's hope the police remain useless in this case, since they didn't bother with my friend's report. Leave that poor frightened big(Maine Coon mix) fella alone already.",66,169,0.94

1671,Not the A-hole,"I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200B;

I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200B;

Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200B;

Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing ""his"" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",5051,16228,0.9
1672,Asshole,"Earlier today, my child sat my wife and I down and told us that they wanted to identify as non-binary from now on. I didn't really get it (and still don't to be honest) so they told me that they wanted to be called my child now, and use they and them pronouns.

I told them that I accepted them, because of course I do, but that I wanted them to not be afraid to let me know if they change their mind. They're the kind of kid that doesn't like being wrong, so I didn't want them to be embarrassed by not identifying as the way they do right now later, because they made such a big deal out of it.

My wife, however, took it to mean that I was invalidating them. I told her I wasn't, I was simply saying that they're allowed to change their mind if it turns out to be a phase, which it probably is. My child started crying at that point and my wife told me to leave the room, which I did.

It's not that I don't believe them. I just think it's unrealistic to expect them to continue identify that way. I mean, how many  full grown adults do you know that identify as non-binary? I don't know any.

And it's not that I'm not supportive of transgenders or anything. I am. My nephew is transgender. But he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and he takes hormones and he got surgery. It's clear with him that it's not a phase. With my child, however, it really isn't.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole for telling my child that they're probably going through a phase?

1673,Asshole,"My wife was born and raised in Germany, coming here for college which is where we met. My wife’s first and native language is German, but she is fluent in English. When we had our daughter, we agreed to raise her bilingual. My wife spoke to her mainly in German during her formative language years and I spoke to her in English, the only language I know. I know some German because of my wife and when I visit her family but I am not fluent.

Now, our daughter is 5 and I would say she speaks both languages fluently, though German would be considered her first language. I am happy she has this and I have been trying to become fluent myself the past few years but it’s difficult to learn a new language as an adult vs. having it in your life since Day 1.

An issue I have, however, is there are times my wife and daughter communicate in front of me in German and I can’t keep up. My daughter could be telling my wife things and I miss out, then I have to ask my wife to translate, which she will.

Recently, in private with my wife, I asked that maybe around me the two could speak in English. That way I could follow the conversations and we could communicate as a family, while I learn their language. My wife got upset and said I was asking too much. Now keep in mind, I never ask her to mute any other part of her German heritage around me. We celebrate holidays, follow traditions, etc. I’m just asking that I can follow the conversation.

I brought this up at my German class, however, and they told me this was a sensitive subject, and not something you can ask of a bilingual person.

1674,Not the A-hole,"So my wife had  a work trip and the hotel they pay for the employees is groce, and her ex boyfriend lives in that city.

They still talk, and the guy said she can crash there if she wants too.

She told me about it, and I said sure, better than the crappy hotel they put you.

Backstory, they dated during college, she broke up with him, he has a fucked up family, and very few friends, and my wife kept in touch and is always trying to help him in whatever he is going through. They are really good friends.

I actually met the guy a few times, he’s a cool dude, and I can tell he’s totally over it also, they really are just very good friends.

I’m not a jealous guy at all, never have been. I guess I always believed if someone said they wanted to be with me, the natural thing is to trust them, and if somebody wants to cheat on you, they will eventually, and there’s nothing you can do about it

Anyway, few days before the trip she asked me again if I was fine with it and I said yes, and she told me that even though she appreciated me being so chill about it, part of her was a little worried that I was fine with her staying at her ex’s house for 3 days in a different state.

I asked her if she had any feelings for him or attraction, she said no, I asked if she was planning on cheating on me, she also said no, then I said so I have nothing to worry about, and I said that I’m just not a jealous guy, which she already knew about very well.

The day she left, she woke up super weird, barely talking to me, which never happens, then I asked what was wrong, she said she couldn’t believe that I wasn’t not even a little bit worried or jealous about the situation.

I told her “ I dont know what else to say” and I also said that it was a little annoying that instead of being happy to have an understanding husband, she was trying to find a problem.

She said “ whatever, I have to get ready and leave”

So she got her stuff together, gave me a kiss and left, but I knew she was not happy .

She comes back tomorrow, we spoke a few times, she said everything is fine there, said the ex says hi, but she still is a little weird with me.

1675,No A-holes here,"We live near a very prestigious boarding school. 10 minutes walking distance, to be exact. 

They don’t allow day students, no matter how close you live, you’re a boarder. 

My daughter started there this week. They have a two week period where everyone gets acclimated before class (the first week is freshman orientation week then a week where everyone is back and gets acclimated.) We are just closing out that first week. 

They’ve got a very lax attendance policy as far as staying on campus, because it’s a small safe town and the student body is notoriously ultra responsible (it’s a self selecting group of academically driven kids). 

So whenever you want to go as long as you don’t have a class you can check out between something like 8am-8pm. 

My daughter has come home every second she isn’t in an obligatory orientation activity. 

I get that living on your own for the first time is stressful and she’s probably anxious, but my feeling is it won’t get any better until she starts making friends (which she can’t do if she’s never there) and getting out of her comfort zone. 

I’m hoping she’ll have some friends before class starts, because this transition period is set aside specially for the kids to get their social footing before they’re adjusting to high school classwork. 

So I told her this weekend we really want her to stay the entire time at school (or out on the town with her new friends, I was trying to delicately say anywhere but here). 

She’s upset and I told her I understand her reluctance and yada yada, all the things appropriate to counsel her with, but that it won’t get better until she gets through this awkward first stage. 

My wife is saying I’m making the transition that much harder for our daughter by taking away her support network. I feel like I’m making it easier by removing a crutch that was holding her back. 

Neither of us went to boarding school so have no clue. 

My wife is pissed and my daughter is heartbroken. I really am just trying to help her but did I go about it the wrong way?

*edit: To be clear, we did not force her to go to boarding school, it was not our idea at all. She selected this school, she opted for boarding. We offered at the first sign of trouble to withdraw her from this school and put her in a day school. She said very clearly that that is not what she wants.*

*edit 2: I see rereading my post that it was very poorly worded. To be clear, I didn’t tell her I didn’t want her to come home for the entire school. I told her I wanted her to try to stay at school* **over this weekend** to participate in orientation.*",294,1142,0.95
1676,Not the A-hole,"I have an aunt that lives in another state. My mother and her do not speak and haven’t for about 30 years. My mom is not hateful about her and handles it with grace. I support her decision to not have a toxic person in her life, especially because my mom has an autoimmune disease that is worsened by stress. 

My aunt is actively dying and today I got the call that she likely won’t make it through the night. I asked my mom if anyone had reached out to her son. Her response was that she was not sure, that she had thought of reaching out to him but felt it was not her place due to the estrangement. I knew he hadn’t spoken to his mom in the last two years. I don’t know any details, honestly, just that he didn’t want anything to do with her and wasn’t speaking to her. 

I don’t know my cousin well but when we meet during family gatherings, I speak to him. We are always nice to each other. So I shot him a Facebook message as that’s the only contact I have for him. I let him know that his mother wasn’t expected to make it through the night and I wasn’t sure if he was aware. 

Minutes later, my mom texted me saying that I shouldn’t have said anything. That it was not my place and I should have “stayed in my lane”. My other aunt is upset with me too. My mom said that he wasn’t notified for a reason and I shouldn’t have told him. 

My reaction was an emotional one rather than logical, I admit. My dad passed away a year and a half ago and I did not get to be by his side when he went. It haunts me every single day. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone and I didn’t want her to die alone, regardless of our lack of a relationship. 

My cousin responded sweet to me and thanked me and told me I did nothing wrong. I totally see how my family is upset with him for abandoning her. But just as (to them) it is not my place to tell him, I feel it isn’t their place to tell me what I can or cannot say. There has been a period where my horrible older sister didn’t speak to my mom for two years. Had my mom been knocking on death’s door, regardless of how I feel about her, I would have told her. I just don’t understand anyone thinking they have the right to keep that knowledge from him. Even if he didn’t show up, he’d known and you would know you did what you could, right? 

My family is not happy with me AT ALL. Should I have minded my own business? I genuinely want to know so that I can learn and grow from this. I apologized to my family for causing any issues, but I don’t feel that my decision was wrong. My intentions were good and had I known it would have caused an issue, I may have had a second-thought.  Regardless, I feel that he should have known so that he would get his chance to say goodbye, if he wanted to at all.  AITA?",27,30,0.92

1679,Not the A-hole,"So while I was out working tonight, I came across a tiny little kitten. The poor thing was tiny, nothing but bones, and came running up to me meowing. I melted. Normally I don't bring animals home but this one won my heart instantly. 

My husband hates pets. All pets. If it requires any kind of responsibility, he doesn't want it. However I'm stubborn and we currently have two pets. A cat and a sugar glider. But when I called him to tell him about the kitten, he hung up on me. 

When I brought the baby home, I gave her food, a spot bath, and gave her a small blanket to lay on. I quarantined her to the bathroom because I haven't taken her to the vet yet and don't want our current cat to get infected from anything this little kitten might have. I don't want to keep the kitten. I plan on finding her a new home tomorrow. 

The event of me bringing the kitten home has started a large argument between me and my husband. Even though I don't intend to keep the kitten, I couldn't leave the poor thing outside to die. My husband says that I can't keep interrupting nature and to let it take its course but I just don't have the heart to leave the poor kitten outside to die. So reddit, AITA for bringing a kitten into my home and not letting nature do its thing? 

__________

UPDATE:

Thank you for the many responses. I know my husband can be pretty brutal at some points but he's not that way with me or our daughter. I knew that before I married him and he knew I had a soft spot for animals. Which is why we have the compromise that we have. And despite what he says, he does love pets. He just doesn't want to be responsible for them. So they tend to love me more because I feed, bath, train, ect them. Anyways, me and my husband talked and discussed everything. We're in a better spot now. I didn't realize I did wrong and I was able to apologize to him and reaffirm that the kitten was temporary. So thank you for opening my eyes.

As for the kitten, I am going to go meet someone today who wants to take her in. So she has a new home, a new momma who will care for her, and won't be taking a trip to the shelter. 

Again, thanks everyone.

UPDATE 2

I just dropped her off with her new mom. She already plans to take her to the vet and make sure she get the treatment she needs. And for those who asked, here is a picture of her.

1683,Asshole,"I am a 21 yo student in the US. A while back, I ordered a textbook, and it arrived Saturday, 8/3/19. Per an assignment, the book had to be read by 8/7/19. 

In the community where I live, there are 2 offices:

1.  The leasing office, which is for people looking to rent a place. This office is open 7 days a week from 8am to 5pm.
2. The residents office, which is for submitting maintenance requests, paying rent, and most relevant, picking up packages, which are left by delivery people. This office is only open Monday-Friday 8am to 5pm. 

These two offices are in the same building, and in adjacent rooms. That is, to get from one office to the other, one needs only go through a doorway (not an actual door). There are two entrances into the building, one for each office. The usual protocol for getting a package, which was explained when I moved in, is to go to the residents office, show your ID, and the receptionist walks over to a small shelf to retrieve your package.  

On Saturday 8/3/19, I got the notification that my package had arrived and went to the leasing office to pick it up, as the resident's office was closed. 

Me: Can I have my package, which arrived today?

R: I'm sorry, but you can only pick up packages from the resident's office on weekdays.

Me: I know, but it has a book I really need for school, and it's right there. (Again, the rooms are adjacent, and the receptionist wouldn't be inconvenienced by having get a key to unlock a door or anything)

R: I'm sorry sir, that's the policy.

Me: I know, but I have my ID, I just need my package.

R: There's nothing I can do, it's the policy.

Me: Why is that the policy?

R: I don't know, sir, I just can't get any packages that are in the resident's office.

Me: Fine, then I'll get it myself. 

From here on, I walk through the door, find my package on the shelf, clearly labelled with my name, take it, and leave. To her credit, the receptionist was polite and did not try to escalate the situation. She told me that I'd be hearing from management, and sure enough I got an email asking to see me. I went to the meeting and they essentially reprimanded me for going into the other office unauthorized. I explained the situation and they basically told me not to do it again, or they'd call the police for trespassing. I told them to get rid of the unnecessary rule that you can't pick up packages on the weekend. Even though there aren't any repercussions, the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth, and I want to know, AITA?

It all started a couple years ago with lula roe clothes (which I think looks incredibly trashy).  At first I didn’t care until it became package after package that got delivered and I noticed that it was more of a collection/ addiction.  She was spending hundreds of dollars a week on it and we fought daily about it.  Eventually I gave her the ultimatum of divorce or quitting entirely.  She chose me, or so I thought.  

It turns out she continued to buy things and hid the purchases from me.  Which, when I found out I told her we were done but gave her another chance.  

She gave up and stopped buying things for awhile from these sales until recently where she decided that it is ok again for her to start buying jewelry from there.

Now we do pretty well financially, and the purchases never put us behind on anything. She works and earns enough to be able to buy these things if she really wants them.  BUT, she literally has an entire dresser full of lularoe leggings and over 40 pearls that she doesn’t wear...  am I wrong for controlling her purchases and not letting her buy all these things impulsively from Facebook sellers, even though we can afford it?",26,59,0.87
1686,Not the A-hole,"So a couple months ago my aunt came from my native country to visit family here. She has visited many times before and stayed mostly in my family's household during her stays. Each time she has come, she has commented on my weight which is a sensitive topic for me. She has said things like ""if you lost just a little weight you'd be a lot prettier like your sister"" and ""if you ate just a little less you'd lose a little weight""

*For background knowledge, I have been overweight basically since I went through puberty. Since being bullied about in in middle school I have tried many different things to put the weight off, and the bullying made me depressed and anxious about my appearance. I am well aware that I am overweight, and I am in no denial of that whatsoever. However, when it comes to criticizing my appearance especially if I am making the effort to try to lose weight it irks me and also saddens me. I would also like to add that her comparison of me to my sister made me extremely upset because 1) she and I have different body types and metabolism rates 2) people would befriend me to get to my sister which added to my depression and anxiety so her comparison didn't help. 

Anyway, this time when she was here, I basically avoided her at all costs because I knew that my weight would come up, and she would suggest the diet that she was on to help me lose weight.
After she left, my mom scolded me for not attempting to spend more time with her, and said I made her feel unwelcome. I told my mom how she made me feel, and my mom said that it was no excuse for treating her the way I did. She added that she's family and implied that that basically gives her a get out of jail free card

I would also like to add that I'm pretty sure that she knows that her comments make me upset because I have gotten visibly upset and left the room before when she has said such things. 

So AITA for no attempting to spend more time with her because she made me uncomfortable? I've discussed with friends and coworkers with mixed responses, some saying that she was just trying to look out for me, and that our cultures are different so maybe she didn't understand that I was offended and hurt by what she said.

I’ve gotten pretty good with makeup. I also have a few small unpigmented patches on my chest, hips and legs but I usually cover it with clothing. I have a little on my fingers but it’s not that noticeable and I do put a bit of makeup on my hands to cover it up. 

I met a guy on Tinder and we connected really well. I didn’t mention my skin condition to him because honestly I was nervous and I still barely knew the guy. We went on a few dates that went well, I wore make up and clothes that covered any unpigmented areas and it never came up. On the fourth date I went back to his place and we were about to have sex. I took my clothes off and obviously he noticed some of the patches of unpigmented skin I had on my body but he didn’t say anything and we slept together. I later took the rest of my make up off and he acted completely startled  by how my face looked. I explained I had a skin condition and he accused me of hiding it and covering it up. I eventually left his place and he basically messaged me saying it was super weird how I didn’t tell him about my skin condition before having sex and I was “really deceptive” He then ghosted me. 

I obviously was heartbroken and told my friend about it expecting him to make me feel better and although he said he was a dick he said it was probably not a good idea to hide a skin condition like vitiligo and that if he were dating a girl and she just sprung it on him like that he would be a bit uncomfortable. 

My sister is on my side though and says I did nothing wrong.

1691,Asshole,"I took my dog Buster to the dog beach recently for the first time and he loved it. He was running around with other dogs and saying hi to people, so no aggro behavior. But there were a few groups of people who were sitting on blankets and had their bags on their blankets. Buster would run over their blankets and they seemed annoyed/aggravated by him and would keep trying to straighten their blankets, but then Buster would come rolling through again. He'd also go sniffing in their bags if they were open and the people would grab their bags in a huff. I did try to steer him away from these people, but it kept happening so we left early.

I'd like to take him again, but I know it'll happen again. I think it's unreasonable to expect excited dogs at a DOG BEACH to not invade your space when you're sitting on the ground. I wouldn't do that at a dog park and expect to be left alone.

[Tax](https://i.imgur.com/GTdWKaq.jpg)

Edit: thought I'd include some additional info.

1. The dog area is off-leash and is demarcated with cones and signs. The rules of the dog beach are 'good dog park etiquette'. Buster is very well behaved at the dog park, but the difference is at the dog park people are standing or sitting on benches, so there's much less opportunity for him to invade personal space. This was his first time at the beach and he didn't bother people outside of the designated area. The designated area was surround by the human-only area.

2. I should have been more clear, but I'm asking WIBTA if I went back and DIDN'T control him. I don't believe I was the asshole when we first went because I did call him away and redirect him to another area every time he would bother people. This happened 3 times with 3 different groups in a 20 minute span of time. Then he did it a 4th time to one of the same groups and that's when I decided to leave early because he was bothering people. I think I handled that situation appropriately.",98,62,0.79

I'm probably not going to do another outing with a group of people for a long time as this was very stressful for me to even go in the first place, but if I ever do again, I will make sure I ask about the appetizer situation. 


An acquaintance asked me and my 2 kids(3yo/6yo) if wanted to meet her out at the local pizza place. We get there and she's got her 2 kids (4yo/6yo), as well. She also invited another one of her friends along with her kids and the friend's mother. There is already an appetizer sitting on the table when I show up and the other friend and her kids are eating on it. I decided that I was going to get an appetizer for my kids and I to share. 

Our appetizer comes and I place the appetizer between my kids. The acquaintance's kids just start grabbing at out appetizer filling their small plates. The acquaintance starts filling hers with my food as well. My kids and I are left with barely any food. I told her kids, ""That was our food. You could have at least asked me for some. That's all we were going to eat for dinner."" The acquaintance just kind of awkwardly laughed. Being left with very little food between the 3 of us and still hungry, I go ahead and order a 10 inch thin crust cheese pizza to split between myself and my kids. Pizza comes and her kids once again grab at the pizza and take some. Leaving my kids with only 1 slice and I gave up my portion to make sure my kids weren't left hungry.  I just look at the mom with disgust. The kicker, her kids didn't even eat the pieces they took! Just ripped it apart and gnawed on it.  I am angry at this point and they can tell. I asked for the bill and everyone is asking why I'm leaving so eary. I told them I was upset they tore into the food we ordered and didn't even give them a chance to say anything. We just left. 

When I got home, I asked my husband about it. He said it's customary to share your appetizer with the table and pizza is always fair game for everyone, especially if kids are involved. He said I'm the asshole and a greedy one at that. AITA for not wanting to share the food I ordered with the whole table?

My perspective:

So we had Mexican food last night and I had leftover nachos. I warmed them up early today, ate some, and then left the rest of them out on the table. I was doing dishes and she was throwing some things in the trash. She yells over ""are you done with these nachos?"" so I say ""yeah!"". Big mistake. After I'm done dishes I see that she THREW OUT my nachos, when I thought she just asked if I was done with them for the moment. I was still gonna eat them later! 

Her perspective: 

This is dumb because I'm clearly not the asshole LOL. BF knew I was  throwing things in trash. Also there were only like 3 chips left, and some nasty crusty leftover ground beef. The nachos had also been out for hours so they were going in the trash anyways. But I still had the courtesy to ask if he was done and he said yes. This is the same guy who was found to be TA for harassing a kid on Minecraft so you guys be the judge. I also told him not to post this because it isn't high quality and he demanded that it be done so he's double TA here.

My neighbor’s lawn service was out at 6:30AM with lawnmowers going, causing my dogs to go crazy and waking me on my day off.

My neighbor has asked me in the pass not to be working in my shed or garage after 7:00 pm, because he is afraid, I will wake his kids. I really think it has nothing to do with kids but everything to do with he wants peace and quiet while he relaxes when he gets home.

I finished a 15 sub-cabinet yesterday was going to take it to my friend’s tomorrow to tune it before the bike rally in a few weeks.

My daughter (15) has been friends with this girl (16) for nearly 6 years. She has basically been adopted into the girls's family. Despite them knowing each other for so long, I haven't really gotten to know the girl. All I know is from what my daughter says and from what the friend posts on social media. My daughter's friend is really good to her, bringing her to movies, taking her out to eat, inviting her on family trips, etc. They hang out a lot and my daughter always seems happier after talking to her. The only problem is the friend's recent actions.

The friend has recently been indulging in some reckless behaviour: smoking pot, drinking alcohol, and dating an older guy (above the age of 20 who has been shown doing hard drugs in online posts). I learn about this from the countless posts the friend makes online. I know that my daughter has hung out with her friend when she was with the older man, and apparently he is a nice guy even though he is into drugs and is willing to date a minor (the age of consent where I'm from is 16, but I still find it inappropriate for a guy above 20 to be dating a 16 year old).

My daughter is a good kid, I trust her not to do anything bad but I know how teenagers are and how many of them will experiment with things like alcohol and drugs. I do not want her to be introduced to this lifestyle at such a young age. I believe preventing her from this would mean I would have to stop her from seeing her friend.

WIBTA if I make her stop being friends with her best friend?

I would hope my daughter would respect my wishes and that I wouldn't have to actually prevent her from communicating with her friend after I tell her not to, but I would take away her means of communication if I learned that she was still messaging her friend.

For some background, the gym isn’t the biggest but it’s the most reasonably priced within my local area it’s also short walk from my workplace and many other offices. Because of this factor, the gym is extremely busy from 5-7pm on week nights. 

Today, I was in the gym and went towards what I thought to be a free bench press. There was still weights on each side of  the barbell, so I visibly had a quick glance around to see if anyone was using it and come to the conclusion that someone had just not bothered taking the weights off each side, annoying but no big deal. 

I sit down to start my set when a guy stands over me, then tells me he was already here and would be no longer than 5 minutes. Again no big deal, I assumed he just went for water etc and had just got back. Fine, I move. 

He then goes back to using the free weights and a bench. Now I understand during quiet periods people do occasionally use multiple machines at once but this gym is packed. 

This is where I’m unsure if I became the asshole, but fuck that guy I’m using the bench I went and sat back down. He didn’t notice for around a few minutes, but quickly went out his way and  asked me to move once he noticed. I explained it was busy, I wanted to finish my set before leaving which I did.

1707,Not the A-hole,"I’m an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don’t need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn’t give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

Even though I’m a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She’d obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. 

For the last six months I’ve been having my 30 mins ‘meditating’ out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have ‘meditative time’ and it’s causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and ‘ruining it’ for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them.

We are at a beach resort with a decent water slide. Today we decided to sit by the pool all day. My wife hit the margaritas early and was super buzzed by about 1:30. She was being super flirty and wanted to test how fast her bare butt in her new cheeky bikini would go down the slide. So she was laughing and giggling the whole way over the slide and up the stairs. 

I went first so I could wait for her in the bottom pool. She came down the last corner and was doing the ""white girl wasted"" woooooooo and kept it going until she splashed in the pool. She splashed in and popped up out of the water and her top was completey gone. Again she did ""wooooooo"" so to all the parents and kids in the line and in little pool thought my wife was showing  her bare boobs on purpose and as happy as can be. I started laughing my ass off and she actually popped under the water, popped up and did wooooo again. I was trying to get through my laughter and tell her top was gone. 

The top had sort of dissapeared into the all the little currents at the bottom of the slide and the life guard had to call to the top to stop more people from coming down so the whole area was silent as they watched us both try to find her top in the little pool. I was still laughing hysterically and she started to get more and more mad at me. We found the top and a nice mom had come over with a towel and sort of wrapped my wife up so she could go to the bathroom and put her top on. 

Edit: lots of people interpreting That I didn't help and just stood there. I was in the pool trying to find her top since it had disappeared in the swirling water at the bottom of the slide. She was trying to do it with one arm since the other arm was covering her boobs. I figured that was the best way to help since the entire slide was shut down staring at her until the top was found.

As the lady left my wife gritted her teeth and said ""it's sad as fuck when a stranger knows what to do as your husband is laughing at you. Fucking asshole."" She stormed off the bathroom and took forever and I realized after about 20 minutes she had gone and locked herself in our room.

She won't let me in and is legit mad at me. I didn't mean any harm or disrespect, it was just a funny thing to me. Was I the asshole?

Mom wanted to take a nap, so I took the kids to Best Buy to browse, went to five below to get a dollar bag of mixed candy, and then to Barnes and Noble to look around at books. 

It's triple digits outside so walking between stores is manageable for me but quite hot for the kids. We decided to take a break at the Starbucks cafe inside the B&N.

I get them juice, they eat their candy.

My kids were using indoor voices (at least by toddler parent standards) and it didn't seem that loud. It's the middle of the afternoon, 4pm. We are seated 13 ft (I counted the floor tiles) from the counter.

As I'm discussing candy and toddler things with my kids, I notice a woman about 10ft away is staring at me. Not glaring just staring. I look at her, she smiles but I get the feeling were bothering her but she's too polite to say anything. She's reading a large book, maybe a textbook/workbook. 

AITA for sitting down with my kids in a B&N Starbucks. Is there an expectation of relative silence that I've violated?

Edit: To clarify why I think we were bothering her. She was looking at us, and although what many of you have said could be true: zoning out in our general direction I don't think this to be the case. 

Her table was positioned perpendicular to ours 10ft away to my 1 o'clock. We on the other hand were at her 4-5 o'clock so she was definitely turned about 120 degrees to her right to look at us. 

From the time I sat down with the kids' juice boxes till I made eye contact with her (about 1-2 minutes) her body remain in that position as observed in my peripheral vision, which is what eventually cued me to look directly at her.

It is an older photo of me. I went on a diet and am now about 30 pounds slimmer than I was in the picture, and no longer have the prominent moustache that I do in the photo. Additionally, for whatever reason (lighting maybe), I look a bit darker/tanner and more Hispanic (I’m half) in my ID photo than I usually appear. But since my diet/moustache shaving, I’ve used that exact ID literally *hundreds* of times with no problem. Somehow, everyone prior has had the facial recognition to connect the man in the ID photo and myself. What’s this guy’s problem?

I argued with the bartender for a long time, but he stood his ground and refused to give it back. As my friends drank their beers, I (who am personally very active on social media) made a Facebook post and a Tweet about the incident, telling people how they stole my driver’s license, warning people not to go there, and calling them a “shady shithole.” In both of my posts, I tagged the bar’s official Facebook page/Twitter handle so that when people search for the bar, my posts will pop up first thing.

I asked for the manager, and he sided with the bartender. I continued arguing, and told him about the posts. Finally, I gave the manager an ultimatum: if give me my ID back, I will delete my posts ASAP, will leave, and will put this incident and the drama associated with it 100% in the past. “I swear, give my ID back and it’ll be over. No hard feelings. I’ll be out of your hair.” I showed him on my phone the number of responses/likes I’d already received, emphasized how much it could damage his business.

Eventually, he sighed and conceded. “If you promise you’ll get rid of those posts, and this whole thing is going to be over, then fine.” I reaffirmed my promise, and he gave me back my ID finally, and apologized for what he said was “an unfortunate misunderstanding.” I could tell that he still didn’t believe my ID was legit, but didn’t want his bar to receive too much negative publicity online.

I didn’t delete my posts, though. By the time I woke up the next morning, they’d received a ton more attention, and I saw I’d received a private message on Facebook from the company’s page. “Hey there, bud,” it read. “Remember our agreement? You promised you’d remove these posts. I got you your ID back and we’re sorry about the incident, can you please make sure we put this in the past as we agreed upon?”

I responded to his message, “Fuck you,” and blocked him immediately afterwards. After that, I typed up a formal complaint about the incident and sent it to his chain manager (it’s part of a chain of 3 bars in my state). Was I an asshole for this?",1203,5930,0.95
1715,Not the A-hole,"So, this was a year ago but has been bugging me. 

About 2 years ago I started working at an office, met a lot of cool people, got along pretty well with my coworkers. One of whom decided to adopt a puppy. The puppy was 8 months old at the time of this story.

Coworker decided to go on a week long vacation but was lamenting that dog boarding would cost $400 and she hadn’t prepped for that expense. I heard this, spoke to my husband, and we agreed that is the pup was housebroken she could stay with us. We’ve dogsat before without any issues, our pup loves other dogs so we thought it would be fine.

The day comes, pup is dropped off and immediately peed on the floor. I’m not happy but figure new environment + new friends = excitement pee. It was not excitement pee. She peed on everything that day, our floors, couches, our dog. Everything. By day 3 my husband and I were losing our minds. She never stopped peeing. Our dog was a year old and fully house trained, so we had no idea what to do. We tried longer walks more frequently - the dog didn’t pee outside. My husband took the dogs on a 6 hour hike - she peed as soon as she was indoors. 

For the record: my husband and I worked different hours so the dogs were in their crates for maybe 4 hours a day. He would come home to pee leaking out of her crate. Our house reeked. She would destroy any puppy pad so those were no help.

Coworkers asked how it was going and I was honest with them, they all started telling me that the owner has a history with adopting terrible dogs, making them worse, and giving them back.

The week finally ended and I’m losing my damn mind. I never wanted a dog gone so badly. I’ve still never had such a terrible experience dog sitting. I tell my coworker what went down and she blows me off, says I was getting the pup too riled up and it was excitement pee + me not taking her out enough. 

Work got tense, home life got tense because out carpets smelled like piss. Finally I work up the courage to ask coworker for $100 so we can rent a carpet cleaner. Guys, you’d think I had asked to murder her dog. She tore into me that I was supposed to save her money from dog boarding and I can’t just ask for money after the fact.

I gave birth to my daughter three months ago. It was by no means an easy birth, not as tough as some but I was definitely emotionally and physically depleted for the first couple of months. I was (and am still) reeling from having lost my mom two months prior to that. 

Without my mom in my life, I have no close, local family who were equipped to come by and help us at all since the birth. What family members we do have, and our small community of friends, have all made sure to reach out, to wish us well, and to try to help out in ways that made sense from afar. An Uber Eats gift card, a package of diapers from Amazon, that kind of thing.  We also had a nice baby shower that my mom threw for us right before she passed that helped set us up with the things we needed.

My brother texts me occasionally, maybe once every week or two for a brief chat. But he never asks about my daughter, instead it's just casual stuff he is interested in that we have always talked about, like football. I probably asked him to FaceTime with us a dozen times so he could see her in real time, but he always puts it off. He hasn't sent any kind of token or gift for the baby. 

I don't expect him to visit, I know that travel is tough for someone with his job and is expensive, and he was just here for our mom's funeral. But I feel like doing something to mark that he has a new relative, his closest living relative besides myself, would be kind of the normal and appropriate thing to do.

So the other day after getting rejected again for a video chat request I just asked point blank if there was something wrong with him, because it seemed like he didn't care much about the fact that he's an uncle now. He tried to play it off but when I pointed out that he could have at least sent a token gift for his niece he seized on that and made it seem like I was being materialistic. I really don't care if he spends a dime on her, I just want to give him some way to show that he cares more than an Instagram like's worth about my family, about me, about her.

I do think it kinda sucks that all of our (my and current gf's) mutual friend will be their with their SO's, but it's not my call who gets invited.

Well, my girlfriend got upset when she found out and said that I was basically throwing her under the bus for this. I asked her why she would want to go to a wedding where she wasn't wanted anyway and she said it wasn't about wanting to go, it was about me not sticking up for her when the couple talked me. I didn't want to start drama with my friends or add to their stress when they're getting married, and while I do want my gf there I don't think I'll change their minds about her.

1722,Not the A-hole,"About a month ago my bf asked if his friend from out of town could stay over for a couple days and I said yes. So the next day his friend shows up while I’m at work. When I get home I greet the friend (who I’ve never met before). I then proceed to go to the bedroom where I change out of my work clothes and throw on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts with no bra. I never wear a bra at home as I find them immensely uncomfortable and hate them with a burning passion. I then go out to the living room to join them. As I’m sitting down the friend makes a comment, something along the lines of “dude, put on a bra”. I figure he’s joking since he kinda laughed before he said it so I just brush it off. He doesn’t bring it up again for the rest of that visit. 

Fast forward a few weeks and my bf wants to have his friend over again. So his friend comes over and this time I’m home when he gets dropped off.  I was not wearing a bra when he arrived. I would like to point out that I was wearing a rather baggy T-shirt so it wasn’t as if you could really see anything. That being said I do have enormous titties (I wear a size 40I bra). Immediately after walking in the door the friend says in an exasperated tone “I thought I asked you last time to please wear a bra!!”  I’m taken aback and I don’t really know what to say. I kind of stammer our a “what,why?” 

Him: I feel really uncomfortable seeing your boobs 
Me: But you can’t actually see my boobs 
Him: Are you kidding me? They’re huge! Of course I can see them! 
Me: Dude, I’m wearing a baggy shirt. At most you can see a bit of an outline. I don’t understand what about that makes you uncomfortable. 
Him: you’re joking right??
Me: No...? 
Him: fucking unbelievable

I look to my bf for help and he  kinda just shrugs at me. So I excuse myself to the bedroom. A little while later my bf comes into the bedroom to see if I’m ok. I tell him I’m fine, just a bit taken aback. He asks if I wanna come play video games with them in the living room and I agree. Before we’re out of the bedroom though he turns around and tells me that maybe I should put on a bra.  I had explained to him before how I felt about bras. He said he understood but didn’t want to make his friend uncomfortable. I was annoyed and told him I would just stay in the bedroom. So for the rest of his friend’s stay I stayed in the bedroom and only went out to go to the bathroom, get food, or go to work. 

So finally his friend leaves and everything is back to normal. Then last night out of nowhere my bf brings up the bra thing again. He tells me I should’ve just sucked it up and put on a bra and that I was kind of being an asshole about it. I feel like I should be allowed to not wear a bra in my home but also I wonder if I should’ve been more accommodating to a guest that’s very important to my bf.

1723,Not the A-hole,"So I know through a non profit I volunteer at a very nice family, or I thought they were nice. Their young daughter needed a kidney and was not high on the transplant list. Her dialysis and medications and such were drastically affecting her quality of life but because she wasn’t actively in the process of dying she wasn’t a super high priority for a stranger transplant.

Rather than delay her going to college for potentially years the family started reaching out to the community to see if they could get one from there.

I enter the picture.

I’m not in a good place at the moment. Jobless, drowning in student loan debt, depressed, etc. I decided to get tested and I was a match. I thought that if I can’t make much of my own life I might as well improve someone else’s. It’s just a kidney after all.

The family was obviously grateful and delighted that there was a match who was willing to be a donor for their daughter. When the dad asked me if they could do anything for me I asked for a job, any job at all from janitor to receptionist, at the father’s small business. 

I DID NOT make it a conditional. That’s highly frowned upon by the authorities who handle transplants. I just said “if you want to thank me you can give me a job, whatever job you can, after I recover.” 

Weeeeellll that did not go over well.

The dad got in my face telling me that I was extorting them, holding a kidney over their head and demanding payment for it. The mom got all mad that I couldn’t just donate out of the goodness of my heart, etc. The only one on my side was the daughter who needed the kidney. 

I withdrew my offer pretty quick. I guess that reinforced their belief that I was making it a conditional. In reality it was because of how hostile they became in response to what I believe to be a very reasonable request. 

Had they been polite and said “we really can’t afford to hire new staff” or “we don’t think it’s a good idea to do that, we don’t want people to think you sold your kidney for a job” I woulda shrugged and gone through with it. But because they decided to be hostile I backed out. 

Because the daughter was not about to die I knew I wasn’t signing her death certificate by withdrawing. I just no longer felt inspired to help them.

Now I know that I might be the asshole by putting them in awkward situation by even asking, and might still be an asshole for withdrawing. 

TL;DR AITA for asking for a job from a potential kidney recipient’s family and then withdrawing once they got nasty?",562,1681,0.97
1724,Not the A-hole,"I am a college student taking summer classes, on an urban campus, and I had two final exams on Friday. One right after the other, all the way across campus. I was worried I'd be late to the second because of how far I'd have to go; so I planned ahead by finding the most direct route to run from one to the other.

I tend to stress a lot about exams and academic stuff, and this exam week was no exception.

On Friday, I took the first test, and then had to get to the second. I put on the playlist i always use to hype myself up for exams, and started  speedwalking across campus. Halfway there, I realized i was potentially going to be late regardless, so I started to flat-out sprint. I'm a runner and I'm quite fast so I was really making good time. 

Part of my route took me through a small park area that's in the middle of campus, and I just sprinted in, with kind of tunnel vision with my eyes on the other side of the park where the exam hall was. I remember upon entering the park,I ran by people in blue Polo-shirts and assumed they were campus tour guides, who also wear blue. Halfway through the park, I noticed a lot of really well dressed rich looking people staring at me but I didn't overthink it even though, in second thought, they were super out of place in campus.

Then I felt a hand grab my upper arm, and I wrenched away and ripped off my headphones. There was a guy who looked like a private security guard, he was asking me what I was doing. And whether I'd heard him yelling. I said going to my exam, and I hadn't heard a thing. He said the park was closed for a private function, and I said OK, I've really got to get going, I'm going to be late for my exam.

He said that he needed me to come with him, they'd need to ask me a few questions. And I was panicking feeling anxious about starting my exam late, so I pulled a business card out and said that my info was there, and I needed to go to the exam. Then, and this might be stupid, I ran. I booked it through the rest of the park and got into the exam hall, and lost him in there. 

I got out of my exam and took the back door out, and went back to my dorm and told my roommates about my day. And they both thought it was really shitty of me to run in through what was actually some alumni's wedding reception. There was some rich alumni who had given the school a lot of money to have their wedding on campus in that park.

I thought it was crazy that they'd do that during exams and block off the whole front of a major exam hall. And have security that would grab a person, even though private security is Not allowed to do that in my area.

1727,Not the A-hole,"As a quick background I have a few issues with sex, the first being that I have HSV2 (genital herpes) which is one of the reasons why I don't ever do casual sex. I've also not had the best experience in the past, though nothing particularly traumatic it's made me put up a few boundaries, so I only have sex when I'm in an exclusive serious relationship.  


Anyway, I've been seeing this guy and it's been going well. We met at a party and have been on 5 dates over about 3 weeks. We'd very very briefly talked about going home together at the end of our 2nd date and id told him I wasn't ready for that and it didn't come up again until I told him.  


At the end of the 5th date I'd decided to tell him and have a conversation about it all. He didn't take it super well, he wasn't rude or anything but he did seem very angry. He was upset I hadn't told him sooner and said I should have been up front so he didn't have to waste his time. He told me he'd cancelled a couple of things so he could see me and felt a bit cheated. I get him not wanting to continuing seeing me but I don't feel like I did anything wrong by waiting.  


When I told the handful of friends that know they were pretty divided. A couple of people said that since this stuff is a pretty obvious deal breaker I should be upfront before getting involved and invested in someone.  


My argument is that it's very personal and I like to feel comfortable before I tell people, 3 weeks isn't a long time to get to know someone. Me and the guy also have a friends in common so I'd also have to be trusting him not to tell anyone else and since we never got close to having sex it was my right to wait till I was comfortable.


So, AITA?

1728,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year. She were talking over dinner and I said I really want to have kids and she’s going to be a really great mom someday and that’s one of the reasons I like her. She didn’t take the compliment well. She freaked out at me and told me I had no right to assume what she wants to do with her life. She then accused me of ALWAYS (not true but she said it) treating her “ like a madonna” and not a whole person. I tried to explain my comment and to tell her that I’m only praising part of her, not all of her, and she just kept telling me she didn’t want to hear it.

Then she said “I’m getting up and walking away and I don’t want to continue this right now.” I touched her arm as she was going to try to get her to stay and work it out. She lost her mind.

1731,Not the A-hole,"Ok, I'll get right to it:

My husband (29M) has a habit of reactionarily assigning ownership to me (27F) of things that cause him pain/distress, when expressing frustration in the moment. For example: 

1.	He slipped down the stairs one morning and screamed ""I hate your f****** socks!"" (In reference to the new socks I had bought him the week prior). 
2.	He couldn't figure out how to turn off HIS alarm in the morning and yelled ""see, this is why I hate your f****** alarm!"" (The alarm I research and purchased for him a year ago...LONG story here, that he has not taken care to learn how to operate. Also fun fact - it was his iPad going off, not the alarm).
3.	When our cat does something that pisses him off, like poop outside the litter box, throw up, lay on the stairs and cause him to trip, he yells something like ""Your f****** cat [fill in the blank]"". (Background: This is a cat that I did pick out from the animal shelter to replace ours that passed away. We've had him for three years, along with our other one for 6, and I guess I've always considered them ""ours""...)

There are other instances of this happening, of which I can't recall specifics of right now. The gist you need is that **nothing is *mine* until it causes him to get upset.**

I have no problem with him getting upset. If I fell down the stairs, or the cat threw up, I would probably say ""I hate these socks!"" Or ""Dammit the cat threw up!"" What bothers me is that he continually makes me the owner of the source of the frustration.

I've tried explaining this so many times - that it hurts me when it feels like I'm being blamed for his pain when all I'm doing in the situation is rushing to comfort and help him. He responds that I shouldn't be getting mad and because he's heated in the moment. My response is that it hurts me that his first knee-jerk reaction is to blame me (or at least it feels like blame).

Today it caused us to get in a fight in which after several attempts (being interrupted the whole while) to again explain why him saying things like this hurt me, and immediately getting my feelings dismissed and explained away, I yelled and called him an asshole (which I am not proud of). He walked away and asked if I was on my period, which made me even more upset. He returned five minutes later and asked if I was ready to apologize, to which I said ""no"". In later conversation, he felt that me calling him an asshole was worse than anything he did, because I was intentional and wanted to hurt him, whereas his harm was unintentional. He even said that **intent** is what determines guilt in a court of law, as a reasoning why my intentional comment was more hurtful than his unintentional ones.

If this was one argument, it wouldn't bother me. But it's nearly EVERY time, and his excuse of ""in the moment"" is BS to me. I'm sick of trying to express my feelings and frustrations, and him interrupting, not listening, and instead telling me how I should feel and act when he's upset and says these things.

1734,Everyone Sucks,"Me and my best friend have been friends for about 11 years now. His parents never like me because of my race, they also thought I was a bad influence on him even though I never did anything wrong. His brothers and sister were cool with me.. 

So we we're really huge fans of yu-gi-oh and we always played or talked about it in some shape or form. In a conversation we had about ""If we can be buried with a card which will it be?"" we both said ""Monster reborn"" at the same time as a joke but we ended up seriously talking about it and both agreed that if something happens to either of us the other would fulfill the request.
Sadly my friend died recently and its was my duty to fulfill this pact we had. The upsetting part of all of this is his parents didn't let me say a word at the wake or funeral and frankly didn't want me there at all. I asked them nicely if I can place the memento (the card) that their son wish to have buried with him. They started the belittle me and insulting me about this ridiculous request. After years of this I had enough and yelled at them saying theyre full of hate and all I did was love their son like a brother. 

I ended up making a scene and disrupted the funeral. Some of our other friends convinced me that it will be best if we just leave and get something eat. Right before we left my best friends sister approached me angrily and said I shouldn't have done that but understands, She than asked for the ""card"" and said she'll make sure it’s with buried with him, I hugged her and thanked her for making his request possible.

Few of my friends said that Im an asshole for ruling the funeral and making it about me. Few said that it was ok because funerals make people emotional but idk. I can honestly say I don’t regret anything I did though

The day after we were cuddling and joking around as usual, like nothing happened. We were snuggled on the couch watching TV and she smiled and said “I have a homework assignment for you.” 

I didn’t know what was coming, so I smiled too and said, “Oh yeah?” 

“Yes. I’m going to give you a worksheet. You’re going to fill out five goals, five dreams, five reasons I fit in to your goals and dreams and five reasons I don’t. I want to discuss in two days”

I was visibly annoyed and said no, that was ridiculous (again I know I’m an asshole for this, Ive since apologized for calling her suggestion ridiculous).

1739,Not the A-hole,"I lived with my parents rent-free after high school. I was very blessed that they allowed me to do so, while I attended college. I offered to pay rent, because I was working part-time and they always told me no, to save my money and to focus on my studies.

Eventually, I graduated and got an apartment with a few other people. I became close with one of my roommates we’ll call, Vanessa. I will say that she grew up in a much stricter household than I did and so to her, my parents are lot more “relaxed” than hers. My mom and I are more friends now that I’m an adult, so we talk to each other that way and Vanessa makes comments about that, because she would never talk to her own mother in that sense. I’ve tried to explain it, but she doesn’t get it. So, I let it go.

One thing Vanessa always tried to make me feel weird about however, was that I lived rent-free after I graduated from high school, living in my parents’ home. She said she paid rent at her mom’s and that I was spoiled. I mostly ignored it, but there were times I did get defensive because it’s not like I could help it. My parents made the rules, not me. And to make it clear, she is trying to make me feel weird about it and isn’t just pointing out differences, she thinks it was wrong that I didn’t have to.

Then the other day we were talking about gifts and Vanessa mentioned that when she moved out, her mom had given her all the money she had paid in rent back. I asked if she knew she was doing that and Vanessa said yes, it was to help her save it. I said, so you weren’t really paying rent, you were really moreso budgeting with your mom.  I saved probably the same amount (she told me what it was) by not paying rent to my parents. We just called it different things. She tried to make excuses, but I said, “No, you’ve made me feel like crap since I met you for not paying rent to my folks, but you really didn’t do the same either.” She tried to justify it again and I said while she didn’t have the money, mine was in a savings account untouched as well. Which she knew this time as well. I told her that she had no right to judge me not paying rent, when she essentially got all of hers back.

We’re not fighting and I’m not even mad about it anymore, but she keeps trying to justify it ever since I called her out on it, even though I don’t bring it up. Like the other day I was collecting the money to pay the rent for our place and she was like “You know about my mom and I’s situation…” and I just shut her down because I’m not interested. I said I’m not mad at her, but she can’t ever call me “spoiled” or say I was in the wrong for not paying rent again. She said I’m being an ass about it. Am I?",86,1104,0.97

We've been living there for a year and a couple of months now and we had a good relationship with the owner.

That was until 3 months ago when my roomate started dating and started bringing her boyfriend around. At first he would only visit so it wasn't a big deal, then he started sleeping over, then spending a day and day turned into weeks and now he is pretty much living with us. The owner realized what was happening very quickly and came to talk to me saying that if he doesn't leave she won't be rennovating our lease. She said she had tried reaching out to my roomate but she had been ignored. I told this to my roomate and she got very angry saying that they both had a right to live there since she paid rent and he had been buying stuff for the house too and that the terms of the lease were discriminatory bullshit.

This rubbed me the wrong way because she had willingly signed the lease not once but twice now and never made any objections about the rules of the place. Not only this but I don't want to leave this house because it's close to where I work and it's a nice neighborhood. My roomate believes that once our lease is done I will be moving out with her and her boyfriend to a different place since they both can't afford most of the places they've been to by themselves.

My entire family is pretty athletic except for my youngest brother and his wife and son. My nephew is 8 years old and is terribly, terribly obese. He has joint issues on his knees, has that classic overweight knock knees stance, he’s cried miserable tears to me in private before because he has to wear enormous basketball shirts and nothing else which he hates, etc.

I’m always trying to get him into physical activity, I’ve privately spoken to his parents because he feels left onto of his cousins games because they’re all so much more mobile, etc. However they are feeders and I’ve personally seen them buy and feed him things that should feed a family of 4 and he’s able to demolish it in one go. 

When we go on these camps we usually go for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, and this time I made sure. I was way more active in the food prep so I could monitor what he ate. He’s my favorite nephew and I felt he deserves way more than this. 

I swapped out his sodas for la croix, when it was breakfast time I loaded the kid up on bacon eggs and sausage but I held back the toast and maple syrup, and when it was smores time I made sure he had some s’mores but I made them up myself with less chocolate and graham crackers and more strawberry and marshmallow. 

Stuff like that. 

Now my nephew is so big that I didn’t SEE a difference, but I kept asking him how he felt every day and the one thing I wanted more for him than anything else- he told me he felt awesome and he was actually for the first time in his life running around with his peers! He would sweat like a lil grubby booger and need to take time out but he could actually PLAY without being in tears from pain.

Two days ago I had a part for friends and some of them brought a +1. My friend Jake (name changed) brought a girl with him. They're not romantically involved, just friends according to him. They both drove their own cars.

So we have a great night until another of my friends tells me this girl was upstairs. I don't know what anyone is even doing on the second floor of my house, period. That's not normal party etiquette, yeah?

I got two cameras: one facing the back door, and one in my bedroom. I excused myself to go into the basement and check the security DVR and found her snooping through my jewellery cabinet in my bedroom.

I pulled her aside and asked her what she was doing in my bedroom and she said she was just looking around at my beautiful house. I called bullshit and said I saw her in my jewellery. I don't know if she stole anything but it seemed like it. She suddenly had to leave in an awful hurry, so I stopped her.

I decided to not let her drive away. She's free to walk home, at night, in the rain, and I wouldn't let her take her car unless she agreed to empty her purse and pockets. If she wasn't comfortable with me doing it, I'd be glad to have an officer come down and do it instead.

She didn't hesitate and just walked away in the rain. Her car is still in my driveway two days later, blocked by my car behind her. She ghosted my friend Jake on all social media.

My wife believes birthdays should be private and should be shared with just our immediate family (wife and kids).

She scheduled my daughter's birthday party (her 4th) this year a week after my daughter's actual birthday so that we could have a private birthday for her. My mother informed us when she was visiting for my son's birthday (his 1st) that she intended on staying two weeks so she could be present for my daughter's actual birthday.

My wife believes she's been disrespected. That (1) she should have asked if she could stay two weeks and (2) she's frustrated that she has to share our children's special day with my parents.

We see my folks twice, maybe three times a year for a maximum of 10 days or so. My wife lost her dad to cancer about 10 years ago so she may be particularity sensitive to family events and their importance.

Am I the asshole for not caring whether my parents are around? I see their visits as an addition to the fun, not a subtraction. I do take my wife's point that she would like to to have an intimate day with the kids--but things aren't always ideal. I live 1.200 away from my hometown. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made. Perhaps I'm not being considerate enough of my wife's feelings.

Reddit could you help me work through this? I have a few days to wave off my mom from making the trip so I need feedback ASAP.

should I be setting boundaries with my parents? Am I the asshole for depriving my wife from having intimate birthdays with her kids?

I appreciate the advice. I'm totally fine being the ass hole on this one if I am. I need some perspective. Thanks guys.

Edit: Points of clarification: My parents stay at my place when they visit. They do not generally stay two weeks at a time. We see each other 1-3 times a year for a few days for a total of 10 days or so. They did field their visit with us for both kids birthday parties this year (but for 5 days each).

My mother sprung the extra week on us while visiting for my son's birthday (probably because she'd think we wouldn't mind). I didn't field the visit with my wife because we were all in the same room when my mother told us--I just put on an agreeable face and said ""great"".

1751,Not the A-hole,"I took my dog out for her morning walk around the park across from my apartment complex around 5:30 this morning. The street I live on is lined with a few different apartment complexes and a bunch of houses. Anyway, as we are walking around I hear people having sex. Loud sex, like fake porn loud.. So I look around thinking someone was in the park. There was a couple walking their dog in the park that could hear them as well and left the park because of the sounds.
Turns out it was a couple in a mini van parked on the street with the windows down, completely naked having sex in the front seat. I yelled to them ""Hey people can hear you!"" thinking maybe they were just dumb/drunk and oblivious. They kept going. So I walked up to the van and said ""Hey, nobody wants to see that."" The girl seriously looked at me, laughed and went back to bouncing away. She managed to get louder. Like obviously they wanted people to watch them and dgaf people saw. So I called the police. My street is pretty busy, we have a lot of joggers and dog walkers that time of day and that's when people start heading to work. If it was like 2-3 in the morning and they were being discreet, or really even if they were being discreet at 5;30 in the morning, I'd just have ignored it but the whole thing was trashy as fuck.

Anyway AITA for calling police on people openly having loud sex on a public street at 5:30 in the morning?",113,200,0.92
1752,Not the A-hole,"Update: Thanks everyone for their input. I'll try to answer the one later today. I have decided to stand up for myself and tell my parents today I want this change to happen. I'm not doing this to hurt my dad. But I think I deserve to feel like I have a home like they do.

End update

My parents got divorced when I was 7. I'm 14 now. For the past three years I've been doing a week at my mom's and a week at my dad's.

My dad spent a lot of money to get this arrangement. No one even asked me what I wanted.

Well I officially hate this schedule. I hate that I have pack all my stuff every goddamn week.

I don't feel like I fit in with both families. They all get to stay in one place and be happy and I feel like I'm just visiting them.

I don't have anything against my dad. He's a good dad. But I want to stay full time in one spot. I also prefer my mom's house because there aren't little kids (my 5 year old stepsister).

I guess the crappy part is my dad just bought a new house so all the kids could get their own room. I mean, I got the worst room but I guess it's the thought that counts.

Also, if I stay with Mom full time, my dad will have to pay a lot more money to my mom. This is because my mom doesn't get paid much but my stepdad makes a lot. My dad does make as much money as them.

I told my dad last week and he's really upset. And he's accusing my mom of brainwashing me, which makes me even more pissed off.

1754,Not the A-hole,"By reporting, I'm referring to choosing ""My driver was unprofessional"" in the feedback section.

I (24f) can't tell if I should because I've never loved socializing with strangers so maybe my radar is off. I'm usually open to some small talk with Uber drivers and in my years of taking Ubers/Lyfts, this is probably the 2nd time I started feeling uncomfortable; I get the sense that most drivers know that I'm not interested in having long conversations. I'm also very non-confrontational in most settings. I'm awful at ignoring people, so I'm sure I came across as a little terse but overall friendly since I smile/laugh easily, especially when I'm nervous.

Anyway: 10pm and working late in the office, so calling an Uber home (it's a 10 minute drive). Driver pulls up and the first thing I notice when getting in the car is that his seat is very far back - this allowed him to keep turning around and get physically close to me despite my being in the back passenger seat. Whatever, I thought it was his driving preference. Over the course of 10-12 minutes, he asked: why I was out so late, where I'm really ~from~ (I'm ethnically Korean), if I made good money, where my parents live, what I do for fun, if I had kids, if I'm married. Every single time, he turned around and leaned forward towards me. I was giving short answers, and had airpods in the entire ride. He ended the ride by asking if I had an Instagram he could follow, and I said, ""Nope! I know, kinda weird of me to not have, but bye.""

I don't want to mess with someone's job or anything, but I can't imagine this is appropriate driver conduct - asking pretty personal questions, leading into ""let's hit on this passenger"" territory.

1756,Not the A-hole,"It's kinda a two fold issue, one half from my mom, the other from my dad. Also: Throwaway account.

The context: Early this year I started working full time. I had a job lined up after college and I make good money. Enough so that I started, voluntarily, paying 1K monthly for food, rent, and small favors (The fact that I no longer do as many chores around the house basically). I make enough money that I can easily pay my other bills (car, student loans, gas, etc). My main reason for continuing to stay at home where so that I can get some money in savings and be able to help my family out financially (my dad's business has been struggling for years). My secondary reason is I honestly do love my family: My mom's a huge nerd like me and my dad actually enjoys playing sports with me.

Part 1) My mom has a tendency to ask me for a little bit extra money every now and then. Usually, I don't mind helping her out. Generally, giving her some extra money gets me some perks (Usually getting her and my sister out of the house so I can have it to myself) and I know it's going to family stuff like groceries and bills. However, sometimes I've had to tell her ""This month is going to be tight for X reason, so please don't ask me for extra money"". Am I the A for getting annoyed with her when she then later asks me for money?

Part 2) My dad is very controlling when it comes to money. He's always been strict when it came to the family check book. Not miserly strict, but always wanted to know where every cent was going. This mostly stems from growing up without much money. Lately, he's been staying on my case about the money I'm making: Wanting to know how much I have in savings, not wanting me to spend money on other people, and wanting to know what I am spending my money on. Am I the A for not wanting to have someone else decide how I spend the money I make?

1757,Asshole,"I have been recently giving advice to a guy who is [trying to contact a girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/es/comments/cnbzum/alguien_puede_ayudarme_a_reconectarme_con_la/) who had met on internet.

He said that talked several times with her through an language interchange application (HelloTalk), and eventually had fallen in love with her, but one day she just disconnected from the app. He knows her name, her city and the faculty there she is currently studying and he is searching for her to say that he miss her (and also probably say he loves her), so I suggested him to travel to that city for two weeks, and try to search for her in the university asking to possible classmates. That will be expensive (about 4000 $), but he says that he can pay for it.

My point of view is... you clearly don't deserve the other person affection if you don't fight for it more that just searching in google and writing in reddit forums. In the worst  case you will lose the money, but you also get the peace of mind of having fight for your dreams come true.

Then, another user in the thread accused him to be a sociopath and a stalker, and me for encouraging his behaviour.

I admitted that from my point of view he has a platonic love, and probably the name of the girl is just an alias used for the application and not her real name, but this should not stop him to resolve his dream for good or for bad. I think that it is better to try to find her, and fight for his dream to come true. I am concerned that he probably won't find the girl, or even he can be rejected, but that still doesn't make him a stalker unless she have asked him to let her in peace.

Am I the Asshole for supporting him and wish good luck with the search, even believing he has low chances to find her?

1758,Not the A-hole,"So yesterday, while sleeping (at 230pm) my mother wakes me up from sleep and informs me that she took one of our family cats to the vet and he had to be put down to severe illness (she mentioned something about internal bleeding or cancer) I was very distraught, but understood. The cat was approx. 12 years old, and was having issues with incontinence (he was pooping around the house pretty often) and was showing signs of his age. My sister, didn't believe that the cat was sick, and thought my mom intentionally had the cat put down as she was tired of cleaning up after it. My mom has even in anger said things before like she was going to put him down if he kept shitting all over the house. I backed my mother up and told everyone else in my family the story she told me, about the cat being sick. We were all upset as a family, but were going to move past this, and remember our feline friend and our good memories.

This morning, my sister asked me to go to the animal hospital and ask for some details about what happened with our cat, and lo and behold, they informed me that my mother scheduled an appointment to have the cat euthanized, claiming he was  very sick and was suffering. I came home, and basically blew up on my mom for lying, went on a huge rant about how she's a sick human being for just euthanizing a pet that was inconvenienced by, and for lying to all of our family about it. She claimed the cat was wheezing the other day and there was some blood in his poop so that was her criteria to have him instantly put down, without any input from the rest of the family, or any opportunity for closure. No one knew he was even going to the vet. I then told her she shouldn't ever adopt pets again for her callous disregard for the cat's life. She left, and that was that.

After all that went down, I called my sister and dad and told them the truth, and they're both disgusted and abhorred by my mother's conduct, and don't know what to do. None of us can really think about her the same, as she essentially killed off a loved family pet for the minor inconvenience of having to clean up after him every once in awhile. And FYI, this cat was one she adopted, not one of her kids, so she can't claim that she was tired of cleaning up after 'our' pet's mess.  This could quite possibly tear our family apart. So the question is, Am I the asshole for telling my family, and potentially breaking my family up, over the family cat? Or should I have kept this to myself and let my family move on and grieve for our pet? Some people I talked to think it's crazy I could drive this big of a wedge into my family over a 'cat who was getting up there in age anyway, and something that was already done and over with'

&#x200B;

Edit: I asked the vet if he was examined or checked out at all to see if he was actually sick, he was not checked out at all, and the last time he was in the vet before being euthanized was 2018. (To clarify, I went to the vet's office in person. The staff there know my mom very well, and my name is on file because of my other cats they so quickly looked up the records since my name was on the same address for another cat I own.)

&#x200B;

Edit2: I've said it in the comments, but it got lost on some commenters, the entire family helped clean up after the cat, but I won't argue that my mom was home more often and so probably cleaned it up more often than anyone one other person. Also, I mentioned the 'her pet' because in the past she has made a big deal over me and my siblings getting pets and telling us we were 100% responsible for cleaning up after them or she'd give them away. I have 'my' cat that I adopted that I care for 100%, my sister has a cat that she 100% cares for, and my mom adopted a cat that we all collectively took care of since he became the 'family' cat because of his super friendly attitude. I don't want people to think I or my sister adopted a cat and then dropped it on her to take a majority care of.",388,1558,0.96
1759,Not the A-hole,"Basically my girlfriend (20F) and I (20F) went on holiday with another couple who are her friends.
 In the middle of the night I awoke to hearing the couple arguing or something and the girl being hurt in some way (saying “ouch, stop” etc).
I tried to ignore it until she came out crying and I confronted the guy which nearly resulted in a fist fight and we ended up falling out. I left the situation to another hotel with my gf and me and him did not associate for the rest of the holiday.

Flash forward a few months and my gf went to their house and they tried to instigate a threesome. The girl in their relationship justified it by saying “he doesn’t want it out of lust it’s another reason I can’t tell you” which is very obviously because he hates me. (It’s blatantly obvious)
The threesome didn’t happen and the girls fell out because he told my gf she was sexy or something in private and she didn’t relay the info to his girlfriend. 

When she told me about it I told her I don’t want to hear of them ever again, and she agreed.
Recently the girls met up with mutual friends and ended up becoming friends again.
I told her I won’t have them people anywhere near my life.

My argument is basically what team are we if she’s friends with people who tried to do something for the purpose of hurting me? And if a girl tried to have sex with me out of hatred for her it would be a completely different story.

Her argument is that I am controlling her by not letting her be friends with who she wants, and I create drama by creating random vendettas against her friends

I’m not going to change my mind and I’m doubtful she will either, we both clearly have different ideas of what a relationship should be.

1761,Not the A-hole,"Until recently I have been in a relationship with ""Robin"". He is a wonderful person with unmedicated and untreated manic depression. Our time together was turbulent, awesome, painful and amazing, a real rollercoaster. It has given us much, it has also cost us both a lot.

Due to his mood swings he has broken up the relationship 5 times in as many years. Last break-up in april he made it clear this one is definite, no getting back together.

He will be able to leave our place in 8 to 10 weeks. In the mean time we live together in a small appartment. This makes it very difficult to not just know it's over, but to actually live it and grieve.

After the break-up I have helped him financially to buy the place where he will move into eventually. He is helping me to make sure I can stay in the apartment we live in now. There is no anger, just sadness and the will to make the best of a shitty situation for and by the both of us.

However, in his process he is way ahead of me. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the fact he is not my Robin anymore. He is already craving for intimacy with other people. There is no specific someone else yet and he is only interested in casual contacts, no relationship. But still, just the idea of him being close with someone else hurts like something fierce right now.

Would I be the asshole if I would ask him to please wait a bit with actively pursuing new sexual partners until he has moved out? Also when he would be kind enough to take someone to a hotel and be discreet about it? After 5 years I only have to see his face to know he had ""good times"". I am already in a dark place, I can't imagine how it would feel if I have to deal with that as well. Also I think when he has moved out and we have some distance from each other, I might be better at dealing with the situation of Robin and his future partners. At least it will be a lot less confrontational.

Don't get me wrong, I want happiness for him, no matter in what way or form. I'm just trying to find a way to not be confronted with his sexlife on top of the day to day struggle. Will I be asking too much?

EDIT with update. After explaining my pov on the matter and asking him if he was willing to make sure I wouldnt be confronted with his new partners or his sex life, he fully understood. He proposed to not discuss any of it with me, keep me fully out of it and agreed with me to find a different place for it instead of our apartment.

Why? Because I don't feel like he is my brother. I didn't grow up with him and he has made me feel uncomfortable on many occasions.
He also says untrue things about our dad but only behind his back and just generally blames everyone but himself for his misery. I've never said this to my dad because he'll be hurt.

1765,Not the A-hole,"A little over a year ago I finally had that moment with my ex-husband where you think ""if someone repeatedly shows you who they are, at some point you have to believe them.""  Our divorce should have been simple since we didn't have any kids, didn't really own anything and could have walked away with what we came with. But he made it miserable for me at every turn and I'm not sure I'll ever forgive him. I moved back to our hometown, he stayed where we were living. 

Through all that I adored his family, they are truly some of my favorite people on the planet. His mom was really the one that talked me through the divorce and kept me from sinking into too deep of despair when things were really bad. I also loved my sister in law and felt like if it weren't for my husbands gatekeeping, we could have been really great friends. 

A while ago I ran into my ex-sister-in-law. She asked me if I'd gotten her wedding invitation, I said no (I truly think it was a legit lost in the mail situation) and she said that she had sent one and really, really wanted me to come. I told her I would love to but didn't have a date and would feel weird there by myself with my ex. She told me not to worry that she had an amazing guy to set me up with and all but pleaded with me to come since she still saw me as family. I told her I would. Well I went out with the guy and we hit it off like crazy and are now dating.  So things were fine until...

My ex found out I was coming to the wedding. I want to avoid as much drama as I can so I politely reached out to him and asked him what the issue was. He said he couldn't be in the room with me and another guy. I actually figured that was fair enough so I talked it over with Bradley, my sister in law and everyone agreed it was a fair request that my ex not have to see me on a date. So Bradley agreed not to attend. Well that wasn't good enough for my ex and he started accusing everyone of ""turning their backs on him"" and if I showed up, he was not going to come. 

Pretty much everyone in his family has told me outright they want me there and if he chooses to throw a tantrum and not show up for his sister, it's truly his loss. 

To my moral dilemma and why I might and might not be the asshole:

In my head NTA: I was an invited guest. I love his sister and family.  We are divorced and his bullshit is no longer my concern. 

In my head YTA: in the years down the road, everyone will remember a brother not showing up for a sisters wedding. That will lead to resentment and potentially years worth of extra drama. I love my inlaws but our relationship as it stands will go on whether I attend or not. So me steadfastly refusing to give into his tantrum really only means I get to go the wedding, but has potential for much fall out.

I was on my honeymoon when my sister gave birth to her second child. I called her and had a FaceTime session with her and newborn the next day. 

I returned home 2 weeks later and met my nephew. I had bought some presents for my sister and brother in law, but couldn't decide on a present for the baby while overseas but didn't worry about it that much as I didn't think it was a big deal. My sister and brother in law are very well-off, have lots of possessions, toys etc plus hand me downs from child number 1, so I didn't think they would miss a gift.

Fast forward two weeks and my dad tells me my sister has called him complaining to him about 15 times that I haven't brought a present for my nephew. I was really shocked when I heard this as I have been visiting regularly,  helping look after her two sons (both under 2yo) so she could have a break. She is apparently upset with me for my lack of gifts both now and with child number 1 (apparently I should be bringing gifts over every 3 visits).

My parents want me to get him a birth gift (he is now 4 weeks old). To add to this, I am the godmother so apparently I'm required to spend up to $500 dollars on a christening gift.

Al approached me about doing a boudoir set with her for my brothers birthday. Once the skeeviness of giving my brother a boner passed I agreed. Al is not only gorgeous but she's tall, very athletic and very, very sweet. The pictures turned out amazing, a lot is looks but her energy just glowed on camera. Al is the centerpiece of the boudoir section on my website and because of her I am booked solid every weekend from now until Christmas. She wanted to pay me but I refused.

Last week I heard from Karen (that really is her name) and she said she's seen Al's pictures and wanted to know if I would do the same for her. I tried to be diplomatic and tell her that I would love to but I'm so booked up I can't even think about it until January. The reality is, Karen is very, very overweight and she doesn't take very good care of herself. She's also super high maintence and argumentative and I was dreading spending rime with her and having to explain why her pics didn't turn out like Al's.i think physical beauty can be found in people of all sizes but Karen is so hard to work with, I don't know if I can do it. 

Then it got even worse when I finally relented and said I would take a night off school in September and do the shoot and sent her a price list. That caused a huge melt down and she claimed I was being unfair and unfamily like because I didn't charge Al. I tried to explain that I was altering my schedule and actually I'm using Al's pictures for promotional material so it's a fair exchange. Karen said I could use hers for promotional material as well. I told her I was really sorry but if I'm going to take off school, I need to be paid.

Karen and Peter are on the warpath against me now. They left a bunch of nasty comments on my studio Facebook page which caused me to lose two weekend clients. They have spread rumors about me amongst other family and my cousin has decided to do her newborn shoot with another photographer.

>Historic usage of billion in the UK is the 'long scale' 1,000,000,000,000 sometimes clarified as a 'million million' or 'double million' in engineering texts aware of the abiguity. In the SI era billion is accepted as 10^(9). Usage to mean 2 million arises from misunderstanding of historic clarifactions, and is an uncommon and incorrect usage, but beware non SI users being deliberately obtuse and refusing to clarify what they mean.

This has led to him raging at me over messenger that a billion is 2 million and I'm being a patroninsing fuck and telling him how to do his job, deleting my post and doubling down on his mistaken definition. He's really quite upset and I've jus stuck him on mute.

EDIT Please read up on size of [historic UK billlion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion) before catagoricly stating at is 1000,000,000. Most of us have grown up in the SI era and are accustomed to the SI/US billion. Older folk and pre SI UK books use the long scale billion

EDIT: Teacher friend is native British english speaker now living abroad.

EDIT: Teacher friend really does think the UK billion is 2,000,000 not 10^(12) or a million multiplied by a million.",58,32,0.76

1780,Not the A-hole,"To give you guys a little context, I’m currently working as a recruiting officer. A few months ago, good friend of mine recently graduated from university and was looking for a job. As a recruiting officer, I thought why not she give a shot at an opening that was in her field of study (important note: this position is only temporary, not full-time). I put in a good word for her and helped her get into an interview. Long story short, she managed to get the job. 

So this is where the situation begins. A few weeks ago, there was another position that was open in our company which she was really interested in. She asked me what was the process like etc etc and I answered her as much as I could. She applied for it and she was invited for an interview. 

Fast forward to today, her interview is next week. Then, she asked me “Hey, you’re in the interview panel right? Do you know what’s the essay question?” (For context, all interviewees are required to complete an essay minutes before the actual interview). 

I told her that I do know the question, but I can’t just give her the question in advance. She then started saying things like, “oh, but you helped me for the previous position...” basically trying to guilt trip me. I just said I’m not in the position to help her. 

Then when I was scrolling through my social media a few minutes later, I saw that she posted “I’ll help in a heartbeat” and “bend my back even.” 

Needless to say, this really upset me and was what tempted me to send her a super long text saying that I just wanted to be fair to all the candidates and that as a friend, she should understand that I didn’t want to risk my job just to help hear cheat.

I got tired yesterday and shut the cabinets closed with double sided tape so you couldn’t tell from outside. I don’t know what kinda magic tape it was, but when he went to put some stuff in, he couldn’t open it. I didn’t say anything, he tugged harder and ripped the handle off.

1782,Everyone Sucks,"So I play in a decent sized band, at least big enough to have guitar techs and drum techs. It's a very bass-oriented sound, so I put huge value on my sound, being both the bassist and a singer.

We recently hired this little dude as my bass tech. His job is simple, make sure the bass sounds good, works good and is setup my way.

We were just having a pretty big set for us, and he blew it. He got me flatwounds (basically ultra slippery, high tension strings that cost 20 bucks more), not conducive at all to my sort of playing.

Then he tuned the basses to E, we tune E flat, so I was out of tune for the first song. I had to tune it myself on stage, which is unprofessional as fuck.

Then I turned on my distortion, it was flat and dead. The fucker had left the old,crusty batteries in.

So after the last song I confront him. I tell him he's incompetent, he fucked up our show; he's out of a job and that I'm not paying the extra 20 for the strings I didn't want.

Another band sees this and their guitarist freaks out, telling me it's ""just bass"" and that I'm being and asshole. I tell both off them to fuck off, but I'm having some doubts now.

AITA? He did fuck up my sound, and made my playing seem worse

After the breakup she would not allow me to go with her because it was my choice to end the relationship and she would not be paying me back for any part of the trip.  I insisted that I should still be able to go because of the amount I paid towards the trip.

My friend asked me : oh, what time can I come on Friday to clean your house for the party?

Well she brought her 4 kids knowing my husband has night shift and he needs to sleep during the day, she used my pots and pans to make the food for her party and didn't wash them. She tried to make a piñata shaped cake and she had never done anything like that ever! She left the mess of cake in my fridge instead of preparing everything at her house and bringing it 2 hours before the party.
She left on Friday til 1 am and left a mess on the kitchen.

Saturday morning she comes to ""clean the house"".
Nope, she leaves my house at 10 am and comes back until 4pm because she went to buy everything else she needed for the party like decorations and ingredients for the food(the party was at 5).

She takes her kids and my niece to the kids art museum to ""give me a break"".
I hint again : I get more stressed out with a dirty house than a noisy house (please clean your mess and leave).
She leaves anyways, and while she is at the museum she sends me a message : oh melanie is on her way to the museum, is it okay if we get back by 4 so she doesn't feel rushed.
At this point I lost it : I have to go to work at 5! No, it's not okay.
And she awnsers : why? You don't think we can clean up your house in 1 hour.
Me : no, besides I have to get ready for work and make lunch for my husband to bring to work.

1785,Asshole,"What the title says.

A couple info:

1. I need to know because it's a trigger for my anxiety, not knowing that she's talking with anyone else, even if there are no malice or it's just her friends. I can't explain why it triggers my anxiety (like full blown cold fingertips and nape, can't breathe), since I trust her anyway. I just want to know. (may be FOMO. I hate the thought of there's a part of her life that I don't know about. But even I'm not sure if it's FOMO. That's anxiety for ya - irrational.)
2. I asked her to promise that to me nicely. She agreed nicely.
3. More than 5 times she's broken her promise. I let it go all the time since she always promises that she won't do it again.
4. Every time I see a comment or a message on her social media that she hasn't told me about, I ask her about it. I try to come out as nice as I can, but she almost always snaps at me, like I'm a burden. Like what I'm asking her is too much. This hurts me even more, on top of the anxiety I already have. Like she doesn't even understand what that does to me.
5. As a courtesy, I tell her too when I'm talking with my friends. I even attach a screenshot so she doesn't worry. Even though she didn't ask for that.

So my question is: AITA for asking for such a simple thing?

1786,Everyone Sucks,"A good friend of mine is getting married soon. Her MIL has put her trough hell these last few years. Initially they got along but then the MIL’s boyfriend made a racist comment about my friend and since the MIL took the guy’s side, it was never the same again. So my friend (who is the bride) asked me to be passive aggressive to her MIL at her wedding. For example: The MIL is a Spanish teacher and she keeps bragging about how good her Spanish is when it is not. Since my Spanish is fairly good, the bride asked me to make comments to her MIL like “You have got such a cute English accent when you speak Spanish. I love it!” which will certainly upset her. Stuff like that. 

I’m a very non-confrontational person so I know I’ll feel at least a little guilty doing it. After all it is her son’s wedding. But this is my friend’s wedding too and this woman has been nasty to her for years.

1787,Not the A-hole,"I am currently residing in a country where English is not the main language. I have a friend here whose English is pretty weak and not as fluent as I am. Since his college days, I have been helping him proofread his English essays or helping him translate English emails since he has trouble understanding them. Even for his job applications, I basically re-wrote his entire cover letters because either the content was shitty or his sentences made no rhetorical sense. Over time, I became the go-to guy if he needed to send texts or write emails to other English-speaking friends or whatever. It was annoying but I did not mind helping out since it wasn't too difficult on my part. 

Recently, he really wanted this job in an multi-national corporation that required an adequate level of English fluency. I basically put him through a two-day boot camp of English interviews, grilling him with common questions that might pop up, and providing him with answers based on his experience and background. With everything said and done, he got the job. His interviewer praised his high level of fluency in English (considering where I am in, the level of English is sub-par), and mentioned to him that his strength in English was one of the reasons he was hired over the other candidates. I told him to practise English from now on and just work hard on his job. That was that, and he started working recently. 

Ever since he started working, he has been constantly messaging me asking whether this email he was sending was grammatically correct, or if he could phrase it a different way to make it sound better. I sympathized at first and thought that he was nervous at his new job. But it has started to become incredibly annoying as he calls me if I don't reply his texts quick enough. I work the same schedule as he does, and I need to work during my company time as well, instead of responding to this kind of stupid texts. Today, I told him to stop messaging over stupid grammar or linguistic questions. I told him I won't mind helping if it was for an important document or whatever (but even then I am quite sure it would be against his company policy to share sensitive details with an outsider like me), but not over stupid emails like ""Sure, but I am busy next week, can we reschedule it to another day?"". 
I gave him suggestions to use grammarly or some other grammar tools, but he said it was easier to ask me. So I told him I will not be responding to his texts for stupid ass grammar questions again. He said I was being an asshole. 
I don't think I am, and I think he just got too used to the fact that I was a nice guy for helping him out from a long time ago, but I just want to check.

1788,Not the A-hole,"A quick note: my father dipped when I was about 2, and left my mom to raise me, my little sister, and my three older brothers by herself.

Right before my sixteenth birthday (I'm currently 27) my mom found out via my school's student counselor that I'm a lesbian. She was pretty upset over the whole thing and we got into a fight that ended with her demanding that I either leave or I submit myself to conversion therapy. I decided that it was best for me to go, packed my stuff up, and bought a plane ticket (in cash) to go from Arizona to Maryland. 

While in Maryland, I supported myself, never once hearing from my mother, brothers, or sister. While in college, I ended up in the same class as one of my maternal cousins, and I told her why I hadn't been at any of the family reunions, in Christmas cards, or at our aunt's wedding. She was very sympathetic and through her, I was able to contact my siblings again. 

A year ago, my sister called me to let me know that our mother was ill, and possibly dying. At the time, I didn't have the money to fly out to see her, so my sister paid for me to go. Even after my sister introduced me, my mother didn't even recognize me. It was like I'd never existed to her. She'd either forgotten about me or blocked any memory of her 'living disappointment' (her words, not mine) from her memory. 

A month ago, my sister called to let me know that our mother had passed away, and I received an invitation to her funeral.

Me and my stepsis never really connected. Whenever I would try to get along with her she would ignore me. She did the same to my mom. I talked to my mom and step dad about it and they said that we just needed to give her time since this was an adjustment. No luck, for the next few years she treated me like I was a ghost. I didn't think much of it and just decided that if she wanted to talk, then she would talk (I didn't want to possibly constantly annoy her). 

When Stepsis turned 14 she started to skip school, do drugs and stay out late. Mom and Step-dad tried to talk things through to her but she continued. I tried to help her out by offering to tutor her, tell her why drugs could ruin her life ect. Her main response was ""fuck you.  You aren't my brother"". This hurt me (even though we were not close).

Few years past and I moved out, went to college, got a job, I saved up money and brought a really small house. Nothing big. A few times I invited my parents/stepsis over for holidays and such. 

One day, I get a call from an unknown number and it's my Stepsis who sounds happy. I was confused since she never contacted me previously. Basically, Stepsis was calling me to say thanks for letting her live with me and that she was already packing to prepare. She explained that ""Mom and Dad said I could live with you"". I instantly hung up and called my parents. In short, they got tired of Stepsis leaving the place a mess and smoking weed in their home, so they told her that I said she could live with me. I got angry and asked why they thought it was okay to say that without AT LEAST asking me first. They said they were going to call, but they thought I would say yes. I told them that she is NOT moving in with me. 

 I get a call from Stepsis who is screaming/crying at me through the phone. I explained to her that Mom and Dad DID NOT ask me anything beforehand. She starts to tell me that ""you're my brother! You're supposed to help me out! we never bonded and this could be a chance for us"". I finally got upset and told her ''No it is not. I tried so many times to get along with you and you ignored me. You said I wasn't your brother and always cursed me. I am not comfortable with you living with me. I'm sorry. ""

I hung up and my parents are angry with me because ""she just needs guidance"". I told them that she is now 17 and knows right from wrong and that I wouldn't be okay with her most likely doing drugs in my home especially when she never contacted me in the past before this.

1790,Not the A-hole,"Bit of background. So my fiancé and I are getting married in three months. My MIL to be has been a cause of stress throughout this whole planning process. I have a large southern family(75 in my close immediate) and he is from a small family. The guest list has been an issue from the beginning because my MIL to be is mad that the list isn’t even on both sides when my family is the one paying for it... she ended up trying to invite 70 extra guests, most of which she has not spoken to in years. We politely explained to her that the budget would not allow this and to only invite the people most important to her. In order to accommodate more of her guests, we took away the plus ones for the wedding party, took friends off of the guest list and even some of my family. 

This leads us to the current issue and what I’m seeking guidance on. MIL texts Fiancé and I today asking if a couple she is friends(unrelated) with and one of their family friends’ son’s girlfriends can come to the wedding since another family’s children are unable to attend. Fiancé and I gently explain that yes, the couple she is friends with can come, BUT the friend’s son’s girlfriend will have to wait on an answer until we get more RSVPs and an idea of who is coming. We explain that we would also prefer to give plus ones to the wedding party rather than a random guest who’s SO we have never met and that we believe it would be rude to do otherwise.

MIL calls fiancé in a rage saying we are being unfair, and that she’s never asked for anything and that she has done so much for us so how dare we not let her tell the girlfriend it’s fine. Come to find out, she already told the family that the girlfriend could come and was only asking us to cover her ass. Because she “didn’t think it would be a big deal” and now she has “egg on her face.” 

After this, she texts my fiancé again saying that we need to “have a heart” and we don’t understand how hard it is for people to come from out of town the weekend of our wedding due to a holiday and that “after all this BS she is never asking for anything again.”

After that, i sent a long but respectful message stating that I was upset that she refuses to see our reasoning and explained again that it is not a definite no but that we just ask that she wait to make sure our numbers won’t go over budget before we agree to anything. I also explained that I am upset that she did not ask us before approving this addition and further explained it was never about the money or the guest list numbers. Instead it was about the premise of allowing a guest bring a plus one rather than the individuals sacrificing their time and money(the wedding party).

Now, I knew she could afford to pay rent because she had been with her ex. I also knew that she was having trouble saving money and budgeting. I had been giving her tips and had tried teaching it to her when she was in high school, but it didn’t stick. So, I charged her cheap rent ($300/month) and then put it aside for her, as savings. So, when she was ready to move out again, she’d have a nice little fund. I didn’t tell her this.

A few weeks later, however, she said that she found it weird. She thought all this time I was putting her rent towards bills. She found the whole thing sneaky and like her paying rent all this time wasn’t necessary. She said it wasn’t really a gift, she had paid for it.

Not I know that immediately after reading the title you want to respond YTA, but hear me out. 

So we were at a dinner party hosted by one of our neighbors and we live in a pretty affluent neighborhood, so there were a lot of engineers and more importantly for this story, doctors present. 

Well the party kind of breaks up into different groups and my husband and I find ourselves in a group with two other couples, one guy is a physicists and the other 5 of us hold positions in the medical field, however in different studies. 

Long story short we all start talking about how we need to have a super honest conversation and hold nothing back, if there are problems they should be asked and addressed. It started with a couple of heart questions, sharp pains when one breathes in sometimes, etc etc. This progresses to a more sexual and taboo area when one of the other ladies admits to having a yeast infection that she can’t seem to shake, she works with eyes so yeast infections aren’t really her area of expertise. 

My husband then decides that this would be the perfect time to mention that I too have a yeast infection. I think you can see where this is going. Initially what he said shocked me, but then quickly I realized I wasn’t mad at him or embarrassed or anything, and actually what I learned and the names I wrote down ended up being very useful in dealing with the infection. 

And then the males start talking about ED, and the other two men admit to having problems with it, but not my husband. I thought that he was being kind of a coward and not admitting his own problem and sharing in the discussion with the other men, yet he seemed to have no problem in sharing my infection. 

I mentioned that he to had ED and for pretty much the whole conversation he was red in the face and didn’t say a word. When we got home he was super pissed at me, but I feel that what I did was for his own good. He has been complaining about his problems for a while and I thought I could give him a little push that could lead to help for him. He said I betrayed him, and what I said was wildly inappropriate, yet again he had no problem mentioning my yeast infection. I hold no animosity against him, but I think he needs to face this issue as it has been bothering him for years.",253,241,0.7

1794,Not the A-hole,"I am the leader of my daughter’s Girl Scout troop. The girls rank as “Juniors”, which range in age from 9-11. Before the end of the school year, we did a camping trip. I was setting up everything for the afternoon with the help of the adults, while we all made sure the girls stayed in the immediate area. We could see if they were going to try to leave bounds, but not exactly what we were doing.

After our first two activities, they have another break. I’m doing something with one of the girls when I hear one of the 10-year-olds we’ll call Sasha yell out “My iPod is missing!”

Now, iPods were not allowed on the trips to begin with, so I wasn’t sure why she would bring it. But I asked when she last saw it, if the other girls had, etc. One of the other girls said that they had seen one of the 9-year-olds looking at it, we’ll call her Megan. I said, okay. Talked to Megan, she hadn’t seen it. Okay. Sasha says she needs to find it or her mom will be so mad. I remind her I said don’t bring electronics and that I wasn’t responsible.

Sasha and her friends go into the tent shared by the 9-year-olds (Megan included) and some of the 11-year-olds. Suddenly, I hear them say “There it is!” I go in and it’s sitting in the front (mesh) pocket of Megan’s backpack. I call Megan in, she swears up and down that she didn’t do it, she would have no reason to take it and starts crying. I don’t know what to believe and I tell everyone they need to go sit down outside while I figure this out. 

I talk with the other adults. We agreed the story sounded weird. Finally, I asked to talk to Megan privately. Again, she swore up and down she didn’t steal it. She’s so upset. I get her to calm down and tell her that it’s going to be okay, she’s not in trouble. I have another adult stay with her to read for a bit while I talk with the older girls (out of earshot of Megan). I say that if this is true, then Megan will be going home and not spending the weekend here. The girls look smug. I then say “Oh, and because she’s clearly dishonest and not living up to the Girl Scout law, I’m going to have to boot her out of the troop.”

That got one of the girls looking upset and I knew my gut feeling was right. Suddenly, she was whispering to Sasha and I asked what was up. She said that it was all Sasha’s idea to get Megan in trouble, because there were too many “babies” on the trip. They had plans for the other four 9-year olds (that wouldn’t have worked). Sasha eventually owned up to it.

I called these girls parents and had them picked up early. I told the girls’ parents that they would not participate in any more GS events for the rest of the schoolyear (last two weeks). Now, it’s time for the new school year. Megan’s mom has recently said that Megan wants to come back this year, but only if the three girls involved in this weren’t. I know one isn’t.

And at this point he's coming off like an old person just trying to be funny and relatable so I'm laughing politely right like ""yeah haha I have a gf tho so I'm good"" and he's like ""oh thats a shame man, the girls here, they're SO HOT""


What then follows was the most uncomfortable rant I've ever listened to in my life. With zero prompting from me other than ""mhmm""s this guy goes into a rant about the girls in my town. Saying stuff like ""yeah some of these girls man like their legs are like WOW and sometimes their shorts don't even cover their butts!"" And at one point he's like ""that's why I drive here, fuck driving in * nearby hotspot area with older people * you make the same money here and get those girls man"" 

I'm just sitting in the back like wtf and then he tells this story about how he went to pick up this swedish girl from my Universitys dorm and hes like, really describing this girls body and outfit. He waits until the girls friends are in the car and then, in his words ""I looked into the mirror and * hits wheel * guess what. The girl in the back. Not. Wearing. Undewear. I looked up at God after and thanked him for giving me such luck...""

Now at this point I was really creeped out. Not only is that a weird thing to like just... Tell someone but since he picked the girl up at a dorm it was like 90% a freshman which means she's like 18 or 19. 

I just like, can't believe what I'm hearing then after this story he just starts telling me jokes until we get to my apartment.

After I just like, didn't know what to think. This guy was really likeable and Charismatic but that shit about the girls weirded me out so much. I decided to report him to Uber and wrote the store of what happened, specifically the upskirting story, afterwards I got a message from Uber that said  something like ""Were sorry no one should be feel objectified on a car and we'll look into this and we've refunded you"" (I think they thought *I* was a girl) 

Was I in the wrong for reporting him? I think he was just trying to like ""bro out"" with me or something but I didn't want him driving around my town picking up drunk girls if that's how he thinks of them, it's really weird for me that he's super old too.

AITA?

1796,Everyone Sucks,"Some background here, I am a rather tall girl among my classmates. The sports I train on also makes me a little bit bulky and my skin a little darker and rougher. I have short hair and often dress tomboyishly(is that a word?), also occasionally apply makeups to make my features more masculine to the point of getting mistaken as a guy by strangers sometimes. It is nothing complicated really, I just find myself looking better this way as I look awkwardly like a drag queen if I dress like a girl.


While my whole class knows about me, there is one particular girl who(serious or joking) always assume that I am either a lesbian or a FTM in the making. She spoke as if it's already fact and decided without considering my opinion. When I confront her about this, her reply was ""But (my name), you play rough sports, you dress like a boy, you hang out with boys!"" And suggest me to sort out my own identity myself, which I rolled my eyes and just left her be, we were not close enough to be discussing my identity anyway. 


There's recently a new guy who joined the class, a rather handsome one, I must say. We were introducing ourselves to him one by one as he walked around. When it was my turn, right after I told him my name, the girl called out :""Don't get your hopes up, she's a gay!"" And the whole class laughed.


I may be laughing along but in fact I was quite irritated. So I walked up to her, announced: ""Yups, and meet (her name), my girlfriend."" And gave her a  quick peck on the lips. She could not break free before the contact because I am much stronger than her, you know. The class then laughed again with cheers and claps and the new guy joined them. That girl though, after the initial shock, ran out of the classroom.


I heard later from the other girls that she developed a love on first sight with the new guy, and I completely ruined the first impression. According to them she had been crying in the toilet for hours(not true, she came back when the class starts but I get that exaggeration) My own friends were saying that I went overboard, and I feel a little sorry for that. Buuuut, it was not that she didn't ruin my first impression with the new guy too, even though he was not my type, and she had been assuming my identity for a while before that. 


TLDR: Girl keep assuming I am lesbian, told the new guy in class, and I kissed her in return. Turns out the new guy is her crush. AITA",53,82,0.84

1799,Not the A-hole,"I volunteer often at a soup kitchen in my town (at least once a week) and I normally end up getting put “in charge”. Far too often, we get parents that are taking their kids there to “teach them a lesson in gratefulness” which I don’t agree with. Of course kids should be grateful, but I don’t think that people down on their luck are props for these people to use for a couple of hours. They can hear everything these people are saying, and it’s just degrading in my opinion. Teach your kids about being grateful and then you can also teach them that it’s good to give back, volunteer your time, etc. 

Then over the weekend, a mom brought her 12-year-old daughter in to volunteer. The mom had a smug look on her face and insisted her daughter serve food, so she “got a good look at the homeless”. Normally we don’t let kids scoop the food, but I did let her give out the rolls because it wasn’t worth the argument at the moment. The mother was scooping the food and to give her credit, she was being good with the people who were coming through the line. Her daughter looked like most of the kids that come, bored, unmoved. One outing at a soup kitchen isn’t going to turn your kid grateful for their iPad. But again, not my business, so we move on. 

The mom did keep making comments, however, to her daughter when we had a lull, such as “Do you see how good you have it?” and “Can you imagine how humiliating it’d have to be to come here?” it was annoying, but I just had to let it go because at least she wasn’t saying it in front of the people that were utilizing our services.

Then a bit later in the night, a girl that was probably in her later teens (but still a minor), came through the line. The mom started talking to her, and the girl shared that she had been kicked out of her home. As soon as she said this, the mother turns to her daughter and says, “You see, Rebecca, if you don’t stop with your smart mouth, this could be you some day!”

The teen looked humiliated. I was pissed. At this point, I finished serving the teenager, told her about services that could help her in the area and apologized. I then turned to the mother and said “You need to leave.” She said I couldn’t make her. I said she was being highly inappropriate and making the people feel uncomfortable. 

The mother tried to explain her daughter was ungrateful and I said “This isn’t the way, just get the hell out.” 

The daughter said “Let’s just go, Mom, this whole thing is stupid.”

The mom huffed, grabbed their stuff and they left. 

Now, I know this looks like a validation post…but it’s not. I was sharing this point of view and what happened with a fellow volunteer friend. She says that what does it matter, so long as people get fed. She thinks kicking the girl out ruined a chance for her and the mom to learn and I could’ve handled it a lot better. So, I bring it here.

1800,Not the A-hole,"I've been friends with this woman since we were 5 - more than 26 years.  About 2 years ago, my husband found a half starved kitten and brought her home.  We nursed her back to health, got her vetted, got her shots, and got her spayed.  We taught her to trust people again.  We spent a year trying to find her a home and failed.  We needed to move - we had a new baby and needed more space.  I spent my entire pregnancy and the first 5 months of my son's life trying to find a place that would allow us to keep all our cats and failed.  So we HAD to rehome this little cat.

We loaned this friend $200 for her pet deposit so she could take the kitten.  That was never paid back, but that's not why I'm mad.  She's an alcoholic.  She's lied to everyone in her life about it.  We thought she'd been sober for a long time.  She had some unrelated legal issues and didn't pay a fine and was arrested.  She told me the cat was with her boss and asked me to go to her house to take care of some things.  I found 20-30 empty handles of vodka strewn about.

I contacted the boss.  She knows nothing about the cat.  I can't find out what happened to her.   I've been asking around for months. I'm livid.  A cat is never ""just a cat"" to me.  Pets are family and I did the best I could for this little kitty.  I feel like I let her down.  At this point, I'm done with the friendship.  I could have forgiven the money and the lying because I understand she's struggling with an addiction.  But if that little cat isn't somewhere safe and cared for, I'm just done.  She could have contacted me and I would have hidden the cat with me while I looked for another home.  She didn't.  AITA for completely writing this friend off?

When my dad found out, he tried putting my mom into rehab, but she kept doing drugs no matter what my dad did. My dad divorced but did not get custody of me because of something with corruption and other things. This part is not very important.

My step-dad is a nightmare. He and my mom got married after 2 months of dating, with both of them doing hard drugs. They would both hit me. Sometimes with whips and sometimes with baseball bats. They would pawn everything I ever worked hard for just so they could get another shot of heroin. They would also inject me with some drug while I was sleeping because they didn't want me to wake up. I have multiple bruises and scars on my body because of them. So anyways, I was 6 when my mom and Satan got married. I would get hit and verbally abused for doing basically nothing. Got a A in school? Hit because I was, ""trying to show off."" Got a B? Hit because I was stupid. Took a few more seconds to walk home from school? Hit because I was late. Every person who I told about my abuse never believed me even after I showed them some bruises. My devil parents would threaten to kill me if I ever told the police.

I got harassed on Facebook nonstop from the both of them because of how terrible I apparently am.

He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

She has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the convo:

Her: I'll get a job. 
Me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
Her: I thought you and dad could.
Me: absolutely not, I'm not raising another baby.

Pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother. I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not fair to us.

1805,Not the A-hole,"A little background: We don't live in our current town by choice. Pretty much everyone living here does so because they are required. It's a captive audience, and real estate rental companies know that and take advantage. I came to terms with early, and didn't bitch much at all, but it still sucks. As a renter you pay for any little repair. And the stuff that they pay for ends up getting fixed by a bunch of lowest bidder handy-men. 

""Water leaking into the wall from the shower sealant cracking, and now there's a bunch of wall mold? How about we just come by every few months and paint over the mold instead of fixing the problem... ""

""How about we demand that you pay us an arbitrary 500$ for dog wear and tear, but we won't give an itemized list of what is getting repaired with that money.""

Anyhow, a bunch of shady stuff, but as I said, I don't complain up until now. I am still paying rent here for this month. We are finally moving in 2 weeks, and I sent notice to vacate. Immediately they started scheduling showings at any old time of day with short notice. I usually try to accommodate and put the dog away and sweep up a bit or whatever. I am currently working nights this week, and got notice late today that there is a showing tomorrow mid-morning. This is the time that I come home and sleep after a night shift. I emailed them immediately and told them that I would be sleeping and can we reschedule for later that day? Tough luck, they say, we'ere coming to show the house anyway.

They suggested to my wife that they would prefer to stay in our apartment and go to the farmers market the next morning.  We live in a nice town with cafe and market in walking distance.  All cool.

They visit often and stay over occasionally but mostly sleep on the pull out couch (we only have 2 bedrooms, one is a nursery so only one bed and two couches in the living room, one pulls out).  Apparently they don’t find the pull out couch very comfortable - to be fair they are in their mid 60s.  I’ve recently learned that when we’re out of town they sleep in our bed.  They or my wife always change the sheets afterwards and make the bed.  Upon learning this I expressed to my wife that it makes me uncomfortable.  I would never sleep in their bed - though they have a guest bedroom so I guess I’m not faced with sleeping on a couch.  Still, I’m confident I wouldn’t do it,

Anyway, they’re really nice and good to us, help out w the baby, etc.  Its not the people.  I just don’t like the idea of anyone sleeping in our bed other than my partner and I.

So I probably won’t say shit bc I love her and don’t want to ruin the weekend, but I came here to see what other people thought.

1808,Asshole,"I have zero tolerance for spicy food.  The example I always give to people to put this into perspective is if you've ever had the tofu from Chipotle (they call it ""sofritas""), then you have a good idea of the upper limit of what I can handle.  In other words, the tofu from Chipotle is uncomfortably spicy for me, but I can just force it down.  Anything spicier than that is an absolute no go for me.  When I was a teenager, my family was eating at a Mexican restaurant, and I ordered food that ended up being way spicier than I anticipated.  I tried making myself eat it, only to eventually have to leave the restaurant and compose myself in the parking lot because I was having chest pain.  Ever since then, I've promised myself that I would never eat food that is too spicy for me again.  If I buy food that ends up being unexpectedly spicy, then I just throw it away and eat the cost (pun intended).

I'm in my late 20s now and have never had an issue with this approach.  This past Saturday my girlfriend's parents invited us over for dinner.  We've been dating for about six months now, and this was my first time meeting them.  When we arrived, they had prepared this complicated noodle dish with red sauce and chicken (not sure what it was called, but they're Korean if that helps).  I took one bite and immediately realized that I couldn't eat it.  I said, ""I appreciate the amount of effort that you guys have clearly put into this meal, but unfortunately it's just too spicy for me.  I can't eat it, but I'm more than happy to sit here and have a conversation while everyone else eats and then just get McDonald's on the way home.""

Things got a little awkward after that, and once the evening finally wrapped up and my girlfriend and I got in the car to drive home, she said that she was upset with me for ""insulting"" her parents by not eating the food that they spent four hours preparing specifically for me.  I reiterated that it was too spicy for me and that I refused to force myself to eat food that causes me literal physical pain.  She said that it wasn't even that spicy and called me a baby, to which I replied that everyone has difference tolerances for this sort of thing and that not only can I not help it but that it's also never going to change.  She was so aggravated that I didn't even get my McDonald's and had to eat a peanut butter and jelly after we got home.

She's been dating this guy since the start of the year and he's honestly a great guy, couldn't be more happy for them.  Then she tells me that after talking with the rest of my family, August 31st is really the only date that seems to work well for them.  They're both really set on tying the knot ASAP and would love to have a summer ceremony on our lawn.

Unfortunately, I've already accepted an invitation for another wedding on that same date about a 3 hour drive from where I live in DC. These are good friends from college and I've definitely previously mentioned that I was attending this wedding to my mother.

With the other wedding in central PA and me living in the DC area, the original plan was to rent a car for the weekend, make the 3 hour drive, then spend the night and return to DC the next day.  In order to make it to both weddings, I would need to fly back to upstate NY (where my family lives), go to my Mom's wedding the morning of the 31st, drive 4 hours to the PA wedding, drive 4 hours back the next day to return the car, and then fly home at some point on Sunday/Monday.All of this seems very cumbersome and with flights costing $400 round-trip, this would quickly become a very expensive weekend with a large portion of it traveling.

Would I be the asshole if I skipped my mom's wedding?  My mom and I are very close, but I feel like she's being too stubborn with the date.  Even if I didn't need to factor in travel/cost, 3 weeks notice is super short notice.

He went on a community outing today with other kids his age. He arrived back home and seemed happy and had a good time and told me about everything he did.

Then, while I was at work later in an aside, I was informed by my community ""youth worker"" in a ""by-the-way"" fashion, that Jake seemed to be very quiet when in groups of other kids his age (13 years to 16 years) when they were talking about partying, drinking, smoking (cigarettes/drugs) and girls/sex. She said he just kind of sat back and said nothing during these conversations which she observed. She wondered if something was wrong with him and that perhaps we should talk to him to see if something was wrong.

Initially, I thought ""is something wrong?"" but I quickly turned my attitude into ""is there something wrong with you to think the kid being good has an issue?""...

I told her my son, at 15, was perfectly fine being quiet and introverted a bit. Why is NOT drinking, smoking, partying and sex at 14-15 abnormal? I don't need a grandchild next year! Fuck me!

I told her that instead of coming to me with her concerns about my son, perhaps she should go speak with all the other kid's parents about their underage drinking, smoking, drug use, and sex and don't try and say my son has an issue because he is not out getting hammered at 15. I did this in public and I was pissed off about the situation. That's the only bit I'm feeling a little asshole-ish about.

1817,Not the A-hole,"My step-sister Stephanie was so obese that she qualified for gastric bypass surgery (we are in a country with socialised healthcare). She’s always been heavier, but did herself no favors because she’d eat fast food for every meal & never worked out. 

I used to be a overweight but I lost about 25kg through diet/exercise a few years ago. I can’t shift the last 10kg I want & still have a round face which I hate. I had to train myself to eat less which meant I was often hungry in those first few months. Her surgery means she doesn't feel hunger now. I had to go jogging even though I am not someone who enjoys working out.

Stephanie is now skinnier than I am, has the thinner face that I wish I had (I'm worried I am doomed to have a round face forever) but she acts like she earned it on Instagram. She keeps hashtagging about #powerofexercise and #gymtransformation etc when she never goes to the gym. 

At a family party last weekend, I was talking to some of my cousins and the topic of weight loss came up & I was saying how I am frustrated with this weight loss plateau I've hit. Stephanie walked up all ""you just need to be more disciplined, it's working for me, I still see you eating cake sometimes"". I rolled my eyes but said nothing. I had ONE cupcake at the party but almost never eat cake.  

She said ""You’re that person who makes excuses and cheats on her diet and then complains. but I'm got results because I don't do that, it takes hard work & sacrifices"".

I snapped & said ""Fuck off Stephanie, you had weight loss surgery because you were so fucking obese, so don't preach to me about discipline or sacrifices"".

She said ""so you're not happy for me. You've always been a jealous cow"", which annoyed me because she has a history assuming I’m jealous of her when I'm not. 

If she shows me her new purse and I say ""oh that's cute""she says ""jealous are we?"". No, I’m being polite? But if I say nothing or say the purse is not my style, she says I’m bitter. When she got married, she was like ""must be hard to deal with the jealousy of seeing my wedding when you're single"". You're 20 & marrying a guy who can't hold down a job because of his gaming addiction so no. It was the same when she got pregnant a year later. But when I said “No, you do you, but I’m still in University & not ready to get married/have children,” she’d be all “defensive much”. It’s infuriating and a big reason I tolerate rather than like her. 

I told her I’m not going to be happy for her until she admits that she lost weight the easy way, because preaching about discipline/sacrifice/exercise to those who worked hard to lose weight that way is hypocritical when she did it through surgery.

She's angry because a couple of my cousins have gone through Instagram & unliked her progress pictures & one left a comment that translates into ""#powerofexercise? more like #powerofweightlosssurgery"", hey Stephanie?"" I did not put her up to this, my cousin has never liked her because she’s always been rude to her.

This summer, however, she's started putting much more effort in. We speak more often, and she's started the good majority of our conversations. I got an invitation to her wedding two weeks ago, and the first thing I noticed is she used my first name.

My first name is very feminine. I am named after my mum's aunt, who passed the day I was born. I have chosen to go by my marginally more unisex middle name. I feel that I've made it clear I do not go by my first name. My Facebook is set to my middle and last names, my email is my middle and last names, etc. If we hadn't texted in a while, I would open the conversation with, ""Hey, Mum, it's \[insert middle name\].""

I texted her a photo of the invitation, and jokingly said, ""Lol who's \[insert first name\]... ;) I'm sure he'd be delighted to pass on the invite."" And Mum responded, calling me cheeky. I felt that things had been clarified.

Mum shows me the table settings she's made, with everybody's name on them, and the etymology of their names. Mine has my first name on it. I send, ""Looks good, Mum! Typo, though?"" And she says nothing. She shows me the party favors, which are basically the table settings but printed onto glass jars. Mine has my *first name*. I text her back, ""Very nice, Mum!! Did you do them handmade? BTW - I think mine is spelt incorrectly ;)"" She responds saying they're handmade, nothing about my name.

I came by and she showed me the family tree decor she made. Again, she uses my first name. I told her, ""Mum, that's not the name I use. You need to use my middle name, or you need to stop calling me by anything at all."" Mum explains she dislikes my middle name, and she wants to be honoring her auntie who passed. I tell her I hate that name, it was lovely on auntie, but not on me. She tells me too bad, it's what she'll call me. Literally calls me an asshole, and then her fiance gets involved, telling me I'm harsh on my mum for not being close with her. I tell them both to call me by my middle name, or nothing at all. They both say, ""Okay, fine, \[first name\].""

AITA for insisting that they use my middle name?",27,23,0.88
1822,Not the A-hole,"My relationship with my mom isn't great.  She had me when she was 17, my dad was 23, so we were very poor and I grew up knowing that I'd messed up her whole life by existing.  She used to scratch and slap and pinch me so hard I bruised, then berate me for crying and embarrassing her.  She abused me.  Just background.

I live across the country with my husband now, so I don't see my parents often.  Since we've started living so far away from each other she's decided to act like we're best friends, and nothing is messed up between us.  Whatever.  I go along with it because it's easier than pitching her into a rage by acting up.  I think a lot of people who have been abused will understand that, but I know many people will think I'm crazy for putting up with it.

She's been begging me to come visit for a year, I finally went, mostly just to get her to stop bugging me for it.  Well when I got there she wanted to go do a whole bunch of touristy stuff, and had me take a ton of pictures with her so that she can post them on Facebook and look like a good mom.  I think we took something like 75 photos of us over the 2.5 days I was there.  I was already annoyed that she was playing up ""I'm a great mom and my BABY came to visit me!!"" angle.

When I looked at the pictures she'd tagged me in after I got back home, I got really angry.  She's perfectly centered and clear in every one of them, and I'm cut off or blurred in all but one picture.  Some of the pictures look like she added tiltshift in Instagram just to blur me out.  She's in her 40s, it's not like she doesn't know how to use her phone's selfie camera.  She still went through the effort to tag me in every pic.

I'm pissed because I think this was a passive aggressive way to get to me.  My friends are saying that it was probably just a mistake and I'm being vain, it's not a big deal if I don't look good in vacation photos.  AITA?",34,103,0.95
1823,Not the A-hole,"I'm going to try and keep this kind of fuzzy for anonimities sake. I'm a nurse who works in a community setting - I see 10+ patients in a day, some for woundcare, some palliative (symptom management for those with progressive illnesses through end of life until death), and anything inbetween. I have 6 colleagues that I work with in a day and we each have our own area that we cover. 




The backbone of nursing is good documentation. Without it you're at risk of losing your license. It's drilled into our heads since day 1 in school, and is a very basic component and expectation of our job. 3 nurses I work with are negligent in their assessments and charting. They don't complete weekly wound measurements (the gold standard to ensure no deterioration occurs), they aren't ordering supplies for their patients, and they aren't completing thorough assessments. 



At the start I gave them gentle reminders about best practice, and offered constructive criticism on how they could improve. This didn't work, so I gave feedback to management (omitting names) on what I'm noticing so it could be discussed at our meetings. After numerous reminders and emails sent out over the span of months (by management) with no improvement I sat down frustrated, as their negligence resulted in more work for me and adverse effects for patients (as specific as I'd like to be.. But there were a few serious incidents where patients became upset to the point of tears as a result). 




After months of leeway I've started reporting any errors I catch directly to management including the name of the nurse. They finally listened, and sent out an email saying continued negligence will result in nurses being reprimanded up to and including termination + mandatory reporting to the nurse regulatory body in our province. This week I caught a TON of errors from one nurse in specific. Some smaller stuff: No wound measurements, not fully completing an admission chart, not ordering supplies on specified order days. Some bigger stuff, too: no vitals taken or a thorough pain assessment done (on a complex palliative patient.. There is no excuse for this), not answering patient page outs, etc. 




This eventually lead to this nurse having her first written warning in her employee file. I overheard her crying today, saying she's going to take a stress leave. I feel like I'm the cause. Yes, she continuously didn't complete basic tasks of her job, however I feel like a tattletale. 




Am I the asshole here?",76,339,0.96
1824,Not the A-hole,"This is a long one with plenty of small issues that build up to a bigger one. 

I work full time for my sister as a Special Needs Caretaker, both of her kids have severe autism and are the messiest most stressful children I’ve ever encountered. She booked a cruise a while ago (she invited me but I’m broke and going to be taking a full class load). Since I didn’t want to go, she invited the other Caretaker that works to help her kids, and I assume the caretaker is paying for her own portion of the ticket. The cruise is this November.

This November I will be neck deep in my last load of classes(online), each of which are necessary to graduate this year and infuriatingly expensive. 
I will also be moving into a new home with my boyfriend right around that time. It’s the first time I’ve ever moved out officially (still living with family), so I assume I’ll be quite stressed with the change and finding a new daily normal. 

If she has her way I’ll be staying with the kids 5 nights in a row and driving them to and from ABA therapy which is about 65 miles round trip each day. My only time off will be the 8 hours the kids are in therapy so if I want to see my SO it’ll be close to an hour drive or more to go home and see him and our pets, + he’ll be at work the hours I’ll actually be free to see him. 

When she brought up this cruise at the beginning of the year I told her all of this. I told her that I’d be stressed with school and in the middle of moving. I honestly don’t want to change my work schedule for her and my coworker to take off on a tropical cruise together leaving me to deal with the kids. I could maybe do one or two nights but she needs to find another caretaker anyways. AITA for standing my ground and telling her I’m not willing to do 5 nights in a row? If she doesn’t find someone else to help it either ruins my coworkers trip or my sisters, or I’ll probably sacrifice my mental health due to guilt and cave in to her request. 

Just a little add on, I do have caretaker burnout, I’m so ready to leave and find a better job that’s easier on my mental health, but I can’t risk finding another job right now until I can finish the 1k a month tuition bills, my savings are just too low. I’ll be gone and full on job hunting the day I graduate from college. (Which she knows)

Edit: I am paid for being a caretaker through the state, I make 11.65$ an hour but cannot clock over 40 hours. Essentially it would be me being paid for watching them during the day but not for staying overnight, and not any extra for compensation of gas money or mental/emotional fatigue.

Edit 2: So I stood my ground and told her she had two months to find an additional caretaker and absolutely refused to take on the 5 days myself, as well as addressed the fact that she wasn’t paying enough/considering enough hours. Things escalated quickly and I told her I was leaving and walked out. I have a weekend to calm down and talk over options but essentially I’m giving her a two months notice to find a permanent replacement for me while agreeing to assisting with _some_ of the hours while she’s on her trip. Im taking out an additional amount on my student loan instead of paying out of pocket to finish the school year and allow me a financial cushion to find a new job immediately.",108,627,0.96

1826,Not the A-hole,"So long story kinda short. When I was born my mom left me in the hospital. At the time she was a crackhead and getting high was more important than I. So she gave birth and left. I was a ward of the state until a family member could be found and agreed I take me. My grandmother ended up finding me & raising me. 

Now fast forward 33 years. I’m an adult with my own child. My mom has been in my life since then unfortunately. But it’s never anything good.  Numerous times she’s showed me that she does not care for me. And now that I’m older, I realize my mom really didn’t want me. I always thought it was because of her addiction. But she’s been clean over 20 years and still there’s a lot of hate and animosity towards me. I’ve asked her many times why she gave me up. But never a real answer. But her actions throughout the years definitely say i just didn’t want you. But because my grandmother was so big on family there was no way she was going to let me get lost in the system. So now my mom has a constant reminder of the child she didn’t want but is here anyways. Also she always told me my father was dead or jail for life. When really he was alive and well. I ending up meeting him when I was 19. 

So with all the negativity she brings in my life I’ve now blocked her. It’s been a few months but my life has been peaceful. But I always get someone who condones toxic behavior trying to guilt me stating “you only get one mother” but as far as I’m concerned, my “mother” was my grandmother. Who is no longer with us. My surrogate made her decision and it’s not my job to try and right her wrongs.",30,101,0.95

1828,Asshole,"Around 6 months ago I met a guy through mutual friends. We hit it off right away and started talking every day about how we were going to turn down some pretty big career opportunities to be together. Then out of nowhere he ghosted me.

Fast forward a little later and we were both at the same conference out of state along with some other mutual friends. I really wanted to see him so I started hitting him up and at first he seemed hesitant but eventually after I made it clear I wasn't looking for anything other than sex he agreed.

We ended up sleeping together and then in the morning he told me he had sex with a mutual acquaintance the night before and he was dming one of our other friends!! I was hurt but ultimately asked to keep it a secret to keep the others from finding out.

A few weeks later we were at a different conference and I just couldn't believe that all the girls there were all over him. I decided to tell everyone about our hookup anyways and how hurt my feelings were. I think I was disrespected and that he should have known better, but some people are saying I had no right to talk about him because its ruining his relationships with other people. They are also saying that I was trying to save face and that I took our relationship too seriously. So, reddit, Am I The Asshole for telling everyone what he did?",53,556,0.96

1830,Asshole,"So, I tend to mumble sometimes or say things to myself in a low voice. My boyfriend often asks me to repeat myself. Sometimes I do this annoying thing where I pretend like I didn't say anything or just tell him it was not to worry about it. He brought up that it bugs him when I do that. We had this whole conversation about it and I agreed to just repeat myself instead of being extra for no reason. This was a couple weeks ago.

Yesterday, we were talking and I said something to myself in a low voice  He asked ""What?""And I said ""Nithing"". He tries asking again and I ,again, respond with ""Nothing"". He then yells at me ""You're so fucking annoying. What the fuck did you say"" in the most aggresive tone I've ever heard him use. I told him not to talk to me like that and left. 

He then texted me saying I was being an ass for not repeating myself and making him feel stupid even after we've had a conversation about it before.

1831,Not the A-hole,"We booked a family ski trip to Utah last spring with my family and my SIL and BIL's family. My family had been skiing for the last few years and were decently good at it. The rest of the family were newbies who had never gone skiing before. My wife doesn't really like to ski and usually plans a girls trip when I take the kids for a ski trip.

We get to the ski resort right when it opens and buy our lift passes(full day). We have our own equipment that we managed to haul all the way over here. So we start skiing and my wife decides to take a beginners lesson since she hasn't been skiing in forever. 

The beginners were at the base doing the basic exercises. It was a warm day (39F) and it was sunny. I knew that this was not the day to dress in 3 layers and cover every bit of skin. I warned the rest of the group and they didn't listen. They were sweating their asses off and they called it quits after lunch. They decided to go back to the hotel, rest and head out to go sight seeing. My wife followed them since she wasn't a big fan of skiing anyways. Me and my kids had bought lift passes for the full day and had no intention of leaving early. As we left the resort the convo went like this.

SIL: Really, your gonna stay when all of us are leaving

Me: yeah, I bought tickets for the full day..

BIL: Seriously, let it go. I'll venmo you whatever you payed for the ticket

Me: uhh well I still want to get a few runs in I'll come back for dinner

The rest if our group agreed and me and my kids went skiing. Later when I got back to the hotel to meet up for dinner, everybody was pissed off at me. They said I was selfish and made the vacation revolve around my needs rather than the rest of the groups. AITA for continuing to ski and not stay with the groups plans. They are still pissed about this and refuse to go an any vacation with my family and bring it up at least once per family event.",38,97,0.95

1833,Not enough info,"First time posting on this sub, so apologies if I don't do everything right. With that out of the way, I think a little backstory is important.

Edit - This may be important, may not be but sometimes I see things (this sounds crazy but uh 'visions') I vaguely knew the guy in the post from years back but have never talked to him. One day I had a random vision that this guy had committed suicide and for some reason the police thought I knew something about it (think of it like a vivid daydream unprompted) anyway a day or two after this he followed me on instagram and messaged me out of the blue. This creeped me out and although I knew we weren't that compatible that weird vision intrigued me and so I continued talking to him starting a friendship.

I used to be close friends with a guy (we'd talk daily for hours) and catch up in real life pretty frequently. He has a pretty serious disease that requires frequent doctor/hospital appointments. One day he moved countries and after only talking online I realised we were pretty incompatible; he hated conflict and would shut down/get annoyed if we disagreed over the smallest thing (to be fair I can be pretty intense and do enjoy friendly arguments, however I tried to tone things down with him). He also had a habit of blocking me whenever he needed a break from talking (with little to no warning before he blocked me). An example of an argument he blocked me over - I told him that I still counted Pluto as a planet despite it not technically being one and he found that stupid. This blocking would happen frequently and I explained its a pretty rude habit, it means that I can't talk to him when I need advice/help and that I didn't like him deciding if/when we talked (when he did unblock me it was usually because he needed to vent)

One day we had a pretty stupid argument In which he told me it was bad for me to date older guys because if my parents died, my older boyfriend would gain custody of me. I told him thats ridiculous and unlikely to happen and he threatened to block me. Exasperated I blocked him first wholly content to stop being friends, as at this point our whole friendship was immature and not worth it anymore.

That was months ago. This morning a random account messaged me, it turned out to be him asking me to unblock him. When I asked why he told me he's in a really bad place mentally and needs a friend to talk to. Although I knew this was probably related to his disease I politely informed him that I didn't consider us friends, that I hope he gets better and that I suggest he talks to one of his brothers/therapist/an actual friend. He hasn't replied.

When I told my sister what had happened she implied i'm an asshole, that it was mean to deny help when he was clearly in a troubled state and that it wouldn't have hurt to listen to him vent. I feel a little mean but I think I'm justified so reddit, AITA?

tl;dr - I blocked an old friend who used to frequently block me, months later he asked I unblock him because he's in a really bad state mentally and would appreciate a friend, I told him we aren't friends.

Edit - a few of you are questioning about the 'bf' there is no boyfriend. I am 16 (of legal age in my country) there is no older guy nor has there been (nor would I really want there to be). This was a hypothetical scenario that was taken way out of hand, not real.",47,31,0.86
1834,Everyone Sucks,"Here's the background. My SO and toddler and I currently live with my FIL. The arrangement is temporary, offered by the FIL to help us save money after we both separated from the military and are waiting for school to start at which time we will have education benefits and be on our own.

We try to save money, what's left from saving during our time in, I tend to be better at that than my SO but that may be why I come across as the asshole. 

My FIL is constantly taking the food that we buy, and we cook, and eating it all. Sometimes he asks, but it's taken a lot to get him to the point of asking. He has his own food which we don't touch. He has a pension and so money still coming in. We don't, we can't get a job yet because we're about to move in a month. However since he doesn't charge us rent (although we are paying for his house cleaner while here, and we do all the house chores, and plant watering) my SO thinks that we owe it to him to allow him to eat our food. I disagree, I appreciate the free rent but I don't feel I owe him anything. 

Does this make me the asshole?

Edit: I think that no matter how ungrateful you all may think I am, I asked if I'm an asshole for not sharing my food, not for my perceived ""ungratefulness"" which you're all so hung up on.  FYI I'm obviously grateful! Doesn't mean I want to share my food.",30,32,0.89
1835,Not the A-hole,"My 19-year-old daughter lives at home with me, and has a 1-year old daughter. During her last year of high school, I supported the baby financially (she did the hands-on stuff, raising of the child) so she could focus solely on school and getting her high school diploma. She had told me she didn’t want to go to college, so I said she’d have to get a job to help with expenses. I’d help her pay for daycare, but she’d have to start contributing.

Now, I did know that she smokes some pot. It’s illegal without a medical marijuana card in our state, but I wasn’t too pressed about it to begin with because she doesn’t do it in front of the baby and only smokes with her friends when she goes out. She obviously can’t afford pot and I won’t give her money for it (I go out and buy the stuff the baby needs with her, so I know she’s not spending the baby money on pot). So, she doesn’t do it often, only when she goes out with friends and they supply it, which isn’t often since she had the little one.

Recently, she applied for a job at a grocery store and she got an interview. She told me they really liked her and were eager to hire her, all she had to do was take a drug test. She hadn’t been out with her friends in a while, so I figured she would be fine. A few weeks passed since the interview and I asked if she had heard back. She said no. I encouraged her to call, because they had been so enthusiastic and now radio silence. So, she called and then told me she failed her drug test. I was confused and asked when she smoked pot. She said her friend had given her some as a gift and she had done it one day when I took the baby out, not long before the test but after she knew she had to take it. She said it was such a low amount, she didn’t think it’d show up on the test.

I was pretty pissed. I don’t care if she smokes, but if it’s a company policy, it’s a company policy and how could she not realize it would show up? How could she sabotage a good job opportunity (this store pays above minimum wage, one of the few in our state who does and treats it’s employees great, it’s not a forever job, but it’s a damn good job for someone with a high school diploma)?

Finally, I asked her if she had anymore pot and she said yes. She brought it to me and I told her I was going to be getting rid of it. I said she was to be applying to jobs every single day and prove to me that she was doing so.

My wife thinks I’m being too harsh for a one-time mistake. I don’t think so. I think this was a dumbass choice and that she ruined a good thing. She can smoke pot, when a drug test isn’t an option. My daughter also finds this unfair, but has been following up on what I asked.

Am I being an ass?

&#x200B;

ETA: People are asking why a grocery store is drug testing. She’s not working a regular cashier job, she applied to work in the back, where heavy machinery is involved (she was going to be taking tests, getting licenses, etc.). That’s why they drug tested. You can’t do drugs and operate heavy machinery.",345,4276,0.96

1837,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed I may be a bad sister and daughter. 

So I am getting married and am thrilled about that, but when I think of the events I should look forward to, suddenly I dread them a bit because I have a sibling who ridicules me. An example is that she generally makes derisive comments about my appearance like the subtle ""this is too big for me... maybe you want it"" or more outright ""some of us care about our bodies,  so won't eat that crap. it's why you look like that"" usually referencing trying something like cheese (she's an off and on vegan, but thinks dairy is bad) or a dessert at family gatherings. It's not just weight she focuses on, but it's her favorite. 

Here's the thing though, I'm in good shape (i'm a decent swimmer and runner with a petite build) and neither of us has ever been overweight. I feel this comes from her past with eating disorders and current mental health issues, so she lashes out to make herself feel better. And I still love her, but I won't lie it doesn't make me want to hang out with her. 

BUT my mother says I only have one sister and thinks I'm being unfair by not inviting her to shop for a dress.  She believes my sister is changing so I should trust her to behave, despite her mental health crisis just last week and that she sabotaged a family trip, causing drama by skipping at the last minute in weeks prior (I wasn't there so am taking my father's and extended family's word as true). My sister is fun sometimes and has good points, so I am considering it. I mentioned her opinion to my fiance, but he said she makes him worry about me (she sometimes threatens to hit), and her meltdown last week we both have a difficult time seeing her as a mature adult who won't cause problems. I think it's nice he's supportive,  but he's clearly biased because he doesn't want me to be hurt- he probably doesn't care if i'm a shit sister. 

I know it's selfish,  but I really would like to just be happy and not be anxious about snide comments made while buying a dress.  It's incredibly shallow, but I just want to feel confident and I never feel that way knowing that my sister may come in with another ""You were always the smart one, so who cares if you're not pretty?"" It sounds weird but I live far away from family  and usually  feel great about myself and my looks and I have a hard time when she's around. It makes me just want to ensure I'll have quality time with my mom with no one to pick on me or start crying about every lunch place being bad for her diet, because I hardly see my mom and just want to have fun with her this time. Yes, it's such a little thing,  but it's how I feel.

TLDR: I'm getting married and buying a wedding dress.  Am I a massive butt if I don't invite my sister who picks on my appearance out of my selfish desire to enjoy the experience with my mom and feel confident in the dress we pick?",53,51,0.88

1839,Asshole,"EDIT: As I've said retrospectively I'd like to acknowledge that this post is pretty emotionally charged and I DO NOT view this as something that he ""did"" to me. He didn't do anything to me, to hurt me, i was just having an emotional response to his course of actions which has affected my side of the relationship or at the very least how I feel I can approach it. I think a lot of what could be an interesting discussion is getting bogged down in reminding me that ""he's an adult"". I get that.

Disclaimer: I am 26 now so this isn't unfolding right now but I have always wondered what others may think.

Backstory- I have always been close with my dad. He was my best friend growing up and I considered him a best friend even into my twenties. We had a very honest relationship with mutual respect and love for one another.
When my mum passed away my dad and I were  distraught.

My dad (55yo) then 'fell in love' with someone who was, at the time, my age- 24yo. I didn't know the girl or have mutual friends with her. To my knowledge this relationship is sexual.
They have now been in a relationship for a bit over 18 months.
Just as a side note, I'm not really interested in discussing the details as to how this relationship came about.

Anyway, this ruined me. Importantly (to me), my dad is aware that this would ruin me. I felt like this was disrespectful to me and my mum. I felt like I didn't even know this man anymore. I feel like I have gone through every possible thought experiment to try to come to grips with this situation but I still feel like the dad I knew would not do this to me, no matter how much he was grieving.
My thought process is that he is grieving, I am grieving and I would not do something that I knew would hurt my dad and potentially affect our relationship in order to regain happiness for myself.

My boyfriend at the time, however, completely disagreed. His perspective is that if I love my dad I will accept him for who he is and support him through this time of grief and however he tries to find happiness. 
I haven't been able to face my dad. I can't even talk to him on the phone because I feel like there's always an elephant in the room. I've put distance between myself and him as I've tried to come to terms with this and my bf views this as me ""disowning"" him in his time of need.
I don't think I disowned him, I think he chose a path and knowingly created a tear in our relationship.

So... AITA for ""disowning"" my dad for having a relationship with a girl my age?",580,427,0.91

1842,Not the A-hole,"Several years ago, we fostered a teenager through his senior year of high school and into community college. Our only requirement for him to stay with us after he aged out of the system was that he needed to be enrolled in school. We also charged him ""rent"" the summer after high school ($300/month) which we put into an account for him and gave to him when he moved out so he had some move out money. Because of his status as a foster child, he gets free college tuition in state so school and books were covered and his money just went towards living expenses. We did the usual ""parent"" things and paid for prom tickets, field trips, and that kind of stuff while he was living with us.   


Things were pacing on track, but right in the middle of his first semester of community college, he decided he was going to move in with his girlfriend, drop out of school, and start working. My husband and I were pretty disappointed, but he was an adult so we had no real say in the matter. We gave him his money and off he went. Soon after, they had a baby. The three of them have stopped by to visit from time to time and I've sent them baby gifts, but that's the extent of the relationship. From what I gather, the relationship has been pretty rocky.   


This past week, he reached out to us and asked if he and his girlfriend and baby could move in with us again. He quit his job, re-enrolled and then dropped out of school, totaled his car, and is just not sure what to do and wants to crash at our house until he can figure out what to do.   


We talked about it, and while we want what is best for him, his GF, and especially that baby, we just don't feel like we could take on two 20-somethings and a baby in our house, especially if they're not working. I don't know how we'd be able to afford it and the three of them would be living in one bedroom. I think all five of us would just be miserable. It was one thing when it was just him as a kid and he went to school and was in track and cross country after school, but I don't know if we could do two more, including an infant.   


We told him we'd be happy to help him put a plan together, find emergency housing, edit a resume, get back on track with school, and so on...but we just couldn't have him and his girlfriend/baby come live with us.   


Are we being assholes? Especially because there's a baby involved?",32,79,0.9
1843,Asshole,"This is my first ever post on this sub and I figured it's probably a good idea to use a throwaway so I don't give my wife another reason to be pissed at me. 

She was hosting a party at our house on Saturday. It was honestly more of a work event and she was super excited about it because she wanted it be our first ""mature"" party (meaning their were cocktails/wine as opposed to a keg, little sandwiches as opposed to pizza and our new hot tub was off limits so no bikinis either...I was joking with her that it sounded like the ""no-fun-arty"" which she found mildly amusing the first time I said it but the next 10000, not so much). 

So she got home Friday and worked until almost 2AM preparing and storing all the food she wanted to serve. There was some sort of work emergency at 7AM so she had to go in and I didn't even realize she was gone until I woke up at about 10. She texted me at like 5 and said she was having the most awful day ever and said she was thinking about cancelling the party. I told her that I would help in whatever way I could. She said it would be awesome if I cleaned up. 

I know me and my wife have very different cleaning standards but I very honestly did the best I could. I cleaned up all our mail that accumulates, cleaned the bathroom to what I thought was spotless, wiped down the kitchen and even started to warm up all the food she prepared. 

She ended up getting home at 6:45 and jumped right in the shower. Guests started showing up at 7 and it didn't even occur to me that I was still wearing my dirty cleaning clothes as I was greeting and chatting with her guests.  

She came out and in a stern ""mom voice"" she demanded to talk to me in the bed room. She laid into me like no one's business. I mean a brief laundry list of all my offenses: 

1. not wearing appropriate clothes. She didn't give me credit that I had been cleaning right until 7 because:

2. There was dog hair apparently everywhere, including the couch and there were piles of where it builds up next to the furniture. I had completely forgot to vacuum and everyone was getting dog hair on their clothes from sitting on the couch. 

3. I guess I missed some huge pee spots on the toilet.

4. I had missed her text that I needed to go get ice. 

5. I guess instead of warming up these salmon/cream cheese wheels I was just supposed to take them out but I put them in the oven and ruined them. 

6. and she reminded me of no-fun-arty.

Even with all that, the party went off just fine but it's Wednesday now and she is still made at me and says that my behavior and the jokes in the weeks leading up to the party show that I didn't even care how much it meant to her and my behavior that day makes her think I don't even care about her. 

Was I the asshole?",353,497,0.89

1845,Not the A-hole,"My newly single friend (30F) met a man (32M), and she came over to tell me about him.  He was a new customer at her workplace and he chatted her up, leaving his number.  They went for dinner at an upscale restaurant this past weekend.  She just got through a messy breakup with her son Charlie's (4M) father last month and has been really down about that, so it was nice to see her this happy.

We were having a nice visit until she threw in ""Charlie didn't seem to like \[new guy\] and refused to talk the whole time.""  I asked her what she was talking about and how they had a chance to meet.  She admitted she took him along on the date.  I was floored.  Just a minute ago she was confiding excitedly that they had been hugging and kissing on said date, so it would be apparent to Charlie that this isn't just mom's friend.

She asked me what was wrong, so I told her I was shocked and thought that she shouldn't introduce them again until she knows the guy really well.  She laughed, saying, ""No, no, it's okay.  I was talking to \[new guy\] at \[workplace\] and he said he loves kids.  He was totally cool with it!""  Again, I was floored that her mind automatically went to considering new guy's feelings but not those of her child.

I was probably a little harsh, but I told her this was about Charlie.  The kid is 4 and his parents broke up a month ago.  You don't take him on your first date with some guy you don't know, and then hug and kiss in front of him while he's too upset to even speak.  That's the kind of stuff that emotionally scars a kid. I felt like I needed to speak up for Charlie who is a sweet and very shy boy.

She sees nothing wrong with it.  Her defense is she wants to spend as much time as she can with her son, so on the days she has him he's coming along on her dates.  She said ""It's not like I'd fuck a guy in front of him.  I'm not doing anything inappropriate, why are you being like this?""  I feel so sorry for the kid being exposed this intimately to his mother's dating life, and I told her so.  She asked me why I can't just be happy for her, told me it's not my place to judge how she parents her child and then stormed off.

I don't know if the friendship is salvageable.  I don't think I did anything wrong by standing up for Charlie, but my husband says I was out of line and that I should have stayed quiet.  Is my outrage warranted or AITA who needs to mind her own business and keep her mouth shut?",300,3492,0.96

1848,Asshole,"I feel like I probably am, but I wanted an unbiased opinion from people who don’t know me or her.

She and I were arguing back and forth about a handful of things that both of us didn’t do well communicating (if the argument matters for context, she refuses to take care of the dog we both want which made me upset, she told me I need to stop doing things like waiting until the check engine light in the car goes from yellow to red, for instance, and other forms of procrastination). It got a little heated likely from built-up tension on both sides, I’m not asking whose the asshole for fighting though. I think we both could have handled it better.

My question comes down to this: while we were fighting she said, “you should be careful how you speak to your wife” (I think this is the best english translation of it) and I said back, “I didn’t realize my first wife would be so uppity” and she just left the house at that. I don’t know where she went and she didn’t even take her phone, just her wallet. I’m worried about her but I meant it as more of a joke and I want her to know she didn’t need to react that bad, I won’t say it again.
I’ll tell her this when I see her again.

So... AITA for saying this?

EDIT: To clarify because a lot of people singled the word out, I didn’t realize the word “uppity” had the connotations that it does in English. The word I used was closer to “dominant.”

EDIT 2: My wife was out all evening/night with a friend but came home early this morning safely. I apologized to her and we talked a lot. and I wanted to thank those who call me asshole even the ones who did it not as nicely because I was still trying to convince myself what I said was not so bad, but I see now it was and I was lying to myself because I didn’t want to be wrong. I’m told I’m a very stupid man by many people I meet, and my parents and brothers, (my wife has never said this though) and I feel like this is right in these moments, I am a stupid man but she forgives me.",132,236,0.88
1849,Not the A-hole,"My sister (28) and I (21F) moved in together in January so that I could help her get back on her feet. Prior to that, we both had our own places so our parents thought moving in together would help us save money. Or so we thought.

My sister has a history of making TERRIBLE choices \[in men, friends and life\] and my family basically cut her off because they got fed up.

Last December she came over to my mother's house when I was visiting for the holidays and gave us a whole story \[tears and all\] about how she was ready to turn her life around and how she's made some very bad choices and she's ready to change. She told my mom that the guy she keeps messing with, who keeps abusing her, came to her apartment and they physically fought. She said she's done with him for good and she wished he didn't know where she lived anymore. She said she was struggling to pay rent, bills, buy groceries etc. ***She reallly got us good.***

***She didn't mention that the situation escalated because he found her in bed with another man.*** Basically, whenever something happens to her she'd lie and leave out important details to make herself seem like the victim, even when she has done something ridiculous or wrong. **She is not entirely a victim. A lot of what happens to her is because of her own STUPID choices.** So when my mom heard about the fight and saw her crocodile tears, she suggested that my sister and I move in together to a new apartment. That way the guy wouldn't know where she stayed and we could save money by renting together.

I told her in front of our parents, ""I'm trusting you. If I see this guy, I'm out."" **She agreed.**

***Within a week, he was there.*** She and I had an argument about it. She decided to be petty and say that if her bf couldn't come over, mine couldn't either. My bf was in New York atm and wouldn't be home for another 3 months. So I agreed. No one's bf was allowed to come over.

She starts bringing random guys over to the apartment to link up because apparently she's ""lonely"". I told her I'm not comfortable with it because her choice in men is very questionable and... do you really need to bring several guys home in one week? You live with you younger sister FOR FUCK'S SAKE. 

***She ignores me, and keeps bringing guys AND her abusive boyfriend.*** 

She also goes out drinking several times a week, often coming home \[with people\] drunk. She never has money to put toward the grocery bill, the internet bill or the lights and she is always shorting on the rent. Which leaves me, the little sister, to pick up the slack.

Her boyfriend showed up unannounced one day, snuck around the back of the apartment and caught her with another guy AGAIN and they fought AGAIN. The guy who she got caught with stood there and did nothing.

I moved out without telling her that I planned to and left her to sort her shit out. Now she's not talking to me anymore and it's still in my mind that I was possibly being selfish... so AITA?",41,106,0.93
1850,No A-holes here,"I have a 20 mile drive between work and home. About 7-8 miles of that is a stretch through a pretty desolate wooded area. Has a lot of curves so is also popular with motorcyclists.

&#x200B;

This happened last week while I was returning from work about 7:30-8:00 in the evening, around that time when it starts to get dark. I am in this stretch when turning around a corner, I see a man lying on the shoulder with a motorcycle lying about 40-50 yards ahead.  Because of the tricky curves and somewhat hilly terrain it is an accident prone zone, specially for motorcyclists, and wipeouts are also common. I couldn't really tell how badly he was injured as he was in full sports biker gear with a helmet, but he appeared to be moving about. Kinda writhing.

&#x200B;

After seeing this man, I pulled out my phone but as expected given the area, cell coverage is spotty and my call to 911 didn't go through. Generally speaking the working advice is for nearby residents is, if someone is injured, don't call 911, just drive them out of the area as getting through to 911 is next to impossible there and you can lose precious time.

&#x200B;

Now comes the difficult part, given the desolate nature of this stretch with a lot of blind spots and corners to hide, it is also known for ambush robberies and in the past there have been a fair number of instances where people have stopped to help what they thought was someone in distress only to have been ambushed and robbed. Its bad enough that the county installed camera's. They're not really monitored actively, but they do record and about a day's worth of footage can be obtained.

&#x200B;

I slowed down to take a better look but given the dusky conditions, it didn't help. Basically it was fifty-fifty chance it could get either of the two scenarios.

&#x200B;

Not sure what was really up I kept driving, redialing 911 till I got to a point where I can proper cell reception, took about 10-15 minutes before I could get through and I gave them the necessary info and they said they'll send an ambulance and police to look into it.

&#x200B;

Couple of days later, I bumped into a buddy of mine who's one of the Sheriff's deputy, I told him what had happened and he let me know that someone was injured, he was the one who'd gotten the call. He hadn't known it was me who called it in. The motorcyclist had cut himself when he collided with the guardrail. The ambulance did find him alive, but he  passed about 5 minutes from the hospital.

&#x200B;

This thing has been weighing on me since I found out what happened. Me assuming the worst resulted in a man dying on the side of the road. I told a few close family and friends about what had happened and how I'd reacted. When I ask if I did anything wrong, I only get complete silence.

1851,Not the A-hole,"So a few years ago I told my best friend that I’m gay and told her about my current relationship with another girl. I told her she wasn’t allowed to tell anyone else and she told me she’s bad at secrets when I asked her not to tell anyone. I insisted she keep my secret and she said she would try. 

A few days later my mom calls me into another room, she tells me everything I told my best friend. Then she asked me if it was true. I panicked because I don’t know what they would think. They’re republicans and Christian, so naturally I was scared. 

I told her that maybe I was confused so that I didn’t have to tell them I was gay. She told me she does think I’m confused and hugged me and told me not to tell anyone that I might be gay. 

A couple of months later I met up with my best friend, and I asked her if it was her that told my mom. She said that she told HER mom my severed and that her mom told my mom. I was and still am mad at her for indirectly outing me, though I’m not sure it’s actually her fault. 

However, what really got to me is when I told her how I just figured I should get to pick how I tell my family and when. She told me that nothing went horribly wrong so “you’re welcome.” That made me really mad, but I didn’t let her know. She left soon after that.

My family knowing I’m gay because of this situation, has caused many hurtful comments and jokes. And encouragement that I hide who I am because of what people might think. I always get constant comments from my father that I’m going to change. I hate it.

AITA for being mad at her after all this time for putting me?",35,31,0.86
1852,Asshole,"I’m 28 a female. My boyfriend is 28. We’ve been together 3 years. I’m 5”4 Over the past year I’ve went from 137 pounds to 153. I’ve gained 17 lbs in a year which is unhealthy. I exercise and am attempting to shed the excessive weight. Most of it is from changing birth controls . Mirena to depo back to Mirena. Depo is known to make people gain weight. I was one of them. I’m not the most comfortable at this weight and I realize that’s no ones issue but my own. 

Here’s where it’s a little tmi. While getting intimate with my boyfriend he decided to blurt out that I look like I lost weight in my stomach. I was pretty ticked off because who says that during sex. I don’t make comments like that on his body. He will offhandedly ask if he’s loosing weight, which he is, in non sexual scenarios. That’s the only time I will comment. 

I’m very upset because he knows I just got into an argument with a nurse practitioner. I had the start of cervical cancer last year and that was stressful. She cut off my concerns about my weight gain by saying it must be something I’m doing to myself ( gorging myself on food, lack of exercise.) I work in a nursing home walking 4+ miles a day, then work our at home. He knows how upset and uncomfortable she made
Me. He also knows everything my body has been through with biopsies, a leep, a failed pregnancy miscarried at 3 months.

I ceased all sexual activity and said now is not the time to be making comments like that. That’s not cool. I’m still pretty upset: he said he meant is at a compliment. I feel like that was an  incredibly stupid comment to make when someone is in a vulnerable, nude state. Way to make someone self conscious.

1853,Not the A-hole,"I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. It was obviously unexpected, but especially because I’m quite young. However, it was caught early, the doctors are optimistic. My parents, brother, girlfriend and two very close friends (who are pretty much the sisters I never had) were the only people I chose to tell. I asked them that they please not tell anyone else for now. When you tell something to either side of my extended family, it’s like playing a game of telephone. My cousin had to get her gallbladder removed and somehow it got around that she was getting a hysterectomy. I also didn’t want to worry anyone and wanted to come up with a plan first, at the time I hadn’t even decided how I wanted to go treatment wise. So again, especially considering my family and stories, I wanted to wait.

Then, I got a Facebook message from my mom’s cousin a few days after I told my family, letting me know that she’s here for me and anything I need, she’s in my corner. I was so confused and then it dawned on me. I asked who told her. She said my grandfather. Now, my grandfather is the last person I wanted to worry with this. He’s elderly, got his own health shit and I was going to talk to him about it in my own way. I talked to my mom and she said, all she did was tell her brother. I’m not even close to my uncle and neither is she. But my grandfather is close with his nieces, so of course it’s spread like wildfire through my mom’s family and my grandfather knows one of my dad’s brothers and called him, to talk about it. And just like I feared, everyone’s in a tizzy because I didn’t get to control how the news went out.

I was so pissed at my mother. I told her that she had no right. She said that I’m her daughter and that she’s going through a hard time right now too. I said I get that, but then she can talk about it with my dad (her husband) or my brother. She knew what this would start and knew I wanted to avoid it. Life has calmed down and I'm not so mad at her anymore, but there are times my phone gets blown up with texts that could've been avoided if we just waited like I wanted and then  I get mad all over again.

1854,No A-holes here,"Anonymous account for me:

My wife's son is 18 and on his second attempt at graduating high school this year. He's been going to a secondary school for ""second chances"" because of his low effort in school work and attendance, plus other incidences. His current school schedule is from 8am to noon. The rest of the day he's pretty much been on his Xbox playing games. He doesn't have his license because it wasn't something we said he could get until he had a job to help pay for insurance (ridiculously high around here), but there are plenty of entry/retail employment opportunities within walking or biking distance. We've talked and he's been told he needs a job, anything to assist with car insurance if he wants to drive, or even consider moving out like he's talked about. We pay his cell phone and won't cut that because they are pretty much necessary and it's only $30/month. We've also noticed a big increase in electrical bills because of his constant Xbox playing, yes it does make a difference, almost $3/day. We've mentioned this a couple times and he brushes it off. He would stay up all night, till 4am playing games before passing out, and not waking up on time to get to the bus, so Mom has to take him. Not only does that take away from her job, but mine as well some times. I recently blocked all Internet access at home to his Xbox, laptop and Roku via the router settings. All devices lose access after midnight till 6am, in the attempt to make him get to bed and get up on time. I left it open during the day so he can do homework after classes, but he was warned that if his habits don't change the cutoff time would extend into the day.

1856,Not the A-hole,"So, a couple of days back my family (mom, step-dad, sister, and aunt) and I were hanging out in the living room. It all started with my mom mentioning something to my sister about getting some help with switching to a new TV satellite provider or a service of the sort. So, I said something like, “well, I guess you have to ask yourself what it is that you want? Are there specific channels that you are looking to have? Or do you get what you need from a service like Hulu or Netflix? Whatever your answer is will dictate your decision on what path to follow.” This is going to sound random, but I don’t know if it was the amount of questions she was getting, but she started raising her voice at me and my sister. At which point I asked, “why are you yelling at us? We’re just trying to help you like you asked.” So she says that we’re not helping or providing her any information, which I did by telling her all of her options and literally asking her which she preferred, and she said that she’s not yelling, while clearly yelling, and saying, “this is just how I talk. I have a loud tone.” And I told her that while she is a loud speaker that she had clearly raised her tone since the conversation started. So to lighten things up my sister says, “I still love you, mom” and laughs. So then my mom responds with, “I don’t care.” So, that prompted me to say, “damn, that’s kind of a messed up thing to say..” so she starts yelling more and then basically accuses us of calling her selfish and embarrassing her in front of our aunt. I told her she was free to feel how she did, but to not lie about things that I clearly did not say. She’s in tears at this point. I remained calm throughout the entire conversation and apologized if I intruded by offering help when she had asked my sister for help. But I also told her that I didn’t embarrass her, that her own actions did and that she should take ownership of that.

This was supposed to be temporary until she got back on her feet and got her own place. 

It's now August of the following year and she's still sleeping on an air mattress in my living room. Since I was trying to help her get back on her feet and this was only temporary, I only asked her to pay a small portion of the rent.

1859,Not the A-hole,"Basically the title says it all. 

My parents are old/retired and I currently pay the mortgage on the house we all live in. 

My father made the decision to invite my newly immigrant family members to stay with us until they can establish their selves in our country. This will take about 6months - 1year as each family member will be coming at separate times. They’re coming from a third world country and speak absolutely no English. There’s 6 family members (2 parents, 4kids) and all of them are over 18.

Now normally I would perfectly alright with this. It’s just - my father made the decision without consulting me or anyone else in the house except my younger brother. And, I don’t think my father understands the responsibility it takes to help establish a family coming from a completely different culture/country. It’s almost like having more kids but their adults. 

You have to teach them English, drive them everywhere, cook for them, teach them the culture, and pay for their expenses until they can pay for them themselves. 

My parents were once in the same situation and depended on the kindness of other people to help establish them. My father is arguing that “he’s been in the same situation so he knows how hard it is.” So, I do partly feel bad but - I’m not embarrassed to say that I don’t want to deal with this responsibility. I want to be able to come home after a long day and not have to worry about other people in the house. And, I already know the responsibility will fall on me because my parents are old and can’t do much. 

Nonetheless, I got into a huge argument with my father and my other family members got involved. There saying I’m selfish for refusing to allow them to stay at our house. And, that I’m incredibly privileged because I was born in my country and my house is big enough to fit more people inside. All my family members (cousins, uncles, aunts) think I’m being selfish but no one else is willing to invite them into their homes. 

So reddit, AITA for refusing to let my newly immigrant family members stay at my house?

The sponsorship program did take 2 years to be approved but I wasn’t aware of it, until just recently.

1860,Not enough info,"My (25f) sister (18f) Sandy is starting college in a few weeks, and needs a laptop. Since last summer she has been pushing to buy a MacBook, and it has been a constant ongoing fight. My parents don’t have a ton of money to spend (my dad is disabled and my mom supports her and my other siblings still at home), but still try to get her what she wants. This includes spending $1000 on her senior prom (dress, hair makeup, limo etc) and another $1000 on her grad party (venue, food, decorations, etc). 

Since I know technology a bit better than they do, they asked me to help Sandy get a computer. She insists that she needs the top of the line MacBook which is selling for $2400. 

She told me that the main reasons she wants them are because everyone says they’re good computers, and that they look really nice. She’s an aspiring instagram influencer so I’d guess that’d help with her brand. She is also thinking of going into graphic design, but it isn’t her major now. Her college has high end Mac computers in their computer lab with all of the programs she would need, and friends who are graphic designers have said that PCs have all of the programs anyways. 

Sandy has about $5000 saved, which would cover the first semester of tuition. Basically whatever she spends on the laptop, my parents will need to cover for the rest of her tuition. Because she views the laptop as one she’s buying with her money, she thinks that she should be able to buy whatever one she wants. 

I did some research and found a few laptops in the $1100 range that have the exact same specs as the Mac she wants, but she won’t budge. When she, my mom and I visited Best Buy to look at the computers I showed her, she went straight to the Apple section to show me how much better they would be and didn’t really pay attention when I showed her the equally if not better PC laptops. She insisted she only wanted a Mac and wouldn’t even consider the others. My mom and I explained how money is tight and that she can’t afford to pay for such an expensive laptop when there are others that are just as good, and it turned into a huge blowout. 

Now, Sandy has found a used MacBook Air online for $1500. Since it’s marked down quite a bit, she would like to buy it. My mom won’t let her get it unless I also give the approval. 

I still think she should get a new PC laptop for $1100 instead of a used MacBook. WIBTA if I told her that she couldn’t get it?

TL;DR my sister wants to get a $1500 used Mac,  but after months of arguing I want to put my foot down and say she needs to buy a new PC laptop for $1100 instead. WIBTA if I did?",397,319,0.94

1862,Not the A-hole,"My mother and I don’t have the best relationship. We grew up in poverty and my parents both struggled to make ends meet working multiple jobs. When I was in high school, we received a settlement from an injury claim that was put in a trust. This allowed my parents to fund their new lifestyle, spoil my younger siblings, buy new cars, build a house etc., without working (trust paid them to be caregivers). Once the money from the trust was no longer available (about 3 yrs ago), my parents didn’t curb their excessive lifestyle. Both of my parents work and make decent money now but are chased by debt collectors and balancing payday loans. My parents currently live in FL with my youngest 3 siblings and have two homes in Ohio that my siblings, nieces, and grammy live in. 

I am 24, married with 2 kids, and own a house. I was a surrogate and have a little nest egg from that. My husband and I make 120k a year and easily afford everything we want. My twin sister works as an accountant for the government. My mom constantly asks us to loan her money and currently owes my sister close to 1k. My brother lives in Japan, but he and his wife purchased a home and allow her to pay the mortgage (because she didn’t qualify for one on her own). We are her oldest children and the only ones who do not live at home, despite 3 of my siblings being adults and one has 2 children of her own. I try to help my mom if my husband agrees because it isn’t fair to my littlest siblings to worry about if they are going to lose their house (like I did growing up). 6 months ago she tried to keep money she promised to pay back and after a heated argument, she hasn’t asked for money from me since. 

This weekend, my younger brother crashed into a barrier on the interstate driving from one home in Cleveland, OH to Miami, FL, leaving them down a car. My husband and I drove to SC and took them to my mom in FL. Yesterday, the dealership confiscated the second car due to a mix up with the payment at the bank. The bank took the payment back after it was made, and the dealership canceled the car loan. My mother is unable to get the car back because her credit is shot. She asked me to cosign on the car loan with my little brother who works part time at mcdonalds while finishing high school. I couldn’t help but laugh in her face and tell her no. 

I don’t trust she will make the payments or that my credit won’t get nailed by another mistake. The had their car repo-ed twice in the last year. My coworker says that I am an asshole because she is family and I won’t actually have to pay for it. Also, she cosigned on my car when I got pregnant in high school and my dad cosigned on my second car (neither of which I still have), so I must feel an obligation to cosign for my brother. So AITA here? 

**TLDR:** My mom asked me to cosign on a car with my brother when she has a history of not paying her bills. I laughed and said no. AITA?",43,38,0.85
1863,Asshole,"Hi! Me (M32) and my wife (F31) are expecting our first child, a daughter, who’s due in about two months. I wanted to do something nice for my wife to show my appreciation for her, as she’s been a little bit moody lately (pregnancy hormones). But things didn’t turn out as I had expected.

There’s a room in our house that we have decided should be our daughters room, and while my wife was away visiting her parents this weekend I decorated that room without her knowledge, suspicion or assistance. I painted the walls, put up shelves and lamps and furniture. I thought it looked really nice, and I had done it according to what my wife said she imagined it like. 

But when she got home and I showed her the surprise she became furious. She was screaming and crying and asking me what I had done. That I had ruined everything. I tried resonating with her and calming her down but she was really hysterical. I’ve never seen her like this, I almost thought she was having a psychosis or something. She then grabbed her bag and went to sleep at her sisters house.

I got a text from her a while ago saying that she really wanted to decorate that room and she’d looked forward to it and that I took that away from her.

I really thought I did something sweet. She never spoke about the room as if it was important to her and I think she’s completely out of line.

1865,Asshole,"Last week, I was using my sister Ashley’s phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend’s number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she’s on tinder (she’s 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said “none of your business” 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she’s just swiping for fun?) so I didn’t want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he’d mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister’s account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she’s still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could “head to my place afterwards”. She was completely receptive and said she’d meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for “Jim”. My dad went up to her and said “Jim’s not coming” and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger’s* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a “fucking dick” and “cruel” to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who’s right and if I went too far?

EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would’ve had sex with Jim. That’s why I went the extent that I did.

Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I’m TA. But I’m TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

1867,Not the A-hole,"First time poster here. Wanted to get a consensus on this situation that happened this past Sunday night. First, let me outline a few things relevant to the story:

-I’m female
-My mom passed away 3 weeks ago this Saturday

So I don’t know about any other women but I get approached frequently by random men/ strangers who will say something like “Smile” or “wow you look tired”. And when I say random men/ strangers I mean random men off the street waiting at the same intersection as me or a guy behind the counter of a restaurant where I randomly grab food. I never know these men. I’m sure other women on here can agree that having random men tell you to do something like “you’d be prettier if you smiled” is very annoying. 

So I’m leaving the bar on Sunday and I get in my uber. As I mentioned, my mom passed away a few weeks ago so my sleep schedule hasn’t been the greatest. I haven’t been sleeping very well which you can probably see on my face (bags, looking tired, etc.). So I get in the uber and the first thing this uber driver says to me, in a condescending tone, *uber driver laughs* “oh wow you look really tired”. Now I definitely had 3-4 drinks that night so I wasn’t sober but definitely not drunk. And I spent time doing my hair/ makeup to get ready for the night beforehand. After he said that to me I said “I beg your pardon” then he got awkwardly quiet. I gave him a weird look then didn’t say anything. As I’m approaching my drop off location the driver tried making conversation by asking “Do you live here or just visiting” but I cut him off saying “you probably shouldn’t comment on your passengers appearances at all, especially women. My mom literally died a couple weeks ago and I’ve had trouble sleeping which is probably why I look tired.” He did seem apologetic and said sorry a bunch of times when I was exiting the vehicle. I just rolled my eyes and shut the door and gave him a 2 star rating.

I appreciate that he was apologetic and there’s no way he would’ve known my personal issues but why do men find the need to comment on women’s appearance? What good can come from a random man telling a woman she looks tired? Lol nothing.

That way I can pay full attention to *her*. I think this is a nice, respectful thing to do.

She gets pissed when I keep pausing it. She thinks I'm being passive-aggressive, like I'm trying to punish her for talking by pausing the show she's watching. She says I don't need to pause it because she's not saying anything that important, just idle chatter. She feels like she should be able to make comments while watching without disrupting the flow of the show, because the point of watching a show together is to *be together*, and it's not so important to pay 100% attention to the show or to chitchat.

He calls me and says that I am not at the park and I need to come to the park right now. He takes me home and I get grounded for a week.

They work very hard and have made good financial decisions and investments that have put them in a good spot in life. I wanted to be a doctor from a young age, which was the dream that my mother had force fed me, and she forced me to join a specific extracurricular club that her friend’s daughter was in that made me love business. Long story short I tell my mom and she says you’re betraying my dream blah blah blah, and I become a doctor or I pay for university and lose their support if I go to business. Fast forward, I’m going into second year and they’ve payed $13000 of the $40000 that school has cost me. I covered the rest using loans, grants, and scholarships. They impose a curfew of 9:30pm, and believe I shouldn’t be in relationships, regardless of whether the girl is my race and culture or not. I work full time and the college savings fund my mother made and promised me is now being used to fund their investments.

Two days ago I asked to go out (the second time in the week) to play basketball, then snapped at my father when he said that I go out all the time and I shouldn’t be “fucking around” so much, after he literally spent a weekend drunk at a casino resort. My mom agreed with him and shit me down. I tell her that I’ve literally gone down a career path they chose, and she tells me she’ll be happy when the school year starts back up and I move out (I live at school).

I plan on telling my parents that their desire to control me makes me feel a deep anger towards them. I don’t know how they’ll react because sometimes it can get really crazy.

In a recent trip to my mothers side of the family, all my aunts and uncles were shocked at how controlling my mother was and tried to explain how this type of behaviour can be destructive but she pulled the “my son is in the toughest program to be admitted to in the country, I know what I’m doing”.

1873,No A-holes here,"I work with a consulting company that basically automates people out of jobs. In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.

This came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.

The result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age.

This was a short haul flight (about 2 hours) in the middle of the afternoon. It was a three seater situation per side. I was seated on the aisle seat with my companion on the window. We kept the middle seat clear so we could have more space. There were 2 kids in the row in front of us. Maybe around 5-8 years old? They were seated on the window and middle seat. After boarding, they were taking a lot of pictures of themselves but used the flash so it would get into our eyes which was annoying but whatever. They were also talking a bit loudly but that wasn’t too annoying either. So I fall asleep during the flight with my legs crossed in front of me. Then I notice that one of the kids moved to the seat in front of me. That’s fine. She starts to recline the seat and it goes to about 70-80% before it hits my knee.

I was out with my friends last night to my favorite sushi place. Across the restaurant was my ex husband on a date. At first it was that soul sucking feeling and I wasn’t ready to admit he was moving on.

My ex hadn’t seen me but he looked over and made eye contact and then the server came back and said “he said that was a very nice offer but no thank you and he hopes you are doing well.”

I was home alone yesterday evening, this was only the first week we had the house, and my fiance was back in our old state tying up some loose ends. 

I was having a laid back night watching movies and having some wine, I was watching horror which I usually like but I was getting a little freaked out being alone in this big creaky house. I'm used to living in city apartments so being so alone was kind of unsettling. I stopped the movie halfway through, and decided to read a book instead.

When I was quietly reading, I heard through an open window, what sounded like footsteps and whispering around the back of the house. Well within our property line, which is quite far from our house. I sat really still and listened, and I was positive that I heard people out there. I couldn't tell how many, but I thought it must be at least 3 from the footsteps I heard. I was pretty tipsy and that didn't help me think clearly.

I should mention I've been assaulted once before, in my own dorm room at college, so I do have some anxiety about not feeling safe in my own home.

I walked upstairs really quietly and locked myself in my room and called 911 asking them to send the cops, I heard people sneaking around my back door, I was afraid they were trying to break in. 

Soon, i heard sirens, then silence for a few long minutes, then knocking on the front door. It was the police saying to open up. 

Two officers were there with 5 children. Probably a mix of elementary and middle schoolers. The cops told me that it was just kids who had come into my yard to play on the tree swing; their families had been friends with the last owner who let them come over and play.

I was feeling shook up still, and I got kind of snippy and said that the message has got to be passed on to their parents that I don't allow trespassing. And that their parents ought to have thought before sending their kids out to play in a stranger's backyard. 

Afterwards, a couple of the neighboring families were mad at me for frightening their kids who had gotten the cops called on them, for being such a ""sheltered city girl"" I couldn't tell the difference between kids playing and a break in. One called me a drunk, because his kids said I looked drunk. One father actually thought I made up my fear of a break in just to have an excuse to call the cops on their kids. He in particular was furious the cops showed up to his home to drop off his son, while he was hosting a dinner party with his boss. He had felt humiliated in front of his boss for no good reason.

1878,Not the A-hole,"Please, hear me out. About a month ago, we completely overhauled our front garden which involved laying weed cloth everywhere and covering it with mulch.  It was a big project and we put a lot of effort and money into it. 

Since that time, a neighbourhood couple has been allowing their dog to poop in our garden nearly every day.  The poop is always in the same spot and it is very close to our front door. Since the garden is covered with weed cloth, it’s not like the poop can degrade into the soil and fertilize it; it just sits there on top of the cloth, smelling and attracting flies.  Since this began, we’ve also noticed a lot more flies in our house. I suspect that the increase in flies is related to the hoards of flies congregating on the poop near our front door. It’s gross and unhygienic and we have a new baby in the house who we’d like to keep away from dog feces to the extent possible. 

We have a pretty good idea about which couple is doing this. They are notorious for walking their dog on our street and not picking up after it. They have been spoken to and it has not changed their behaviour. We just purchased an outdoor security camera (not for this purpose, but catching the poopetrator is an added bonus) so we should soon have some video evidence confirming our suspicions about the identity of the guilty party.  Once we have confirmation, I intend to start collecting the dog poop left on our property, putting it in a bag or envelope along with a note along the lines of “you left this on our property” and leaving it on their property.

She passed during childbirth. My stepson is low functioning ASD and has other health disorders related to the heart and lungs. My wife was a SAHM ever since I met her.

I thought I was equipped to manage both children but I learned very quickly how hard my wife had it before I came into the picture. Precisely zero daycares near me will accept my stepson because of his conditions. 

He has a ventral septal defect which he has episodes over frequently: his skin will turn blue, he becomes disoriented, and if he's not restrained in a way to make him kneel down, it's a trip to the hospital. He's unable to do this on his own and physically resists. Just this year alone I've had eight hospital visits for this. This is the big one but other challenges exist, too.

I had to quit my dream job to care for him because he's been turned away from every daycare. I had to go on government assistance which was difficult because I was making decent money beforehand. Difficult not only in lifestyle change but also in just getting approved.

After two years of this, my life is going nowhere. I can't get a girlfriend, I can't get a job, I have pretty much no support here. My wife had no family, I have family who has shunned me for dating a single mother to begin with. The only one who gives me some reprieve is my mother who will babysit one day a week for me. I feel like my daughter suffers because we can't do anything: she's at the age when we'd be going to parks yet she can't even speak yet. My focus is almost entirely on my stepson.

I want to give him up for adoption because I don't know if I'm equipped to do this anymore. More importantly, I want a life myself, too. I don't want to frame him as a problem because he's innocent in this, but if he was with another family, I might be accepted into my family again. I might be able to form new relationships. I'll be able to work, spend more time with my daughter, let her flourish.

But I'd be failing my stepson, my late wife's son. A little part of me thinks my wife would look down on me if I did this, yet I don't know what else to do. He belongs in the care of medical professionals, not me.

1880,Not the A-hole,"I am a 35 years old guy, and I was lucky enough to marry my crush (27F) two years ago. We met at work, where she was a receptionist for the big building my company is in. Anyways, she has two daughters, 6 and 7 years old.

When I married my wife, I was a bit iffy at the idea of being a dad so fast and so suddenly to two kids that aren’t mine, but I love my wife so much I am willing to sacrifice my man-time and a portion of my salary to take care of the kids.

To be honest, I’ve had my ups and downs with them (you know, kids) and sometimes I think I’d be happier going back to my “lone wolf” life. But I fully know that this is my life now and I try my best to suck it up and do what I signed up for.

Back to the story: I know the kids dad had died only from my wife’s words and I’ve never had reason to doubt that.

It has been two or three months since she started convincing me that I should adopt them as a birthday gift for both of them (their birthday happens in two consecutive days, coincidence). I’d be fine with that, it’s just paper for what I would do anyways.

I agreed to that and she said she’d get on with the documents. Well fantastic! I thought. I like not having to do anything. What really got me suspicious is how she changed her behaviour with her phone and laptop. She started putting the phone face down, and she created a totally different user for her laptop she switches to when she’s with me.

I thought she was cheating so I did what every scumbag like me would do, I spied on her. Long story short, I come to know by a very reliable source that…. her ex-husband isn’t paying alimony anymore as he is in jail with no money to his account. The world crushed on me. First I thought the guy was dead, now I discover he is alive, paying alimony to my wife’s bank account while I was financially providing too.

I confronted my wife and she didn’t deny any of it. She started crying and she was adamant that she did that only for the kids’ well being. She was putting the alimony money he ex was giving her into an account for when the kids will be 18 yo (I have no proof of that). She also said that it was a while since she felt I should adopt them, as they love me and they look up to me. She was firm about stating that nothing happened with her ex husband while she was with me. She said that her ex is ""dead"" for her by all means. She admitted that she lied, but for good purposes - as she was scared that a guy like me would be scared by her reckless past. That's not who she is anymore, as she is focused on family and on us.

Now, I need to find out more about her ex-husband that’s for sure. I am also furious with my wife for not trusting me enough to come clean about her past. Meanwhile, will I be an asshole if I refuse to adopt the kids (they have a dad and he’s ALIVE!) and if I state that I will retract from them all the financial support in case I decide to get a divorce?

1881,Not the A-hole,"Using a side account for this because she knows my main reddit, but not this one.

So, as the title suggests, I’m babysitting my friend’s son - we’ll call him Phil - he’s 11 months old, been looking like he’s going to try and walk for about a week now. My friend - we’ll call her Lil - has been VERY excited about this. 

As fate would have it, it happened when I was looking after him. Phil made a few little unaided wobbly steps, and my heart burst. Then it immediately filled with guilt, when I realised this is the first time he’s ever done it. I didn’t film it, my hands were full - I was preparing his food and he was playing on his little mat. 

Now, the real reason for my guilt is because Lil is a young single mother who has sacrificed so much to raise Phil to the best of her abilities. He is her world, she’s his, their bond is strong and beautiful, and honestly? I feel as though his first steps would be something sacred she’d like to experience, not his auntie Angelica. 

She’s due back in a couple of hours. I’m sat here typing this out whilst that sly little bastard is giving me side-eye and beaming from his cot. He knows what he’s done, and he’s loving it. He can’t exactly tell her, can he? 

So, Reddit, WIBTA if I didn’t tell her, and let her experience what are technically his second steps as if they were his first to make her happy?


Update: She’s home! I didn’t tell her. Her baby’s first steps are the first steps she sees. Thank you so much for your insight, guys.",149,769,0.97
1882,No A-holes here,"I [25F] have no children yet, so maybe I am too quick to judge. I have 3 coworkers who do this. They are all moms in their late 30s - mid 40s. I have began to notice that all of their stories about their kids (ages ranging from 10-20) have similar details. They all let their children who are 9, 10, and 11 sleep in their beds with them. At first I didn't think it was weird because maybe they had a bad dream or something, but they do it EVERY SINGLE NIGHT - no exceptions unless they are not home. All of their children have their own rooms with their own beds, but every single night they sleep in their parents bed or one of their parents sleep with them in the kids bed.

It even got to the point that one of the parents is seriously considering buying a twin bed to put into her and her husbands bedroom for their 10 Yr old to sleep in. When she was telling me this, I finally ask, ""does she not like sleeping by herself?"" (or something along those lines. I asked it nicely, not with any attitude in my voice) and one of the other coworkers chimed in saying, ""[My son] sleeps with me every night."" She said that multiple other times throughout the rest of our conversation so I got the feeling that my question struck a nerve for her.

Later, I felt bad because I felt like she thought I was just a judgmental asshole, but seriously, one said that her oldest child slept with her until she was 14. That's nearly high school age! I could understand maybe if their childten have gone through some kind of tramatic experience, but they all seem to have well off lives. I have no memory beyond MAYBE 2nd grade of sleeping in my parents bedroom and I thought that was normal.

1883,Not the A-hole,"GF and I are planning a trip to Japan at the end of this month. I've been dealing with all of the travel, transportation, accommodation while she is to handle the day-to-day sites to see.

I also have a friend living in Japan who has been immensely helpful in guiding me in terms of how to navigate around their convoluted rail system and the best routes to take between destinations. I've been relying on her for information because neither of us has ever been to Japan, and I want to make sure things go smoothly so that we don't spend time getting lost in Japan. She has revised some of my work a few times and made suggestions to it and I trust her because you know...she lives there!

GF got super upset with me because we were trying to book a particular cafe to check out while we there there but the entire site is in Japanese and google translate only took us so far. She spent about an hour trying to figure it out and appears to have some sort of reservation booked (we're not sure as the booking confirmation is all in Japanese). There are also some instructions in terms of actually picking up the reservation in-person rather than just showing up at the store? Either way, due to this ambiguity I decided to ask my friend how this works. As busy as my friend already is, she kindly offered to help us do the reservation and even said that she will go and pick the tickets up for us and can give them to us when we land! I thought this was super generous and I was really appreciative of her to take her time to help us newbies out.

My GF was livid after learning this and was offended because I asked my friend to help us (even after telling my GF that I was going to ask her for help on this). She was offended because all of her work was for nothing and that she wasted an entire hour trying to make this booking and instead I'm just delegating it to my friend to handle instead. She started yelling at me and telling me that I should just go on the vacation with her since I listened to her. We were also planning to meet up with her on the day we landed (max 2 hours) and my GF said she would have none of it and would never want to see her (we're there for 2 weeks).

I was upset as this was a vacation I was looking forward to with her. I trust my friend who lives there to help us with these logistical things since she knows better. I want to make sure things are done correctly and that we don't waste time getting lost/screwed over.

From my understanding, I think my GF feels that her work is being undermined by my friend (even though she is pretty much deciding all of our day-to-day activities and I let her have complete free reign on that). I trust my friend and I would rely on her for certain aspects of planning since she speaks the language. Also I told my GF that I appreciate all of the work that she did in helping with the booking but it made more sense to make sure it was done properly by leaving it to my friend to handle for us.

1885,No A-holes here,"My wife and I have a 2-month-old son. I love him, he’s the light of our world. However, I do think that he isn’t the cutest thing in the world. I think that about most babies at this age. They grow into their looks and right now, he looks like a little alien. I’m not saying it to be mean and I would never say it to him when he was older, nor would I say this to a parent of a child that wasn’t my own.

I jokingly call my son “my little alien” and “tease” him about his features (I call it this lightly as he has no clue what’s going on, just the funny man with the mustache talking about something else). My wife is getting mad, though. She says that the baby looks like she did when she was a baby (I personally don’t see it) and that she takes it personally. I tell her she’s a beautiful woman and that her baby pictures are cute. I’m just saying this about our son and it’s something I do with him. She says it’s not cool and that I need to stop. Okay, fair enough, I won’t do it in front of her anymore if she’s so upset. I wasn’t doing it so often that it was a big deal anyway.

So, yesterday, I was changing my son’s diaper and made a comment like “Okay my little alien, let’s get you nice and clean”. I didn’t realize my wife was in the nursery, but she got pissed. She went off on me and said we had talked about this and that I was being mean.

1886,No A-holes here,"I'm invited to my friends' wedding in November and they asked me to be a bridesmaid. I live in a different country and am really happy to go. We've only met once for a few days, but I really like them and have known them for years. They're amazing, and a bunch of us guildmates are going to be at the wedding, so I'm really psyched to go.

The bride had decided on a vintage dress style for herself. Cool, that's fine with me. She wasn't sure what she wanted for us bridesmaids, so I kept asking every few weeks about any news so we could order, be on top of it etc. Today, she sent me a picture of a dress with the message of ""What do you think? I'm thinking of ordering next month because [ bridesmaid I don't know] is pregnant and will get bigger.""

Truth is, I hate the dress. By itself, it's nice. It's the deep v-neck, slim-waisted and very long-skirt you'd expect to see a tall, small-boobed woman wear to a very formal occasion. It's just.... A style that really doesn't look good on me. My boobs make dresses like that a nightmare, the style really doesn't flatter me at all, long skirts are hard because I'm short and the colour looks terrible on me because I'm pale. Plus, I'm worried fitting will be poor because she wants to order it but I won't be there to know it fits or get it tailored in time since I'm flying in across Europe.

My friend is really sweet and not at all a bridezilla. WIBTA if I tell her I don't think the dress would work for me? Should I suck it up because it's her wedding and I can change for the reception? Would it just be better to not be in the wedding party? I don't want to be an ass and make it about me and what stupid dress I wear, but I also don't want to feel ugly by wearing something I'll feel bad in.

Any advice welcome.

Update: Since everyone seemed to be on the same page, I (politely) let her know I thought it was pretty, but there were a few things I was a little concerned about. However, if it's what she wanted, I'd 100% wear it and be happy with whatever she picks. Turns out she's not set on it and is now even considering letting us all pick our own clothes in a colour scheme, but doesn't know. She knows as much about fashion and skin tones and colours as I do, aka not much, but she's an awesome bride and friend, and what makes her the happiest I'd what matters, you guys are right.

1889,Not the A-hole,"I'm the youngest of 4 siblings. When I was little my oldest sister got sick. Doctors said she had less than 2 years to live, she was only 19. 

My dad was pretty successful, my mom died when we were kids. 

Life changed course completely. Everything was about my sister. My dad quit his job and escorted my sister around the world. It was her dream to travel. I was 3 when she was diagnosed, but I knew it was the right thing. She needed to fit as much life into her time as possible. After a year she was doing way better than expected, she was deteriorating slowly, but the inevitable remained. 

My dad made the decision that she would never have to work. That she would be completely free to follow her dreams. He called in every favor, every friend. My dad was a successful guy and if she had a few years they would be perfect. 

I was raised by my 14 yearold brother and sometimes my aunt. When I was older I started helping. I'd dispense medicine, buy groceries, cook, clean, everything her condition made hard. We ate the same diet, she hated having to look at food she couldn't have. I pulled out of school so I could help her full-time. I homeschooled myself and my sister taught me. She got married when I was 19 and I moved home. Her husband was great, they were happy.

I studied hard. I took the ACT. I scored near perfectly. I got into an Ivy league University. With scholarships, work-study and FA I was supporting myself. My first year went well, but college is hard. In my second year my sister's health declined. She didn't have much time. She told me that she knew she was gonna die. That she knew our lives had been affected by her condition. She knew we'd given up an enormous amount so that she could live life. It meant a lot to me.

My grades disintegrated. I drove 9 hours every weekend to see her. Between the time, stress, and exhaustion I pulled out Ds and Bs. My scholarship is gone. She passed in early summer. After her death my dad lost it. More than ever he isn't concerned about us. He hasn't worked in 20 years and doesn't have much left, what he does have he's using to retire.

Before she passed she said that she had left each of us (her siblings) a part of her trust. Everything else would go to her husband. 

Thing is, I haven't seen or heard anything. It's been months,summer is ending and my scholarship is gone, I'm panicking. I can't pay for school, I don't have credit, and my dad isn't going to pay. I've talked about this to my other sister who asked me if I'd been told the same thing. She's confused but she's finished college and has a job, and doesn't think we should bring it up. 

I feel like such a dick for wanting to ask my BIL and my dad about it. Maybe she forgot. Maybe it just slipped. She was dying. But I can't deny, I'm a little suspicious of her husband and our dad. AITA for questioning where my inheritance is after my sister's death? I feel like an asshole, but we'd been through so much and this wasn't like her. Please help.

1890,No A-holes here,"I (M) work in a department that is primarily female (let's say about 75% female). There are three bathrooms near my office.

I think it would make the most sense to simply label all of the bathrooms as 'Family.' but that's not the way they did it. 90% of the time there is no issue with waiting for the bathroom, but sometimes one of the ladies will use the 'Family' bathroom instead of the 'Women's' bathroom so I have to wait for the 'Family' bathroom to open up while two single occupancy bathrooms with locking doors are available. So, WIBTA if I just used one of the women's' bathrooms in this case?

1891,Asshole,"The title basically already explains it all but I guess it doesn´t hurt to add some context:

 I \[F27\] recently decided to mix sources of protein into my diet that some would call unconventional. While I still eat (locally bred) poultry from time to time, I decided to try out insects such as mealworms to improve my ecological footprint and step away from large-scale livestock farming. I did not make a huge deal out of it and did not expect any of my family or friends to stop consuming animal products like meat in any way. 

My friends and I usually gather once or twice a month to have dinner together, which one of us usually cooks at his or her home. So it happened that it became my turn to provide food for our group of five. I decided to make a quiche, and instead of the beef, as the recipe suggested, I just used mealworms. My friends came over and had dinner with me, and enjoyed the evening and the food I had prepared. Neither of them seemed to notice something out of the ordinary or commented on any of the individual components of my quiche. 

Important notice: I did not pretend that the quiche contained beef/pork/chicken/whatever -- actually, I didn´t comment on the ""meat"" at all. Maybe it is also vital to know that I had never prepared a quiche for my friends before, so it is not like they expected it to contain conventional meat when they ate it. If one of them had asked about it, I would have absolutely told them. Also, I know that none of them has an allergy against mealworms.

I didn´t do this to prove anything really or to try to ""convert"" them. I didn´t think much of it until I spoke with my sister who was appalled and called my behavior sneaky and disgusting.

Well, a girl I’ve known for 3 years and I have been dating for a bit more than a week now (very short time I know) and we had our first kiss three nights ago. Today she texted me asking if she could pick me up and go for a drive, and she confessed to me that she has mental health issues but not many people know about them. To my knowledge, her older sister already has a small idea of these problems but doesn’t know the full extent of them.

One thing that was quite clear in our conversation was that she definitely wanted me to keep it private and not tell anyone. However, I really feel like I should tell her older sister because they live together and I feel like she would be much more well equipped with dealing with this than I would be, and then maybe the girl I like can get the help she needs to deal with her issues.

1896,Not the A-hole,"This is frustrating af so pls bare with me. I've made an alt acc since she knows my personal one.

So.. WTF.

I've been friends with this girl a year, we started flirting and chatting a lot more a few months ago so I decided to fly over here to visit her and see if we're compatible irl. We are 1k miles apart which is a few hours in a plane. I thought we both genuinely really like each other which is why I came, I wouldn't fly this distance for just anyone and she told me she wanted me to come.

I arrived 3 days ago and at the actual airport she tells me another guy has also come to see her even though she didn't want him to. He's also from another country and flew roughly the same distance to get here. I was confused, cause I don't understand why he flew here if she told him she didn't want him to, like no guy is that stupid as to get on a plane for some random girl. She said it's because he just wanted to travel and picked her country.

So I've been staying at her house and this other guy got a hotel, so the first day we drove him to his hotel and it was just so awkward. You could tell neither of us wanted to be there anymore, and you can definitely tell we had no idea the other existed. That night we went out for drinks and he came along, despite telling me she didn't want him there. I'm only here for a week and for the past two days the 3 of us have spent the days together and it's so fucking awkward. I really like this girl and I want alone time with her.

So today I told her I don't want to see him again, that this trip was meant to be for just us and I'm feeling very awkward having another guy around who obviously wants to get in her pants. It's frustrating. She told me we're not exclusive, they're just friends like us, and she doesn't want to leave him alone all day. She specifically said her and I are just friends so I can't get angry.

She left me alone in her own house, and went to his hotel for a few hours and came back literally half an hour ago (I don't know what they did, they could have had sex for all I know), saying now we could go out for dinner and drinks just us. She had no problem telling me she stayed at his hotel and hang out with him there playing on her switch. So clearly she 100% believes we're not exclusive and told me to chill the fuck out or she couldn't be with me because I'm too overbearing already. I'm not trying to be... but this is a shitty situation and in my eyes we were being flirty af and I didn't know there was another guy coming. Like why couldn't she just pick another week for him to come?

1897,Not the A-hole,"First of, 2019 hasn't been easy on me at all, I've lost 2 family members, had big ass drama with my girlfriend and almost quit school because of depression. I then started a job right after college, no break between school and work. I have worked all summer every morning, 5 days a week 9 hours a day to afford my second year of college. I start at 7am and end at 5pm. My job is very physical and I am completely exhausted when I come home, which means I usually get to sleep at around 9pm, giving me roughtly 4 hours of free time everyday. Then I wake up at 6:30am and the cycle continues.

Now, school for me starts in 2 weeks. I was supposed to work next week but decided I couldn't handle it and basicaly told my boss that I wasn't going to come, he was okay with it but I wouldn't get paid, of course, which I'm fine with.

Before I continue, I wanna say that for my age (18), I am in a very good financial state. I really do not have to worry about money and I could pay for college without having to work.

So, I was going to use this one week break to rest and litteraly do nothing at home, sleeping and doing personal stuff, away from everyone. When I told my mother about why I needed that rest, she got mad at me and told me I was being lazy and antisocial, that people my age would rather go hiking or doing stuff outside than staying inside and doing jack shit and also that I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED the 600$ I was supposed to make that week ( which is honestly not true). She said that everyone works and goes to school and all you need to get some rest is sleeping at night. 

This makes me really sad, since I absolutely need to rest or I won't be able to perform in college, but I also do not want to upset her since she's my mom and I love her.

I just want one week being a lazy ass and not having to do anything with anyone. Am I asking for too much ? Should I just continue working and shut up about my problems and my need to rest ?  Thanks for reading.

1902,No A-holes here,"So, to lay out the context here, I’ve got a major issue with my sleep. It’s not conventional insomnia, but rather, reversed circadian rhythms: I can’t get full REM sleep during the night and won’t feel rested during the day, but if I go to bed during the day I sleep like a baby. I’ve got a rather rough autoinflammatory disease (with lethargy as a major symptom) that doesn’t really have a proper treatment too, so it’s very important to me to get good sleep so that I can at least function instead of being a depressed, exhausted blob.

Ever since I learned from my doctor about my brain being wired to be nocturnal, I decided that I’d start sleeping at night when it’s feasible. The change was almost immediate; I could fall asleep within a half hour, I woke up refreshed, there was a noticeable improvement with my depression, and I could think clearly again. But there’s a glaring problem; I still live with my family, as with the aforementioned disease holding a job is just not feasible until treatment for it advances or I can work from home. And living with family comes with an expectation to be active with the family, to eat the same meals, to go out together on vacations and outings; And this new schedule does not allow for that at all. My family, naturally, goes out during the daytime, when I’d really rather be asleep so that I can feel well. But the fact that I’ve missed so many of these “family moments” is upsetting my parents. My mom is concerned for my health and wellness, and well my dad, my dad is just angry. Anger is his response when he feels hurt or sad, though, so I know it’s taking a toll on him too.

They want me to continue with a conventional schedule; sleep at night, go out and live during the day.  My mom feels that even though the doctor did confirm the circadian rhythms, that this is not the right way to treat them at all; but she hasn’t presented any solution aside from powering through it. My dad is convinced that I’ll be a complete social recluse with this schedule, and that the benefits won’t last long. 

I try to be up during the day whenever I can, and about 60% of my days are spent with a conventional sleep schedule. But I often go back to a nocturnal lifestyle when the depressive, mind numbing effect of constant exhaustion gets to me. Even knowing it hurts their feelings, I feel like I can’t keep subjecting myself to constant exhaustion after having tasted the alternative. But am I being completely callous, and ignoring what it means to be a family by prioritizing my mood over the family activities?

AITA?

EDIT: To clarify this post with a little update, I made a lot of excuses as to why I don’t WANT to work or may not be able to keep a job for long, but even I know that I can’t just sit and do nothing; I already have plans to go into foodservice for now. It’s just that realistically, I won’t keep the job forever even if I push and work as hard as I can; Of course, I’ll get a new job after, but it’s going to be hard to make a living wage if I’m regularly getting fired for sitting in the freezer to wait for a autoinflammatory fever to cool off or for a breakout of rash on my arms to stop. I intend entirely to power through my issues; Because yeah, I’m depressed, my body is like a steam engine breaking down, and sitting around feels like the only option, but I can’t just.. do that forever. At least, not around my parents, it’s not right to have them support me while I crumble and I already knew that.

A detail people mainly ignored is that I mentioned spending only 40% of days with the flipped sleep schedule. I don’t just live nocturnally constantly and never interact with family or work around the house; Most days I am entirely present. Tired as hell but present. It’s only when depression or illness start to go really wild that I return to that schedule to keep things from getting very, very bad. It would be downright fucked up to just leave my parents alone every single day.

After a call with the doctor who gave me the diagnosis, he does think that it could be sleep apnea, or just that I need to get myself into a more consistent schedule. He doesn’t think it’s going to disappear anytime soon but says that the flipped schedule was only ever supposed to be a test run of sorts for the diagnosis, not a permanent solution, which is strange considering he never set a deadline for it to stop. We’ll be doing a sleep apnea test for the second time, as when we did it before it came up as only a very minor case but it could have been an error. Still the fact that he essentially 180ed and said “oh yeah that may not be it” when we voiced our concerns, after adamantly claiming I had this disorder, is unprofessional at best and suspicious at worst. will voice my concerns over the guy with my family.

All in all it’s been really helpful to actually get some realistic opinions on this rather than just appeals to emotion. I don’t think my parents are assholes, and I didn’t in the first place. I think they care about me and that they don’t want my future to be spoiled by me never pushing through my limits. I never intended to convey some kind of indignant hatred of my parents with this, and I didn’t want to convey it as me having just given up and wanting to live as a NEET, but I didn’t do a very good job at getting what I meant across and mostly just ended up complaining and venting worries.

I plan to apply for a job at the local burrito place within the next month. They’re understaffed and I’ve always loved cooking, one of the only easy hobbies for me. My parents and I talked about the situation as well, and now that I know it’s not just them that feel I need to push through it, i finally cracked and agreed to being held accountable to the schedule 100% of the time. I’m not happy about it but if so many people are certain it’s an unhealthy behavior then I shouldn’t pretend I know better. Let’s hope this isn’t just going to make things worse.

TL;DR never intended to just sit around jobless, already had plans to apply, doc is questioning his own diagnosis which is just leading to more consideration of getting a new doc, nocturnal schedule wasn’t even being done on the majority of days and I’ve cracked and am switching to a normal schedule 100% of the time even though I’m very worried about the consequences of that.

I’m gonna be muting this post because I kinda like having notifications that function, but thanks for being honest about this one. And to the guys who adamantly said not the asshole here, thanks, but the whole reason I came to post this was BECAUSE I needed actual analysis of the situation and an actual discussion with some differing opinions and not just “oh you poor thing you should do whatever you want just because you’re disabled”.

Today and yesterday were long days full of a lot of hard talks with parents and the doc and I’m gonna at least try to get some rest now, I stayed up all the way until 8 pm yesterday to reset my sleep schedule so I should be able to sleep with some music.

I’ve rambled on too long already, probably won’t update again. Let’s hope this works, guys.",499,1788,0.95

1904,Not the A-hole,"To celebrate my birthday last weekend, the guy I’ve been going out with (let's call him Julian) invited me over for dinner that he would cook for me. Julian is a great cook and I liked a lot of the food he cooked in the past so I happily said yes. 

The dinner started out great, everything was delicious and we enjoyed each other’s company. Until it was time for the main course and he told me that he had cooked his version of a traditional Southern catfish dish.

I don’t eat catfish (I’ve tried it a couple of times before and I don’t like its taste, I always end up spitting it out) and I was pretty sure we had talked about that in the past so I was confused why he cooked it. I thought maybe he forgot that I don’t eat catfish, but as he served the dish he told me that he knows I don’t eat catfish but he’s hoping that I’d change my mind after tasting his recipe, which he created with me in mind.

I know it’s a harmless thing to take one bite of something that I know I don’t like and technically there is always a probability that I might end up liking his dish, but at that moment I really felt uncomfortable. Like I was being backed into a corner and I had to force myself to eat catfish for the sake of not being rude to someone I like. But I really did not want to eat catfish.

I told Julian that I loved all the other dishes he cooked for me that night and I am very sorry but I really don’t want to eat catfish. He looked crestfallen and said “Even just one bite?” I shook my head and apologized again. 

He said it’s fine and he understands, and scrambled to make me something else. The atmosphere felt awkward so I followed him in the kitchen and told him I want to help him make the dish. I kept a conversation going while we made a salad and it was a bit of an effort at the start but the awkwardness lessened eventually and we were back to normal by dessert. 

I didn’t think about what happened anymore in the next few days because I thought Julian and I were okay, but this morning I got a message from one of Julian’s friends, who I’ll call Alyssa. I guess Julian told his friends that I didn’t eat his catfish dish because Alyssa went off on me and told me that I was an entitled bitch for refusing to take one simple bite of the catfish dish made by someone who took the full effort to cook a five course dinner for me.

My friends are telling me that Alyssa is the bitch for thinking that I owe it to Julian to eat what he cooked especially since he knows that I don’t eat catfish but he cooked it anyway, and in the first place he should not have assumed that I would want to eat it just because he cooked it for me on my birthday. 

I think that Julian’s friends are taking his side and mine are taking my side so I decided to post her and get a more ‘neutral’ opinion.

1905,Not the A-hole,"So, recently, at about 10 pm, my uncle and cousin (who I don’t know well at all) show up at our apartment out of nowhere. We already had a ton of visitors that day, and I was already tired and just wanted some time to myself, plus unplanned visits are somewhat a pet peeve of mine, especially at that hour. 

When I saw them at the door, my thoughts were something along the lines of “Not again! Are you serious?” and immediately went to my room and locked the door because I didn’t want to deal with it. I didn’t think anything of this because I doubt my cousin especially likes me, and my other cousin was already here and I knew they would interact with each other. I didn’t think I was being a bad host because not only did I not invite my cousin and uncle, so it wasn’t really my job in the first place to “entertain” them, I knew my other cousin would talk to the visiting cousin anyway so she was getting “entertained” either way (and for the record, this was correct). 

I don’t care for the visiting cousin, and I doubt she especially cares for me. Same goes for my visiting uncle. There’s no beef, we just don’t know each other very well and I’m not really interested in forming a bond. My mother made me come out and greet them, which I did, but soon thereafter retreated to my room. 

After they left, my mom brought me to the table and she and my other aunt/uncle/cousin had a discussion with me about how I’m “emotionally unavailable”, “don’t care for other people’s feelings”, and “arrogant”, essentially that I’m a big a-hole. I explained to them all that I didn’t think I was hurting anybody’s feelings because I doubted that they actually cared, and I don’t think I’m better than my visiting cousin and uncle, I was just already tired and didn’t feel like interacting, especially since I didn’t expect their visit nor did I invite them, care for them, or even know them well. 

My mother told me she knew that I didn’t have malicious intent, but there are certain social cues she knows I know but resents that I choose to ignore them just because I want to. She’s right about my emotional unavailability, but i don’t think I should have an obligation to make myself open to people that I don’t especially like and didn’t invite. She told me I just had to offer my presence, which again I disagree with, because I don’t think my presence is necessary in this situation.

Our landlord was very nice about everything and agreed to take her next months rent (600) out of her deposit instead of charging it to us (she also agreed to this as we had a 9 month lease) 

She paid a portion of her rent from the last month but did not clean her room at all. She hadn’t even cleaned her room since she moved in either. We were the ones who had to scrub her room for hours before being able to list the room online to hopefully find a new housemate as we could not afford to live there as just three people. She also did not clean any other part of the house either, including her shared bathroom. 

She left a lot of stuff in her room, the bathroom and the hallway, which we eventually had to throw out after a few months. In the kitchen she had a cabinet of glass bottles that we also had bring to a bottle bank eventually. 

G also owed money for the electricity bills in the previous months.

Me and my two housemates decided to move out a few months later and we scrubbed that house top to bottom for hours to make sure we got our deposits back.

I’m a bisexual woman. Before I came out, my parents would always say that if me or any of my siblings said we were LBGT, they wouldn’t mind and only care that we did well in school, work, etc. Based on their comments, I assumed that they would be ok with me coming out in whatever way possible. I also really didn’t want to have to sit them down and have the whole “talk,” I just wanted them to know, acknowledge it, and for us to move on.

During pride month, I made an Instagram post that said “bisexual and proud.” This was my way of coming out to my friends, and my family, since I knew they were following me there. They never asked me about it, but I knew they had to have seen it. 

Months later, my mother and I were talking about different sexual orientations. I said something along the lines of, “well, you know how I’m bisexual...” and I can’t remember what else. That’s when she got mad and said, “how could I not know when you post it on social media?” We ended up getting into a small argument about the way I came out. Basically she was upset that I didn’t sit her down and tell her, which I guess I can understand. However, at the same time, I feel that my coming out should have been in the way I feel comfortable.

Then he says that he is going to see his daughter giving birth in a different city. I become a bit sceptical, but I ask him a few questions to make sure he is not lying. 

I ask him which bus he is taking and he points to the correct bus (as I know the bus which goes to the city he wants to go to). Then I check online if the price he mentioned is correct. The online price was 23 euros, but that can mean it's just cheaper when you buy it online. So I start believing him and I tell him that we can go over there and I will pay for his ticket, but he tells me that he is waiting for his wife to arrive and that he will take the next one (which arrives one hour later). I became skeptical again and told him that I would not pay him. He said okay and was that.

1912,Not the A-hole,"My husband is active military, we’re currently living on a military base in Japan and hold SOFA licenses. He’s taking leave next week and we’re going to go explore the country for a week and a half. We’re trying to find an alternative to taking a taxi all the way to the airport, as the fees from our place go all the way up to 80 USD, and UBER is not currently a thing here. I found that we can drive to a base closer to the airport and fill out a simple form to leave our car parked there, then taking a taxi at around 20 USD. I let my husband know and he printed out the form.

Earlier today I got text from my husband telling me he has offered to lend his coworker (that he has known less than a year for) his car in exchange for a ride to the airport and back. His coworker will be PCSing/leaving Japan, and will be selling his car soon. The usual thing to do in this instance is to just get rides from your fellow coworkers working your shift.

I looked at our insurance papers and while I’m not 100% sure of which specific plan we have, I know that Japan has a comparative negligence rule.

I let my husband know that I’m not on board with this and I think it’s a bad idea. I wish he would have told me before asking the coworker. Since it’s his first time owning a car, I feel like he doesn’t understand what a headache it can be to deal with an insurance company.

His reply was that he could “deal with the situation if it comes up” and he’d “work through it all if there are any problems”.

I sent him reddit threads and other links where people detail why it’s not a very good idea, but his reply to that was that “people who have had bad things happen are more likely to have a story and comment rather than someone who loaned it out and got it back with no issue”.

1913,Not the A-hole," Question changed at the end

I'll try to keep it short.

Nearly 5 years ago, I came out to my mum as gay. I think it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. My closest friends knew about 6 months prior and were my rock and support to learn how to accept myself. 

A bit of backstory about my mum, she used to openly laugh at homophobic jokes and let her partner say stuff like ""if anyone in this house is gay, I'm moving out because I don't want any guys trying to touch me"" (not even a woman want to touch you though?). She has a group of openly homophobic friends, and another group of openly supportive and accepting friends. 

After I came out to my mum, she spent the whole night (loudly) crying, and constantly coming in my room and asking me if it's just a phase. To which I would tell her no. 

Jump forward two days, she's on the phone to everyone in the family and tells them. Most of my family is conservative and traditional, especially my nan. So she calls my nan, tells her that I'm gay, and my nan said she doesn't want to talk to me for 5 years. That didn't last very long, but she still constantly asks if I'm gay, calls me a fag/poof, all that stuff, and sends me high school musical/visibly child girl birthday cards. After the phone call, my nan calls distant relatives and tells them. After my mum called my uncle, he sent me a text saying it's all okay and congratulating me on coming out - the only family member besides my sister to be openly okay with it. 

I think my mum is okay with it now, she supports gay rights and wants to go to pride every year, and does things that supportive mothers do.

However, my sister is bisexual. Whenever it comes up, I ask my mum why she outed me to my homophobic family, but didn't out my sister. She then gets very mad and refuses to talk. Maybe it's the guilt? Idk. Like I obviously don't want my sister to be outed, it's a horrible thing, but I don't understand why I'd get different treatment to my sister.

AITA for mentioning that I was outed to everyone, but my sister wasn't?

Edit: I just want to put emphasis on the fact that I don't want my sister, or anyone, to be outed. I 100% believe that it should be up to the person.

I also changed the AITA question at the end

**Edit 2: I do NOT want my sister to be outed.**

Edit 3: probably should've mentioned that my sister came out as bisexual only a couple weeks after I came out

Edit 4: I'm not holding it against her, it's only come up in conversation a few times in the past 5 years. Earlier today, I was looking back on my coming out experience and how my mum reacts when it's brought up. That's why I asked the question",132,890,0.95
1914,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds horrible but hear me out. Fuck I'm still livid from this. Luckily it was only $4.24 which I won't lose sleep over but anything above 10 if this happened I would have pushed to get the fare waived.

So it's 12:30 am, had a fun night, tired and wanna go home, I'm maybe a 15-20 minute walk from home but decide to Uber it, and since I'm not in a crazy rush I go for the Uber Pool to save money, after all I'm only a 5 minute ride from home anyway.

And yeah, I'm well-aware the pool can be wonky sometimes. It connects me to this driver who it says is 5 minutes away. Of course, with the pool I know that's not always accurate because anyone can pick it up. Okay.

So I start to see him go in the opposite direction to pick up ""Charlotte"". Alright, so be it. He's lingering for a bit in circles in an area 5-7 minutes away, eventually her name disappears.

But then... in the next 10 minutes (yes, 10), I watch him continue going in the opposite direction... towards the other side of town. No more names appear in this time. He keeps moving further and further away... and becomes twice as far away from me as he was when he picked up ""Charlotte"". I consider cancelling and ordering again, but don't want to deal with the cancellation fee, so I try calling him.

After the second attempt, I finally get him and give him a demanding earful - ""hey dude, it's succulentboobs, what's going on?! I've been waiting at the corner of [location] almost 20 minutes, I've just seen you going in the opposite direction, what's the deal?""

He just responds with ""okay I'm on my way"".

Sure enough, he turns around immediately and comes to get me. I'm prepared to pummel him with questions, but when he finally gets here there's another girl in there and he seems chill ad briefly apologizes so I decide to let it go and not cause a scene.

But then, as he's going in my direction, right halfway to my house, he drops off the girl and says ""have a good night Charlotte"". I was ready to let it go, but this just raised the question - if this girl was in fact Charlotte and going in the same direction as me, then WHY the blooming hell was he going in the opposite direction from there for over five minutes straight after he picked her up? Especially when he was supposed to pick me up at a place that was directly on the way! And furthermore, why did I have to call him to get him to actually come in my direction? It seems like that's what got him to turn around and he wouldn't have otherwise.

So I confront him about this - turns out Charlotte was also having him pick up her friend and get them somewhere (off the grid, which explains why I didn't see any names), and when I asked him why he's prioritizing that over his actual orders - he actually straight up admitted that he forgot I was even there as a pending order and my call reminded him. He apologized but I told him that's not cool and reminded him how long I was waiting, and... you know the rest.

This weekend, my Mom came to town so I suggested everyone just come to my apt and I'll order in (Jen and Mom have never met). Everyone got here, made introductions, everything was smooth, but I could tell my Mom kept looking at Tommy.  She kept trying to interact with him in different ways and I could tell she was gauging his response.  Now, my Mom has an Ed.D. in Early Childhood Education.  She's been a Child Psychologist for over 20 years.  Tommy sat in the living room petting his toy while we got the table and food set up.

Keep in mind that we don't know how much the gift cards were worth at this point, so we were giving a gift card that could potentially be from $50-$500 to an 8 year old (of course that means we would be indirectly giving it to his parents). So his parents redeem it, and it's a $100 gift card. 


now Idk if I'm being greedy, but if I were the person who spent $200 worth of gift cards and someone gave half to an 8 yr old I'd be pretty pissed. I might be in the wrong though, my mom says I'm being rude and that the gifter was inconsiderate to not consider the other cousins.

So as the title suggests, I'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



Me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. This abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and I used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because I'm set to win in a few months.



Now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after I adopt our kid.



When I told her that I was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support I'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why I wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



For info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.

1922,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: My partner is upset with me because I asked her to stop taking candid pictures of me and our baby together

My partner and I just made a baby. Our baby is a beautiful blend of us, she's healthy, and she's easily consolable as long as you pay attention to her needs. I feel very lucky to have such a chill baby. This is our first kid so I'm learning to be a dad and she is learning how to be a mom. 

Im not a fan of documenting every moment of my life,  I prefer to just live it. I have a stoic demeanor and tend to be extremely mindful about things being impermanent. I was a very reactive young man and as I grow older being slower to react has been the lynchpin to my ability to cultivate close romantic relationships. 

We all have our dispositions and tendencies. This is mine. My partner has another.

My partner loves to take pictures of everything she experiences. Her Instagram story is basically a play by play of every meal she makes and every experience she encounters. Our baby has been hot content for her lately.

I don't like that our baby is social media content for her, but if she feels rewarded posting pics about our baby 24/7 so be it. My only ask is that she leave moments with me and baby out of it. The first 3 weeks she did not follow my boundary and from time to time I would find myself on her social media sharing a candid moment with our daughter. I let it slide because whatever were new parents, but I continues to reiterate that I would.rather not be content in her social media world.

Yesterday as I'm walking around the house feeding baby I turn around and see her recording me. I understand that she thinks this is a sweet moment to share with social media but for me this is a private moment I'm having with my family that I don't want to be shared. Im learning how to be a dad and I feel vulnerable enough as it is without having my moments be turned into content for my partner. 

I snapped and told my partner ""please stop fuc*ing posting pictures of me and baby"". I immediately regretted the reaction but I felt like all of my other polite requests were ignored and I reacted in a harsh way.  She told me basically that there is something wrong with me for not liking to take pictures. Now she refuses to speak to me because she is hurt by how mean I was.

1923,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I’m probably on YouTube. 

Today I had to forcibly remove a passenger from an airplane. I’ve been a flight attendant for 5 years, and this is the first person I’ve removed; and I feel icky. 

(The parts I didn’t see): Passenger scanned mobile boarding pass at the gate; had 4 bags, there’s a maximum of 2. Agents tried to stop her but she ignored them. More agents at the aircraft door, they tried to stop her &  she physically pushed past them and onto the airplane (my domain). I’m the lead flight attendant and the most senior FA

The agents ask her to stop. She doesn’t comply. She puts 3 Bags overhead, and keeps her (admittedly tiny) purse around her shoulder. The agents are livid. She’s irate. I do my damndest to deescalate the situation. I try to speak calmly to her “I know what happened at the gate is stressful, you can’t have 4 bags but if you check one we can deal with your tiny handbag by putting it in your larger bag, but if you are going to be irate on the flight I can’t have you travel with us as it affects the safety of others” etc. She’s yelling at me in the aisle. agitated. Irate. Yelling. Saying we’re “ridiculous and rude!” etc. Other pax are getting involved & defending her. I have federal regulations and I don’t make up rules. If I did I would have probably been persuaded.

I’m doing my best. 

Then she says, loudly, in the aisle “you are being ridiculous & you are all acting like a bunch of bitches.”  I KNOW I heard this. while the agent already wanted her Removed, until this moment I was doing my best to get everyone where they wanted to go because everyone (including myself) was ready to get home. When you call me names it’s out of my control. You should know this by the bad rep we get as FAs for throwing people off the plane. I went to the captain. She was removed. She refused to retrieve her baggage; another flight attendant had to do that. I hid like a coward while she was removed. 

What I’m most concerned about is during the flight someone called me a liar saying she “was removed for calling me a bitch and that didn’t happen.”  I know I heard her say those words. But even if she didn’t she should have been removed for assaulting an agent and being irate, combative, and non compliant. But it’s stuck with me tonight. 

Alternate conclusions:
1) did I do enough to deescalate? It started with too many bags but did it have to go THAT far? I didn’t see solidly the first half of this exchange but could it have been deescalated? I feel super bad about being the FA that has a passenger removed...did I mishear her calling me/us names? Does it matter?

2) you’ve seen the news. If a crewmember (or agent) tells you to do something just do it. We don’t make up the rules, and some of them I think are ridiculous; but I face up to a personal $10,000 fine if I don’t enforce them. You’ve seen the news. Just do what we say. We actually HAVE to do this. 

Thoughts? Am I THAT FA? AITA?",289,1195,0.95
1924,Everyone Sucks,"My 14 year old Sue is starting high school in September and a boot camp for band has recently started. For reference, they’re out practicing in the sun for about 6 hours a day, 4 days a week. For reference, Sue has moderate sensory issues, especially relating to food. We watch her like a hawk to make sure she doesn’t develop an eating disorder.

For the first two days of camp, I packed Sue alunch. Her mom normally does this, but she’s out of town for now. On the first day I packed her some left overs (fried rice and veggies with fruit; they have access to a microwave). She came home and raided the fridge and claimed that she didn’t like what I packed. The next day I made her a pb and j and threw a few raw carrots and pieces of broccoli in there. Repeat of the previous day.

I told her that she shouldn’t be wasting food like that and that, if she didn’t like what I made her, she could make her own lunch. 

Yesterday, I get a call from the camp saying that she had passed out. She admitted to me that she never did pack her own lunch. She told me that she forgot and that she couldn’t find anything in the (fully stocked) pantry. 

My wife is livid. Although she does agree that Sue should’ve been responsible, she says that I still should’ve made her a lunch. My wife and I have disagreed for years on the whole making lunch for Sue thing. Sue needs to be a 14 year old and make her own lunch; she should be able to find foods that fit in with her tastes. My wife, on the other hand, thinks that by asking her lunch, she can prevent Sue from going down a path of even worse eating habits and making sure that she gets all of her nutrients. I think my sister in law’s death from bulimia also plays a role in my wife’s attitude towards Sue’s eating. For the record, even at her worse, Sue has never been diagnosed with an eating disorder.

1927,Not the A-hole,"I go to visit my father during the summer for about a month. He has recently gotten married to another woman who has 8 year old daughter. I am 18 years old and my half sister is 25 so we have a lot more in common. I have been hanging out with my stepsister everyday for the last two weeks and it’s pretty fun. But my half sister just joined yesterday and we try our best to include my stepsister but she is just so much younger. 

Today all 3 of us hung out all day and by 5 we r tired so my half sister and I go to my room to watch some YouTube videos (they r not appropriate for children).  Then at about 8 my stepsister is supposed to go to her grandparents house just for the night and come back the next morning.  She starts crying because we didn’t spend all our time with her. My stepmom flips out and chases my half sister out of the house.

1928,No A-holes here,"In 2007 I gave birth to a little girl, Lily. My ex and I were deep into drugs and alcohol and were highly abusive. He got sober and asked if he could keep the baby. I agreed. I got sober but relapsed during the pregnancy, cementing the idea that I was not a good person for Lily. I relinquished my rights and my ex took Lily to live in Florida where he's from. I stayed in Alaska, where I'm from. I never saw Lily after the day I signed my rights away, something I've never regret.

&#x200B;

When Lily was two I got a letter of request of adoption. My ex had been seeing a woman since the Lily was four months old and she became momma in all sense of the word. When they got married when Lily was two she wanted to adopt her. I agreed because the Lily needs a momma. They unfortunately divorced when Lily was four but this woman is legally her mother so they've always had a relationship. In fact, this woman had custody of Lily and my ex had visitation. My ex unfortunately passed away about a year and a half ago in a car accident. He started drinking again and he crashed his car. Lily's mom had been seeing a man since the divorce who she recently married. He wanted to adopt Lily because he loves her and wants her to have a family despite everything. 

&#x200B;

Out of respect for me the mom wrote me a letter and formally asked for my blessing. I have no legal rights but she's a lovely lady who loves Lily and respects me as the bio-mom. Of course I gave my blessing because I want Lily to have the best life she can. But then the mom said Lily wants to meet me. She's 12 now. I haven't seen her since the day I gave up my rights and watched an airplane fly away. I've never regret giving her to her father where her life was far better than it ever could have been with me, a mess of a human.

&#x200B;

This last year since I got sober my life has been really hard. My dad died, my brother was diagnosed with cancer and is failing fast, my godmother was paralyzed in a terrible accident. All of this has been testing my sobriety in the worst way. Watching my brother fade, and knowing my dad is gone, and watching my godmother battle depression due to her disability, has been harder than all the times I've relapsed, even the OD. I know meeting Lily would be too much stress on top of everything and would make me remember a really awful time in my life. I'm afraid meeting her would make me use again.

&#x200B;

I told my mom I had been offered the chance to meet but declined and she went off on me. Said she had always wanted to meet Lily but she never said but now she feels like I've forever shut the door and she'll never have the chance. I told her to just write Lily's mom and ask for permission but she says that I've ruined everything by saying no. She asked me to write Lily's mom and ask for permission, which I said no to doing. I don't want to get Lily's hopes up about me. My mom is pissed off at me and says I've ruined everything.

1930,Everyone Sucks,"This is really more like are we the asshole, but anyways I'll go ahead and start with the reasons why I feel bad about the situation. 

So this happened a couple years ago in college, and the gist of it is our program had about ~20 people in it and we all had this really good friend group thing going, but none of us liked this one particular guy in the group. So we basically were mean to him and generally ostracized him, never invited him to our parties or anything. It got to the point where nobody would ever respond to him in group chat, we straight up ignored him. Our program would do this end of year thing to honor all the graduates, and when they were honoring him NONE of us clapped, and then we all sort of giggled because it was hilariously awkward (we were towards the back so it wasn't particularly noticeable, but still). Eventually he dropped out of our group chat, and the only response was someone saying ""bye Felicia"" and that was that.

So I know we all sound like shit at this point. But here's the thing. This dude was an absolute awful misogynistic fuckboy. We were in a pretty male dominated program, but I felt super comfortable around everyone except him. He would even rank us few girls in the program by how ""fuckable"" he thought we were, and of course all the other guys in the program (who are actual decent human beings) thought that was disgusting. He even told me to my face that he only talks to girls if he thinks they'll have sex with him, otherwise there's no point. So that's basically permission to never acknowledge his existence again, right?

So I guess I'm a bit conflicted because of the way we handled things. He was not a good person, but ostracization is considered a pretty terrible form of bullying that leaves lasting scars. Is it victim blaming to say getting bullied is his own fault for being a bad person? Or is this just us cutting out a toxic person from the group? I feel confident it's not YTA, but I flip between ESH and NTA. I'm wondering what everyone else thinks.

Edit: hey guys, based on a lot of comments I would like to clarify people DID confront him about it, but we eventually just got tired of having to interact with him since we were all classmates and shared a group chat turned friend chat as well as a lounge room on campus due to all being in the same program together.

Edit 2: So a lot of you agree I suck. It's good to know I was right to feel guilty and wasn't just overthinking things. Thanks!",32,32,0.9

So I’m a babysitter/nanny and there’s a family that I’ve been sitting for every Saturday night since June (it’s now August), and they usually order a pizza for dinner for both me and the kids. When they order the pizza, they give the pizza place their credit card number and it’s paid for ahead of time. I just have to sign the receipt.

Last weekend, I noticed for the first time that there wasn’t a tip already added - when I sat for a different family during the school year, they always added the tip on before I got the receipt, so I just didn’t notice it earlier this summer.

1933,Not the A-hole,"So my MIL is a bit of a witch. My husband has monthly dinners with her to keep her happy and get to see his family (he's 1 of 4 siblings and loves all his brothers and sisters dearly). The dinners include all siblings, all their partners, and the MIL and FIL, about 8-10 people total.

My family is Irish, and my late nanny passed me down a recipe for Irish stew. I have it written down because it's in nanny's handwriting so I've kept the original version she wrote for me safe for a decade now. This recipe is written entirely in Irish, her native language. I can read it, as can my family, but my husband's family cannot.

The actual recipe is pretty vague. The measurements are in pinches, dashes, splashes, ect, and it relies on taste more than anything. The only measurement of the stock is ""strong"". I don't even know the exact measurements, as when nanny taught me how to make it, she just showed me which jugs and pots to use and how full they should be. Whenever I asked how to replicate it, nanny would just say ""you'll know"". At the time I thought she was joking but it turns out she was right. I taste as I go and I just sort of know when it's done. I also have nanny's soda bread recipe which I make by hand, which goes really well with the stew.

When the last family meal happened, my husband asked me to make the stew, and throughout the meal MIL had complaints about every part of the dish, ranging from ""this lamb is stringy"" (it wasn't) to ""I don't see why it has potato"" (it's Irish) to ""this soda bread tastes homemade"" (it is and also how is that a bad thing).

My husband could tell I was getting annoyed, so he said ""well, I really love it. It's probably my favourite meal"". His siblings agreed that it was nice, as did their partners and FIL.

I got this text from MIL. She wants nanny's stew recipe. She said she found a recipe online and it tasted ""shit"", and wants nanny's recipe, which while not hugely different from most recipes online, does have a couple of ""secret ingredients"" and methodology that most recipes don't use.

So if I did give MIL nanny's stew recipe, here's how that would go: I'd have to translate the recipe, and write it out. I'd have to make the recipe myself from scratch and copy down my exact measurements. Then I'd have to show MIL how to make it, inviting her into my kitchen, and showing her exactly how to make my nanny's recipe. Then the same again for the soda bread.

I don't want to do this. When MIL ate it, all she did was critique it. Nanny gave it to me, and while she didn't make me promise to keep it secret or anything, she said she wanted it to stay in her bloodline, and for me to pass it down to my children. Plus I don't want to spend more time with MIL than I strictly have to. But I'm worried that if I keep it to myself and don't let her have the recipe, then I will look like the arsehole, as I'd be creating tension over a bowl of stew.",463,1858,0.97
1934,Not the A-hole,"This happened several years ago but has been bothering me off and on since.... so I’m hoping to get some adjudication from the internet strangers. 


I was the captain of a women’s rugby team in college. There was a huge social component to the team and we hung out all the time. It was also SUPER lesbian/queer/what-have-you friendly, though I’d estimate still majority straight. We had a number of players who joined mostly, it seemed, for the social component and  never were too keen on the actual rugby portion of the team. I think the fact that it was so open and queer-friendly without being specifically a gay/queer organization was a big draw to some people. This post is about one such player, who joined mostly for the social aspect. 


A few months after joining, this player (who initially presented as a butch lesbian) came out to the team as trans, which was a non-issue athletically - he wasn’t on hormones and even if he had been, he didn’t seem to care about actually playing anyway and certainly wasn’t first-string. Over the next few weeks/months, though, it started to be kind of weird to have a dude on the team. He was NOT quiet about being a guy, and definitely referenced his maleness a LOT. For example, he’d talk about having to go with us to buy a car so we wouldn’t get conned, that kind of thing. He also continued to make the kinds of jokes that are okay for women to make to each other but feel kind of icky coming from a guy. 


Speaking for myself, it was a little weird being in the locker room and changing etc. with a dude. Not because he’s interested in women, (let’s be honest- probably 40% of the team was interested in women) but more because it was a man in a female space. 


ANYWAY. I eventually told him I didn’t think that a women’s sports team was the most appropriate place for him. He’s a guy, everyone on the team views him as a guy, and him coming to our all-female events was making some people uncomfortable. I told him he was 100% still welcome at all the stuff that people brought their boyfriends to, but that coming to team-only events probably wasn’t the best idea. 


So, internet jury, AITA for kicking this dude off the team?

""Ok, I'll be right over""

My mom passed away on the 3rd of July, I was chosen by the family to choose the funeral music, because I spent the most time with her after Mom and Dad divorced,and my older brothers were in college/living on their own and my younger sister wasn't born yet when they divorced.

Throughout my time with her, she would always play this game called Dr. Mario on the NES, (we were poor at the time) and I would occasionally join in, but things got way better and we bought a Wii (Circa 2010,) and my Mom was ecstatic when she discovered there was a new Dr. Mario game on the Wii, we bought it.

She would always tell me that she absolutely loved one music piece from the game, the Fever theme. So when she passed away, I had a friend (that was a music producer/composer) remake the Fever song so that it sounded sad yet hopeful, the original song is the type that could be remade to fit different moods.

In a week, he sent it, it sounded really good, I picked some more normal funeral songs and I even made sure with my father that it was okay, he said he liked it. But, dumbass me didn't tell him it was a song from a video game.

Sure enough, the funeral went fine, and later I booted up our old Wii to play Dr. Mario and reminisce, my father, (that was staying home at the time) sees me playing and we started reminiscing together, according to him she used to play it a lot even before I was born.

But then he heard the song and he said it sounded ""weirdly similar"" to that one song that was played at the funeral, I told him it's the same song just remade to sound different, and he. Was. Furious. He started going on and on about how ""You played music from that damn video game!"" Etc. Etc.

Well I recently talked with her and basically said hey you shouldn’t be misleading people like that just to show off how hard your life must be. she was like “what are you talking about?” And I basically explained what I said above and she got kinda annoyed with me and said that what she does is a real job not just a hobby or “side gig”. She then proceeded to tell me my logic doesn’t make sense because then her “side gig” would be her part time job since she makes more $$ from doing plushies. But I countered that with the fact that the part time job is in fact, considered employment *by law* regardless of how much money she makes. She even calls the plushy thing her own “business” but I didn’t comment on that to be safe even if it does sound pretty Braggy. Anyway AITA for correcting her?",104,54,0.7

I dont want to marry someone who has more than 25k debt at our age. 

He is telling me I'm being stupid about this. AITA? Its his debt after all, not mine.

They text every once in a while and she likes to send him nudes (that she sometimes sends to me because wants approval) to which he will respond with “nice” or “you’re hot.” Fast forward to May, she flies out to visit him and the first night he’s “busy with work” so she has to stay in a hotel because he says he won’t be home all night. The second night she goes over, loses her virginity, and has sex a couple more times with him the next day. When she flies home the following day, she is telling me how head over heals in love she is with him. More texting and nudes ensue and now we’re at this week and she is complaining to me that he only wants to talk over snapchat because he “wants to respond to her right away” (her words) even though he responds to her (15 a day) snaps around once or twice a day.

So if I were to donate to a charity, which would then be used to alleviate people's suffering, I'm going against the will of the gods who decided they have to suffer.

We got matched with a mother a few months ago who lives out of state and she chose us. The plan always was that when she went into labor, we’d fly to be there and stay there for a few days to a week, just to get all the paperwork done, make sure everything was situated, etc. In advance, we asked that my sister be able to dog sit/house sit at a moment’s notice since we had a due date but obviously baby’s can come a week before/after, anytime around that date. She agreed.

So, the baby is born. We’re so happy and excited. That first week is exhausting, plus we have to fly back with him. We had called my sister with a head’s up the night before saying we were. When we arrive back, our house is packed with family and friends, all there to meet baby. I was overwhelmed and just…not understanding. My sister said it was an “impromptu baby shower” since I didn’t have one (it didn’t seem right in case the birth mom changed her mind). Everyone wants to hold him, see him, asking a million questions and I just want to sleep. He’s also fussing because it’s loud, bright and he doesn’t know any of these people. I don’t care about people holding him, but I really just wanted this first night to be about us and for it to be a few people at a time.

Eventually, I go into my room and shut the door. My husband comes in a bit later and asks what I want. I tell him to get my sister and tell her to get everyone out. I’m exhausted and aware I might sound rude, but this isn’t how I imagined our first night home. I’m not in the mood to play houseguest. My husband agrees and is nice enough to be the bad guy. My sister and him get everyone to leave, and she promises the next day, she’ll come back to clean up.

When she does, however, she calls me rude and ungrateful. She says that I should’ve just enjoyed the party and people would’ve helped me with the baby. I said I didn’t want that, and how could she think I would after flying 5 hours with an infant? She got mad, finished cleaning and left.

Maybe she's stressed from the beginning of the school year, but her blood sugars have been all out of wack, like in the high 300s (normal range for her is 100-200). Sometimes I'll text her to see if she's okay, remind her to correct her blood sugar if it stays up for too long. She admits that sometimes she'll forget to give herself insulin at lunch, or if a teacher gives out candy or something. Sometimes, she'll outright lie to me about her blood sugar, saying she's in range when I can see that she's not. She's gotten mad at me for asking her about it, even demanded that I delete the Dexcom follow app from my phone so that I'll stop ""stalking"" her.

There was a kid next to her with his grandmother sitting behind him. I was sitting diagonally, so I could still see her and hear if she called for me, but I wasn’t sitting directly behind her. Granted I enforce the kids to be polite, I do not force them to play or interact with anyone they don’t want to. I figure they are eight and can determine who they want to talk to. I see the kid repeatedly look  at Bs computer and start pointing and talking to her about what she was trying to do. I see her not really responding and was visibly getting annoyed. The kid kept leaning over, pointing at things on her screen and talking. I then see the grandma stand up and start talking to B. At this point I get up and go over. I guess B was playing an “I Spy” game, and the kid kept pointing out the objects before she could find them. The grandma was telling B she should be ashamed of her self, she needs to learn manners and how to share, etc. I step in and asked what was going on.

My husband has a fairly healthy social life with work colleagues and frequently spends evenings and weekends socialising with them. Although I like my work colleagues it is much more of an 'end of work day see you tomorrow' kind of relationship.

Today he sent me a message that 3 co-workers (who are all female) are thinking of taking a ski trip in January and did anyone else want to go. The trip is going to work out fairly expensive at £2000 (around $2400) for the two of us. I'm hesitant due to the cost and the fact we haven't had a decent none city-break style holiday since we went on honeymoon. He is saying that if I don't want to go he is likely to go without me as he has never been skiing before (I have been once when I was 11) and he doesn't see why I should have an issue with him going without me. I think it's a lot of money to spend on a holiday by himself with work colleagues. Especially as it may mean we can't afford a decent holiday together for another X amount of years because of the expenses. Even if I do go I think it's a lot of money to spend taking a holiday with his work colleagues. 

I'm not majorly worried about him going away with three female colleagues (as I trust him) but it does make me feel a little uncomfortable as it just feels.. weird.

Harry, from what he tells us, dropped out of college a few years ago and worked some jobs on and off, but is currently unemployed and had no solid plan for what to do in the future. This obviously was a bit of a red flag for me, since Maya is going to be in school for a while. So supporting two people (and maybe more, if they have kids anytime soon) while attending something as rigorous as med school sounds very hard. I can say that from personal experience myself.

Afterwards, Maya asked me my husband what we thought of Harry. I asked if she wanted our honest opinion, and she replied that she did. I told her marrying him personally seems like a bad decision to me- he doesn't have a plan, ambition, or much future prospects since he hasn't gone to college or trade school or whatever, and has no intention of getting a job anytime soon. I'm not telling her what to do, and ultimately, it's her decision, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't do it. The next few years of her life are vital, as she has to get good enough grades to secure a good residency, and then complete her residency. Supporting yourself and another person financially while doing that would add immense stress and seems like a bad decision to me.

Last Thursday I came home from a week vacation and wanted alone time that Saturday with my friend, H. During that time, my son was out of town for the month with his friends and was coming home on that Sunday. Sunday came and he said he was gonna stay the night with his friends. 

I thought cool! I'll invite H over as well as my aunt to have dinner with us on Sunday! We had a good time and we spent the night together. Monday came and we were planning on spending the day together and I was gonna have him stay the night again. My aunt was coming over so I started to make dinner.

My son then called and let me know he was coming home that night. My son absolutely HATES H because we dated and he used to live with us, so I let him know H was gonna be here. My son got upset and said ""whatever, I'll just go into my room and ignore him."" I then said, ""well why can't you stay the night with your friend again?"" And he said his friend was having his gf over for the night and he wanted to go home already. So then I asked if he can go stay with his siblings or my sister. He said absolutely not.

I then asked my son to give me some privacy for one night. Is that too much to ask for? He then said he pays rent and should be able to come and go at his leisure, then he said, ""well can you leave next weekend? I'm having my gf over and need privacy"" I told him no because it's my house, my rules. He then told me he was gonna go stay with his brother since he can't come home.

I felt he was kind of an ass because he spread all this, especially to my other kids and their spouses, who are gossipy people.

He then promised me he'd leave to his aunts each weekend to give me privacy. I told him he no longer has to pay rent since everyone seems to think I kicked him out. He said he'd still help each month because he can still support himself. From all the comments, i realize what I did was pretty selfish.

Me (18), my brother (15), my sister (7), AND my step  sister (8) all were born within ten days of each other, and our birthdays are coming up. Crazy? I know. So my mom and her boyfriend both want to take us out for a collective birthday celebration, and I was totally cool with that, especially considering I’m going to college soon and it’ll be great to have a night out with them before I go. 

But my mom has decided on a really fancy steakhouse, a place where people are on dates, people are conducting business deals, and a place where people aren’t expecting kids. 

I love my mother dearly, but I just can’t stand the thought of this. I know she’s going to want to bring gifts, to which I know the kids are going to be obnoxious. I know this because she’s done this before, just not at a place like this. 

I first told her “let’s not go somewhere this high end, the little girls are too young and won’t appreciate it like they would if they were older”

She said okay, but ultimately decided to keep her original decision. 

So then I said this:

Okay, well I don’t really want to be THAT family who brings little ones into a place where it’s expected to not make a ruckus, so if you want to bring them there, that’s fine, but I won’t be going.

Now her and I aren’t talking. Part of me feels like a piece of shit, but the other part of me is glad I made myself heard. AITA?

I asked my sister what was wrong again, and she did not answer, she just kept crying, and one of her other friends told me to go away because I was making things worse.

I’m 24 and I’m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

She’s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

She also met her fiancé two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He’s not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. 

Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I “didn’t bring anything in”.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn’t I, and I tell him not to touch me. 

He tells me to “calm down” and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he’s being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn’t want to throw me out but he “will if he has to.” I told him that he’s trying to look tough but it’s just making him look stupid. 

At this point I’m getting more and more angry and I’m practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just “drop it.” He said he would but that “they can deal with it when I get out of hand.”

I just went to go find a seat after that. 

After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should’ve let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had “something to hide.” 

I don’t think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don’t think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this.

Our thought was that we didn't really want anyone there that we didn't know since it's more of a ""close friends and family"" reception. Realistically, the only people who get a +1 are friends because they may not know anyone in my family and I wouldn't want them to feel uncomfortable.

My mom asked about 4 months ago if she could bring her best friend as a +1. I do not like my mom's best friend. She causes drama everywhere she goes, and she especially doesn't like my dad. I said she couldn't. My mom does not have a significant other that she could bring in her place.

My dad has, on his own volition, covered a significant amount of the wedding costs because he is employed well-enough to do so, and my mom has not contributed any money to the cost of the wedding. This is okay with us because we initially weren't going to rely on anyone else for wedding costs. Also, since my mom makes less money than I do, it wasn't a thought in my mind to expect her or ask her to cover the cost of anything in our wedding. The reason I bring this up is because my mom's best friend will somehow twist my dad's generous act of covering the some of the costs into a negative thing. The two of them would sit there and talk negatively about my dad and his fiancee during the reception. Throw in alcohol, and the two of them would draw lots of attention to themselves and put my dad in an embarrassing spot (especially in front of my fiancee's family who has not met anyone in my family yet since they live halfway across the country). I know this would happen because it's happened before on numerous occasions.

My grandma tried to reason with me and say, ""Let her bring her friend,"" to which my response was, ""It's my wedding. I can decide who I want there and who I don't want there."" My mom actually started crying and then said something to the effect of, ""I was really hoping I would be able to bring my friend and her boyfriend."" I said, ""Mom. Now you're asking for 2 guests? We have to pay for everyone's food and we have to solidify guest numbers. We only have so many seats. We can't afford to pay for more people."" Then she asked, ""What if I have a boyfriend by the time the wedding comes around."" I said, ""We wouldn't know him and we don't want anyone we don't know at the wedding. Also, It's a cost thing too.""

1967,Not the A-hole,"I came home from a class last night and to my surprise, there was a little orange tabby laying on my doorstep. The poor thing is so skinny and malnourished (you can see his spine and ribs). His fur was matted and he was just covered in dirt, plant matter and bugs. He is incredibly friendly though, so we had suspicipns he is someone's pet. My husband and I have posted on pet FBI, Next Door, Facebook and other social media to broadcast if anyone had lost this little tabby. We took him in and he is currently living in our garage. 

The two us had a few hits that someone was missing their cat in our area, but none of the cats matched his description. When I took him to the vet today, they told me he doesn't have any microchips in him, so he was probably a stray. With that info, we started asking around our friends and family if anyone would want to adopt this very friendly and loving cat. 2 of my husband's friends at work have actually been in the market for a cat, so they said as long as he is litter trained, they would take him.

However, shortly after getting the news that he was going to a good home with people I trust, I got a message from a woman in my neighborhood. She told me that this cat belonged to her and her son and it ran away from home. She had been looking for it for 3 weeks now. I checked her post history and she had not posted anything about a missing cat. I asked her if her cat was chipped and she said of course. I then asked her what kind of cat it was and she said a tabby. No specification on color. I was a bit suspicious so I looked through her post history and there was 0 mention of a missing cat, or any cat in general.

When I told her that the cat we have is not chipped, she started going off on me and saying I was holding their cat hostage and I am a horrible person, how could I do this to her 10-year old son who loved his cat, Cheddar? She told me that I was lying or the vet was lying when they said this cat didn't have a microchip. She said she was going to come to my house to take this cat, which I declined and told her she was not taking this cat, even if she is the rightful owner. 

Am I the Asshole in this situation?

Edit 2: Thanks so much for the feedback and support. I just got some new info that makes me think she was trying to get a free cat, or that this isn't her cat to begin with! In the event she is missing her cat, I do hope she finds it soon. 

I was unaware that my neighborhood has its own stray/feral cat colony that lives in the woods nearby. My husband was talking to a neighbor today and the neighbor said that there's maybe like 10-20 cats living in the woods. Some are friendly and a lot of the people in the neighborhood feed them under the assumption it's someone else's cats. The neighbor my husband was talking to thinks that this cat came from the colony. He's seen a few cats that match this cat's description in the colony. Many of the colony cats are not chipped and are unalteted, per say. I am calling my local shelter to help to TNR the colony tomorrow.

1969,Not the A-hole,"Ill be brief here as cuz I don't want to make it a long post.

I had a former friends Mark and Gwen. I say former cus I decided to drop them both after we had a fight. Mark's GF said that I was creepy cuz I'm a 27 yearold virgin. Mark jokingly told her and Gwens BF that I was virgin on a night out. Something I didn't appreciate. Then she just dropped that remark. I just told her to mind her business. He told me to tone down my hostility and Gwen sided with him saying I was very sensitive. At this moment I had it. I just walked away. I had enuf at this point. 

6months have passed. They tried apologising but I had it. So I met them at a local mall coincidentally last sunday. Small talk aside she told me that she's getting married in two weeks and wanted me there. I just flat out rejected and told her I wasn't interested. Just like that and walked away. I heard mark yell about how much of a jerk i am and whatever but i walked away. 

Yesterday she dropped by and gave me the invitation. I had some guys from my local tennis club over. Igave her the invitation back and told her not to come back. She teared up and walked away. 

I didn't start thinking about it until when the boys told me how cold I was. I don't know I just am I confused here. I do have the right to reject right?",65,109,0.92
1970,No A-holes here,"Last year I left home to move away to university. My dad continually told me my old room was mine and always would be, something he still says.

While I was away at university my dad got a girlfriend who quickly moved in with him, I'm happy for them. But the last time I came home I found my room had been completely organised and tidied. My dad happily told me his girlfriend had ""nicely sorted out all my stuff and made it organised"". 

I admit my room was a mess and luckily I'd taken anything private with me, but I also feel that he had said it was my room which led me to believe he'd leave it be. 

My dad thinks I'm overreacting and that I should be happy his girlfriend tidied it. She does seem like the ""motherly type"" who may have been just trying to help but I still think it's a complete invasion of privacy.

1971,Not the A-hole,"So this happened a while a go but I still think about it from from time to time. 

So my gf was graduating from college and she wanted my parents and I there. She's from another country, and her mom couldn't be there. GF asked me to try to sit close and film her getting her diploma for her mom. We got there early but the arena was already pretty packed. We found a nearly open row close to the stage so we go to sit down. There was a teenage girl playing on her phone at one end and a toddler playing by herself at the other end. My Dad and I pass the teenager and sit down. Apparently they were attempting to save the row for their family bc when my mom goes to pass, the girl kicks her leg out to stop her. That's when her father, who was sitting in the row in front of us got involved. He tells us that row is for his family.   If he had asked us nicely to leave I probably would have, but he came at us pretty rude and entitled.

So my Dad fires back that you cant save seats and were not moving. My mom, not one for confrontation, tells us shes going to find another seat. My dad holds his ground and so do I bc Im determined to get this this video for my gfs mother, and Im kind of on my dads side. Im like my mother. I hate confrontation but I do think its a little ridiculous to claim a whole row of 10 seats in a crowded arena. This is where I might be TA. The toddler starts to cry. Shes clearly disapapointed she didn't get to save the row like her dad told her too. I feel awful but still don't move. Things escalate and my dad and this guy are arguing louder. Not screaming but deffinately making a scene. The guys says ""if you wanted these seats you should have gotten here earlier"" to which my dad replys ""we got here before your family"". The man finally relents, grabs his toddler and sits down. Another family comes and asks if these seats are taken. My dad point to the man and says he seems to think so. The family shrugs and sits down. 

We watch the ceremony and I got a decent video of my gf. I told my gf what happened after and she thought my dad was a hero. My mother and I feel like we might have been assholes.

1972,Asshole,"So I (21M) work at an upper class restraunt as a waiter and bartender. One night we get this party of 12 come in for a 3 course meal which, of course, comes with wine.

Anyway the night drags along, I'm not having any problems with the groups so far and they seem like polite people. I go down to re-fill their wine and other alcohol, and I notice one lady clearly intoxicated. She mumbles ""fill my wine glass alllll the way to the top pls"" I obviously don't do this but I give her a standard refill. The guy next to her which I assume is her bf/husband says ""Don't you see she's had enough? Please don't give her any more alcohol"" I apologise and head back to the bar.

I bruaght it up to my co-worker and he said he didn't think I was TA because it's what she requested and these guys are spending a lot of money. But what the guy at the table said got me thinking.

1973,Not the A-hole,"In my position it's expected that we be accessible after hours in case an urgent issue comes up. I'm not expected to be monitoring my e-mail constantly, but if something comes up and my boss texts me, it's expected that I hop on and deal with it if I'm available. Long story even longer: most people in my role have their e-mail setup on their phones.

...and so did I, until recently. The Microsoft Exchange settings for our work server required that you allow ""Device Admin"" access. If you're unfamiliar, that means that the e-mail administrator at our company could potentially remotely lock/wipe my phone. I used a third-party e-mail app (I won't name drop since I don't want to promote a service here, but it's a fairly popular Android Exchange client) that allowed me to restrict that admin access to the app only - so if the administrator remotely wiped my phone, it would only wipe the Exchange e-mail data instead of my entire phone.

We recently changed our e-mail service, and now we can only access our e-mail through the official Outlook Android app or the Outlook program on our company-issued computers. The Outlook app does not have the ability to restrict Admin access to the app only, so I would need to give my company Device Admin access on my phone. I am not willing to do this because...

1. I do not know who has administrator access to the company e-mail service, so I can't say I trust everyone who does
2. Someone could accidentally, or less likely maliciously, remotely wipe my phone when I have not lost the device (say, trying to wipe someone else's device)
3. My company does not pay for my phone service at all; I have no problem with using my unlimited data/minutes for work purposes since I would have the service anyway, but I'm drawing the line at giving them permission to remotely wipe my phone

My co-workers say that I'm being ridiculous and should just do it despite my objections. The two counter arguments I can kind of see are:

1. I could potentially be making more work for my coworkers if I am OOO and can't get my e-mail
2. I'm really just making things harder on myself by restricting myself to having e-mail on my work laptop only

I still maintain that the company should either allow for the use of the outlook web app (which is currently restricted) or vet the third-party e-mail client and allow its use.

1974,Asshole,"Hello!

So just I (m23) just had this huge argument with my (f25) wife.

The background: me and my wife got married last year, and for about 1 week ago we became parents to this beautiful little girl imaginable. She comes from a single parent family, and raised, soley with out any siblings, by her mother. They are very close and me and MIL goes along very well (realy, she is an amazing woman). I on the other hand is the complete opposite. I come from a large family (I have 5 siblings) raised by both my parents and my mother absolutley adores children, I shit you not if she could there would be no end to my siblings. Every grandchild she has she loves as if they were her own, and she loves having kids around, watching them, playing with them spoil them etc.

MY mother and my wife how ever are realy not the best pals. They behave in each other presens and they are not rude, they just dont match on any level. Now my wife made it clear to me that she does not wan my mother to visit us while we are in the hospital (I get it since my mother can be a bit much sometimes, especially when she gets a new grand child). I thought it was fair and square, after all she is the one doing all the hard work and I am there for support and not realy in any position to make demands. So far so good.

Here comes the tricky part. The delivery was realy painful and took a looong time (I think about 40 hours+ wich several complications) and natrually my wife was exhausted afterwards and once everything cooled down she was given something to help her sleep, and she was knocked out dead cold. During this time, while my wife was asleep I got a text from my mother asking how it went and if she could come visit etc because they live realy close to the hospital. Looking at my wife sleeping I said ok, but we had to meet in the visiting area because my wife was sleeping.

So I took my daughter, went and met up with my mother. They stayed for about 30 min and then went of on their way. I took my daughter back to the room, and as we enterd my wife woke up and asked us were we been, I told her and she went silent. last night her mother (my MIL) came for the first time she lives quite far away, so need several days of travel.

I dont know what sparked the argument but the essential was that my wife considerd me a major assohole for letting my mother see our daugther first. She wanted her mother to be the first relative to see our child first and that she said she didnt want my mother to visit at the hospital. I found that absured, that I understood not wanting to see my mother in the fragile state of post birth, but putting up my family to visit my child for several days in awaiting for her mother? Especially when they live close by. And the fact that I made sure she didnt have to meet my mother was considerate. The argument got heated and we kinda made up but things are still lingering in the air.

AITA here?  


Edit:  Just for clarification, it was never discussed upon who would meet the baby first, only that my wife didnt want my mother to visit.",1081,1411,0.91
1975,No A-holes here,"I bought my first house just a month ago. I'm a 26 y/o woman, i bought it just for myself, and I'm really proud of it; I've always been a big saver and it's paid off.

It's a small house with a nice back yard that has a small inground pool and some forest behind it. There's a stream running through the forest, partly through my property.

It's a nice location too, just outside the small city where I work. I keep my house very clean and have a modern / minimal style to it. 

Some of my favorite things to do at my place are have my friends over for swimming and chill barbecue parties and bonfires. I also host a weekly DnD group on Thursdays. 

One thing that's stressed me out about having a home is the amount of liability I'm taking on, especially with the pool and the stream. And also how it's my job to maintain it and keep everything nice, which can be expensive! 

And every time there have been kids over, I've been so stressed.

The neighbors kids play in the stream and also apparently the old homeowner let them play in the pool a lot. I'm not comfortable with either. It seems like a lot of kids feel like they have free reign to come swim, every time I send one away two different ones come by like ""Mrs Johnson always let us swim"" 

Also when I've hosted DnD, a couple of players who are not really close friends of mine (They're more like friends of a friend) showed up with their young kids, who they never brought to the bar where I used to rent out the back room to host DnD. 

I get stressed out about my stuff getting broken or dirty or the kids getting hurt. My place is not really kid friendly; I have a modern black glass theme to my furniture, with black glass tables and coffee tables and shelving. Not something that's ok to climb on. And I have a well stocked home bar, and a kitchen that's not at all childproofed. I've got a magnetic wall where I store and display all my nice cooking knifes, for example. So every time, I'm just stressed about watching for kids climbing on the tables or getting in the kitchen or in the booze.

I floated the idea of having an 18+ house by one of my neighbors who I'm friendly with, since I was feeling frustrated. Basically putting signs on the pool fence and along the property lines by the river saying no trespassing, and the property was 18+. And she said that would probably cause a lot of fuss in the area, because it's a very family friendly area where a lot of people go so their kids can have a safe place to play outside and have community. 

I also floated the idea by one of my friends in DND and she said that would probably drive people away, which is a big pain in the game because you need a reliable group. And would it really be that bad to have one room where the kids could play?

I don't know if I'm being too paranoid and irritated. AITA for wanting an 18+ rule for my new home?

ETA - A lot of comments mention ""no trespassing"" signs. I've already got one, and a lot of neighbors assume that it's just to keep strangers from hunting or fishing on my land or something, they don't think it applies to kids too. So that's why I wanted to be specific on my signs, as weird as it sounds...",263,982,0.96

1979,Not the A-hole,"My mom is a very antisocial muslim woman, but she expects me to be home all the time so she's not lonely. (We live alone together, and I would be living away at college right now if she wasn't going through medical treatments.)

Whenever I am out of the house for a while she gets mad at me and blows up on me, so last night she decides to slut shame me for having a boyfriend (whom she's met before and actually thought was a great guy) and accuses me of having sex. I always resented her for telling me my worth is only about my virginity since I was 8 years old has given me trouble to have a healthy sexuality as a 21 year old.

Last night she decided to say she saw my panties in my laundry and my discharge looks like I've been being a whore.

She told me I'm cursed and that God will punish me. I don't believe this what so ever, but I sent her a verse from the quran that basically says if you accuse a virgin of having sex and you're wrong, you will be punished. (Islam scripture actually protects women from sexual accusations),  a hadith that says you need 3 witnesses to say the girl is active, and another verse that says you cannot speak on God's behalf for how he will punish someone.

Edit: I was disgusted she went in my laundry and in the heat of the moment also told her she just doesn't remember what discharge is because she dried up down there and it's probably dust and spiderwebs for her.

1980,Not the A-hole,"My ex is a very complicated person. She’s been through a lot in her life and I feel for her, extremely. At the same time, she’s done some stuff that’s hurt our kids and I have to put them first and foremost. We’ve been divorced for 4 years now and at first we were friendly, but now, it’s gotten to the point where we can’t be because I have to put my foot down to protect the kids. I have sole custody and at this point, she has visitation. When these events, were happening, however, she did have partial custody (every other weekend). Our kids are 9 and 12. 

Last year, my ex got pregnant. The kids were very excited, talking about getting a new baby sister, constantly. Then, it was revealed that the baby was born still. The kids were devastated and I helped them through it, offering support to my ex as well even though we weren’t on the best of terms because I knew she was struggling. She turned me down and this was when things started spiraling more.

A few months ago, we ended up in court to talk about custody again. It was pretty clear that I was going to be given sole custody because she wasn’t stable enough to have them on her own. She had been lying about a lot of stuff I won’t get into here and was owning up to it. When asked if she lied about anything else, she said that the baby hadn’t died when she was born, but she had given her up for adoption. She just didn’t know how to tell the kids that she wasn’t able to care for her. I was in shock and found it terrible that she would lie about such a thing, put our kids through that. They’ve written letters, prayed to this sister, mourned her and talked about her in therapy. Yes, her being given up would’ve been hard, but thinking she was dead was even worse.

After the hearing, I asked my ex if she was really telling the truth (because sadly I can’t believe anything she tells me) and she showed me proof that she had given the baby up. I was so angry with her. A few days later, I sat the kids down and explained to them the truth. I didn’t bad talk their mother, they knew she already told lies, and said that she had lied about something else. I explained their sister was alive and was being raised by someone else. They were angry and confused. Now, my eldest won’t see her mother and refuses to go to visitations. My youngest goes, but I know they don’t talk much.

The issue is, I’ve gotten flack in my life for telling my kids. They think that it turned them against their mother and that she should’ve been the one to tell them. I didn’t trust her to do so. Some think I should’ve had their therapist do it. I’m honestly not using this for validation and I do wonder if I handled this right. Was I an asshole for telling my kids about this?",98,470,0.97

Hello Reddit, my wife recently lost some weight and is back to her pre-baby weight, keep in mind our youngest is 6. I was 320, down to 280 and now back to 300 and I blame my wife.

I have been trying to diet and exercise for some time now. We go to the gym 2-3 times a week. I do most of the shopping and buy good food/no junk food. I will skip the bread, portion my meals better, yada yada yada.

She always goes to Target. Women love Target... Buy Target stock..... and comes home with junk, granola bars, cheeze it’s, chips, ice cream etc. saying it’s for the kid's lunches or summertime snacks.. But if it’s in the house, I will eat it and she knows that. I am trying to tell her kids don’t need those type snacks, but that’s a whole different post.....

She also will go somewhere and call me if I want a snack.. like bring home Frostys for the kids, or stop at McDonald’s, or 7/11. I told her to stop doing that, yet she continues.

She called me last night and asked if I wanted a snack, I yelled no and hung up on her. She was mad. She gets mad when I don’t say goodbye before I hang up... But I had to do that because you know what? I would have said yes.......

Am I the asshole for thinking she is sabotaging me to not lose weight?",69,35,0.77
1984,Asshole,"Okay, so it’s more of are we The a-hole, but anyways here is the story:

I have a friend group of about 9 people including me. We all have nicknames for each other, which is based off the muppets. Idk why we started doing this, but in that group, we go by those names. They’re given for their looks or personality. For example, I am animal due to my crazy red hair. Anyways, he have this laid back dude we call Kermit since he’s full of wisdom, the leader, and cool. He recently got a girlfriend who is really sweet and she joined the group almost immediately. The problem came during lunch when we deemed her worthy of a nickname, so due to her dating Kermit, we called her Miss Piggy. When we told her she started to cry and asked why we were calling her fat. We didn’t know that she had body issues, which is what Kermit told us. So she thinks that we called her fat and refuses to speak to any of us, especially me since I first called her it. We didn’t mean it to be mean.

So are we the a-holes for calling her that, even if we didn’t mean to be rude or mean.

UPDATE: Kermit just texted me and updated me. He chased her down and explained to her about how everyone in the group has been nicknamed after the Muppets and that Miss Piggy is Kermit’s girlfriend. (We just said that she was gonna be Miss Piggy to us from now on) She had never heard of the Muppets, so she thought that it was a insult to her. She is glad that we included her but asked for us to give her a different nickname, but she wants one. I said “how about Honeydue (the scientist muppet) because of how smart she is and she said sure. 

We will be more sensitive now and everything’s cool.

EDIT:
Just to let you all know, we hadn’t seen muppets in a long time and had no clue about Denise. Idk why we have the nicknames, but we would’ve called her Denise if we knew.",108,691,0.93

1986,Not the A-hole,"I had a really good friend that moved back to her home country a couple of years ago. This friend has a son that’s around the same age as my own (now 11 years old). The boys were never really friends. Her son can be a bit of a bully, is very aggressive and overall, just has some issues that she’s trying to help him with. So, we mostly just hung out ourselves until she moved, taking her son with her. Now, her son’s father (her ex) still lives in the states and her son comes to visit him as unaccompanied minor once a year. She’s always trying to say that the boys should get together but due to a few awkward playdates as kids, my son is just not interested and always asks that I make an excuse. This year was no different and I told her that my son was busy with camp during the time that her son was visiting. (A lie, he was hanging out with various friends and had camp, but I could’ve made time, he just didn’t want to and I wasn’t going to force it.)

Now, keep in mind, I don’t have any contact with her ex. Like at all. We haven’t spoken since the two of them divorced which was over 6 years ago. Not for any bad reasons, but we were never friends and the only reason we ever spoke was because of my friend. He didn’t contact me at all before this. I was at work and get a call from my daughter (14).

“Um…Mom…(Friend’s ex) is here.”

“Huh?”

“Yeah, he just showed up. I didn’t even recognize him until he said his name and then I saw (Friend’s son) in the car.”

“Why are they here?”

“To hang out with (son), I guess?”

I found this weird. Like I said, I had never arranged a time or date for this. I had told my friend that my son was busy and unavailable to hang out. I asked my daughter to give her phone to my friend’s ex. We chatted and he said that his ex had told him to bring him by our house, so the boys could see each other. I explained my son was busy and not home that day (a lie, but according to my daughter they hadn’t seen him) and that it just wasn’t a good time, reiterating that I had told that to my friend. He said okay, nothing more and according to my daughter, they left.

My friend and I later talked, and she was upset that the boys never got together. I reminded her that I said my son was unavailable and that the unexpected pop-up was pretty inappropriate. She said that I could’ve made the time, because her son hadn’t seen mine in awhile. When I was talking to my husband about it, he said I should’ve just had my son hang out with him, because it just seemed like a lot of drama for nothing. My son, on the other hand, thanked me for avoiding it all.

1987,Not the A-hole,"Background info: I'm 16, and got a diagnosis for telogen efflevium (basically my hair sheds A LOT due to an iron deficiency). My hairs thickness has decreased by approx 60-70%, and its really disconcerting seeing clumps of hair fall out daily. Ever since I find out, I've been emotionally distressed, and its taken an obvious toll on me. 

I didn't tell anyone, not even my friends, about the aforementioned condition, as I feel its unnecessary and I don't want anyone to know. A few days ago, my mom was talking to my aunt, and I made my mom promise not to tell her about the condition. I move on with my life, and forget about it. Until yesterday, when my mom gave me her phone to check something out. I had this nagging feeling that kept telling me to check her texts with my aunt. I know its an invasion of privacy, but I couldn't brush it off. Lo and behold, not only did my mom tell her, but she went into GREAT DETAIL about it, about how i count the hairs that fall, my current mental state, how I've been ''disconnected'' and uninterested in everything! Needless to say, i was FUMING. What really pissed me off is that out of all the people, she tells this aunt, who is the type that can't keep a secret, she'll tell anyone who'll listen. I was finally feeling somewhat better about my condition, and generally; only for this to bring me back to square 1. So I went, and confronted her. My judgement was clouded by how angry I felt, and I threw the phone on the couch. She was indifferent. My mom is one of those people who pride themselves on not apologizing, even if they're wrong. My mom is never at fault, its always someones fault. This isn't the first time shes done something like this. I can count the amount of times my mom has apologized to me on an amputees hand, so I'm not really expecting an apology. Instead of her being mature, my dad tries to resolve the issue by talking to me privately. I end up telling him how I plan on cutting her off (I have other reasons), how she still has a middle school mentality, etc. She thinks I'm ''overreacting'' ''Its not even that big of a deal'', so AITA?

Her side:
He bought a Switch for $50. Im an avid gamer and still have all of my childhood consoles. I'm in college and work full time but literally live on pennies so I was SPEECHLESS when a luxury item like that was brought into our lives for so cheap. I have been playing Zelda any second I get and I love it so much, it distracts me from stress, I have fun, and we bond over playing it together. Well, he's broke right now and wants to sell it for quick cash. I say it's not fair because we share it so he can't make that decision just because he bought it, that's not teamwork or relationship material. Plus, he wouldn't be broke if he hadn't spent $50 on beer this week so it isn't fair he's selling our shared items because he can't budget money well. I paid for our $350 dresser but I let him use half of it because that's relationships, you share and don't hold who bought what over each other's head. 

Edit from her: i offered to clear the $300 he owes me on my credit card so I can ""buy it"" from him and keep it and he said no because he wants cash. 

His side:
I paid for it, so it's my item and I can do what I see fit for it. A piece of furniture in our room and a misc item video game console are not the same especially when she collects old consoles so she has tons of games to play. I need the cash to get through the week. It is a luxury item and she shouldn't shame me for doing what I need to do for some cash. It's just a video console, she can buy another one herself if she wants to and just restart the game. It isn't the end of the world.

So for the background: 
My (m,23) best friend (f,23) had Idiot boyfriends for as long as I have known her. Nothing horrible or abusive, but they were idiots. While you think that wouldn't necessarily affect me - since it's her relationship - that wasn't the case. 2 of them were incredibly jealous and it was annoying af. 

Fast Forward and my bestie is single. I thought I could help her a bit to finally get the great bf she deserves. I went through my friendslist and....well...most of them did not really fit the description she gave me of what she wanted from a bf.

(Both of them really really love volleyball, as I said: perfect match). They instantly hit it of and started hanging out without me.
I never told him of my idea. I told her only after they were already friends. But to be fair I did talk him up a lot and always used him as a benchmark of how dudes should be.

Again fast forward a bit and his girlfriend broke up with him. They were already having a rocky relationship when I had my match making idea and broke up once before. 
After a few weeks my best friend and my friend got together.  (They did nothing other than hang out before the break up, no cheating involved)

I told all of this a friend of mine and she thinks I was a massive asshole to the ex-Girlfriend by introducing them. 
And since then I found out that, while not the primary reason, him hanging out with my best friend was a contributing factor to the fight that finally led to the break up. 

So dear Reddit: Am I the asshole?",89,81,0.83

1992,Asshole,"Throwaway, sorry for length.

Background: 7 years ago, I was in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted for about 3 years. During that time, I became addicted to painkillers (prescribed originally for an injury sustained in the relationship and then became a means of coping). After the relationship ended, I spent a significant amount of time in therapy & treatment. I also finished started/finished my doctorate. I’m very private about my personal life and because I lived on the opposite side of the country while in this relationship and using, I was able to hide a lot of that part of my life from family/friends. I only told 3 close friends who lived back home, including one called K. K had been one of my best friends for the last 12 years, she knows the most intimate details about my life, and vice versa.

A year and a half ago I moved for work and K and I became even closer, as we had both recently moved to different states where we didn’t know anyone and relied on each other for ""company"" while we adjusted to the change. She was also quite stressed about money having just finished a professional degree, and work having just started a new high pressure job. We talked almost daily. At this time, I finally felt healed enough to begin dating again, and fell pretty hard for a guy named E. After \~9 serious months together, I found out E had been cheating on me. This was devastating and I relapsed. I immediately told K and my 2 other close friends who knew about my past and got myself into treatment. Surprisingly, K was completely unsympathetic and refused to discuss the breakup or how I was doing. Admittedly, it was hard for me to focus on anything else, my addiction and heartbreak were all-consuming at the time, and I took a 3 week leave of absence to deal with things. One night while on the phone, I had been having a particularly tough day and K completely blew up at me saying (and I quote) “I don’t want to hear about E anymore. You’ve become a junkie again over this person and he wasn’t even cute. Grow up.” I was beyond hurt that someone who I considered one of my best friends would say that and immediately hung up. The next day I sent her a message saying how shocked I was that she would say something like that to her closest friend, let alone one who was alone several states away, dealing with work stress and an addiction issue on top of a break up. She responded with a long message about how \*I\* was the asshole for not even bothering to find out what was going on in her life that day and why she might have been stressed enough to snap at me, and focusing so much on myself. I never responded, and have since essentially cut her out of my life. She’s texted/called me a few times and I haven’t responded. It’s been \~6 months and some mutual friends think I should get over it. I honestly don’t think I can or want to - I don’t want an apology or anything else from her ever. AITA for cutting her off point blank?",36,68,0.84
1993,Not the A-hole,"For awhile, I was disappointed that it seemed my kids weren’t having the neighborhood experience I had where you could meet up with friends next door and play. Most people in our neighborhood are older, with grown kids. Then about a year ago, an older grandmother type got custody of her 3 grandkids. The grandkids were on a walk and while we were all playing in the yard, we met. The younger two are around the same age as my kids so they hit it off. So, these kids started coming over to play a lot in our yard, on our equipment and what not. I never talked to their grandma about it. I know her a bit, but there’s a language barrier. The kids always said grandma knew where they were. They’re 8 and 10, by the way. 

Anyway, eventually stuff started going missing. I didn’t blame those kids at first. I told my kids to not leave stuff out in the yard (we lock up outdoor toys in our shed and bring in anything else), and it wasn’t anything too valuable. A ball or a jump rope. While the neighborhood doesn’t have a lot of kids that live there, we do have visitors and it could’ve been anyone.

Then one day, I came home with my kids and noticed these neighbor kids were playing in our yard. We have our playground fenced off but they were in the front, kicking their own soccer ball around. I said they couldn’t be over when we weren’t home. They said they understood. Then a few days later, the lock on the gate to our playground was broken. I fixed it, but was suspicious. Sure enough, broke again and the kids were in there. After talking to them, they said they got their older brother to do it. They say they don’t have stuff like this at their grandma’s. I said I get that but that this was illegal and dangerous. If they got hurt, I’d be responsible since it was my property and they can’t just break in.

I went to the grandmother with the kids and a neighbor that I knew spoke her language. She helped me explain that if it happened again, I’d be pressing charges and that her kids are to stay out of my yard. I also expected to be repaid for the lock. The grandmother said that her grandson (16) couldn’t afford to repay it and I said that wasn’t my problem, she could pay for it and then he could pay her back or whatever. I said if I didn’t have the money by x date, then I would call the cops.

My other neighbor thinks I’m being too harsh. I don’t think so. I paid to have it replaced once and didn’t have evidence that he had broken it. Now, I do. I think the least they can do is fix it. Am I being an ass here?",58,464,0.97
1994,Not the A-hole,"I was at the Apple Store yesterday for a repair.  I tried to use a local business to get my issue resolved but only Apple is able to repair home button issues of the kind I had.  

I arrived 15 minutes early, figuring that if I'm early maybe the appointment would start on time, but was told to come back at the time of my appointment.  Fair enough.  I came at the time of my appointment and then they sent me off to a table to wait.  About 20 minutes into the wait, every employee in the store stopped what they were doing.  At my table this meant one employee who was assisting someone with setting up their iCloud and another employee who was activating a phone.  

Every employee then spent 5 minutes loudly, raucously applauding as one employee walked out the door for the last time because she was moving away.  It took 5 minutes because she was hugging everyone.  I heard employees later remark that they do it this way to make it intentionally embarrassing.

Eventually they all got back to work and then about 5 minutes later someone came to help me.  The help was great and itself only took 5 minutes.

I tried to appreciate the heartfelt send-off but instead my mind just returned to the fact that I'd been waiting at a table twiddling my thumbs and every customer in the store had their experience interrupted.  

Afterwards I filled out my ""how'd we do"" survey and gave my helper a perfect rating but the overall experience a low rating and explicitly complained about the wait during the ceremony.

It was only 5 minutes out of the 20+ minutes I was made to wait but it's what I focused on and what continues to annoy me when I think about it.

1995,Not the A-hole,"So I guess how to describe this...my local movie chain (statewide) does this program where in the summer they sell a package of tickets for $60 (in this case) for 12 weeks of movies. So the movies are almost always second run kids movies and you can go to one movie a week. The movies always happen at 10AM so its obviously geared towards kids, moms and babysitters. You more or less end up seeing the same groups and families every week.

I work overnights and don't make a ton of money and just generally enjoy the movies, comfortable seats and cool air (I live in a cheap ass apartment that doesn't have good AC). When I saw the theater was having this deal, I went to the manager and asked if I could buy one...he said of course and I thought cool no big deal. 

I usually get off work at 8AM so what I would do is stop at the theater, park in the shade and sleep for an hour before the doors actually opened at 9, then I'd go in, grab my snack and chill in the theater until the movie started at 10. I always took an out of the way seat and would enjoy the show. 


Well last week on my way out a typical ""Karen"" came up to me and asked if I had any kids. I said I did. She said she was curious but she never see's me with them. I told her I didn't want to get into it but I was divorced. She said asked again why I don't bring my kids to the summer movie club which are obviously for kids. I said I just enjoy kids movies. She said ""you're that pervert I see sleeping in your car."" I told her I'm not a pervert and I just am on my way from work. She said I really slept in my car to see Shrek?  I told her I just wasn't comfortable with the conversation and left.

She went to the assistant manager and however she spun the conversation I was banned from the theater. He threatened to call the police and I can't have a parole violation. This was last week and it's about 9AM now and I'm going to go in and talk with him and try to justify myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong. 

Basically if I was the asshole, I'll just leave and go to movies somewhere else. If I wasn't the asshole, I'll go in and make my case (this theater is about 7 miles closer to my apartment than the next one, so it's just a nice convenience to be able to come here).

1996,Not the A-hole,"Quick backstory so I can give the most information possible:

My girlfriend and my tattoo artist go way back. They went to elementary school together and all the way up to graduating high school together.

I'm a guy. My girlfriend is a girl. My tattoo artist is a girl.

Soo, to the main story:

I went to get a tattoo today as a tribute to my late mother, who was my only parent and an amazing mother throughout my life.

My girlfriend came along as they were friends, so we were all chatting having a really good time. They were also talking about how we should all go to the gym together as the tattoo artist wants help with her form etc / afraid to start alone.

When she's done with the tattoo it's absolutely amazing, so I ask how much she wants - and she says half of what any sane tattoo artist would take.
I ask if she's 100% sure on the price, and she confirms that I'll be basically walking away with theft. So I offer to pay her dinner as a sign of thank you, which I got all the time when I used to be a carpenter.

My girlfriend (what I thought) jokingly asked if I was asking her out, which to me sounded absolutely absurd, so I said to the tattoo artist that if she doesn't want my money then at least let me pay for your dinner.
She said that she was fine as she's staying at home and her mum had dinner ready when she got home - but thanked me for the act of even considering it. 

This caused a huge scene when we got out. Girlfriend crying and everything about how I'm not respectful and that even though she knows I wasn't really asking her out she doesn't feel safe that these things are open to interpretation etc.

I didn't even think this was open to interpretation as we were all getting along amazing in a very platonic matter.

So, reddit, AITA for offering to pay for her dinner or is my girlfriend out of line?",87,230,0.95
1997,Not the A-hole,"I was at a chain restaurant cafe type deal, waiting in line to order. I have my headphones in (whether they were on or not doesn’t matter because he didn’t know that) when I’m approached by this older guy and this is basically what happens:

Guy: wow you are just beautiful. You don’t deserve to be here alone...

Me: (*I look up and do that small fake grin thing like I didn’t hear him and immediately turn around again*)

Guy: a girl like you doesn’t need to be eating alone. You deserve a man that....Let me buy your lunch. A lovely doll like....

Me: *awkward chuckle/straight face* oh no (I avoided saying thank you and immediately turned back around, now looking at my phone and really emphasizing how into it I am)

Guy: *says more stuff and just continues to act like white noise*

I’m finally at the front. And proceed to order a very delicious bacon cheese burger, sweet potato waffle fries, & iced peach tea with honey. I ordered to dine in because I was on a cheapish date with myself and “The Hate You Give” by Angie Thomas had just finished downloading on my iPad. Overall just going to be a great afternoon!

This needy mofo interrupts my transaction..

Guy: I just can’t sit by and let a girl like you eat alone

Me: oh no, you really d— (me preparing to shut this down)

Guy: shoved his card. Spits his order out and tells the lady it’s on him

I finally give in to his suave ways and just let him pay

Me:  wow but I actually got mine to go *giving a side eye to the cashier*

Guy: oh beautiful don’t stress about it. That’ll be an easy change for them

Well the cashier definitely got the hint. All my stuff was bagged up and his was brought to a table. I quickly grabbed my bag and drink and said I really had to get going but told him that “I was very appreciative of his generosity to strangers, and that we needed more people like him in this world.” Then I dipped. He began saying stuff on the way out but I didn’t stop. 

I got home. Devoured my food. Yada. But later I was telling my friends about my free lunch and they said I was acting kind of bitchy about it. They said I knew his intentions and I should have been persistent on turning him down and that dating is hard. That maybes hes putting himself out there, and that how I treated him is how incels are created. 

That last part really got to me. And damn, I do get where they’re coming from. And maybe I *could have been explicit* but damn. He also could have taken my first no. I wanted to eat alone and read a book in the restaurant and his pushy attitude made me want to leave. Also, other than the slight chuckle and “no I’m fine”, I straight up ignored this dude. Like gave him no indication I was engaging. He was presumably so into himself that he just kept going. 

So, AITA?

Edit/Update:

Wow. Went to work and didn’t think too much more of this. Thank you for all of your feedback! One of the friends and I are going through more of the comments now and having some good discussion on it. 

NTA: thank you! A lot of your comments made sense and definitely validated my initial feelings. But despite what others are saying, this was not a validation post I promise. I was genuinely curious and wanted to think a little beyond myself. It was not my intention to make y’all annoyed by more “validation posts”. With that being said. I completely agree that I don’t owe him anything.  And when I say know it’s enough and I shouldn’t question my consent just because it may hurt someone else’s feelings. 

ESH: thank you for those that took the time to explain the other perspective. Being ethical came up a bit. And I admit, I 1000% knew this guys intentions. And although I didn’t start my day try to finesse a free meal, I can see why accepting it just may not have been the right/moral thing to do. Honestly if this happens again I’m not sure of what I’d do. It’d definitely depend on the environment and my safety, but I’d like to say I’d have a mix of my original instinct with at least a dash more empathy. 

YTA: YTA implies that “I suck” and “he doesn’t” and although I mostly think that I don’t suck, I can more so accept that maybe we both suck. But I don’t think that he was completely without fault here. I really wanted to take all sides into account. But NO. Some of you were thoughtful or rational. And I appreciate your time and perspective. BUT FOR ALL YOU OTHERS: no I don’t deserve to die. I don’t consider myself a “selfish bitch”. And even if I had his info, there is no way in hell I’d call him to apologize or pay him back.",190,375,0.86
1998,Not the A-hole,"My mom is kinda the mother hen at her work and she ends up making lots of friends with the girls she works with. 

A lot of these friends have been there for her through major things like divorce and ill health, and I’m glad my mom has awesome friends that she can trust and rely on. A few of them even took her all expenses paid to cancun for a few weeks after she recovered from a nasty illness so I do know they love her and vice versa.

She has 3 boys, and always wanted a girl so lots of these women are in their 20’s and they absolutely adore my mom, and the feeling is mutual- like, her Facebook is full of them taking her out to brunch and stuff on their days off etc. They’re close.

My mom is terrified of driving because when she was a teen she ended up accidentally hitting someone and although she was never charged with dangerous driving she gave up her licence and has never driven again. I work a full time job with my dad but I’ll ALWAYS make time to drive my mom around as my 2 brothers don’t live close and she used to rely on my dad but since since the divorce I’ve stepped in.

She has made a new friend at work who’s in her early twenties, she’s only known her this past year. This girl is pregnant and doesn’t have family or friends to help her out. She needs help going to and from hospital appointments and Uber’s are racking up and buses are notoriously late or diverted in my town. 

My mom called me up pleading with me to take her friend to at least 3 future appointments, AND some shopping trips for the future baby. My mom said that she’s going alone, blah blah, she has no one to help, my mom is vested in making sure this girl is ok etc. 

I’m reluctant to help because I don’t think it’s my issue, I’m happy to help out momma and I’ve driven her friends around before when my mom is also with them but taking someone to their hospital appointments seems kinda weird. 

My mom is a bleeding heart and loves ‘fixing’ things and people, and she has asked me to do it as a favor to her because this girl is down on her luck and she’s asked my mom to be this baby’s godmother because my mom has been such a pillar of support. 

It’s all a little weird to me, but the major major reason I don’t want to do it is because I mentioned this to my girlfriend and she was NOT HAPPY with the thought of me basically being this chicks private uber and I can see her POV. I’m also genuinely super busy and my life is all about making $$ so if it’s not immediately for my loved ones I’m out. 

My mom is really disappointed and has been paying for this girls uber herself which is insane to me, and I do feel guilty but over my mom, not this chick- AITA because I refused to take her?",423,2286,0.97
