0,Not the A-hole,"My husband went out for the day with his pal and didn't know that I worked in the evening, so he didn't take his house keys (he often doesn't). When he got home I was at work (nurse) and couldn't answer my phone. He spent an hour in our garage before I was able to call him back and he came to get my house key. He was understandably grumpy. 
But there's more. 
We live in the suburbs in a small, new neighbourhood with 2 german shepherd mixes and a pomeranian. He believes no one would ever break into our house and locking the door (whether we are home or not) is dumb.
I'm not worried about our shit; if we got robbed blind but our dogs were safe, I could move on. My fear is that our dogs would be stolen/escape, or I am home alone and sleeping in the am when he leaves for work and doesn't always lock the door.
I took this opportunity to put my foot down and say ""be an adult, from here on out take your keys and expect the door to be locked"". 
He is doubling down and saying that it is ridiculous that he should have to worry about being locked out of his own home.

1,No A-holes here,"I'm in my 30s, have been with husband about 8 years, married 4 and have 2 children. We have a good relationship, rarely argue etc.

I had a difficult adolescence. From age 14 to about 22 I was in a very bad place. I drank excessively (a litre of vodka a day at peak) and put myself in awful situations, with awful and traumatic results. I was in abusive relationships, I did dumb things, dropped out if school and hurt myself in all sorts of ways. It was just an awful time.

I managed to separate myself from everything and spent a few years getting myself together. I had therapy, I got fit and healthy, cut ties with everyone damaging from then and life has been great since. I met my now husband, finished school, I have 2 degrees and a good job. We have 2 children and I feel so lucky every day.

I've always been very closed about that time, I dont like to think about it because there's a lot of trauma there. I dont feel like that was me, the person I was then is unrecognisable to now. My husband knows the bare bones as I've put here, but the devil is in the detail and I just never went there. And I dont want to.

Suddenly, after years of never asking anything about my past before I knew him, he has started prodding for more information. He says he feels like I know everything about him and his life but he doesnt know me at all. Last night, he says (via text as I'd fallen asleep) that it's been on his mind since we're both free today, we're going to sit down and I can open up about everything. I feel absolutely sick at the thought. I don't want to lie to him. I dont want to go there either. Also he loves me now, he absolutely would not like the person I was then. I fear his opinion of me would be forever changed.

WIBTA if I just said that sorry, I dont want to go there. He knows everything about me now - he knows all my friends, my family, my phone/day to day life is an open book. I love him so much but I want to leave the past in the past. Probably forever.

ETA - he knows everything I've said in this post but no detail beyond that at all.

There's very little chance of him finding out anything further by himself. I don't think anyone I knew back then would even recognise me now, and my name has changed as I'm married. And I don't do Facebook etc anyway. Most of family are just thankful that I am happy now and don't know the half of it anyway. One sister does not feel the same and is no longer in my life as a result, but would never speak to my husband.

I do feel like TA as knowing him, I think he would not have gone on a second date if it were possible to know everything about me let alone married me and had children. But I am a good person now, and a good wife and mother. It's hard because I don't feel like I deserve to be forever judged but then he doesnt deserve to have things kept from him that might be important to him.

Thank you all for your input, it is very helpful for me to consider the different viewpoints. Currently sat in car trying to avoid going home, agree with those who said further therapy probably needed! I have a reprieve today as we actually have a lot on, but dont think this is something I can just stall on indefinitely.

EDIT 2

Thank you all for your thoughts, I'm so grateful that so many of you took the time to comment. It has helped tremendously, and I'm amazed and suprised that I'm not TA.

I've realised from this that the behaviours and problems I had back then resulted from self hatred/shame (that wasnt necessarily warranted) and that I completely changed and reinvented myself without actually letting go of the hate for teenage me, which perhaps clouded my assessment of how husband would judge me if he knew and lead to me just never going there. So further therapy needed and I'll be upfront with him about the why and perhaps open up to him over time. 

I also appreciated all the thoughts on me being TA and why, it has helped a lot too. I've felt like a fraud as husband loves me so much and thinks the world of me and I'm realising that deep down I feel like I'm not worth his love and he'll realise one day and leave me. Again, i need more therapy.

Thank you all again, I didnt expect such kindness and care and am very grateful.",71,31,0.83
2,Not the A-hole,"I was at a social event this evening hosted by my wife's friend/coworker. During the party, one of the other attendees frantically runs into the kitchen to wet a towel. Turns out, another couple there left their 3 year-old daughter in the car for nearly 40 minutes on a day when it was 93 degrees outside. They only realized their mistake when another sibling was playing outside and heard the 3-year-old screaming. They were attentive to the child and sought advice from an MD at the party. They did not call 911 and they remained there for another 90 mins-2 hours after discovering her in the car, which I thought was odd. 

&#x200B;

The parents were clearly shaken up about their mistake. Based on short conversations with people who know them well, they are well-intentioned parents. However, they are fostering kids and in total have six biological or foster kids, I believe all under the age of 13. Mom stays at home but receives no outside assistance. Based on what I witnessed tonight, I have serious concerns about whether the parents have the capacity and resources to raise six kids in a safe and supportive environment. I believe it might be in the best interests of the kids for an outside agency to appraise their welfare. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, as we were leaving the party I noticed a text from a friend who was there with us but did not know anyone else. She asked us to call her. She's an extremely non-confrontational person, but she basically said that if we didn't call CPS she was going to do it herself. I said I would do it, and my wife protested mildly, acknowledging that it was our right to call but believing it was not necessary or helpful, as she fears the parents facing sanction, especially the risk of them losing out on the opportunity to adopt their fostered children. 

&#x200B;

I called CPS when I got home. I gave them an incident report and they said ""these are very serious allegations."" However, I was missing certain details (e.g. home address of where the incident occurred) that prevented me from formally submitting the report. In the time after I spoke to them, it occurred to me that there is a significant complication to proceeding with the report. My wife and almost everyone at that party are medical professionals, and therefore mandated reporters. My report and the failure of others to report could cause problems for my wife's coworkers and friends who ostensibly did nothing wrong. 

&#x200B;

I really don't want to go ahead with the report now. However, I asked my wife and her friends to confront the father (their coworker tomorrow) and have an honest conversation about whether the family has the capacity to support all of those kids. My wife doesn't want to do it and her friends are pissed at me for calling CPS in the first place. Did I fuck up?",53,111,0.94
3,Not the A-hole,"A bit of backstory... my mother was diagnosed with leukaemia about two months ago, it’s not terminal & everybody in my family is staying  positive including my mother but as you can imagine we’re all drained, stressed & emotionally sensitive. 
So about 10 days ago I rang my grandmother (my dads mother, my parents aren’t together and haven’t been since I was born) for a chat, she asked how I was doing, we talked about uni etc etc, and then she started talking about her friend who survived leukaemia... she then followed up this story by saying “So your mum could recover...or she could die”. Just really bluntly and matter of fact.  I was of course taken aback by this as I thought she was going to say something positive... I just put it aside and ignored it, but then about a minute later she said “so I don’t want to tell you to be hopeful because she could die” after this I was upset and told myself if she says something like that again I’m hanging up. But again she said “life wants you to have babies and live, even if your mum passes on” and that’s when I hung up. 
A few hours later I texted my grandfather and told him that I purposely hung up because I felt that she was lacking empathy and was being insensitive, he talked to her about it and texted me about it the next day saying that she said she loves me. I thought that was the end of it and I took that as her seeing where I was coming from. 
So today I went for lunch with my grandfather (my grandma wasn’t there) & he said “do you think you could apologise for hanging up on your grandma?” I said “is she going to apologise to me?” & he said “no, she was saying what she was thinking” & I said “well she was being really blunt about it” he said “she’s well within her rights to say what she thinks. Maybe you should have told her this after she said it” to which I said “well I cried after she said it so I didn’t feel like talking at that time” and he said “well I don’t know exactly what she said” even though I did tell him that night... I’m not living in a bubble, I know that death is a possibility but it’s not something that’s definitely going to happen right now & just like my mother I’m being positive and crossing bridges when we get to them.  
I don’t feel like I should apologise to her because I feel like she said something really negative and unnecessary during a sensitive time & she’s had a falling out with all of her family besides me & 2 others because they didn’t agree with her opinion & she felt she was “within her right” to say things that weren’t her place to say. 
So AITA? 


TLDR: I hung up the phone on my grandma because she said that I should prepare for my mother’s death as she currently has (not terminal) leukaemia. My grandfather says that I should apologise and I refuse.",22,43,0.94
4,Not the A-hole,"So my apartment complex has a rule that all dogs owned by tenants must be 50 pounds or less and cannot be purebread German Shepard or pitbulls (I know that can be a shitty rule because some of the nicest dogs I've ever have been those breads). However, one of the tenants does have a German Shepard that is incredibly aggressive. My dog (a 2 year old border collie) ignites this German Shepard like you wouldn't believe if they see each other on a walk. This German shepherd barks and tries to go after my dog (luckily the owner can hold him back), and it's clear that it this dog got loose it would eat my dog alive. Additionally, since the owners live in the building right next to mine, they'll put their dog on the balcony sometimes (they live on the third floor). It's not every night, but every couple of days when my dog and I are walking back to our apartment that dog will see us and go ballistic. I have no qualms against the bread, there's another German Shepard in the complex that is very sweet and I would not report. I feel like this dog may be a liability, but at the same time I don't want to have the owners of the dog be forced to get rid of it or move. In general, I don't agree with the complex's rule on bread restrictions, but this dog is clearly a maniac.

6,Everyone Sucks,"I was in the middle of digging up a tree stump in my backyard when the neighbor's kid comes outside with his older sister. This kid (who's prolly 11 or 12) immediately starts trying to talk to me. ""Hey neighbor! How you doing neighbor? What's that over there, neighbor?"" etc. 

Now keep in mind, me and the neighbors tend to keep to ourselves. At best, we'll acknowledge each other if we happen to run into each other, but we've never been chummy. He wasn't trying to be friendly. He was trying to annoy me, and it was working. So I tell him, ""Listen, I'm busy. Don't talk to me"" to which this little ass kid replies, ""Fuck you, neighbor."" I'm not proud of what I said next, but I had lost my temper. I tell him, ""Fuck you, you little shit!"" 

Aaaand then his older sister runs and tells their father. So now the dad comes out, and he tells me, ""Hey, don't use that type of language with kids around."" And I kind of lost it. ""Give me a break! Your kid was the one who cursed at me first!"" From there, an all-out screaming match erupted between me and the parents.

It was bad. Cops were called. Statements were taken. Looking back, I regret letting it go so far.

8,Asshole,"Throwaway because this involves my kid. My thirteen year old daughter (let's call her Kaitlyn) has been playing piano since she was five. My wife and I have always pushed her to be disciplined in her piano practice. She plays piano for an hour and thirty minutes per day.  Unless she is sick or we are traveling away from home, she never misses a day of practice. Keep in mind that we always have her make up the time that she misses. We allow her an amount of leniency by letting her make up the time over a week's interval. Kaitlyn has never protested about her piano routine and we always believed that she enjoyed it. Yesterday, she was invited to a sleepover with her cousin. I told her that she could go and reminded her that she would have to make up her piano time, preferably before the sleepover. To my surprise, Kaitlyn said that she didn't want to and that it was just a day so it didn't matter much. Of course, I put my foot down and said that she couldn't go to the sleepover unless she followed her piano regimen. Surprisingly, my wife sided with Kaitlyn and said that I should let her skip a day, just this once. I said that if we allowed Kaitlyn to miss a day once, she would take advantage of our leniency and continue to skip days. Kaitlyn is now very angry with both of us and I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong in this situation, considering that she's usually such a good kid.

Edit: A lot of you guys have questions about whether Kaitlyn can still enjoy being thirteen. From my view, she can. This summer she has had two sleepovers.

Edit: UPDATE: After reading all of your comments my wife and I had a talk with Kaitlyn. She told us that while she still enjoyed piano and piano competitions, she felt that she could manage her piano practice on her own. She also said that I am trying to make her more Asian than she is (technically she's Afro-Asian), which is something that I never knew she felt. We agreed that she could make the decisions on her piano regimen (provided that she plays around six hours a week) and that she could go to the sleepover with her cousin without making up the piano time. I feel that I should trust my daughter more on making good decisions for herself, as she always does when given the opportunity. For everybody who responded, thank you.",680,1025,0.83

11,Asshole,"My friends and I (10 people, just to give an idea of the size) get all together every once in a while to just hang out and have a good time. One of my closer friends in the group has a girlfriend that mine hates to the bone. We'll call her Lisa.

Lisa has done some pretty questionable shit to my girlfriend. She's a nice person overall but has stuck her nose in some of my girlfriend's relationships too deep and has done some damage. I'll spare the details, but I am fully on my girlfriend's side in this. We can't totally cut her off though since she's the girlfriend of one of the guys.

Anyway, while we're all hanging out, Lisa starts talking to me and we just have a normal conversation. I'm a pretty easy going guy so I ask the usual ""how is everything"", make a few jokes, we show each other some funny memes on our phone, then the rest of the party continues. Lasted like 10 minutes I'd say

My girlfriend the next day starts telling me how upset she was that I ""fed Lisa the attention she craves so much"", and how I shouldn't crack jokes with her and make conversation with her. She said I should just be blunt with her and give the shortest replies possible whenever it's my turn to talk.

I'm here to have fun. I also don't want to disrespect my friend's girlfriend by being a dick to her. To top it off, I don't wanna start any bad vibes in this party just to please my girlfriend. I could probably find a way to do it subtly if we're in a club or something, but we're literally just 10, in a house.

13,Not the A-hole,"My GF recently found out her neighbor had a mental illness he had to take medications for. She found this out because her dad and her found him sitting in his doorway holding his feet and when they asked if he needed help he told them something about the voices. At the end of this story she says “he may be a serial killer”, in which I respond to “that’s really stereotypical to say and that’s not okay, thats sort of being discriminatory, almost along the lines of being a bigot”. This turned into us having a huge argument about how I was taking his side and how her feelings are hurt by me basically calling her a bigot because of what she said because she meant it as he could be a more dangerous person. I tried over and over to explain to her that just because he has a mental illness that can devolve him to act out of social norm when off of his meds doesn’t make it okay to even suggest that he “may be a serial killer”? Basically from what I said she feels like I was attacking her character when I was only trying to call her out so she wouldn’t come off to others as sounding discriminatory.

15,Not the A-hole,"About a month ago, I got into an argument with my next door neighbor about my dog peeing on the sidewalk in front of their house (we live in NYC). She then runs out of her house and screams at me that it’s illegal for me to let my dog pee there. Instead of telling her that no, the law actually pertains to dog owners picking up their dogs’ poop, I asked her sarcastically (but politely) where she thinks I should let my dog relieve herself. Like am I supposed to let her pee on the street? On the grass (obviously there’s virtually none in this city)? On her? All she kept saying was “I can’t give you an answer to that”. So I stormed off and told her to fuck off under my breath. 

To avoid seeing her ridiculous face, I changed my dog’s walking route so that we wouldn’t pass by her house. However, because they live right on the corner of the block, we still see them regardless, especially since she seems to be unemployed with the amount of times a day I see her outside gardening. Every time we do, she glares at us and whispers to her husband in their native tongue. Tonight, we passed by their front yard and we noticed she posted a sign that said “Be a Good Neighbor” which was followed by the law that tells us that leaving animal FECES without cleaning it up is against the law. Now slap me silly if I’m wrong, but feces refers to poop. Shit. Crap. Not PEE. If I am wrong, then I guess I gotta catch my dog’s piss in my hands.",33,32,0.97
16,Not the A-hole,"Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

Come us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?

Edit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


Edit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


In reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go. You guys have given me a lot to chew on, and I'd really like to thank you all.",3215,14784,0.94

18,Not the A-hole,"I had a pretty terrible childhood. My father was in and out of prison, I had a lot of siblings and my mom struggled to keep food on the table. She did her best, but I knew it was hard for her. As a result, she also wasn’t the best mom.

When I was about 8 years old, I became close with a friend from school and her family. They were my escape. I spent nights there all the time. When my dad went back to prison that year, I could manage to escape there when my mom went to visit him so I didn’t have to go. Honestly, for a few years there, they were the best safe haven I ever had. I remember dreaming I could live with them. Life was so much simpler there. They knew how hard my life was at home and said my door was always open. I had holidays there, was one of the family. Sadly, they moved away when I started junior high and as this was the age before social media, I drifted apart from my best friend.

Fast forward years later and I’m now married with children. I’m close with a few of my siblings, but not so much with my mom (dad passed on years ago). While Facebook wasn’t a thing when I was a kid, it is now and I recently reconnected with my childhood best friend. We were catching up on everything and she told me that she was really happy that I turned out okay, her and her family would worry about me constantly. I told my mom that I was talking to this friend and she told me “Did you know they used to beg me to take you? Constantly, take you away from all of this. But I could just never do it, I didn’t want to lose you forever.” I confirmed this with my childhood best friend and she said it was true. Her parents would ask my mom so often, and the last time was right before they moved out of state, they hated how I was being raised.

I admit, I’m pretty upset. I’m a mother myself and couldn’t lose any of my kids, but I can take care of them. My mom barely was able to raise any of us and she didn’t exactly spend time with us day to day. My father was also heavily abusive when he was home and it lead to lifelong scars that have taken years of therapy to get over. I know that life with my friend and her parents might not have been perfect, but who knows.

I told my mom I wished she hadn’t told me and it’s sort of lead to a fight within our family. My siblings are calling me ungrateful.

I’m holding a cardboard box full of our weekends worth of trash.

“In the back of the truck.” The lady yells at me and points about 50 feet away to a garbage truck. I start walking towards the truck and there’s a huge sign in red which says 
“UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD GUESTS PUT TRASH IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. PLACE IT IN BINS.”
The truck is backed up, 5 feet from two large bins. I throw the box in the bin and head back to my car. When I get back my girlfriend is like “that lady is really mad you didn’t put the trash IN THE GARBAGE TRUCK” I let her know, there was a HUGE sign saying not to.

24,Not the A-hole,"We aren't in a rush to have kids or have baby fever. But my husband's family has made it very clear they dont want us to have kids until our nephew the only grandson, is six and old enough to not need that much attention 

My SIL, had him very late after her first child. She is a single mom but is very well connected with her baby daddy. She makes an effort to set play dates and stuff like that. When she got pregnant again from him everyone in the family was upset because he is barley in the picture or financially supportive. No one the family respects him. They do socialize with him and his family from time to time but it's out of courtesy to her efforts.

With that being said, she does not struggle financially IMO. She struggles with having a father figure and someone to set boundaries. I'm not judging her parenting skills, I'm not a mom but I have learned a lot from watching her with and I know what I don't want to do when I become a mom. 
Up until his 3rd birthday I really wanted my husband to be involved with him because I felt bad he didn't have a real male figure and someone to set boundries. But over time I have been more aware of how much my SIL doesn't respect me and she doesn't follow through with the boundaries my husband has tried to set for her son. My own husband has complained that he's had enough of trying to discipline him when she doesn't make an effort to reinforce it. 

Our nephew very much respects my husband and me. When we babysit him he listens, understands and follows directions to behave. But honestly he can be exhausting when his mom is around. 
In passing I have told my husband that when we have kids he will need to be more involved with them than him. He agrees and understands that our kids will come first and being a father figure to them will be priority over our nephew. 

We moved into a new home, and my husband made a joke that we were pregnant. His sister and his mother were not happy. They didn't say anything out loud but their reaction was not what I expected. When we told them it was a joke they both seemed relieved and my MIL said ""good now _____ will have all the attention"" and my SIL laughed in agreement. 

I feel kind of bitter about this and now I really dont want my husband to help his sister with any kind of support for our nephew. When it came time to potty train him she asked my husband to help and when we got home I was very adamant that I did not want him to. When she asks us to babysit I will tell him to tell her no. She clearly has the time, energy and support from others for her son, but always uses us as a fallback.

My dad had his annual company BBQ this afternoon. All I wanted to do this morning was sleep but my husband woke me up at like 10 and asked if I'd be able to make my ""famous"" queso dip for my dads party. I asked him if he'd mind skipping it this rime because I was so worn out I just wanted to stay in bed, but he did his cute little boy face which I can't resist so I drove to Safeway. But it was slammed, they had to look in back for some ingredients and then I got in line behind a woman screaming at the check out girl and was asked by the police to wait and give a statement. It just raised my stress threshold to a degree I wasn't ready to deal with. I made my queso and we went to the party.

We are from New Mexico and I make my queso with hatch green chile. My sister moved to Texas and since Texas sucks and apparently wants to poison everyone, she makes queso skipping the green chile and add pork sausage. To me it's a greasy inedible mess and Texas can burn to the ground for thier bad queso and so many other reasons. But my sister is staying with my parents and she also made her queso and they were set next to each other on the pot luck table. Mine was gone in a matter of seconds and my husband came over to me with a huge pile of my sister's slop and said ""babe this is delicious as always!""

I know I was already keyed up but my week, my morning, the stress of the grocery store trip and the hiur drive to my parents just set me off. I asked him if he was serious. He said yes. I asked if he didn't notice the lack of green chile and the little bits of sausage floating in it. He said ""oh yeah!"" I looked at him and said ""youre an idiot, I made it FOR YOU and you can't even tell the difference."" He said ""no reason to be a bitch to me!"" I told him I wanted to go home. He asked if this was because of ""your inferiority complex with your sister?"" I told him he was an asshole and I left without saying goodbye to anyone and he only caught me at our car at the last second or I woukd have left him. We got into our worst fight where we drug up all the dirty laundry we had and we had an hour to get it all out. 

We've been avoiding each other but I'm starting to calm down and realizing I may be in the wrong here. He did say somthing insensitive (followed by some truly shitty things) but was I the asshole who started it?

26,Everyone Sucks,"Long-time lurker but made an account just for this because I want to figure out who's in the wrong. For the sake of anonymity, I'm going to keep this very vague.

My parents chose to come to the States when I was very young (6 or 7) for a better life. We had a lot of hardship during our initial years (hopping from apartment to apartment, delivering newspapers, etc.), but we're doing really well now due to how hard my parents worked and I really respect them for that. My younger brother was born into the wealth that we have now and because we have quite a big age gap, we don't have a lot in common. I think he's really spoiled because he doesn't really know what we had to go through to get to this point and my parents pamper him a lot.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today, he's asking my parents for a ride to an amusement park that's about a 30-minute drive away, and I offered to drive him because I'm not doing anything the coming weekend anyways. Because I had been to this amusement park a lot during my high school years and there's a bus route directly to it (and it's fairly cheap), I offered that he just do that because it's much easier than any of us making a two-way trip for him. He proceeds to say that there's no way he'd ever step foot on public transportation. This kind of hit me the wrong way because I grew up bussing throughout high school and college and only recently got a car, and I could not believe he had the audacity to basically say that he's too good for public transport. I refused to drive him and told my parents that they shouldn't either, and that he should just bus to save us all time and money.

&#x200B;

Both my parents and my brother are mad at me because I'm not driving him, and think that I'm being stupid/unreasonable and should just do it because I'm free during the weekend instead of making a big deal out of it. Am I in the wrong here?",19,58,0.9

33,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I am 20f, and my siblings are 17m, 15f, and 13f. I also have no intentions of bringing this up to my parents, but I do feel kind of bad for thinking it.

Growing up, I was told that phones are not something a child/young teen should have. So I was only given one of my parent’s cell phones during middle school when I had field hockey games, and in high school they bought me a TracPhone (not a “high end” one, but one of the sliding keyboard ones) for the same purpose. As a freshman in HS, I begged and pleaded for a phone, but we were able to compromise on an iPod touch as a Christmas gift on the condition that it would be my only gift until next Christmas, so no birthday gifts or anything, which I accepted. 

At the point of 11th and 12th grade (I was 16/17, this was 2015-2016) I asked again if I’d be able to get an actual phone, with the same condition of the iPod. I was still told no, and if I really wanted a phone, I had to buy it myself. It wasn’t until the beginning of 2016 when I had enough free time to get a job. Even then, I had to save up for college for the summer and fall. It wasn’t until October of 2016 that I was able to buy my first phone, an iPhone SE. I was berated for “wasting my money” on a phone like that, when I could’ve bought a cheaper one it continued to use my shitty TracPhone. I’ve recently bought the XR in February since that SE ran it’s course, and I’ve never had a “new” phone. Same thing happened though (despite being 20), berated for wasting my money, etc.

So present day, this weekend my parents bought phones for my siblings. They’ve had smart phones the past 2 years or so, but they weren’t exactly great ones, they were just the free ones you’d get from MetroPCS, still much better than my HS setup. My sisters both got an iPhone 8, and my brother got an S9 (along with my parents). I do realize that we’re in a better financial situation than we were when I was younger, but I feel like they should have said “We can’t buy you a phone because of financial reasons.” Other than “You can’t have a phone because we don’t think teens should have them, and you’ll need to pay for it yourself when you get one.” I’m honestly extremely pissed at them for this, and it’s not the first time they’ve shown double standards when it comes to how they raised me vs how they raise my siblings. Quick example, I wasn’t allowed to play SSBB because it had a T rating and I was 12, but at the same age they didn’t care if my 13yo sister watches Rick and Morty. It’s been affecting my mood this weekend and my interactions with them, but as I said, I have no intentions of bringing this up.

So, AITA for feeling this way?",61,126,0.94

So at the beginning of the year I found out my husband was having an emotional relationship with his ex girlfriend for several months and was planning on leaving me so you can only imagine how that went. It got super messy for a while and then we decided to try and make it work but he just wasn’t the same person and treated me like shit constantly. So we decided earlier this month to start the divorce process and he’d quit his job, move out, and go to his mothers (since he doesn’t have any family or friends that he’d be able to stay with). Well a week before he was supposed to move to his mothers, she was murdered. 

Now I’m stuck with him here in an extremely awkward situation and I don’t know exactly what I should do. He’s now living with me, with no job (so I’ll end up helping his bills), and we’re pretty much in limbo. So reddit, will I be the asshole if I tell him that I still expect him to move out and continue with the divorce process regardless if he has somewhere to go or not?",119,586,0.96
37,Not the A-hole,"I run a gun store and hired a man to be a salesman.  In his interview he mentioned he had a reading and writing disability I asked if he thought it would interfere with filling out forms as a mistake on a 4473 form could cause us to lose our FFL and get into trouble with the ATF.  He was very upfront and told me it was a minor disability and should be no problem.  2 weeks later he has made mistakes on 7 forms and it turns out it is more than a simple disability I had to walk him through how to spell 5 letter words like SALES and STREET.  He has accidently made mistakes on the model number of guns and customers names luckily I caught it before we filed the paperwork.

43,Not the A-hole,"I'm not from this town. Its a northern town, and yes there is a lot of money here. I am graced with enough per diem from the Navy where I can definitely afford to go out to eat -- in fact, that's the point of the per diem (I'm not here for long anyway).

Still, I try to save money where I can, I don't want just blow it on stupid stuff and this northern town is more expensive than I am used to.

Well, I'm from a city in the South, originally, and never once have bartenders asked for tips. Hell, drinks are cheaper at $5.50 and it never occurred to me that I ought to tip ever -- I didn't think it was a thing unless you were being served.

With this particular lady, I hadn't yet gone to that bar (there were multiple in the establishment) and paid in cash since there was $20 minimum if you use a card. I was getting my one last drink for the night and the first floor bar was too crowded. Hadn't gotten a beer from her. She popped off the top of a beer, handed it to me, and then took the $7. I was wondering why it was taking so long to get my change back, but then she dropped the money in the jar. That's when the short conversation happened.

She did of course give me my 50 cents back after saying what she said, but I couldn't help but think of my mother, who bartended all while I was growing up, and so now I wonder if I was being a stingy bastard about 50 cents and maybe I've been doing in wrong all along and the bartenders in the South were just too polite to say anything.

Yeah, the tone was a little cutting, but again, I wonder if that's just the way of people to be honest around here, which I appreciate. And yeah, culturally, its 50 cents in a rather wealthy town, so...

45,Not the A-hole,"We have a 6 year old corgi chihuahua.  After my husband passed from cancer 3 years ago, I (F54) talked to my daughter (then 15)  about getting another dog. She had been asking for one, and I thought it would help us with the grief to rebuild the family a bit and have something to focus on.  After much research and visiting and about six months, we got an obese elderly long-haired miniature dachshund, Coco.  The vet estimated her at least 10 years old, she has back problems, and about three teeth.  She also turned out to be completely incontinent and unhousetrainable.  Carpets are destroyed, house smells like a barn, I'm shampooing carpet every week.  She is a fat sassy old lady, and we love her.  

She has had many health problems, expected for an older dog, and a chronic disease that is expensive to manage ($300 blood test 3x a year, and meds are $50 a month). I've had to postpone the blood tests a few months for finance reasons, but only if she's doing well with no symptoms.   

My daughter and I both expected this would be ""her"" dog and she would bond closely, but that didn't happen. (The other dog is more my son's, who's grown and gone).  She plays with it some but mostly fusses when Coco poops in her room and gets into her snacks.  I mention that because if the dog got her through her grief and is now her support and best buddy, that would have a huge impact in my decision. That is not the case. Daughter will be upset for a while when Coco does inevitably go, but she will be ok.  

So here we go again. Something is wrong, I took her to the vet yesterday, she got a steroid shot but it's been 24 hours and she's not yet responding to the antibiotic. I have a call to the vet to get her back in.  If it's something that she can kick and she is shortly back to  normal, great.  If the vet says this is it, I won't let her suffer.  

 But - if with lots of expensive treatment and her going through pain, she will eventually be OK for a few months or a year before the next thing, WIBTA if I said let's just let her be at peace and put to sleep?  She is so old with so many issues, including some chronic pain with arthritis, and I don't want her to suffer.  But I'm questioning myself because I know I have ulterior motives - my life will be easier when the expensive, stinky little muffin is gone, but I would never get rid of her for that.  Other dogs I've had, it was very clear when it was time.  Is it more selfish to put a dog down maybe before you absolutely have to for their pain, or to keep them around longer as their comfort decreases (and to be honest as the bills rack up, which are impacting our finances) because they are funny sassy little peanut heads we will miss very much?

Update: Thank you all for your kind words. No matter how you know it’s coming and how many times you go through it, It’s hard. She’s bouncing back this morning. She’s up on her feet walking around, eating again, and is not in pain when I pick her up, although she still limping. I have a call into the vet. That’s what makes this hard, she gets these Infections and is miserable, and then Bounces back. Is the quality of life in between the bad spells worth the pain she goes through? I Felt guilty even asking the vet about her end-of-life, but based on your comments that is the first thing I will do, have a frank conversation with him about exactly what is best for her.

47,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriends childhood friend is getting married soon.

So a couple of weeks ago I attended the hen do, I actually had a really good time with the other girl I attended with! However at approximately 1am the main bridesmaids all come down in their pyjamas and tell me they've ordered me a taxi, I personally thought it was dead rude and its got me thinking about other things.

She's made comments to her fiancee before (infront of me and my boyfriend) such as: 'I hope you aren't going to let them drink this much at the wedding' and mentioned that his friends are so annoying.

The night she made the above comments she asked us if the groomsmen could get ready at our house on the morning of the wedding because 'we have the nicest house' and she particularly likes how I've decorated the spare bedroom, she also asked if I could provide a breakfast spread and today I found out a photographer is coming to our house.

The wedding venue is down the road from us and they arranged a hotel room for us which we politely declined - a taxi will be a couple of quid but then the groom made some comments to my boyfriend about 'being tight' and saying 'out of all of us you can afford it' so we relented.

My boyfriend is a groomsmen but not the best man and he's had to buy his own suit (fine) but I'm wondering WITBA for not giving a gift (they've asked for cash towards the honeymoon).

I'm not sure if my judgement is being clouded and I'm just being petty.

Edit: Okay, I think I get it, me and her obviously don't really get along but I should probably get her a gift anyway. 😊

She is 28, I am 24.

Invited her to my murder mystery party, spoke to her earlier in the day, still coming, her boyfriend turns up at the party, turns out she's ill. But she dropped him off AND picked him up!

I arrived at the party with two other girls who were invited, we are all friends of the groom, all 3 of us were 'asked to leave'. We've known the groom for about 3 years before he met her.

Went to her house for a dinner party, we told her we were driving, she told us she was disappointed as she wanted a big night so we get a taxi. It gets to 10pm she's complaining she's tired, me and my boyfriend leave in a  taxi we didnt need.

The bbq was bring your own alcohol, bring your own food. I took a bottle of champagne, 3 lovely roulades and a kiss the miss goodbye hen party favor and lipsticks. 

Previously I had actually been told that the hen party was a spa day but a few weeks ago she told me people couldn't afford it so it was gonna be a bbq instead, but while at the bbq I found out they had actually been at the spa during the day. ☹

At the party one of the hens bought paper masks of the groom. We put them on for a photo with the bride and it was dead funny. Us 3 girls put ours in the bag we bought and hid it under the table (it had our valuables in, we thought the masks woukd be funny to give the boys for the stagdo) when we left the masks had been taken from our bag.

50,No A-holes here,"I moved in with my roommate about a year ago. We're both single moms, I have a boy (3) and she has 2 girls (4 & 5). Before moving in I asked her about her lifestyle, stressing that I would not live with someone who keeps drugs in the house or brings men home. She said she didn't do either of those things, and she hasn't for the entire time I've lived with her. Her kids are very sweet and they get along well with my son, she pays her way, cleans up after herself and doesn't start drama. Honestly one of the best roommates I've ever had.

It's been peaceful until about 3 months ago when she brought her boyfriend home. She told me straight up he's on parole for B&E, GTA (his mom's house and car) and drug offenses. When he was gone I told her I was not comfortable with her bringing this man around my son and tried to gently ask her what the fuck she was thinking bringing a felon around her daughters. She accused me of being stuck up and judgemental. I told her at least I am using my judgement and thinking of the kid's safety. She got mad and took the girls to her mom's house for the weekend. It's been frosty since then.

I've put a keyed lock on my door and use it whenever I leave, whether he's here or not. When he is here we stay in our room and watch Netflix quietly, or leave to do something else.

I know this upsets her, and she's just trying to live her life. To be fair the guy has been very mellow, seems to treat her well, and the girls are okay with him. They seem happy. If he wasn't fresh out of prison I would probably be more willing to know him at this point, but I'm not. I'm anxious and find myself being hyper aware of my son's location, my roommates schedule, the girl's behavior etc.

I texted her to let her know I'm going to be looking for a new place because I don't feel safe and it's stressing me out. She didn't reply but I can hear her crying and I feel terrible.

53,Not the A-hole,"We are currently on vacation with my family (three generations, 13 people). Tomorrow, several of us are going to an amusement park, and my husband and I are disagreeing on whether or not we should bring our five-year-old son. I have several reasons for saying we shouldn’t: The group is six adults and our three-month-old baby, and while we can hand the baby over and take turns on a ride, our son would have to stand in line for a bunch of rides he doesn’t want to go on (he’s afraid of roller coasters and too short for a number of other rides). One of us could split from the group with him to go on the kiddie rides, but then that parent wouldn’t be there to hand the baby over to. I’ve also been looking forward to this outing because I love roller coasters and haven’t been able to go on any fast rides while I was pregnant—and frankly, I don’t want to spend €54 to watch my kid ride the kiddie carousels. 

In addition, we have a car that seats seven, but if our son joins us, we will have to take a second car, and people aren’t excited about riding in it because it will be hot tomorrow and the second car has no AC. 

My husband’s stance is that going to an amusement park is a family outing and we would be jerks not to bring our son.

If our son doesn’t come with us, he would join my sister with her husband and kid, who are going to a car museum with classic and historical cars that also has activities for kids. We asked our son how he felt about the two options, and he’s kind of meh about both. 

We’ve agreed to describe the two options to him again tomorrow morning and let him decide, but AITA if I would rather he didn’t come with us?

EDIT: This morning, kiddo’s first words were, “Mommy, guess what! They have an indoor climbing park!” “Who does?” “The park we are going to today! *And* they have bumper cars! It is the best park in the world! *And* I may have cotton candy!” So apparently husband pulled a sneaky on me and totally hyped the place to kiddo ;) 

But of course we’re taking him now. Our plan is that about half the time, first one then the other of us will take him to the kiddie area, and the other half of the time he’ll just have to hang with the grown-ups even if he doesn’t go on a lot of rides.

56,Not the A-hole,"I got surgery on my throat on July 11th, and since then I have been in a lot of pain, doped up on painkillers, and unable to eat. As a result of not eating I have become very weak, and start to feel faint and see black spots in my vision when walking from one room to another. The Sunday following my surgery my mom ran our dishwasher and got our trash & recycle ready to be picked up in the morning. It is my job to empty the dishwasher and take down the trash. If the dishwasher is run and I'm not home for a few days, my mom will typically just leave it for me to empty until I return, which is fine, but still a bit annoying. But I get it. They're my chores. On this particular Sunday I was in a lot of pain, at one point violently throwing up bile onto my freshly cauterized throat, sobbing into a trashcan. My mom tries to offer me food (to prepare for this surgery she bought me only 2 foods. A giant family sized portion of mac and cheese and lemon flavored popsicles that I can't eat) I tell her I cannot eat. She asks why am I making this so difficult for everyone.Throughout the week my godmother has taken care of me and my mom has offered pretty much nothing, she hasn't been checking to make sure I'm eating or taking medication or choking on my own blood. Flash forward to today. The dishes from last week are still in the dishwasher. The trash was not taken down and it has been 100+ degrees all week. I told my mom that I was not going to empty the dishwasher because it is fucked up she wouldn't do it while I was sick, plus they're not even my dishes, I haven't been eating. She is very upset with me, and I do not care. Throughout the entire process of surgery, she has been nothing but a hindrance to me, she almost made me not get important medication I needed the day before I was to get surgery, did not get buy anything for me to eat (she went out and bought a bunch of things that SHE can eat), and has told me that I am a nuisance while I experienced the most intense pain I have felt in my entire life. It goes past just not wanting to empty the stupid fucking dishwasher, it's the fact that she couldn't even do something as simple as put a few of HER dishes away while I'm suffering. I think my mother may be on the autism spectrum, so explaining things to her rationally doesn't really work. We argued for a while on the phone today and I think she understands that she's being shitty, but now it's become a pride thing. She h a t e s admitting that she is wrong. I explained to her that she has done absolutely nothing for me during this process and brought up examples and she was very quiet and crying. I asked if she had anything to say to me and she said nothing and I hung up the phone. I am still very sick and weak and frustrated, and couldn't even do these chores if I wanted to. If I leave them they will remain there until next week. I know everyone is probably going to say I'm the asshole, but even if I felt better I wouldn't do those chores.",20,48,0.88
57,Not the A-hole,"I’m a vegetarian which I’m sure some people will call me TA right away after hearing that. Whatever. I still stand by my actions here and will follow through regardless of my judgement. I’m just curious as to whether my request is reasonable. 


I’m 19F living with my parents and older brother (30). Because I’m the only vegetarian, I do all my own cooking. I often eat with my family while they eat their meat dinners. This is fine with me. I don’t have a problem that they eat meat at all. I’m not here to judge anyone elses’ Choices as long as they respect mine. 

I really got into cooking 2 years ago and last Christmas my brother gifted me this expensive Japanese knife. It’s awesome for cutting vegetables quickly and well. I use it everyday. Sometimes my mom does too - but not for meat as she has a particular meat knife. 
My brother is a full time chef so doesn’t cook at home too much since it’s his work. Once in a while though he will make a meal for my parents and him. Wednesday was one of those days. He got my knife out and started cutting vegetables then went to cut the meat. I asked him to please not use my knife for that, I would prefer it to be a vegetable only knife because I’m just not comfortable with it being used for meat.  He got kind of mad and said I wasn’t overreacting and being too sensitive. 

I don’t want it be used to cut meat for 2 main reasons:
1. In restaurants they often have different knives for meats and vegetables for sanitary reasons. I feel like at home it’s not that different; especially since my mom had a designated meat knife. 
2. My brother isn’t the best at cleaning or sanitizing things. I’m afraid of getting sick by accident if the knife wasn’t cleaned after being used to cut raw meat. Cooked meat is one thing, but the idea of raw meat grosses me out so much. 

It’s MY knife that was literally a Christmas present so I feel like it’s use should be up to me. AITA?",113,242,0.88

We're gonna be having a lot of parties at this house, and because of that all the bedrooms have heavy padlocks on them. I would keep the rifle in my closet with a trigger lock on it and also probably chained to the wall with a bike lock, so security shouldn't be a problem. I could store any ammo I keep on hand in my car for another layer of security. But still, I think the fewer people who know where and how I'm storing it the better, including my roommates. 

I'm mostly concerned that at least one of my roomies would have a problem with it, though.

My sister has a mental illness that makes it hard to get along with her. There was about two years when I didn't talk to her at all, now we have a very superficial relationship. To be honest, I don't like spending time with me.

Recently, she started attending my church. She even went through the process to become a member. Everytime we are there together she just wants to stay right by me. She always sits with me after the service at fellowship hour.

62,Asshole,"Disclaimer: asking for a friend who does not have reddit. 

My friend is currently in her second year of medical school and they recently had a class regarding professional conduct and attire. She was hanging out with her colleagues and mentioned that it was unprofessional for one of their classmates to be dressed in leggings and a crop top. Her classmates disagreed and said that it’s totally okay for people to dress this way as long as they aren’t seeing patients. But my friends logic is that they are in a professional setting and represent the school and should therefore dress accordingly when on campus. 

So reddit, is she the AH for thinking this?

EDIT: I would like to clarify that the class on professional conduct specifically mentioned not to expose midriff. My friend mentioned that if this weren’t stated during that lecture she wouldn’t have cared.

Final edit: I’d just like to say that i have sent my friend a link to this post so that she can review the comments. With that said, i’d like to point out that she NEVER confronted the girl and never intended to do so.

63,No A-holes here,"Hi I am new here on Reddit. A friend recommended AITA to me. I am male 23 years old. I am from Northern Europe. Sorry my English is not too good. There's this friend of mine Kira who lives a few blocks away and whom I have had a crush on since I was a little boy. But I had always thought that she had only seen us as friends, nothing more. So yes it is kind of disheartening. 

But these past few months, I could see things are changing between us. We are growing closer than ever. She has asked me many times to take a walk with her and take lots of pictures in the forest or around the town. It's like she wants to see me everyday. I was so excited and happy that I started plucking up my courage to ask her out on a date, not as friends, but boyfriend-girlfriend. 

Unfortunately last week her mother told me that she has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. And it is expected that she only has at least a year left, if not less. I am beyond devastated. I love her and it is hurting to see how she is trying so hard to look strong, always smiles pretending she's okay. She has no idea that I know about her disease because her mother told me not to tell her, because Kira has made a decision that she doesn't want everyone to pity or feel sorry for her. 
Or at least until she herself decides to tell me about it. 

I don't think I can pretend any longer. I really love her and want her to know about my feelings for her, which means I also have to tell her that I know about her disease, and I don't care if she's going to die because I want to remember her as my girlfriend before her time comes. I've talked with my parents about it and my father thinks it's best if I keep pretending that I don't know about her being terminally ill because things will never be the same if she knows I know. She will accuse me of being extra kind to her only because I pity her. 

My mother also thinks it would probably just hurt her too if I told her that I love her more than just a friend because if she also feels the same way about me then she would regret that we had not revealed our feelings to each other years ago.

64,Asshole,"Back in May, a student of mine emailed me 2 days before when her final was scheduled. Her twin brother passed away early that night due to the negligence of a drunk driver. She said that she does not think she would be able take the final and asked if she would be able to reschedule. I sent my condolences and let her know that she could have as much time as she needed and that I will get in touch with her later in the summer.

Due to administrative policies, Friday was the deadline to submit extended deadline grades. I told her she could take the test as late as July 16th if she wanted a grade for the semester. Alternatively, I could give her an incomplete, which is essentially the grade of “could not complete the class for extenuating circumstances”. Lastly, she could apply for a leave of absence, and would be able to able to complete the final when she returns. She thanked me and told me she will get back to me with her preference soon.

I emailed her again 3-days later and asked if she had a preference regarding what to do for her final. She didn’t respond, so I emailed her again on June 24th, July 1st, July 8th, July 12th, and July 15th. I also mailed a letter to her place of residency that essentially said the same thing, and left a voicemail on her cell phone. 

She failed to reply to any of my means of communication, including the ones that told her that without a response, I would be forced to give her a 0 for the final, which was worth 50% of her final grade. In order to qualify for an incomplete, she would have to sign a form and have it looked by both the professor (me) and her faculty advisor. The “leave of absence” is a Student Disabilities Services policy, so I couldn’t do anything with her going through them.

Because she did not get back to me, I submitted a 0 for her final and she failed the class. I told my husband this morning  about what happened (he is also a professor at the same university) and he was completely aghast. He told me I should’ve just made the final not count towards calculation for her final grade, or just say she got a passing grade on the exam. That would mean I would have to essentially lie, which I was worried because it would have looked suspicious if her other professors said she was similarly irresponsive to their emails. 

He told me the other professors probably waived her final completely and what I did was morally reprehensible. He works in a different department, so he’s used to having a lot more freedom regarding the grading scheme, but my hands were tied. We fought and he’s insistence that I “should’ve done more to help her”.

I get his perspective, but the fact is that she plainly did not respond to my messages. I did what I could, but he thinks I should’ve just lied and hope I didn’t get caught. Am I in the wrong for failing her?

**EDIT:** I truly did not expect this response. I'm going to draft an email to my supervisors and see what can be done. I did not mean to argue with my judgment (that's why all of my comments were removed; I did not delete them). Whatever the case, I'm going to do what I can to make this right.

65,Not the A-hole,"This employee is the same one from my previous post here. Please read that to understand this. 

Update: I went through with my abortion and everything is fine. Me and my bf are still happy together. Thank you everyone for your support.

This happened 2 months ago, but I opened my reddit after a long time. Felt like asking this one here. 

When I rejoined work after my abortion, the coworker (Lucy), would keep avoiding me. Making faces when we cross each other. Petty things. But she wasn't my direct supervisor and this didn't affect my work, so it didn't bother me. 

There was one day where her team and my team had to do some code retrofitting on some overlapping areas. The particular coworker who usually does this was on vacation. My company has a habit of doing this work on Saturday, and not a weekday. 

So we were having a team meeting to see who could take over. It's important because accidentally overwriting code or adding unnecessary code will lead to a huge headache later. Lucy walks into this meeting and asks my manager whether he has decided. And he says we are discussing it. 

And then she says, ""You should tell her to do it. It's a Saturday. It's not like she has kids to worry about."" 

The entire room went silent and I was feeling so embarrassed. The whole office knew what happened with me after what happened previously. I told her ""Neither do you.""

And then, I just got up, walked out of the room and informed the HR that I will be quitting. I had 2 open (I can join if and when I choose to) offers from 2 different companies. But I liked my company and the work environment and most of all, I didn't want to leave my team/manager hanging, in the middle of a huge project. 

The HR was obligated to ask me the reason and I told them which lead to a huge investigation, at the end of which, she was fired, without severance and LOR. 

My friends and family have mixed feelings in this. Some think that she was being petty and some think that she was merely stating a fact (that other members of my team had kids to worry about and I didn't as it was over the weekend and that it wasn't a dig at me and I was overthinking.

I had a facial earlier this week. I went in for dry skin and exfoliation. That's it. Nothing else. I've had maybe three other facials in my life, and IME I received constructive feedback on how to care for my skin. I get that it's not a compliment session, it's for the purposes of skin care. But this week's experience was really negative. I was asked to get there early to fill out paperwork, which required a detailed list of my skincare products, and my history (Have I smoked? No. Have I gone tanning? No. etc...). I filled all of it out in detail. 

The aesthetician who worked with me obviously didn't read it because she proceeded to ask me all the questions on the form. Okay, fine. She hadn't heard of the company that makes my skincare stuff. I mentioned I ordered online and she said ""oh well that's terrible, you can't trust anything you buy online."" Oookay. Then she says ""You used to tan?"" I said no, and she said ""really??"" I said no. I'm a pale lady with freckles, it's just my skin type. I wear sunscreen daily. She proceeded to ask me ""what are you doing about these lines in your forehead"" and then asking me what my heritage was to see if it could explain ""all the sun damage."" I don't actually have a lot of sun damage, but I do have freckles. I have pretty healthy skin overall, but I do not tan and I tend to have dry skin. She said everything in a really demanding tone. I explained that I'm actually okay with having a few lines, and that I've had freckles since I was a kid. I probably sounded upset because she immediately started to apologize and then didn't talk much after that. It was not a relaxing experience at all. She did an okay job at the actual facial, she just had no customer service skills. 

On the way out, I was asked how it was. I told them that I did not think the aesthetician was a good fit for me. They asked me to elaborate and I said it was because she was a bit pushy and aggressive in her way of interacting. I told them I didn't want to cause her any trouble, but that if I come back I didn't want to work with her, and that's all. I left her a 5% tip, since she did actually complete the service, she was just really unpleasant to work with. 

The owner called me later and said that I wasn't the first to complain and said that they would offer me a discount if I decide to come back. I thought that was nice of them, but it also made me wonder if I'm just being a bitch. On one hand, I'm mad that I spent money on something that was supposed to be pampering and I just left feeling upset. On the other hand, I've worked in retail and service jobs and I felt bad when people complained. AITA?",37,204,0.97
68,Not the A-hole,"Right now, I’m on one of those European river tours on the Danube. Being 19, I’m the youngest one here by about four decades (excluding the handful of 40 year-olds). I came in a group of 7. My mom, her sister, her cousin, my grandparents, and mom’s cousin’s mom. Once again, I’m the youngest with the second closest in age being 40. Also, they all grew up together. They all know the same people and stories. They all have children. It’s been kind of frustrating trying input myself in their conversations, but being extrovert, i did. 

At dinner, we’ve been seating my grandpa, grandma, mother, and I on one side of the table, respectively, and a space, my great aunt (grandpa’s sister), second cousin, and aunt. This made things easier for me to try to relate. I was by my mom, my aunt that I see about once a year, my grandma, and my second cousin that’s the youngest at 40 and a little bit easier to converse with. I’ve been able to jump in the best I could, but still, it’s been hard and kind of exhausting. 

Today for dinner, my mom and I got to the table late and noticed that our seats were taken by my grandparents. Everything else was the same. I go to sit next to my grandpa, and across from my great aunt. When I sit down, my grandpa says “no, I want your mom to sit here. Go to the other chair.” The chair across from no one, diagonal to no one, next to only one. 

I sheepishly moved over a seat and tried to keep my mind busy as I’m a naturally very emotional person. The seat wasn’t set and there was no menu. My mom asked him why he had made me move. He said that there was no reason. 

I’ve already felt disconnected, but at this point I felt straight up unwanted. To keep from making a scene, I just got up and went to my room.

In-between flights we usually stay in hotels, our layovers range from a few hours to a couple nights depending on the rotation. My airline has contracts with multiple businesses of transportation to and from the hotels /airports, and as far as I know they shuttle exclusively airline crews.

This morning we started early, our pickup time was 6:20am. No big deal, it's just three flight attendants in a large van. The driver loads three suitcases, shuts the doors, drives us to the airport, opens the door, takes out the suitcases and waits for a tip. I don't mean casually pausing to make sure we get everything sorted, I mean hands on hips straight eye contact refusing to get back into van kind of waiting. Most flight attendants and pilots tip a few dollars, I usually don't because I don't believe I should tip a shuttle driver for, well... mostly just driving. Yes, suitcases can be heavy especially with airline crews, but I help out the drivers by loading and unloading my own bag unless they specifically tell me not to. So I collect my suitcase, thank him verbally and continue into the airport. He is very offended by this and makes a comment to my colleagues while huffing and puffing: 

""oh, I guess he's just gonna stiff me then huh?""

This van driver is about late 40's early 50's. In good shape. Hasn't spoken a word to us during the 20min drive, then expects money from each of us and talks shit behind my back? When my coworkers told me this, it really irked me so I called the van company and asked to speak with a manager. The man who answered says there is no manager available on the weekends, but he can pass along a message. I calmly explain what happened and asked if this was a normal expectation from the drivers. His paraphrased reply:

""Well we are sorry to hear that, but our van drivers do expect to be compensated as per your airline contract, these rides are charged at a lower rate. The drivers are paid hourly but it's not alot so they expect at least $1 per bag. What he said was inappropriate and I'll tell him to next time fume in the van and not in front of you guys. It's a two way street, sort of an unwritten rule, but I'll pass it along to the higher ups and sorry his comment ruined your morning.""

I understand the US has a strange culture of not paying employees enough, so it's then an expectation/obligation for the customer to make up the rest of a livable wage. I strongly disagree with this sentiment, and I will choose how to give out the money I earn. Tips should not be expected for every little thing. It used to be a generous gesture, or recognition for a job well done. I have worked in many hospitality industries without tip expectation; you do your job and you do it well regardless. After calling it in, I'm wondering if this makes me the asshole.

71,Not enough info,"First post here, please be kind. 

I've known my friend Joyce for over about 10 years. We met through a mutual friend and just clicked and became very close to a point of calling each other sisters.  I found out she's a liar. It was always small white lies I didn't care about such as her age, things about her kids, past, etc. I noticed the stories she told didn't make sense as her kids contradicted her. 

The scam: She got into making reborn babies. She made/sold them for couple of years and was doing well according to her. She claimed one of her daughters messed up her Etsy account and couldn't use etsy. I had an account with hundreds of ratings and offered to let her use it to sell her reborn babies. She took over my etsy and started getting a lot of orders very fast as Christmas is only few months away. Despite getting large amount of orders, I noticed she was not working on the dolls. I asked her and she said she ordered the supplies. She was also selling on her website.

Long story short, by early December, she had over 70 Christmas dolls to make and send and she had completed ONE. I helped her organize the Christmas orders and made everything easier for her.

Somehow all the dolls were out by Christmas in less than 10 days. The quality was severely lacking to say the least. Myself and my DH, her husband and even her DIL helped her for the last week. I was working with her 18-20 hours a day and my DH was helping make some parts she never ordered. 

After Christmas, I helped her organize again fshe stopped sending out any orders after January. Some disputes were open due to quality of the dolls. And because she made so much etsy required SSN or tax ID and she used her business tax ID number so it's not tied to me at all.

I found out between the Christmas orders and ordered that were never sent, etsy refunded about $36k to buyers and is now owed to etsy. Few weeks ago, I found out she was getting letters from the AG office and got curious and looked up her original website. Turns out she had a lot of people on BBB complaining of never receiving orders. I checked BBB on other websites she had and same thing. People were saying she would deliberately tell them 90 days or 120 days to get them out and by then, the dispute timeframe was over on whatever platform they used to pay. Aside from etsy, she scammed another $15k minimum and these are only the ones on BBB. 

She talked about a group on book of faces for scammers that  is very active and large and I want to out her there.

72,Asshole,"For context, I am half German and half Taiwanese. While I am not religious myself, my whole family on my mother's side is Buddhist, and I grew up with the religion. The swastika is a Buddhist religious symbol, and it is commonly seen in temples and on the chest of Buddha statues.

Some time ago, I bought a T-shirt. The design says ""Rock Buddha"", and it shows a cartoon Buddha wearing sneakers and drinking coke, and - he has the swastika on his chest. I bought the shirt simply because I liked the design, I like rock music and Buddhism was a pretty big part of my upbringing.

But of course I'm aware that the sign has a big Nazi connotation outside of Asia. I've been living in a German expat community in Asia, and although there have been some fake-shocked/amused comments, everyone knows that I'm not a Nazi and this isn't supposed to be a Nazi symbol. It's all cool. But, I am moving to Germany, and I'm not sure if it is still appropriate to wear the shirt there. My thinking is that the context of the Buddha would make it clear to everyone that it is used in the religious sense, not the hateful one. But maybe the connection to Buddhism isn't strong enough in Europe? Would it be offensive to wear this shirt? WIBTA?

Edit: Okay, guess I was too naive and a dick. I can live with that, and the shirt will be leaving my closet.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm a girl/she

Edit because this has come up multiple times - the swastika on the shirt is not identical with the Nazi swastika.

73,Asshole,"Alright, so it was my freshman year of college, and I had a crush on this girl, Ill call her Emily, and it seemed like she was into me. One night, my roommate told me after this other girl came over that he ""called dibs"" on her, which I thought was weird but to bond I told him I called dibs on Emily. Me and Emily didn't work out, and she told me we were just friends, and then started dating my roommate. 

My dorm was one room, with a dresser, desk, and bed on each side of the room two feet apart, so when she was over their relationship was right in my face, and I didn't really have many places to go at the time. Now, I do think what my roommate did was sort of a dick move, I would have been happier if he came to me first and was like hey, I know you like her, are you okay with this, etc, but its whatever. We never dated, its not like I had a claim on her or anything, they're both adults and can do whatever they want, but it was just weird and I think inconsiderate to me. 

Anyway, to the actual question at hand. One night, about a couple weeks into their relationship I think, Emily was over and it was getting late. She usually left around 11 or midnight, sometimes with my roommate back to her dorm, and it was getting to 12:30, and she still hadnt left, and at like 12:45, she crawled into his bed and fell asleep, him quickly following suite.

Now I'm not a confrontational person, so even though I was immediately extremely uncomfortable, I wasn't going to say anything to them then. So I crawled into bed and tried to sleep. Now, I already have anxiety and the woman I still have feelings for is sleeping 2 feet across the room from me with my roommate, so it was impossible to get to sleep. I ended up browsing reddit in my dorm lounge for like 4 hours until I was absolutely exhausted and thought maybe I could get to sleep, which was like 7 by then. 

After class the next day, I texted emily and said, hey, I'm not trying to be mean, but I just don't think Im comfortable with you sleeping over quite yet. And she responded by saying she didn't understand why I was uncomfortable and that it was my roommate's dorm as well. This was also brought up more recently in an argument, where she said ""I thought it was ridiculous because you had a crush on me for a week that you felt you suddenly had this right to me"" and in that same argument called me a misogynist for saying I called dibs on her. I feel like I wasn't being misogynistic, just trying to use the same term since it was just said by my roommate, and I feel like she missed the point of why I was uncomfortable. Am I the asshole?

Tl;dr: I told my roommate I had a crush on this girl, they started dating, she came over one night and slept over, roommate said nothing. I couldn't get to sleep til 7 because it was awkward as fuck( my dorm was one room with beds two feet apart). I told her I was uncomfortable with it next morning, she said I had no right to be",24,42,0.85
74,Not the A-hole, I work as a photographer in a waterpark for the summer. I am usually asked to go in the pools and take photos of families and people doing slides. The company that I work for provides the equipment that is about 10 years old (Nikon D90 + 18-105) and probably has a shutter count close to a million since I take about 2000 photos a day. A customer splashed water on the lens yesterday while he was going down a slide that doesn't normaly splash water 3 meters in the air and it stoped working after 5 minutes. Bear in mind that I did everything I could to protect the camera with my body but the water was too much. Now the company expects me to pay retail price for a 7year old abused lens. The funniest thing is that they were socked when they found out it wasn't working when the lens isn't even weather-sealed. Now I paid for it since it was in the contract that i am responsible for anything that happens to the camera and I'm left with 60$ until august 15th.

75,Not the A-hole,"My dog, 2 years old, has a rare skin and hair disorder which necessitates specialized grooming very frequently. The tl;dr is she needs to get a haircut every 2 to 2 and a half weeks and it's always around $150. Otherwise her skin become irritated and it becomes painful for her to walk and move in general. It's been described by my vet to me that it's similar to psoriasis or eczema and too much hair exacerbates it so much that her skin gets infected.

She's such a loving and cuddly dog. We're best buds, absolutely. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't inconvenient: I'm married, have a newborn on the way, we live in a crappy apartment. Yet we're spending about $400-600/mo on grooming or vet visits. Plus if you count food, toys, etc, add another $100/mo.

My wife wants me to put the dog down. My friends want me to put the dog down. My parents want me to put the dog down. But I can't, she's family to us and especially me. She's not in such poor health that it's necessary to put her down. She's not in pain, as long as it's managed. She's only got to the point of pain 2 or 3 times, and this was when she was a puppy.

78,Not the A-hole,"I hurt my knee, now wearing an immobilization brace. It's big and bulky and goes from my ankle to thigh. I have a love/hate relationship with it; it's let me walk around some for the first time since I hurt myself, but everyone stares hard at my leg. I've gone out to bars/shows with friends a couple of times since, and people are super annoying about it. It makes me feel so uncomfortable to have strangers stare at my leg and ask me weird questions about it. I've had people tell me how 'brave' I am for daring to go out in public with my 'disability'. It's temporary, hoping I'll be back on my own two feet soon. 

Last night, I was hobbling into a bar I like by myself, waiting for my friend to show up later. While I was coming up this man kept staring at my leg. He then asked me 'What's wrong with your gimp leg?'  I'd already been asked a few times already what was wrong with me and I was a little upset.  So I decided to make him feel uncomfortable too and I told him my boyfriend beat me with a bat. He got all flustered and upset about it, and he told me that was a really fucked up thing to tell a stranger. I told him not to ask personal questions of people he don't fucking know if he doesn't wanna hear something like that. 

I mentioned this to my friend today and she told me I was an asshole to lying for him about it, and I should understand 'he's probably wondering why that hot girl is broken.' I think he deserved to feel uncomfortable for starting the whole thing in the first place.

This has meant his income has skyrocketed, to about 35-40k per year as a teenager. In the UK, that's a huge amount for anyone our age. 

I was happy for him at the time, but he's become insufferable about his money. He constantly goes on about his new car, how he can go and spend loads of money each weekend, and can't resist always slotting in that he's a real business expert.

The last straw for me was this weekend, when he asked if I wanted to go out. I just said 'I would, but I'm a bit short this month' and he told me to start a business as 'he has plenty to afford to go out.'

I went off at him, and told him he was a tax fraud (he works purely in cash, and most of that never sees a bank account. He isn't even registered as a company.) with no business skill whatsoever. I said he was incredibly lucky and the only reason at all he is successful was because he was in the right place at the right time, and nothing to do with his own ability.

85,Not the A-hole,"Almost every year since I [23F] was kid, my father has gone on a kayaking trip down in southern Utah. The trip has since evolved to involve the other adults in our family (i.e my aunts and uncles). It has always been the “let loose”, party trip. My dad’s sisters are Mormon, but their husbands are not and the trip was an excuse to go crazy and drink. It was an “adult” trip from the outset. I looked forward to this trip for years as it was the only non-LDS trip my family goes on and I was allowed to go when I was 20.

Last year, my (LDS) aunt surprised everyone by bringing her year old son [13M]on the trip. My dad specifically told her repeatedly it would still be an “adult” trip, but she said he could handle it. On the trip, there was still alcohol and I completely admit to talking about “inappropriate” things after my cousin went to sleep or when he wasn’t around. However, voices carry and he (and my aunt) definitely overheard things.

At a baby shower in June, my aunt made a big deal of pulling me aside away from everybody else and telling me that she was planning a trip this year, wanted me to go, but that my “sexual” talk last year was too much and wouldn’t be tolerated this year. She was very upset with my behavior. I told her I was fine with being “family friendly” when it’s pre-established, but last year was still an “adult” trip. Upset, I left the baby shower early because I didn’t want to cry in front of everyone.

She later text me that she hoped I didn’t leave because of her and it spiraled into an argument. Her POV is that because her son was there it should have been obvious that behavior would change. I again explained that I was fine being filtered on pre-established family friendly trips, but last year was not one. If I went this year, I would be fine filtering, for example. 

I’m also angry because she planned this year’s kayaking trip with EVERYone else without my father’s — who started the trip in the first place — schedule and now he can’t come. They also expect to use all of his equipment (he’s bought all the kayaks/paddles). 

At first, I said I didn’t want to go, but a cousin of mine wanted me to and my father said it would be worse if I didn’t. So I text her that I was planning on going and got the time off, but she has not texted me back. I finally called an uncle to see what was going on after a few days and he said it would be best if I didn’t go because she was really upset. She has also gone on to tell everyone that I said I hate her, which isn’t true at all. It’s all being blown out of proportion. 

I’m so tired of being the bad guy. I’m so incredibly frustrated with the situation. Am I the asshole? Should I have filtered in front of her son? I feel like I’m being blamed for her putting her child in an adult situation.",46,182,0.96

87,Asshole,"I've been seeing a girl for the past couple of weeks. We've been on two dates and last night was our third, and everything was going great as far as I could tell. She's a Chinese international student and in day to day life over here (UK) she goes by the name Zoe, because she says non-Chinese speakers always get her name wrong and it's just easier that way. On our second date she told me her real name was Xiulan and she prefers to go by that so could I please use that instead. Of course that's no problem for me. I've never spoken Chinese before so I do have some trouble pronouncing it but she teaches me how to say it properly. 

For our third date I invite her over to my place to cook for her. During this she's outside playing with my dog and her phone goes off. I called her, using Zoe, because in the moment I forgot her Chinese name and didn't want to completely fuck up the pronunciation and offend her. She asked me in the future if I could use her real name and I said sure, no problem. I must have looked uncertain or whatever because she asked me if I could remember it. I confessed that no, I couldn't exactly, and she told me how to say it again. 

After we had dinner she said she had to go because her friend needed her. I asked her about a fourth date and she made excuses about work and said she'd let me know. I messaged her this morning asking if she was ok and she told me I really upset her by forgetting her name and she didn't want to see me again. I apologized but she hasn't replied so I guess I've fucked it. It's really disappointing because I thought we were really getting on great up to now and I really liked her.

Obviously I feel like a dickhead for upsetting her but I can't help but think like it was a bit of an overreaction on her part to totally cut things off just for this. It's a completely new language to me and I've got her kind of stuck in my mind as Zoe, because that's how she was introduced to me and what she used on our first date.

91,Not the A-hole,"I (28F) live south of Houston and this weekend is the 50th anniversary of the moon landing so there are events going on everywhere. My great uncle worked for the government in FL during the 60s (he was a maintenance man) and he feels very connected. He got tickets to the events yesterday and asked if he (80ish), his wife (70ish) and daughter (49) could fly in and stay with me to attend. They flew in Thurs night and fly out early Monday. 

Friday they were on their own while i worked. Yesterday we went to JSC all day and really had a blast,   Today they wanted to drive to Galveston and make a day of it. I had initially planned to go but last night turned me off. 

My great uncle and aunt were tired and went to bed. My cousin stayed up watching TV with me. I like to watch 48 Hours. Last night was a horrible episode about a young man killed by a former classmate turned Nazi wannabe. The young man was Jewish and gay and that appeared to factor into his killing - the wannabe really wanted to be accepted by a Nazi group he followed online.  Killer was found guilty and went to prison.  During the show it was shown that the victim’s grand mother lived in Europe during the ramp up for WW2 and had to wear the yellow star. I made the comment, ‘how sad to survive the holocaust then have your grandson killed 80 years later in Southern California by the same group.’  

My cousin went on a tirade about Jews. I won’t repeat all the hate here but it made no sense. Part of it was the holocaust was orchestrated by the Jews then it was it never really happened. It was just rantings if a man woman. I initially tried to debate her until I could tell she was just nuts. I asked her about the millions of non Jews also killed she denied that too. 

Finally I gave up and went to bed.  I was so frustrated and disgusted even this morning. I made an excuse to get out of going to Galveston with them. Now I feel bad - i feel like I should have called her out in front of her parents. I should have made them change their plans to go to the Houston HolocaustMuseum.  But thinking about it last night people don’t just end up that way - what if her parents shared her views?  I wasn’t going to argue 3 on 1 and end up kicking out my geriatric relatives.  They’re leaving in the morning and I don’t suspect I will have to see the parents again until a family funeral or something similar. 

AITA for avoiding the confrontation?  I plan to tell my mom and grandparents but not while they’re all here in my home.

92,Asshole,"My sister \[25\] lives with dad. She dreams of a husband and kid but hasn't had luck due to social anxiety.She gets support, company and can save a lot, he is getting older and lonely so they both benefit from it. It seemed healthy until recently.

My sister has been looking for a house to buy for a while to start a family. Recently she has been playing with the idea of buying a house with my father, so she can take care of him when he gets older. I know she is also worried that he'll be lonely (he's a difficult guy and has pushed away most friends and family). She is also depending on him for 'the things a husband should do' like certain chores, company and emotional support and I know it makes her less motivated to be outgoing and socialize because she's comfortable in her living arrangement. (She basically has all the things a husband brings except the romantic/intimate aspect and it makes her stick in her comfort zone).

First she talked about a sort of dual house. Buy two lots next to each other and connect them, or find one of those houses that has a 'flat for rent' in it. I also live close to my mother and we live separate lives but are still close so that seemed a good idea.

This week when I went to visit she was talking about a new house, she just mentioned two bathrooms, nothing else separate. I asked if this was one of those dual houses and she replied it wasn't. Just a regular house that happens to have two bathrooms.

I was immediately kind of weirded out and asked her what she would do if she found a husband (she is really set on marrying and having a few kids). She just shrugged it off and joked the guy had to get used to living with dad.

Our dad isn't the easiest to get along with and I think most men would stay away from a situation where they are immediately forced to the presence of a dad 24/7.

My father was eagerly planning along and I started feeling like he was too eager. Like he saw it as a way to not end up lonely. Now for me, I feel like he needs to make his own life and not depend on his kids like that, I care about my parents & I take care of my sick mother too, but I also motivated her to get out more and make friends & not rely on her kids too much. She has done that & she's much happier & more independent for it. I feel like it should be his responsibility to prevent her from making decisions that could hinder her own life.

This is why I asked him if he thought it might not interfere with her family planning or 'personal growth' (her social anxiety) and he blew me off quite harshly as if I insulted him. I tried to minimize sounding accusatory and tried to frame it as an innocent question but my sister was also offended (on his behalf).

I feel like their explosive reaction validated my concerns but I know sometimes I see things wrong & need to rethink them later, so:

AITA for questioning their choices or am I right in being somewhat concerned?

&#x200B;

\*\*Edit:\*\* It seems I haven't worded my post properly, English is not my primary language. For context, my father has a history of abuse and manipulative behaviour. My sister was too young to experience it first hand. My mother was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward after their marriage. My father has changed a lot but is still inherently manipulative. Just not overly abusive. My sister doesn't see it and sees him as a fragile man.

I am not ""weirded out"" just because they live together. That's fine. I'm concerned because he is encouraging her keeping her world small and she has frequently voiced unhappiness over her empty social life.

Edit 2: Please stop arguing about how it's normal in other cultures to live together. It is not about them just living together. They have been doing that for 7 or so years and I have never thought badly of it because it was a healthy relationship. It is however not healthy anymore. My sister agrees that it is a concern and not healthy. She becomes a different person when my dad is around and I'm afraid he is counting on her guilt to live together, when she has doubts about how this will limit her adult life.",127,282,0.92

But I don't think I was wrong to be upset, that's where you nice people come in.

We just had a really nice vacation for the most part. It was to an awesome resort with a local vibe on one of the less travelled islands. He paid for the entire trip, much to my discomfort but his insistence (we have been together for 3 years now and even so being raised a frugal Catholic with 8 siblings, I'm not comfortable being spoiled). 

He spent about an Hour working the first day but he promised it was only to ""keep up"" with emails. Then the next day he did rhe same thing but he was answering emails and he missed a surfing lesson I really wanted to do with him. I went by myself and made the huge mistake of wearing a ""cheeky"" swimsuit and the instructor was a total creep which made me even more frustrated with my boyfriend. He promised that night he was done but he was up at 3 am on his computer. When I confronted him he said that he wanted and needed to ""get ahead"" on work so he wasn't buried when he got back on Monday. I told him my feelings were really hurt that he took me on vacation that I wasn't totally comfortable with him paying for then feeling like he was ignoring me. He told me to ""cool your jets Mel, this job is paying for YOUR vacation."" 

I bit my toungue and tried to have fun but even on the day he promised not to work I found him answering emails on a bench outside a restaurant.

100,Everyone Sucks,"So I (21F) got a new housemate (early 20s, M) recently in the student house we live in - he just moved in a month or so ago. The second week he was here he had his friends over at every single night from about 10.30 to past 12, usually 1am. That week I got incredibly sleep deprived. I'm an incredibly light sleeper so I just can't sleep if I hear noise - and we share a really thin wall, so I can hear everything. So each night I had to stay awake until his friends left and a lot of the time, I had work the next day which ended up in me having to leave work early one of my shifts as I just couldn't function. I can't fall asleep to music as it's too noisy, and my excellent noise cancelling headphones can't even block him out (though I'm not playing music when I wear them so obviously they don't work remotely as well). After that week of no sleep, I asked him if we could compromise - maybe he could cut down on having friends over and on the nights he did, he could let me know and I would sleep over at my boyfriend's that night. 

He was actually incredibly apologetic which I appreciated and said he had no idea it was affecting me so badly. Except the thing is: he's still pretty loud after 10.30 into all hours of the night. He's not playing music or anything but yet again, he has friends over loudly chatting (they got here 9.30, still here 11)  and it's a work day tomorrow. He also didn't tell me they were going to come over so I didn't get the chance to organise going over to my boyfriend's. One of the things I got really annoyed about was when I talked to him about it, I tried to empathise and said I'm sure he could hear me all the time as well and it was just a terrible wall. Except he said he actually couldn't hear me pretty much 99% of the time. 

I put a lot of effort into being considerate of noise from my room - I don't have friends over past 10.30 generally ever (sometimes have them over drinking, but we go out clubbing at 10), if I watch TV in the evening/night, I wear my headphones etc. This guy woke me up this morning with his alarm that went over for 15 minutes.

So every time he brings friends around, I start playing music. I'm paranoid of affecting the other housemates however as they're nice people, so I've checked the volume is low enough it doesn't go their side of the house - but I'm assuming he can't be missing it with how thin our wall is. And considering that I can't sleep for hours after his friends go, I've been keeping it on as if my sleep is disrupted, I want to show him the same courtesy. 

Be honest. AITA for doing this? I'm sleep deprived as I write this so definitely could be.

Edit: playing the music is also because I really want him to understand how thin the wall is, and to know that if he can hear my low volume music this clearly - I can hear him talking right now. Just to clarify!

Edit2: my house is rented primarily to students so our realtor has extra clauses in our contract, specifically relating to noise between 10pm-6am (hence why I was so careful with my noise, should have clarified). A reason I picked this place was because I did think it would be a great environment as noisy houses would do me in.

Edit3: this blew up in the few hours I slept! (Joking...) Extra INFO: guy's frequency of having people over 4-5 times a week right now. 

Can't switch rooms, we have separate rental contracts. Noise clauses mentioned before in contract - not sure if they only relate to excessive noise as it just says ""noise between 10pm-6am"". 

Have talked to the guy 3-4 times about it now, one of these times we set up the arrangement to have his friends over less, this is now past that.

I sent him a message last night as I had to get my boyfriend to pick me at 12 as I couldn't sleep, explaining I had to go and saying it was uncool that he didn't give me a heads up his friends were over so I could go sleep at my boyfriend's earlier than this.

FINAL UPDATE: called my rental agency and asked about my contract. They said that his actions in having friends over repeatedly between the quiet hours were a breach of contract. The noise clause in our contract is not relating to any and all noise but they did say that social noise between those hours isn't tolerated as it's specifically targeting that. So, doubt my petty actions are going to be continuing as I'd like to stay in NTA zone and I'll just report him in future if he continues (after communicating his breach to him though, I'll obviously give him another shot).",129,532,0.93

Lately, we've purchased a house together. It's always been my dream to have a larger house and we finally did it this year. 2018 and 2019 have been rather taxing financially as there were several big-ticket items to spend on. We're also finally moving in together as a couple permanently, after 2 years of a long-distance marriage.

Recently, my husband was a little more secretive than usual. I eventually discovered that he had adopted 2 puppies from his neighbour and intended to surprise me on our move-in day with them. The puppies are strays that his neighbour rescued from the streets. 

I love dogs, don't get me wrong but the thing is, we have a lot of moving stress and additional cost that will be cropping up in the next few weeks. I told him that the dogs are a no-go for now and we had an argument. 

He said that I always mentioned that the best gift would be an armful of puppies (which is true, I have said that). He also said that I've always been controlling of the relationship and must always have my way in all aspects. He mentioned that if I had selected the dogs (as opposed to him), then we would have had them.

I told him that the dogs were great but that they should wait. At least until we're settled in the new house (maybe in 5 months). 

There's a cold-war brewing between us and we're both not speaking to each other. 

So Reddit, AITA for this or is he being unreasonable?

EDIT: Thank you for all your comments, everyone. For clarity, he is committed towards taking care of the dogs and has told me that he would be 100% responsible (he's built 2 kennels, sourced-out homemade puppy recipes and leashes and made vet appointments). 

Financially, we're perfectly all right and the extra commitment won't be a burden. The dogs will not impact us negatively and there won't be any gaping hole left in our finances.",67,151,0.92

105,Asshole,"Last year I got into a three year grad school program where people both complete individual assignments and participate in group research. I was picked to join  an elite research group on a niche topic in our field (humanities) with two second years, Brian and Sabrina, placed under the supervision of one of the leading experts in that field. I quickly became close friends with Sabrina, who was passionate about the field, her career and a devout Christian, traits we have in common. She took me to her church and faith group and we talked about basically everything under the sun.

In winter, Sabrina started to withdraw. She struggled focussing on her work, lost a lot of weight quickly and behaved out of character. She told me she was concerned about her solo research paper that was due by the end of the school year. 

About a week before that paper was due Sabrina finally broke down to me and confided into me that she had been diagnosed with a mental illness that she couldn't get good treatment for under her insurance and how much it crushed her to see how her condition got into her way of working.

This is where it got difficult: her bad work in our group also affected my career prospects and I felt that I couldn't continue working with her knowing she would not recover quickly. I met up with Brian and our group advisor, shared what I learned and we all agreed that it would be our best course of action to replace Sabrina so she could get back on her feet. Because I had to leave right after that meeting to go to my sister's destination wedding we decided that Brian would inform Sabrina the day after she handed in her thesis.

When I returned from the wedding I saw that Sabrina had been blowing up my phone for days. Appearantly, Brian didn't muster the courage to tell her so Sabrina had to learn about being replaced by her successor's facebook update; her personal advisor learned about her condition from our supervisor and refused to continue to work with her; she had to come out to her parents about her struggles and they were less than understanding. I tried to console her and prayed with her, but she got even angrier and hung up on me.

I still saw her as my best friend, but she never returned my calls and texts and refused to speak to me at church and faith group despite I continued to try. After some weeks, she kind of disappeared, took time off from school and quit the church. Noone heard from her for a while until a faith group girl saw her working a retail job in the city last week. Appearantly she lost even more weight and had given up any ambition to ever work in our field. This concerned me. I texted her and Sabrina answered ""That is none of your business. Don't contact me again. You ruined my life.""

106,Not the A-hole,"Hi everyone, I'd love a little moral insight into my actions. I feel justified, but my friend is completely pissed off at me and won't let it go. 

My friend and I made plans to take a train down to a city about 1.5 hours away for a day trip yesterday. Nothing particular planned, just to get out of town for a bit. We were supposed to take the train at 9am. We got to the train station with 15 mins to spare and I went to pick up the tickets whilst they bought us breakfast to have on the train. We were about to go through the gates 5 minutes before departure and they hand me the sandwich they got for me. It was chicken bacon. I'm vegetarian, as my friend very well knows. 

I ask if they accidentally gave me theirs. They laughed and said they got the same sandwich for both of us. I'm really confused and say, ""you know I'm vegetarian...?"" And their response, still giggling, was ""not today!"" Uhh, what? My friend sometimes jokes about feeding me meat but I always took it as banter. 

I'm confused and annoyed, and tell them I'm going to get food I can actually eat. They chase after me, saying how we're going to miss the train. I'm used to having food at 7-8 in the morning so I'm starving, and don't particularly care if we miss the train as the next one comes in an hour. I guess I could've waited until we arrived but still, I had plans to eat on the train. The line at the shop is long so we do end up missing our train, and had to wait around for the next one. We still managed to get to the other city, but suffice it to say that the mood for the trip was completely ruined. 

TLDR; friend got me a chicken bacon sandwich knowing full well that I'm vegetarian so I went to get myself food I can actually eat, thereby making us miss our train.

107,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because all parties know my account name.

Backstory: My boyfriend (Alex\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I’ve become friends with his two best friends (James\* and Noah\*) but we’re not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.

Situation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

Three nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn’t move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

James messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had “promised” two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it’s a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn’t want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

Am I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?

2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn’t considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don’t know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn’t stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can’t use my discount in the way that I did. He said he’s just going to let it play out but he’ll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don’t think we’ll be getting one.

Me and my brothers weren't allowed to have summer jobs and instead were forced to stay at home and study. We saved 500$ total. We got money by collecting Eidi (Eidi is basically money given to kids on Eid by relatives. It happens once a year.) So when we were able to get enough money to buy a gaming PC my dad refused to buy us a PC. He didn't straight up say no instead he took me to some PC shops to comfort me that he will buy me a PC from my money and then 2 days later I heard him saying to my mom that he will not buy me a PC from my money and will not let me or my brother bring PC into this house because my grades are C. When I heard this I blew up on my dad and started yelling at him.(didn't cuss). Then later cried myself to sleep. Since then I have been giving my dad the silent treatment. I asked my mom to help me convince my dad but instead she dosent wanna get Involved. My brother and I are both pretty upset currently. But I feel guilty recently so AITA for reacting this way?

111,Everyone Sucks,"My girlfriend and I (mutually) decided to break up in March and are still living together. When we broke up we both asked each other not to bring someone home when we rebound. 

Last weekend I told her that there are still aspects of the break up and this new dynamic between she and I that I'm still trying to adjust to and struggling with a bit (I've a long, hard history with depression and anxiety which doesn't help) which I wasn't even going to tell her about, but I was down for a week or two and she kept asking what was the matter.

 She has started seeing someone else about a month ago, which doesn't really bother me and isn't the issue. I truly am happy for her as long as she is safe and happy and I'm not still in love with her or hoping to get back with her, but a few days ago she sent me a message saying that she was bringing the guy she is seeing back to the house that evening to ""probably just watch a movie downstairs."" It wasn't asking if I would be cool with it or that she was thinking about it. It was literally an FYI message.

She and I messaged back and forth for the most part as we were both in work but the gist of the conversation was that I wasn't ready or comfortable to see my ex of three years be romantic with someone else, let alone in the house I live in (If I bumped into them on the street that would be different.) I told her that I was angry and hurt that she would just ignore the agreement we had when we broke up, and that it wasn't cool to do that. She was saying that she can't keep herself down because of my depression, that if I brought a woman home then she wouldn't be bothered and that I was being an ass. 

She ended up not bringing the guy over and I text her the next day apologizing if I seemed angry and if she felt like I was just trying to pick a fight with her (we spoke briefly about it face to face the day before and while I didn't get rude or disrespectful, I did get a little animated) and to clarify that I wasn't doing this just to be an ass or be awkward, just that I was not comfortable or ready to deal with this whole situation yet. She messaged back basically saying that she hates my guts and doesn't want to speak to me and she started telling me again that I was just being an ass and now because of me she is alone. 

Up until now the break up has been very amicable and mature, but now my ex doesn't even want to look at me because of this whole thing. I'm ready to eat crow if I'm the asshole here. 

Thanks.

My husband has a very close friend. People have commented on the nature of their friendship because they are extremely close. When we're out in a group of friends they sometimes get confused as partners. Does it irk me? Ofcourse! 

And yet that's not my major issue with her. When my husband first became friends with her I didn't like it much because he's cheated in the past. But the past's the past, right? Right upon meeting her something felt off. But I thought that was just me. (Though in the past my first impressions never proved me wrong).

Anyway, we were at her house, having drinks and my husband gets a call. He leaves the room and I figure we'll continue the conversation. Well, no. Dead silence. She even turned her head on me and began petting one of her pet ferrets. Ok, awkward. This lasted the entire time my husband was outside. The second he walked back into the room she gets all smiley and talkative. 

Now if there's anything I hate hypocrisy and disrespect has to be it. And that first meeting set the mark for all our future encounters. Ignoring me, forgetting to say hello, ect.

At one point she and my husband went mountain biking. He mentioned he was bringing our daughter and still she only packed water and snacks for the two of them. 

To say I dislike her is an understatement . If their friendship ever ends I'll be toasting with champagne. It's gotten to the point I feel uncomfortable in our group of friends.

I don't like her, I don't want to spend time with her, I don't want her on my social media, ect. My husband thinks I'm wrong and shouldn't treat her different from our other friends. Now I would never ask my husband to chose between me and her, that's childish. But I refuse to let her into my life any more than I have to to keep it civil

I've asked him multiple times to use a normal speaking voice if possible after midnight, because that's when I start to go to sleep, but every night this week I've been up listening to him screech! The vents carry every single thing he shouts right up to my bedroom.

123,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at bottom

So I have this neighbor that does things that I find mildly annoying on a fairly regular basis. Their trash cans tip over two or three times a month and spill into my yard, their adult son smokes weed and the smell occasionally drifts into my house, and they park their van on the street so that it is mostly in front of my house. I never say anything to him about these things because they usually do a pretty good job of picking up the trash when it spills, weed is legal here, and I don’t own the street. Plus none of it bothers me enough to bring it up. 

My wife and I park both of our vehicles in the garage, however earlier this week we bought her a new car and we will be selling her old car by ourselves. I pulled the old car onto the street and parked at the very edge of my property line so that it is entirely in front of my house and there is enough room for one more car between it and my driveway. I know that will prevent my neighbor from parking where he usually does, but I figure it’s not a big deal because he has his garage, his driveway, and enough room to park two cars along the street on the other side of his driveway, so the man has other options. 

After only three days of our old car being parked there I come home and his van is backed up to within a couple inches of our old car and is partially blocking his driveway, he approaches me and asks if I will move the car so he could park where he normally does. I told him I wanted to leave space for our guests to park in front of our house and that the car would be gone soon since we are selling it.   He then points to where he wants me to move the car so that his will fit again, I point out that if I do so there will not be room for another car in front of our house, in addition to occasional other visitors my wife’s parents are over once or twice a week and it makes sense for them to park in front of my house. 

I asked him if there was some reason he couldn’t park on the other side of his driveway and he said he likes to park on my side because it’s easier ( I can’t see any reason that this is the case). As politely as I could I explained that the street is first come first serve and that if the space was open I would be parking the car there until it sold, and that if he found it open to help himself, however I would not be moving it just so that he could take its place. He seemed upset and scoffed at me before going back into his house. Am I the asshole for not just moving the car?

TLDR:
Neighbor usually parks with 3/4 of his car in front of my house. We buy a new car and temporarily park the old one entirely in front of our house but it prevents him from parking where he usually does, he asked me to move it but I refuse because he can just park in front of his house until I sell the car.

I told her that she didn't have to do that- but I would certainly pay her if she was genuinely offering. We ended up agreeing that she'd help while I was at uni.

I clean my bathroom and kitchen pretty much every day because they're pretty small. I told her not to worry about them , or anything other than vacuuming, maybe a bit of dusting. I didn't think that it wouldn't take her more than an hour, but so as to not rush her, we had agreed on about 2 hours, with $50 an hour- yes I know that's high.

I left for my classes around 2pm, and when I came home, it was nearly 7pm. To my surprise, she was still there, watching TV. She doesn't drive, so I thought maybe she wanted a lift home (she lives about 5 minutes away so it wouldn't bother me). I asked her what was up, and she said she'd only just finished about 10 minutes ago. I could tell the floors had been vacuumed, but no dusting had been done. I wasn't too worried about the state of the house, as she was doing me a favour after all. However, I was concerned that it took 4.5 hours to only vacuum the house.

I mentioned that I told her not to do too much, only vacuum and dust and that I didn't think it would take that long. She started getting defensive, and said that it was a ""huge"" house- so huge that she didn't even get up to dusting.

I ended up handing her $150, and said my thanks and got ready to take her home. She was upset at this point, and said, I thought we agreed on $50 an hour. I said, yeah but we also agreed that it wouldn't take longer than 2 hours. She ended up crying and saying that I was trying to stiff her. I was really upset too, because I thought I was being reasonable (I even overpaid her). She took the money, but was still mad and now she won't talk to me and our mutual friends are calling me greedy and a bad friend and I feel super guilty.

127,Asshole,"I am in an online group that talks about wedding stuff. Recently I made a post asking for advice. My post said, 

“Question for y’all: my wedding is still a long way out but I want to know—is there a very tactful way to say on the invites that you would REALLY prefer people stick to the registry? It’s something that’s important to me because 1. We are poor, so the things we ask for we actually need and might not be able to get them for ourselves if someone else doesn’t get them for us 2. It’s just so wasteful on an environmental level, I hate getting presents I don’t like because it feels like just another thing I’m going to end up throwing away when that wasn’t necessary. You know what I mean? Have any of you had similar concerns and found a way a successful way to communicate that?”

I was taken aback by an overwhelming majority of people that clearly thought I was the asshole—some of the most upvoted responses said

 “Honestly, most people stick to the registry or give you cash. You can always return stuff you don’t want.”, 

“There is no tactful way to say it. Period.”, 

and 

“it’s rude to mention gifts at all so...no, there’s not a tactful way”. 

I got exactly one serious response that suggested the wording, “Should you wish to help us celebrate with a gift, we hope this registry makes it more convenient for you to select something that you know we will love.” This sounds perfect and what was exactly what I had in mind, so I’m confused at why so many people seem to feel so strongly that I am wrong. 

My defense:
My family and my fiancé’s families are both known to be very bad at sticking to registries/wish lists, so we anticipate getting a LOT of gifts that we didn’t ask for, not just a few. Part of it also feels like an issue of class to me—if you have money, then of course it doesn’t matter, but we have much more limited money (to buy our own stuff), time (to return/sell/donate gifts), and space (to store things in our studio apartment).

But on the other hand:
Maybe I am having a poor attitude about this. If people want to show up and give us anything at all, I should be grateful, right? We’re poor but also have been living together so have most of the basic things we need, and clearly we have enough to pay for a modest wedding, so maybe I’m just using that as an excuse to justify my annoyance at the situation. Am I being greedy? An ungrateful brat? An ASSHOLE?",199,246,0.92
128,Everyone Sucks,"AITA for dropping my pants to prove a point?

So I’m M25 and quite asian. Full Korean blood as far back as you can look. As you can assume, it’s given me some shit over the years especially as a kid but I didn’t expect such childish behavior from an adult woman. It’s 2019 and we’re all in our mid 20’s, we shouldn’t have racism today.

My friend Dave was having a get together at his place and I don’t really know his friends plus he must’ve had 20+ people at his house. I’m kinda awkwardly following him around the whole time and he introduces me to a girl my age.

Evidently she’s friends with my GF and starts to giggle a little. She said stuff like “ohhh the things girls share, i know more about you than you do yourself haha”

I wasn’t really fond of her childish personality but kept talking to her anyway for my friend. Girl doesn’t know when to quit and says “you know, GF is worried about you meeting her parents cause...you know...you don’t look like her” Okay, news to me, let my girlfriend tell me that herself thank you.

I said we were mature adults who didn’t focus on looks and it wasn’t her business. She KEPT GOING though and said “but cultural differences are a big thing, like what if she doesn’t want her kids to give up English for you??”

We’re both drunk and she’s pretty obviously wasted and giggly. I basically told her to fuck off and Dave is trying to diffuse the situation.

Girl says “I’m just looking out for her! It’s not a racism thing it’s just maybe she’s not satisfied but is too shy to say it. You’re cute and all but there’s lots of differences. Like you and a white guy...you are shorter than one...probably in more ways than one, it’s science.”

I had about five shots and a beer or two and wasn’t in my right mind. I dropped my khakis, NOT MY UNDERWEAR (which was tight enough to see the outline of Mini Me). Which wasn’t a horse dick, but certainly not small.

I said something stupid like “that look short to you?” And she screamed and ran away. People were looking at me and my friend kicked me out full stop. I got an Uber.

I’m home now and Dave is pissed but honestly, don’t two dick moves cancel each other out? People say “oh I hope racists die” but if you’re okay with that then why not a crude way of proving a point? It wasn’t ideal but I think there are situations where people deserve an asshole. Plus again I was and still am a little sloshed.

129,Not the A-hole,"AITA for having no desire to babysit my BILs child? For context, I am a SAHM who loves her kids but doesn’t like kids in general and I do not babysit. My BIL & his wife haven’t paid for childcare in 5+ years because they’ve taken advantage of several family members (all on BILs side of the family). BIL works a M-F job, starts early around 4am and gets off around noon. His wife is self-employed (provides a service to clients. Workaholic. Makes her own hours). They do whatever they can do to get other people to watch their kid so they don’t have to. Seriously. The kid is always with someone else. For years my MIL, who worked full time M-F watched the child in the evenings & then overnight every weekend. She didn’t want babysit that much but she wouldn’t say no. She passed away and now BIL has started calling on his sister (my SIL) to babysit whenever school is out (she teaches so she’s out when the kids are out). Like my MIL, she doesn’t particularly care to do it every day & overnight but she won’t say no either. And just like with MIL, they finagle it into her keeping the child overnight. I fell for it once last summer and it was finagled into an overnight thing. Now 3 times in the last 2 weeks they have asked us to babysit. The first time, they asked us to pick up the child 30 miles away & bring to our house. They’ve since asked 2 more times, but it involves dropping the child here at 5:30am and 6:30am and me taking him to camp at 9am. They need a sitter because BIL starts work at 4 and his wife is scheduling clients prior to 9am. Why is their lack of childcare my problem? Why am I the bad guy for saying no? I have no desire to wake up at 5:30-6:30 to babysit FOR FREE. And provide meals and use my gas.  These people would never ever try to compensate me or return the favor sometime. AIAH for thinking that just because I am a SAHM, I’m not free childcare for other people? AIAH for thinking if they are using day camp as childcare, shouldn’t my BILs wife schedule her clients around her child’s day camp schedule?

About 3 months ago, 21F came to me and told me she was having issues with anxious thoughts, depressed mood, and other symptoms. After listening to her and talking to her, I, at her request, found a psychiatrist who was recommended by many and had excellent reviews. Also at her request, I accompanied her to the appointment and stayed with her while the psychiatrist conducted an extremely thorough evaluation. At the end, my daughter was given an antidepressant prescription and a prescription for Xanax, to be taken during her panic attacks. 

I didn’t tell my husband, because my daughter confided in me and I respect that she’s an adult and that she has the right to her privacy. Husband found the prescription bottle laying around. He is livid that she’s taking medicine. He thinks she should’ve tried more “holistic” approaches (I.e, exercise, diet) before going to medicine. Besides that, he’s angry at me for not telling him about this. His reasoning is, God forbid something happens, he needs to be aware of her medical history and current conditions and medications.

132,Not the A-hole,"I have a now 6-month-old male dog that I adopted. I was told by the people I got him from to got him neutered until he was a year old, because of his breed. I always keep a watchful eye on him when I take him out and my yard is closed off, so there should be no reason for dogs to get back there, or so I thought. 

Our next-door neighbor adopted a dog around the same time we did, female, from a different foster group. They are not great with this dog. She is constantly getting out, they’re always chasing her up and down the street, screaming her name. They haven’t made any attempts to train her (they admitted this to me) and they don’t even take her for walks, they just let her out into their backyard, which overlooks our yard. 

I do take my dog for daily (Sometimes twice daily) walks but I do send him into the yard to do his business outside that. He can’t escape, because it’s completely fenced in. We have a doggy door so he can let himself out as well. Anyway, one day I look outside and realize the neighbor’s dog is back there with mine…doing the devil’s tango. I go out there and bring the dog home. The neighbor’s are intensely apologetic and I manage to build something to make sure that their dog can’t go into ours ever again.

A bit later, the neighbors come to me and tell me that their dog is pregnant. She didn’t do anything with any other dog and they’re sure it’s his puppies. I said that I will help find the puppies homes, but we’re not interested in more dogs at the moment.

I guess the foster home they adopted the dog from found out that the dog was pregnant and took her back due to breach of contract. I guess due to the pet population, they have to promise to make sure that she wasn’t getting pregnant and while they didn’t do it purposefully, they didn’t get her spayed when they were supposed to either.

Now my neighbors want us to pay them money for the dog that they lost, because they’re claiming it’s partially our fault. I told them to get lost and said they were irresponsible dog owners, plus the dog jumped into our yard. They’re angry and said it’s the least we could do, plus we got to keep our dog. They claim we should’ve lost ours too.

133,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so, first time poster, I'm just going to lay it all down on the table. Please be patient.

I'm a 26 year old man. For about a year and a half, I worked for a business owned by a friend, who I'll call Ricky, the nature of which isn't pertinent to the situation. I was brought on in a time of need, and I worked hard to repay that kindness. I worked many hours of unpaid overtime, took many last minute changes of schedule, and I tolerated the irregular mood swings and often irrational behavior Ricky often exhibited. He was a good boss and friend, though, he showed me favor when it was appropriate, and even sent me on a plane to my hometown, to meet my estranged father for the first time. For this, I will be eternally grateful.

My employment with his business ended, when after some personal difficulties I was experiencing caught up to me, and my performance dropped to to the point where I was let go from my position. Ricky was right to do it, regardless of what was happening in my personal life, because my quality of work had slumped. He has to look out for himself and his business.

I picked up a labor job and worked hard at that, full time, but wasn't able to pay all my expenses with it, and was going hungry. I made significantly less money than before, and my area is famously expensive to live in.

So, after a hard few months, I decided that indeed, a man must eat, and picked up a part time job at a competing business in order to earn a supplemental income and balance my books. I had debts to pay and I had to choose between eviction, and loss of my whole life, or staying in the good grace of a man who had indeed helped me, but had fired me all the same. Even rescinded my invitation to his wedding.

The other day, Ricky confronted me in person, after having been informed of my new position by a mutual client. He exploded, he called me honorless scum, a shtty person, a rtard, and told me that I was a worthless employee and a miserable excuse for a human being.

Then, he threatened to assault me, and told me that because even though I had informed no clientele of my new position, many of them preferred dealing with me over him, and it was hurting his bottom line. Word had gotten around that I was with a new business, and many clients stopped working with him after my termination. He accused me of stealing food from his mouth to feed myself, even after I explained it was a move born of desperate necessity, not an attack or some foolish attempt at spite. He told me he'd do everything in his power to make my life at that business a living misery, and told me the last kindness he'd do me was warn me not to go to another shift there. He made many vague threats like that.

If he was willing to get rid of me to save his bottom line, am I justified in prioritizing my own bottom line, even if it meant costing me his friendship.

For the past few days, I've been working myself to death clearing out my parents house and our house of junk for a yard sale. I also have two sons that I am taking care of, as well as running a household.

My husband kept talking to me, and after awhile I said ""Babe, I'm really tired. Can we have some quiet time?""

So he kept talking, with the TV super loud, etc. And instead of telling him to quiet down and have his night be affected, I said ""I'm going to lay in the bedroom and relax where it's quiet."" 

So... he followed me in the bedroom. Probably perusing for sexytime, who knows. So I said ""Babe. I am really tired. REALLY. I just want to go to sleep. You can go play video games or whatever but I really just want to be left alone so I can relax.""

142,Asshole,"I work at a local cat shelter that is no kill, and runs primarily on volunteers and donations. Which means it runs well because it is very popular in the community. There are about five paid employees, myself included, spread throughout the week and over twenty volunteers.

I am our equivalent of a shift leader because I am the only paid employee. The others are two volunteers, a brother and sister who have been working since they were fourteen and twelve respectively. Now B is 21 and S is 19. While we work, cleaning boxes/feeding cats/washing dishes, people from the community can come in to play with cats. This week, a man who regularly comes to socialize feral cats told me that S was dressed inappropriately and shouldn't be working on a shift when kids could see her. I told him I'd look into it, and found S cleaning a litterbox.

Sure enough, most of her crack was showing. I should mention here that S is a very heavy girl, and she probably didn't intend to be dressed inappropriately. If I had to guess I would say she didn't know how it was going to fit until she wore it here. In fact, when she stood up she pulled up her pants. They just didn't fit and kept slipping down. I pulled her aside and calmly told her that her pants were not fitting well and made her look inappropriate. I told her since there were people around we needed to fix it, and offered to let her take the rest of her shift off. Instead she called her father and had him bring a hoodie, which she tied around her waist, and finished working.

Today my boss came to me and said she'd heard what I did to to S, and told me I have no right to berate volunteers-I did not berate her. My boss didn't listen, and said that people like S and her family keep our shelter afloat and I should be ashamed for bullying a younger girl on her size. I am in my forties. She gave me an official warning (our shelter works on a marks system, if you get too many you get fired).

Also, I did manage to get my boss to relay what she had been told and to me it doesn't sound like she has an exaggerated version. I don't know why she's blowing it up so much, though.

We generally provide rules at the beginning, when we explain the hint system, telling them that we like to provide help during the game if a group looks frustrated or aren't on the right track with a puzzle for an extended period of time.

A family of four, two women and two children, come in to play what is rated as our easiest room. I go through the rules as usual, and start their game. I push them in the right direction like I do every other group, and they make it to the final room and final puzzle.

They misread the clue and ignored the progress they had already made. I proceeded to tell them that they had the right information and just had to put it in order, but they seemed to get worse, with the kids milling about or lying down and the adults yelling at each other.

145,Everyone Sucks,"Short backstory. I have been seeing this guy for a short period of time. Despite using Plan B and having a copper IUD inserted 3 days after we had unprotected sex (copper IUD can be used as emergency contraception within 5-7 days), somehow I am pregnant. 

He would really like for me to have an abortion. I don’t want one. We are both stable adults capable of financially supporting a child. Whether that’s together or separate. And while I am pro choice, an abortion is not something I’ve ever felt I could undergo. I’ve seen this baby’s heartbeat. And I know that it wouldn’t ruin my life. Make it more difficult? Delay some goals? Sure. But I would be fine. 

He is adamant he doesn’t want any more children (he has two from his previous relationship), and he has made me feel as though if I continue with this pregnancy, he will have nothing to do with it.

I am upset for a number of reasons, but the main one being that he did NOTHING to prevent this pregnancy (cumming inside of me without asking about birth control etc) and I did everything I could short of not having sex in the first place. Taking Plan B made me feel shitty, and having the IUD inserted was some of the worst pain of my LIFE. He is SO adamant that he won’t support this child, and I am terrified of raising an infant alone, I am considering having the abortion. I don’t want to bring a fatherless child into this world. Especially when their father has loved and taken care of their other children. That’s what my father did. I never met him, yet he stuck around for my older siblings. It’s cause a lot of deep emotional pain, that has taken me quite some time to come to terms with. 

I feel like it’s a fair trade off. If I go through with this abortion, I am going to have to deal with the emotional and personal moral conflicts that come with it. Not to mention time off work and the physical recovery of the procedure. All because he doesn’t want the kid that he didn’t seem to do anything to prevent in the first place. 

Am I the asshole for requesting that he get a vasectomy if I agree to the abortion?

*edit to fix typos

*Edited to say I appreciate all of the input. I do want to clarify that I understand that I have no control over him, nor do I want it. I would also never DEMAND a vasectomy in exchange for an abortion. I didn’t mean to make it seem as though if I chose to get an abortion, and he didn’t want the vasectomy, I would change my mind about the abortion. That’s why I used the words “ask” and “suggest”. 

He has expressly stated that it’s not that he doesn’t want a child with ME, it’s that he doesn’t want anymore children, ever. 

Posting this has made me realize that I shouldn’t even be consider suggesting it right now. I should respect his autonomy, and clearly based on the responses here, it would be easy to for him to feel manipulated by the request given the timing. I also need to make this decision based solely on my own feelings and ability to care for this child. While I want to respect his feelings, ultimately I’m the one who has to live with this choice. 

So I have a lot more thinking to do. Thank you everyone for your input. Good, bad and indifferent. I appreciate all of it. I’ve read a lot of good points I hadn’t considered. I am (hopefully understandably) very emotional and my rational mind is hard to hear. Which is why I posted this here before making any decisions.",354,651,0.89

My parents have paid for dinner for us plenty of times, more than we've done for them certainly. But when someone else invites you out to dinner, the expectation is that you at least pay for your own meal. You don't invite someone along so they'll pay for you and your partner's food.

My friend said my husband is TA because it was my Dad's birthday and my husband should have automatically paid. We don't have extra cash to spend on stuff like this at the moment and they know this.

This morning I was just hoping to finish without stopping to rest(I only made it 3/4 of the way).  A fun run typically is not timed and encourages people who would like to walk the course as well.

This particular 5k has a gimmick that advertises quite well on social media, so the number of people walking at this morning’s fun run vastly outnumbered the people running the course.  Many of them were playing on their phones and posing for Instagram photos right in the middle of the course.  There were walls of people walking preventing runners from getting through all over the course.  

I became very impatient with threading my way through the crowd by a half mile into the race.  For the rest of the run, anytime that I encountered a group of people blocking the entire course, I would loudly yell “PLEASE MOVE TO YOUR RIGHT IF YOU ARE NOT RUNNING” while keeping as far left as I could.

I probably had to yell at least 20 to 30 times and some people got out of the way, while others were somewhat upset.   A few runners started pacing behind me since I was able to punch a hole in the crowd with my shouts.  I turned around and loudly said “THANK YOU” to a handful of people who made absolutely no effort to get out of the way or even walk at all.

The reason I’m posting though, is should I send a copy of the texts to this guys wife. I feel like she deserves to know. As sick to my stomach I feel right now, it’s better that not knowing. My wife said that this is between us and I would be an asshole if I ruined their marriage as well. 

I’m not here to know that my wife sucks, I figured that one out. But what I want to know? Would I be the asshole if I sent the texts? I’m pretty sure I’m going to do it.

EDIT: I have said this in a few comments but I figured I would put it here. I do not of pictures of anybody. The pics were sent over Snapchat so thank goodness I didn’t have to see them. I only have text messages back and forth between them talking about what they would do if they were in person and the like. So if I sent anything it would just be a message and I probably would pick one of the less explicit and disgusting ones. Just enough that it’s clear what’s going on.

EDIT2/UPDATE : It has been a week since I found the texts between them. I have since cooled off and now I’m in more of a depressive funk rather than the angry rage from before. But I have decided that I am not going to get in touch with the other mans wife. Some of you said that I would be the asshole if I did it for selfish reasons, some of you said I would actually be the asshole if I didn’t do it because she deserves to know. My reasoning is that I just don’t want to think about it anymore and I’m doing my best to move on. If that makes me selfish and the asshole, so be it.",173,472,0.95
153,Everyone Sucks,"That title probably won't make sense for a second so let me get into it.  I'm in a group of friends that values honesty and tells each other how it is and we like it that way.  

Enter now a relatively new friend who had hung out with our group for about a month.  She begins bragging to us that she's going to start hooking up with a guy who's going to pay her around 3k a month and gifts to sleep with him and hang out with him.  Immediately it gets stated along the lines ""Hey that's prostitution but good for you.""

I feel like I should stress at this point no one planned to jump on a moral high horse, we just said it as it is and intended to move topic.

No go, she's upset that someone would say that and that others would agree so she then takes defense by stating ""Who are you to judge. Like two of you have kids and couldn't keep your dick in your pants so why are you trying to shame me?""

Enter me now who while agreeing with the others before hasn't given much statement to the situation, but being one of said single fathers she attacked I was now upset at the comparison and decided to set it straight.

My rebuttal was along the lines of: ""You're right.  I pay child support and do the best to take care of my child. I take responsibility for my actions.  The thing you don't seem to understand is at the end of the day I can tell my parents and friends and future lover I have a kid and very few people will care.  You can't say the same for banging a guy and getting paid to do it.  Go tell your family or let your future boyfriend know what you've done and see how the rest or sympathize with you.""

154,Not the A-hole,"At my first wedding, my brother proposed to his girlfriend. He didn’t clear it with me or my partner and we were both very upset, as the toasts quickly turned from us to focusing on them and their engagement. His fiancée apologized to us afterwards and said she thought he had okayed it with us. He eventually apologized too under pressure from his fiancée but the damage was done. This was a culmination of a long pattern of attention seeking behavior from my brother. His engagement broke off pretty quickly. My first wife passed away a few years ago.

I am now engaged again to a great woman and we are planning our wedding. My relationship with my brother has improved and he’s gotten some therapy. However, with my wedding coming up, I don’t trust my brother not to go back to his old ways, especially since he once again has a long term girlfriend. It feels like we’re back where we were those years ago, and I’m worried that history will repeat itself. This feeling has compounded by him brushing me off when I tried to sit down with him and tell him he can’t pull that again. I don’t want to invite my brother to my wedding. I don’t want to risk another debacle like that one.

My father is really angry that I don’t want to invite my brother and yelled at me about it. My fiancée is on the fence and is worried that his girlfriend will feel cut off from the family.

155,Not the A-hole,"I'm going to be honest, I've always been good at making myself seem like my model student/good Christian/ perfect child. It's the easiest way to get through life until I'm living on my own. I'm a good liar. I do it a lot.

I'm bisexual, and I'm an atheist. However my parents rule is that I will be going to church as long as I live with them. I'm 16, have a job, and go along with whatever they want me to do as it keeps arguments to a minimum.

Recently I brought a rainbow bracelet to signify pride/support the movement. My parents don't seem to notice anything I wear or do, so I feel fine. However, last Sunday I went to church, and my small groups leader (an obnoxiously friendly and touchy woman) inquired about my bracelet. I just laughed it off- I felt awkward and didn't want to talk about it.

Later, when the service started, the pastor made a strange amount of eye contact with me as he went on the usual invitation, ""If any of you are struggling with any sins- any sin AT ALL, the youth leaders are here to talk to you, and will help you overcome this sin.""

I don't want to overcome anything. I don't want to overcome my girlfriend, or any of my LGBT friends, all of which are viewed as sinful by the church. Previously gay kids have been outed to their parents, the community, etc. At one point the pastor asked 'what is the most disgusting thing in God's eye?' and the adult pastor's son yelled out 'GAY PEOPLE'. The youth pastor's scrambling to correct the statement didn't make me feel any better about the church's stance.

After the service, I didn't come forward, and my small group leader approached me again, essentially telling me that she knows I struggle with same sex attraction and that the bracelet is a way of showing it. I didn't want to deal with the hassle, the arguments, the bullying- so I got manipulative. Really really manipulative. I started crying (something I can do easily on cue), asking her why she would accuse me of such a thing. I even started babbling like I couldn't articulate, and she took me to the next room to calm down, apologizing profusely. I then explained that the rainbow was God's promise to never flood the earth again, and I wear it as a reminder of his gracious promise. It was some churchy-Sunday school-John 3:16 bullshit I came up with on the spot, but she immediately backed down and apologized. The rest of the night I made a point of wiping my eyes, sniffling, generally send a message that I was not feeling well at all. Several of my peers cane up to me after that saying they were sorry that she said that to me, and that they knew I would never hide something as 'disgusting' as that from the rest of them.

And now I feel awful. I feel awful for pretending to be one thing. I feel like I'm disrespecting my community and I feel like I'm disrespecting the people I'm lying to. I've never had any problem lying and manipulating to keep myself safe but now I'm questioning my own character.

AITA here? I really don't know anymore.

161,Asshole,"Recently I went on a trip to Vegas and bought people some small, miscellaneous gifts I thought they might like. I got my eldest daughter (28) and her step-daughter (12) water bottles with gel beads to keep their drinks cool, my youngest daughter (18) a unicorn night light, and my son (20) a joke box-old practical jokes like fake vomit and buzzers. Now, one thing that may be worth mentioning is that my son has Asperger's. And for this, all that means is that it's very easy to tell when he doesn't like something because it's very easy to tell when he does. When he likes it, he is very noticeably excited and extremely grateful. When he doesn't, he's calm and mostly indifferent-though very polite.

He didn't like the joke box, I knew immediately despite the fact he said thank you and accepted it. So I acknowledged that he didn't like it, and apologized for getting him a gift he didn't enjoy. He responded by assuring me he did like it and thanking me again, because, like I said, he's polite. Later my youngest told me she never liked that I did that, and when I pressed she said it was unpleasant when I acknowledged a gift was unwanted. She said it makes the receiver feel guilty and is a quick way to get double gratitude on a present. I told her she had it all wrong, and was overreacting.

My son has moved back in with me last weekend.

The older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

I got a phone call from my son on Saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

I jumped into my car and brought him home. I also yelled at the man and told him I'm calling the cops.

I then called an officer I knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

When we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

So while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

I'm happy he is rid of that predator but I'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

I have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

I hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

164,Not the A-hole,"I’ve lurked on this sub for so long and now I have something to post finally, not as dramatic as some others but I’d still like some feedback. 

I have a very small dog, she’s a rescued tea cup chihuahua who along with some birth defects due to her unfortunate family tree, is also very fearful of children, as a lot of tiny dogs tend to be. Because of this, she can come off as aggressive when kids get too close. It’s not usually a problem, and parents usually understand when I explain why their kid can’t play with my dog. 

My dog is okay with other dogs, of all sizes. She grew up with labs so she knows how to handle herself, regardless when she’s at the dog park I NEVER take my eyes of her. The dog park we go to is great for her because it’s big enough to where she can run around with bigger dogs but still has enough room to keep her distance and move away if she needs to. There’s also a fenced off small dog area, but we rarely use it as there’s usually no one in there. 

We’ve been going to this dog park for years, with no issues. Recently a lady came in with her two daughters, about 5 and maybe 3. I didn’t mind her at first, she said she was new to the neighborhood and her girls just wanted to meet the dogs. When they approached mine, I explained to the kids that they couldn’t play with my dog. The problem is it’s been about a month now, and almost every single time I’ve been there’s, she’s there too. I have to explain to her kids every time that they can’t touch my dog, sometimes multiple times. 

Eventually I talked to the mom about it, she gave me a weird look and said “look, they’re all fine playing together, it’s good for your dog to learn to be around kids anyway.” I briefly explained to her that that’s not how that works, but rather than make it an issue, I took my dog home. The last straw was the last time I was at the dog park, the older girl hopped the fence and fell right on top of another smaller dog, which to their credit they did apologize to the owner for. Not 5 minutes later I see the two girls corner and taunt my dog, who’s growling and barking at them, clearly terrified. The mom sees this too, and rushes over telling me to calm my dog down, and that if my dogs aggressive I should keep it in the fenced area (even though that area is for small dogs, not aggressive ones, who would even bring an aggressive dog to a dog park). 

I snapped, does she have fucking brain damage? Some sort of short term memory loss? I had already told her AND her kids to leave my dog alone. So I let her know all of this, and ended it by reminding her that the dog park isn’t a petting zoo, it’s specifically so that dogs can play freely. If the kids are preventing even one dog from doing so, they shouldn’t be there. There’s plenty of other, probably safer places for her to take her kids. Again, I took my dog and left, but not before she called me a bitch, in front of her kids.. AITA?",299,2284,0.97

166,Asshole,"I think the title says most of the situation.

My partner and me are vegan and want to celebrate our wedding in a way that suits our moral compass.

Some guests are also vegan.

We are planning a buffet style dinner, where the guests are asked to help by bringing something.
Every guest so far was fine with the restriction of vegan food, even though some have to put in extra work (research vegan recipes, try vegan alternatives etc.).

Now comes the catch:
My partner eats cheese since she got pregnant and started getting nauseous from *some* vegan foods. She isn't planning on eating cheese at the wedding. 

Her mother is ecstatic that they ""finally can eat out together again"" (as far as I have noticed they didn't have an issue with that while she was fully vegan).

And now she insists to bring a cheese platter to the wedding.

She asked for our consent first, but I know she would be pissed if we would say no.

My partner told her ok because she doesn't want to fight with her mother, but I am not comfortable with that decision.

Am I the ass hole for not wanting cheese at my otherwise vegan wedding?

167,Not the A-hole,"I've been going to therapy for about six months. My girlfriend of two years has known about it and has been very supportive throughout that time. I use therapy to work on several things, however, I initially decided to go for a very specific reason; something I'd  never said out loud until I told my therapist. 

Last night, my girlfriend said that she felt like I was hiding something from her. I asked her what it was and she said, ""I want you to tell me the reason you decided to start going to therapy."" I said that I wouldn't, considering I'd never discussed that issue with anyone before and I wasn't comfortable talking about it outside of therapy. She got mad and accused me of ""essentially lying"" to her. I told her that the fact that she even knows that there is this issue that I won't discuss (even though she doesn't know what it is) is already much more knowledge than the vast majority of people in my life have about the issues I'm dealing with. She said that what I tell other people doesn't matter to our relationship and that we should be 100% open and honest with each other. I responded that I am 100% open and honest, except for this one thing which, again, I have literally only ever discussed with my therapist. She goes on to say that ""it's a lie of omission,"" and if I can't tell her and ""be 100% transparent"" then she doesn't think we are compatible. I asked if that was a threat and if she was making me choose between the boundary I've decided to set for myself (another issue I've been working on) and our relationship. She said, ""I'm not making you choose, but what you decide to do will have repercussions for us.

Mom is ok with us having sex since she knows that she can’t stop it but wants us to tell her when it happens so she can make sure we have enough condoms and stuff to stay safe. He yelled at us to get dressed and come downstairs. He then kicked my boyfriend out and sat me down at the kitchen table to scream at me some more. I couldn’t get a word in edgewise. After being screamed at for about 30 MINUTES, I snapped. I yelled at him that he has not been a part of my life for almost 6 years. Hasn’t even made an effort to give a damn birthday card on my birthday. He doesn’t get to all of a sudden decide to become a parent again whenever he feels like it.

The woman who comes normally brings one or two people to help. In the beginning, they were doing a really great job. Then for a while, the main woman wasn’t coming and she was sending her employees. They were not doing as well a job as her. They weren’t pulling back furniture to clean behind, sometimes they’d skip rooms all together, etc. I tried talking to them, but nothing was getting done, so I went to their boss. She was very apologetic and suddenly, she was coming back with them. She explained that she was expanding her business and taking on more employees, but it didn’t excuse anything. I accepted it.

Today, they came back, the boss and one of her helpers. The boss was upstairs and the helper was in the kitchen. This helper was one in the past that hadn’t done a good job. I was in the playroom with the kids (I move them from room to room as needed so the people can clean), when suddenly I heard talking. At first, I thought it was the boss and the helper, but then I realized it was just the helper. I went into the kitchen and found she was on the phone. She wasn’t working, just leaning against the counter with all the supplies spread out. It didn’t seem to be an important call, she seemed to be making plans for tonight.

I didn’t interrupt the call, but I waited until she was done and I asked her to please not take calls while she was working at my house. She got defensive and I said, it was just a simple request. I didn’t say this part, but honestly, if she had done a better job in the past, then maybe I wouldn’t care, as they don’t charge by the hour, just a flat rate.

She leaps to serve their every whim, and they have a strong entitlement mindset now. She jumps through hoops to make them happy and they don't consider her at all. Her useless husband is fine with this as long as nobody disturbs him from playing video games. But if they try to make these demands on him instead of her then he starts yelling. 

She serves them dinner and sits down to eat, but she herself can't eat for at least 20 minutes bc they demand she heat their food more or cool it down over and over, get them a different cup because they don't like that one, get them a different drink, etc. And they fight each other over the pettiest s*** like who got the better fork or who got more milk when there was no difference.

So my friend had surgery and she won't be able to lift her arms for weeks. She can't wash herself so I came over to wash her. KEY FACT she can't lift her arms AT ALL so if something fell on her she couldn't stop it.

The way I had to wash her was she was lying in the tub and I had to get in the tub with her.

The kids burst into the room squawking and fighting because they wanted to ""help."" Shoving each other in the bathroom. I told them to leave us alone for 10 minutes and then we'd be done. They had a huge tantrum so my friend said let them stay in the bathroom.

But they started insisting they had to get IN the tub and ""help."" it was already really hard to wash my friend at the angle of the tub and the tight space but she said they could one at a time.

But then they started fighting over who could go first and shoving each other right over the tub.

Like I said in my friend can't lift her arms so if either of them had landed on her she wouldn't have been able to block it. They would have busted her stitches and she might have had to go to the emergency room.

I kicked them the f*** out and yelled at them that they weren't behaving, then I locked them out the door and they sobbed.

177,Asshole,"We work at a warehouse, and this coworker girl and I ended up on the same line that day. She and I were assigned to put products in boxes together. Someone started talking to her as soon as we started. This slowed her down to almost to a stop for a good 45 seconds, which is pretty long when you have to keep up with the machine, and I had to do double the work during that time. I hollered at her twice and told her to “Quit talking and start working.” Her boyfriend (also working the same line) went up to her and tried to help her, but the other person left, so she picked up the pace.

The products we were working on were relatively new to us. They have to go in the box a certain way, but she and I were putting them in two different ways. The manager wasn’t around at the time to ask, but knowing I have more work experience (1yr vs 6 mo.), I thought I had a better chance of being correct. 

I went up to her and told her she’s doing things wrong and told her how I was putting them in. She usually listens but this time she didn’t. I was already irritated from earlier, and this disrespectful behavior added to the frustration. I dumped the box in front of her out and showed her how I’d put them in. “Do you get it now, yes or no?” I asked. She gave me a sigh and looked irritated but kept silent. 

Her BF butts in yet *again*, offering to switch positions with her. I tell him he needs to leave her alone because she’s a grown adult that needs to learn how to speak up for herself and do her own job.

 She puts the products *back in the box the exact same way she was doing before*, deliberately ignoring me. Out of anger and panic we’ll make the line stop, I grabbed the box (to stop her) and said;

“Hello? Do you not understand English!?”

To this she yells even louder than me:

“DO YOU THINK YOU’RE AUTHORITY, RACIST!?”

And started to cry. Her BF, still playing knight, told me I need to ”leave her alone”. The manager comes and talks to her. During this time another coworker talks to me, and for the first time, I found out she is half Asian, half white, and English is her 2nd language. She looks caucasian. Obviously if I knew this I wouldn’t have said what I said, and I said it ironically because her English is fine.

Later I found out from the manager that: 1) the person talking to her was asking for help, 2) she was putting the products in right (but didn’t tell me), 3) she wasn’t speaking because she thought I’m “aggressive” and didn’t want to explode.

My husband says I should at least apologize for at least the “English” comment or else people will think I’m racist. I, however, believe this entire situation could have been avoided if she spoke up for herself, and the comment wasn’t actually racist, but a common sarcastic remark.

179,Not the A-hole,"I got through my bachelors on a full ride scholarship because I graduated valedictorian. My parents didn’t pay for housing or tuition or textbooks, just my monthly allowance. However, I tried to decrease their costs by working multiple jobs. Granted, they did pay for my insurance and phone bill but I paid for my outings with friends. They paid for my credit card when I couldn’t pay it off, which did add up towards the end of my schooling due to graduation costs and licensure exams, etc.

Now that I got a job in the field they had pushed me towards, they are telling me that I have to start paying for my siblings’ schooling. Although my sister is motivated, my brother is absolutely not. He doesn’t participate in extracurricular activities and lacks interest in academics. He just sits at home and watches tv and plays video games with his friends. At one point, he confided in me that he goes out with his friends and does drugs. When he got his report card, he got a D in English. Anyway, he was not as driven as I was when I was in school. 

I told my parents that I am not paying for my siblings if they do not put in the effort into their schooling. I have consistently offered my advice to my siblings and tutoring and they consistently ignore me. 

I did tell my sister that I would pay for her textbooks and some of her tuition because I know she’s actually studying and looking for a job.

Now, my parents are pissed saying that I am selfish because they did pay for my allowance throughout my undergraduate schooling.

AITA for refusing to pay for my siblings?

EDIT: the reason I ask is because it’s fairly typical in my culture for the eldest sibling to support younger siblings in their education. I am deviating from cultural norms. My friends think I’m a selfish asshole that I would rather spend my earnings on travel and self-care",28,94,0.94

183,Not the A-hole,"So in my family when you get a job it's your responsibility to pay for certain stuff like your own clothes, phone bill, school supplies, etc. We considered it more of a mutual understanding among us since we have our own money we should pay for our own stuff to some extent. My mom would sometimes buy us certain clothes when she is out doing errands but we have to pay her back after ofc. My mom decides to buy my brothers some socks and underwear for myself. The problem was I already bought myself some boxers a few days prior so I told my mom I didn't want them bc I didn't want to pay for more clothes. Some more context is that I recently bought a bunch of clothes and school supplies as well on top of the boxers and I don't want underwear since I prefer to wear boxers. My mom demanded I pay her for the underwear but I told her I didn't need any more clothes and I'm not gonna pay for something I didn't want in the first place.

One time at a party, I got drunk and hooked up with a senior (also a senior). She told me she was on birth control so I didn’t use a condom. 

Fast forward to seven months ago. She DMs me and asks to meet up at the park in the neighbourhood. She tells me she’s three months pregnant. Was disappointed in myself honestly but manned up and told her I’d support her through the pregnancy. 

My parents were disappointed as well but we began to prepare for the baby and started taking parenting classes. During one of these classes, the instructor was talking about birth. I cannot STAND blood, looking at other people’s body parts. No way.

I told the girl that i would not be able to watch the birth and said I’d be able to stand next to her and hold her hand but I would not be able to look down there. She completely understood and said it’s fine and said she felt the same way.

We got a phone call from her dad, telling us her water broke. We rushed to meet her at the hospital and as I’d said, I stood next to her and held her hand and thankfully did not see any blood or her vagina.

Her mother looked unimpressed as the contractions were being timed and kept huffing. My mom asked her if she was alright and her mom said, “Why won’t your son just go and see the crowning later?”

I immediately tensed. Do not want to see that. The girl said it was fine and that i didn’t want to. Her mother called me a ‘pussy’ and proceeded to say ‘you’ve seen it before, this is why we’re here!’ and ‘you either see the crowning of your child’s head or you stand outside.’

I felt very uncomfortable and everyone just fell silent after that.

189,Not the A-hole,"My wife had bad PPD after our first was born two years ago and was on antidepressants for a long time. If she stopped taking them, she'd fall into a deep depression and our relationship suffered. A mutual friend suggested some research chemicals to her and my wife gave it a try. She uses 4-aco-dmt, as far as I understand an analog for psilocybin mushrooms.

She did it once and stopped taking her antidepressants and she was fine. She was fine for about two months before it slowly began to creep back into her life. So she took 4-aco-dmt again, and again, her anxieties and stresses were gone for months. She never kept this from me, she was open and honest about it. And she has no desire to try any other drug or research chemical.

Now once every 3-4 months, she'll take a day to herself while I manage our child the whole day and she'll just take this drug. Her dose is about $10 every 3-4 months when antidepressants were costing us hundreds a month. And she's fine: she's no different than if she were on antidepressants, in fact, it looks like she's doing better than ever on them. Her behavior hasn't changed, her mood is improved. Honestly I feel like this drug does whatever antidepressants do but last a lot longer.

So far nothing bad has happened of it, but obviously self medicating is a risky thing in and of itself. I've been enabling her because I know the benefit it's providing to her and by extension our relationship.

I broached the topic to a friend who can keep things in confidence and he thinks I'm an asshole for enabling her drug use. Even if I explain it all as I have in this thread, he thinks *I'm* being abusive by condoning it. Some part of me does feel slimy, but if it works, it works, right?

I right away felt the atmosphere was different then with other employees I’ve trained. We had a fair bit in common and both seemed to enjoy talking to each other and getting to know each other. I quite like this girl and was planning on asking if she wanted to hang out outside of work. But when I came into work yesterday I found out that she had been let go. At first I thought it was a shame and wouldn’t have done anything more as I had no way to contact her. 
But on leaving work I noticed her file was left out in the open (a manager dropped it) and giving it back I took a photo of her contact number (I don’t have access to the files normally, I also took the photo on a whim I’ve never done anything like that before). 
I’ve been wondering if I should message her and ask if she wants to meet up as either friends or a date but I don’t want to seem creepy or stalker like.

191,No A-holes here,"A couple weeks ago, my best friend’s boyfriend’s father died of a massive heart attack. Nobody saw it coming as bf’s dad was in generally good health. It’s a relatively new relationship. They’ve been together for maybe two and a half months, haven’t been serious at all. She caught him making date plans with another girl and she’s told me about different guys she’s tried to flirt with during this “relationship”. After her bf’s dad died, she’s been crazy in love with him and has decided he’s her soulmate. 

She’s obsessed with the fact that he “needs” her and thinks this whole thing is super romantic.  She loves that she’s finally meeting his family and friends and that they just adore her. She loves that he calls more frequently. Every time I ask how they are doing, it’s always lots of hearts and heart eye emojis because she thinks the relationship is taking off. She’s missing the point that I’m asking how he’s coping with the loss and how she’s doing with taking care of him. 

And it honestly just makes me sick. I’ve seen other friends lose parents and have had to help them through the loss. There’s absolutely nothing romantic/ cute/ adorable about losing a parent. I honestly want to ask her if she even remembers  that someone actually lost their life.  How she interacts with her boyfriend and his family is obviously none of my business but when she’s nonstop romanticizing this in conversations with me, would I be the asshole if I told her how much it bothers me and to cut it out?

Edit: just want to make it clear that it’s her conversations with me and me only that bother me. When she speaks to me, she’s gushing about how romantic it is that he’s emotional and “needs” her. I don’t think (and don’t care) she’s acting like that with him. I just, friend to friend, don’t want to hear anymore about “omg this is so romantic, he NEEDS me!” When someone just died.",40,155,0.93

These are weak justifications

* I pay the rent/mortgage so I can make all the rules
* I pay the internet bill so I can turn off the wifi whenever I feel like it

195,Not the A-hole,"I am a mid 20's male PhD student. About three to four days ago, I started having some pain in my left testicle, but it was somewhat mild so I simply ignored it. Over time it persisted and became slightly worse - I don't have to walk funny, but I do need to sit down gingerly, have been avoiding working out, etc. Yesterday I began Googling my symptoms, and I became concerned that I could be experiencing testicular torsion, which is a medical emergency that needs to be dealt with immediately; one particular statistic I came across - that if testicular torsion goes untreated for more than 24 hours, there is a <10% chance the testicle can be saved - scared me quite a bit, as at this point I'd been having symptoms for several days.

I call my university's medical center, and they tell me to come in ASAP. Over the phone, they ask if I have a preference for the gender of my doctor, and I tell them I have no gender preference but that I would like to have a third person present in the room during the genital exam. They say this is fine, and that I will be seeing Dr. LastName. They say nothing of the doctor's gender. I drive over as fast as I can, and when I check on the iPad, the receptionist comes over and pulls me aside. 

She explains that there is an issue with the doctor not wanting to see me. At this point, I'm both scared and growing confused with her evasive explanations about why Dr. LastName doesn't want to see me. Eventually another doctor - not Dr. LastName - hears our conversation and comes over. She explains that Dr. LastName is a woman, and that she feels uncomfortable examining male genitalia. Together, the receptionist and the doctor tell me that techinically I can force the issue given that I have an appointment, but that it would be better for everyone's comfort if I just wait for the next male doctor to be available. I protest a bit, explaining that I'm worried about time being an issue, but eventually I feel bullied by the 2v1 scenario into acquiescing. I end up waiting for \~30 minutes to see the next available male doctor, who says it's likely not torsion but schedules an ultrasound for Monday just to be sure. 

I've since been growing increasingly uneasy about the issue with Dr. LastName not wanting to see me. I've looked up Dr. LastName, and she is a late 40's doctor, practicing locally for >20 years with a clinical focus in family medicine; my university contracts with her and other local doctors to meet students' general healthcare needs. Given the routine nature of genital exams (I had these regularly in my teens for sports), the doctor's stated clinical focus, and potentially urgency of my symptoms, I've been increasingly feeling that I should report her and/or this incident (to whom I'm not sure yet, perhaps my university or some external medical board?).

My SIL doesn't like me, I tried my best at first to get on her good side, but everything I did was never good enough. I stopped trying long ago to get her to like me and after my daughter was born, I'm pretty sure she hated me even more.  

My daughter (10) and I are very close, we do everything together and sometimes she'll give me a peck on the lips and I thought that was normal for parents and kids to do. Apparently my SIL thinks it's gross that I still kiss my daughter on the mouth.

Just yesterday she came over to visit my wife but it was just me and my girl home, wifey was out picking something up. When SIL arrived, I made a joke about her not being melted because it was raining and she told me not to teach my daughter to disrespect her Aunt, but all I said was to my girl was ""See, not everybody has a sense of humour."" which she laughed at and then she decided to go play some games in her room. BUT before she ran off, she quickly gave me a kiss and left. I noticed her face (SIL) had a ""WTF?"" look on it, she then said ""You still kiss her on the mouth? That's pretty creepy.""

I thought she was joking at first but I realized very quickly that she wasn't, WTF was she going on about?!?! I told her she was being a idiot and that if she had her own kids, she would understand. She then said something so idiotic and offensive to me (every parent would be offended by what she said) ""It's just kinda something you'd see a p*** do, adult man kissing a young girl, it's very creepy."" I thought my head was going to explode.

I very quickly lost it at her, I told her to get out of my house and to never come back, I couldn't believe she actually said that. She tried to play it off like it was a joke, that is something you just never say to a parent. I called her many names in a very short amount of time and forced her out of the house, I was seeing red. When my wife got home, I quickly told her everything she said, and I think she was more angry then I was. SIL came back to the house and she (wife) laid into her, she was never welcomed back into our house, she was out of our lives. I'm glad we never have to deal with her anymore.

SIL started to act like the victim on facebook and told everyone, that she just made a simple innocent joke and that we overreacted, MIL/FIL are both on our side once we explained what she said. But there is still a very small amount of people saying, we can't cut out family because of a joke. Fuck that, family doesn't make ""jokes"" like that.

Let's just get this out of the way - I don't like her that much. We are not alike at all! Normally, I just brush it off, smile, whatever, because she is my husband's sister. But I feel like she has gone too far this time by showing up at our picnic wearing a shirt that had a silhouette of Jesus on the cross and says ""Nailed it."" I understand not everyone is religious. I do not push my religion on her or anyone else. But this is too much.

This isn't the first time we have had religious disagreements.  She is CLEARLY anti-religion and likes offensive jokes, but like I said, I'd normally just brush it off. But to come into my home with a shirt that is so disgusting? I've had it. I told her she needs to leave and if she wants to ever come back, she will not EVER wear that shirt again. She just kind of laughed, which makes me so much angrier.

Some of the people there (mainly my family) agree that it was super distasteful. My husbands other sister is neutral, or just not saying anything, whatever. But the kicker is my husband says I am over-reacting. Ok, so say SIL was a vegan (she's not, but I can't think of any other comparison right now), say she was and I show up at her place with murdered animals on my shirt. Would that be okay?? AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT because people are saying I am controlling: She does this type of stuff in subtle ways, but I cannot justifiably say it is BECAUSE I am religious. She would have the offensive jokes and her opinions regardless (I don't care what her or anyone's own opinions are, to be clear).  To me, this was just like displaying it right there and it is different than just ""Jesus isn't real"" or something, you know? THIS HAS BEEN A CULMINATION of it all, and it felt very disrespectful. So while I will believe some of you when I say I come across as controlling, please understand that I have been very patient with her for YEARS.

Edit 2: Many YTA judgements are using my religion and beliefs to somehow justify that i am an AH.

1. This is not what the issue is, at all. I have clearly stated multiple times that the difference of belief is NOT offensive to me.
2. Say i was Jewish and she came up in a Hitler shirt, cool or no? Same type of aggression, imo.
3. Using someone's beliefs against them, like what many are doing here, is an AH thing to do, and also ironic considering you accuss me of that, all in the same breath.

Edit 3 because so much making shit up, I swear. Some comments using her age and the fact I've known her for years as me being ""intolerant"". How old do you think I even am? I'm 11 months older than her!

4: seriously. What religion is it OK for me to compare this to? Can't compare to Judaism. Just even mentioning it, now I'm the AH. Yet it is perfectly fine to talk poorly about Christianity? Why the double standard? I have done nothing to SIL, or anyone here, using my beliefs negatively. 

***
People have been attacking every single comparison I make, so who cares at this point. Take literally anything offensive, put it on a T-shirt, and wear it around someone with intent to offend.

Thanks for the reasonable YTA judgements, the ones that are actually relevant to the situation. Seriously.

Well, I guess they have been teaching their 12 year old daughter (my niece) about religion and she kind of cornered me with a question. I went in the house to refill my water bottle and she said ""Hey, Uncle bender750, you believe in god... right?"".

I came out of my room today to see some of my family in the living room chatting, and I joined in. My mother started telling me about how my brother in law was planning a trip/vacation for us, and she asked me if I wanted to go. So I said 


“Seems nice! I might not want to though, depends on when the trip is, or if I feel up to it”

Then my BIL spoke up


“Oh you’ll come! We’ll tie you up and bring you with us whether you like it or not!”
queue laughter from my mother

Even though I felt slightly uncomfortable at the joke, I replied  “That’s what the police are here to prevent, though”


He replied with “You can’t tell em if I drug you before!”
mother continues to laugh at this...


this kinda went on in this general gist for around 30 seconds, after which I told him “Hey, I’m really not finding those jokes funny and they’re making me feel uncomfortable”

After which he said “Oh I’m not joking! I’m serious!”, and more laughter from mom


I just kinda paused for a bit and said “...Okay”, and excused myself into the kitchen.


That was the end of it. Around three hours later, I came out of my room again exclusively to go to the kitchen. Coincidentally, this was when my dad came home, and so he was sitting with my BIL having a conversation. I simply walked past, and I was about to enter the kitchen, my BIL called me name.


Me: Yes?


BIL: Careful what you eat! Else you might fall asleep and wake up in another country!”


Me:...Again, I really don’t find these jokes funny


BIL: Again, not a joke!


Me:....Okay..(enters kitchen).


That was the end of that


Later, I was talking to my mom, and this was brought up.


Me: I really didn’t feel comfortable hearing these jokes


Mom: It’s just banter! You need to lighten up. 


Me: I get that, but I told him I didn’t like the jokes and he kept going.


Mom: Nobody expects that someone would be so sensitive to banter. You’re the one who’s not normal, he was normal and was just joking around and being friendly.


Me: Again, I told him I didn’t like the jokes. I understand why he wouldn’t have expected me to feel uncomfortable, but he kept going even after I told him I felt uncomfortable at these jokes.


Mom: You’re odd. Your feelings are all warped and you feel bad over the stupidest things, he did nothing wrong and you need to lighten up.



Then I felt inclined to write this. I don’t know what to think honestly, I know he’s just making jokes that are just not tasteful in my personal opinion, and it’s okay if he likes making these jokes, I just don’t like hearing them as it gives me a very bad feeling in my gut. I being sensitive? And was I wrong in telling my BIL to keep his jokes at bay?


EDIT: Thank you all so much for confirming what I was thinking and reminding me that my feelings matter and that my sense of judgement isn’t completely off like my family made it out to be.

At dinner the subject of baseball movies came up and we all mentioned some of our favorite movies.

We didn’t have any plans after dinner, so we decided to go back to my place to watch Major League.

She goes on this long rant and says she can’t believe we like this movie and there’s nothing funny about the thousands of Native Americans that were killed.

I am an auditor. The client my colleagues and I are auditing is situated in a place that doesn’t have clean drinking water and as a result we have to rely on plastic bottles for our water. 

Now the thing about audits is that they’re very time intensive and we spend a lot of time in the same place and create A LOT of waste in the process. I’m talking about half empty containers  of food dozens and dozens of plastic bottles and so and so littered all over the audit room after a long day. 

To help curb this problem I take it upon myself to gather anything being wasted and take it home to make food for my dogs. I also make tea for myself using the water bottles by pouring the bottles out into an electric kettle to boil them. Since there’s a lot of water I end up making a lot of tea and people are more than welcome to come drink and they do. 

This morning some of my co workers saw me emptying bottles into the kettle and were absolutely mortified claiming I was making tea with contaminated water. I tried explaining that boiling should kill any germs they were afraid of but they claim that it’s still unsanitary and boiling wouldn’t kill everything. Although our manager didn’t make a big fuss about it she did tell me that doing such could be seen as “facilitating an unsanitary work environment” and next time I should just let the cleaners do their job as the audit room is always spotless the next day. 

I understand that different people have different standards for hygiene but I think most would agree that unless someone has a viral infection, boiling the water should make it fine.

207,Not enough info,"I wanted to get a custom Harry Potter themed portrait done for my friends and their 2 kids. I posted on Reddit asking for potential artists and found a girl whose style I really liked. I reached out, told her I was looking for a theme where my friends and their kids would be dressed in the wizarding clothes, have Hogwarts in the background, etc. She said she loved the idea and was super excited to get started!

She sends me her first draft (super rough sketch) but I said I didn't love it because the people were so small you couldn't really see them all that well. I sent her an example of one I'd seen on Etsy and said I wanted something along the lines of this, where the people are the main focal point, and Hogwarts in the background. She said sure, no problem!

A couple weeks later she sent me the final portrait and the people look *nothing* like my friends and their kids, but I really loved the rest of it! Hogwarts, the wands, their clothes, etc. It was literally just their faces that I'm so disappointed in. She said she'd rework it, sent me the new one, and same thing - they look nothing like them. I said I really don't want to spend more money, but if she felt like she could do something different and not have them be the main focal point so it's easier to capture their essence I'd be willing to pay more. She just keeps saying ""it's really out of her comfort zone"" and it's not really her style. I paid good money for something that I now will never give my friends because I'd feel embarrassed. I understand in art there will be some variation , but I could ask everyone who knows my friends ""who are these people in the painting?"" and 10/10 would not know. If it's too far out of her comfort zone and she can't do what I asked, I think she should have turned down the job.

So, WIBTA if I tried to get my money back via a dispute? I know PayPal has a disclaimer about handmade/custom items not being disputable, but I work for a company that makes handmade items and we've lost disputes before.

EDIT: People seem to think I asked her replicate the Etsy image because this girl would have been cheaper than Etsy and that is not true, I literally paid the exact same amount for this girl as I would have on Etsy. I only sent her the Etsy image because it was roughly the idea I wanted and I wanted her to put her own twist on it, which she did and I loved her result of the background/wizarding garb she did. The faces are my big hang up.

I wanted to try and find a more local person/someone who didn't have a well established Etsy shop just to support people who weren't where they wanted to be yet in their career. I have definitely learned my lessons as far as communicating my expectations, asking for previous portrait comparisons, and splitting the payments.

208,Not the A-hole,"This happened a while ago. I live in a small town and I would park my car outside on the street near my unit as there was a section paved so that our unit block could park safely. There was a small tree that would provide some semblance of shade in late afternoon, but not enough to cool your car down. I would leave enough room for my neighbour to park her car behind me (but she usually used her garage).

After living in my units for a couple of months, I saw a car parking near mine. After a while I noticed they were parking directly in front of me no matter how much room I left behind me. Annoying? Yeah, but I could deal with it. I thought it was another person from my unit block but a neighbour from across the road saw that was someone who worked at a nearby hotel/bed and breakfast. There was staff parking at the hotel and ample room on the other side of the road.

This car started getting closer and closer to mine, within about 50cm (council rules state cars should be parked 1 metre away). My previously mentioned neighbour and his wife said they had witnessed the person reverse parking near my car, got out to check the distance and reversed even closer. 

I decided to leave a note on her car asking that she not park that close to my car. She retaliated with a note saying she had parked there for years and that I should be leaving her more room. I fired back by pointing out she didn’t live there and I printed out the local parking laws and a how-to guide (hilarious in my books) and putting it on her car. In order to spite me she parked her car within three inches in front of mine. I had enough and called the parking ranger to have a chat and they agreed to come out and look at it. They called me later that day and said it was ridiculous, leaving a note on her windshield to warn her about parking that close to other cars and that she would be liable to any damage. She didn’t park near my car from that point on.

My wife and neighbour thought it was hilarious but my mum was saying it was petty. AITA here?

A bit of back story - I'm a trainee in a foreign country where I do not speak the language. Even with the language barrier we communicate quite well and joke around all the time.

Today during lunch time there was cake in the fridge for people to help themselves. First time I saw it was yesterday, so of course I assumed it was made a day or two before. So I as I was eating my slice my coworkers were laughing and making jokes. Since I don't understand the language I didn't pay attention as it's pretty common. As I was finishing someone told me the cake was made 7 days ago (it tasted perfectly fine and I did not realize) and that's why they're laughing.

I was extremely upset and tried talking to my superior (that was there laughing) why this 'joke' crossed a line as I could have food poisoning, but she brushed it off saying it was not her fault and if I want she can put me with someone else.

So, WIBTA if I went to the head manager about this? I don't want to cause problems if they really didn't mean bad, but also I don't want this to happened again to someone else as there are many trainees not speaking the language.",35,28,0.94
211,Not the A-hole,"So, I'm pretty new to Reddit so sorry if my formatting is bad,

So, 2 months ago, I decided I needed to try to lose weight after seeing a picture of myself about to run a 5k trail? I forgot what it was.

My mom was recently overweight from having my baby brother and not having the time to lose the weight as she works 6, sometimes 7, days a week as a night shift nurse. Sometimes she would say to me that we needed to lose weight and that we needed to hit the gym, but of course, no plans were made.

I tried not to tell my family about how I was trying to lose weight, but ofc, they soon found out. My mom was offended that I decided not to invite her to join me even though we have to different schedules. I told her that I prefer to do it alone, especially because when I did it with her, she made no effort to do the moves right and such.

We then go into an argument and she told me that I was selfish and not family oriented, that I have to help and that I have no choice in the matter. I told her that I could help her a little like giving her the information she needs but I would not be making her meals or detox drinks and etc.

Now, whenever I tell her I'm fasting, she always tell me to just eat and it doesn't matter and even has tries to force me to eat meat even though I've told her I'm a pescatarian. It's tiring and I wish that she didn't do it.

214,Not the A-hole,"Okay so here goes.

My boyfriend and I have a 10 month old son who is the light of our lives. I am a stay at home mom, and he works to support us. He helps out with the baby when he gets home, but I handle the night time wake ups when they happen since he has to go to work the next day.

My boyfriend is a SUPER deep sleeper, and I am not. He used to set his alarm himself but he would let it ring for over 10 minutes every morning making me wake up wayyy sooner than necessary and then I’d be grumpy because I have to wake him up even though he set an alarm. To avoid this routine I offered to start setting the alarm for him, waking him up and then going back to sleep myself. (My phone vibrating wakes me up, the alarm makes my skin crawl.)

This worked out great for a few weeks with no issues at all, but then this morning I could NOT get him to wake up. The alarm went off at 6:20, I shake him and say time to get up. He mumbles at me “not yet” so I set another alarm for 6:30 and go back to sleep.

Rinse and repeat this 2 more times and it is finally 7.

Now he has to leave for work at 7:35 so he still had enough time to get ready (so I thought) so I wake him up and he starts yelling at me for not waking him up soon enough?! 

After explaining to him that I tried numerous times and I couldn’t get him up he accused me of not even trying! He said “I don’t remember that, just admit you overslept”. So I told him fine, if that’s how it’s gonna be then you can set your own alarm, but if I hear it going off for longer than 5 minutes and you’re not moving I’ll try one time to wake you up before turning it off. 

I’ve tried finding a solution and clearly it’s not good enough. I’m open to any ideas! So WIBTA if I turn off my boyfriends alarm for work when he REFUSES to wake up to it?


EDIT: I just received a text from BF at work apologizing for being a grump this morning and a promise to try to work on it in the future. 

I have decided I will continue to wake him up until we get an alarm that wakes him up gently and naturally with light instead of noise like recommended in this thread.

215,Asshole,"So, today we threw a party for my 5 year old daughter, she turns 6 next week. We had a great time and everyone enjoyed themselves. 

We’ve come home with a mountain of presents and I’m of the opinion that my daughter should wait until her actual birthday to open them. My wife, however thinks this is mean and she should open them today. 

This comes up every Christmas as well, even before we had kids. My wife would want to open a present on Christmas Eve and I would want to wait for Christmas Day. 

Growing up I was always taught to wait until the day before opening presents and on Christmas Day we would spread opening throughout the day. For example, we’d all open one first thing, then another after breakfast and another mid morning. I still believe this spreads the fun throughout the day.

So will I be the asshole if I make her wait a week to open these presents?

EDIT: She has opened the presents and looks like she’s about to pass out from tiredness. She’s had a great day and will have another one next weekend! 

Thanks everyone.

EDIT 2: Just to address a couple of common questions that people asking and other statements.

Why hold the party a week early?
The party is a week early because some of her best friends are out of the country on holiday next week. 

5 year olds don’t even know the date, to her this is her birthday! RAR!
She knows the date, has a calendar and counts down the days to important events, she can tell you how many days until her birthday without looking or counting days. You guys have no idea what a 5-6 year old is capable of.

Presents should be opened at the party, what the hell is wrong with you?
Between me and my wife we have been to a fair few parties over the last few years and none of them have had present opening ceremonies. There just isn’t time. The kids have an hour in the soft play/bouncy castle/painting some pottery. Then 45 mins to eat, sing happy birthday and have a slice of cake, then it’s home time. 

Why would you force this?
I didn’t. My wife stated her opinion, I stated mine. We agreed that she could open the presents she was given today. We have presents from us, her granny and other family members that she will open on her birthday. What I was asking was hypothetical.

Do you still do the Christmas thing?
No. We open all presents on Christmas morning, then we’ll go to family or they’ll come to us and there will be another round of presents. We let the kids open something small on Christmas Eve just before bed, although I’m not a fan. My wife opens something as well, but I do not.

Something no one has asked but I thought relevant. Opening presents throughout the day at Christmas was great. Now I find Christmas is over far too quickly and the kids are ignoring everyone for most of the day and playing with the new toys etc. 
Secondly, there was always a big surprise at the end of the day, this was usually the present from my parents. The anticipation and build up to it made it so much better.

216,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday my boyfriend and I walked home from grocery shopping, we have to walk through a forest with a big lake with ducks and such. Sitting on a bench was a little kid, maybe 6 years old. He was feeding the ducks, with white bread and rather big pieces. He was saying something like ' careful the ducks are on the path' and I felt the need to tell teach him an important thing about feeding ducks. I explained to him in a soft voice that the ducks should not eat white bread, because they get sick of off it. And he should be careful not to make the pieces too big because they might choke on it and die. His father was sitting two benches away and smoking a cigarette, not saying a word. Walking away I said to my boyfriend how I learned about that at a very young age and he had to know. It was for the sake of the kid, I didn't want him to accidentally kill a duck and having to watch it happen.

217,Not the A-hole,"So recently I went on a tour around Europe for a couple of weeks with a group of other 20 something's. There were other tours happening simultaneously with other groups, but with the same tour company.

 One of the destinations was Venice. On the first night in Venice our group decided to walk to the nearest bar/club to continue the drinking sesh. Once there we're all sitting and talking/drinking or dancing. I notice that the other tour group has also decided to come to the bar. In that group is this girl slightly younger than me also from my country (most of the other people are Australians, I'm from NZ). I've talked to her very briefly on another night, basically just introductions.

This happened to be some sort of masquerade party although I and a lot of people hadn't bought masks. So a while after we arrive, I'm sitting at a table minding my own business having a drink cause I'm not drunk enough to start dancing yet . This girl comes up to me and asks if I can help her to put her masquerade mask on. Before I can answer, she says , ""I'm not putting out tonight, by the way"".

I was just confused and said,"" what? Ok. "" 
And helped her. Ngl I was slightly shocked and annoyed that she had the confidence/arrogance to think that I wanted to get with her, for no reason just because I'm a guy. So I just shrug it off and continue drinking and chatting with my group.

A while later myself and the rest of the group are all dancing. All the tunes are coming out, one banger after another. And this girl again sidles up to me and says, ""you're from NZ, right? I'll hit you up when we're both back.""

I was again confused cos I barely know this girl and not super attracted to her. I looked at her and said,"" what makes you think I'm interested in you?""

She kinda just stopped and looked at me sort of shocked. She then laughed and said,""fuck off"" and went away.

220,Not the A-hole,"I'm working as a camp counselor. It's a daycamp but we do one week long sleepaway trip during the last week of July. I have become close to some of my fellow counselors and a group of 5 of us hang out a lot work and some of us get together outside of work. Two in the group are high school seniors and 3 are going to be college freshmen, so we are all 17 and 18 years old. 

There are two people in the group that recently started hooking up. Olivia and Landon. Olivia and I were friends before we started working here. I knew Landon's face because we live near each other and I've seen him around but he went to a different high school so we didn't know each other beforehand. Olivia told me in mid June that she and Landon hooked up. I was somewhat surprised because Landon is black and Olivia's dad is an outspoken racist. She said they fucked at Landon's house and she told her family that she had to stay late at camp. She also said, ""Oh, and the stereotype is not true if you catch my drift."" I told her I didn't and she made a joke about penis size. 

She drives me home since I don't have a car and her and Landon are still having sex. She openly admitted that her dad would kill her if he ever found out and told me not to mention it to my parents or sister because she can't have her dad finding out. I told her I wouldn't tell my family but asked her if Landon knows. She said that he didn't but it wasn't a big deal because it's not like they are getting married and aren't even dating because she ""could never go there with a black guy anyway."" She has made statements in the past about how she would never date a black guy. 

Yesterday Olivia was sick and didn't come to work. I was going to have my parents pick me up from work (they drop me off everyday anyway) but Landon said that he would just do it. When he drove me home I told him what Olivia said. I said that it might not be any of my business but I wanted him to know because it could affect his safety if the dad finds out and that Olivia is making jokes at his expense about being with a black guy. He kind of laughed it off and said that he'll be leaving in August anyway for college and that they are just fucking, not meeting the parents. 

Apparently he had a change of heart and called it off with Olivia. He told her that he knew about her family and her comments and that he couldn't be with someone like that. Now Olivia is pissed at me and the rest of the group is too because they said that I made everything awkward and now the sleepaway trip is going to be ruined because I couldn't keep my mouth shut. AITA?

Edit: Apparently I need to clarify that I'm a girl...

Also, Olivia has made racist comments about blacks in the past. That's why I mentioned that in my title. Part of the reason she ""could never go there with a black guy"" is because of racist stereotypes. She thinks black people will rob her family and doesn't want ""little African babies."" This has all been said by her within the last year.

Edit2: So apparently I shouldn't have made it obvious that I'm a girl. I am not interested in Landon romantically. I think he's a good guy and I will admit that he's attractive, but he is so not my type. I'm am saving myself for marriage (stupid, I know). Landon had a really bad break up senior year and says he's done with relationships. He just wants to have fun which is great for him but not something I would be interested in and knowing he has been with a friend of mine makes him a complete no-go.

My godchild (f31) has accomplished jack shit in her life except having an exceptionally photogenic baby by a dumbass who is in jail awaiting trial for attempted murder (spoiler: he did it). GC is genuinely lovely in appearance and manners, but irresponsible. She spent fifteen (yep, 15) months and every dollar she had - and borrowed a $1000 more - to have a massive, over-the-top baby’s first birthday party, just to impress an old boss. She borrows from everyone to make down payments on expensive things that she always loses (the fancy car at 28% interest, or the too-big-for-a-single-parent home that’s 60% of her monthly income) within three months or so. These setbacks never bother her because she believes in herself and knows that “God” will take care of her. Combined with her love of credit cards and multiple cruises per year, her FICO score is 210, maybe less by now.

GC’s parents spend hundreds of dollars each month on clothes and accessories and photo shoots for the baby. They are all broke as a joke spending money to make sure this baby looks good on the ‘Gram, yet GC turned down several offers of paid baby model gigs from chain and boutique stores out of sheer laziness, even though GC hasn’t worked in 2 years.

I have no children and make good money, so they keep trying to force a relationship between me and the baby. I try to stay away; however, last month I  offered to set up a college fund and a modest trust fund for the child. 

GC just got the idea to start a (copycat) line of baby clothes and accessories. As usual, she sent a sunny little group text to her family and friends proclaiming her faith that “God” will provide thousands of dollars to start her internet business.  


While I wouldn’t donate $5000 towards the criminal defense lawyer for baby daddy (his alibi is SO stupid!), my spouse did give money for the security deposit on the most recent house GC lost, and I sent a payment on a more affordable car that, like the previous luxury car, ended up getting repossessed. Her business startup text made me angry; I responded in the group texts with some harsh truths about her lack of research, experience, or reliability.

GC’s parents furiously rebuked me for denigrating their daughter’s faith and business potential. I responded in the group texts with my opinion of their parenting skills.  In the end, I withdrew my offer to set up a trust and college fund for the baby because I believe they will raise this kid to be spoiled and useless. GC took it all in stride because of course she did. GC’s parents and their siblings stopped speaking to me. I have no other family so I feel badly about this.

230,Not the A-hole,"Sorry about the formatting.

I am 22(f), I live in a small apartment complex in the north eastern part of the US and recently moved here almost a year ago for work. About a month and a half ago I got new neighbors that live across the hall from me. They’re nice people and I’ve had nothing more than polite conversations with them and turns out their 2-3yo son loves me as well as their newborn. The only problem is, is that I’m almost sure he’s dealing out of their apartment. 

Let me clear this up by saying I have nothing against smoking weed since it’s not my business. However, the problem I do have is the amount they smoke. My apartment smells like pot about 12 hours out of the day and no matter how much air freshener I use it will not go away. It has gotten to the point to where my clothes smell like weed when I go to work and I work for the government so naturally I can’t smoke and when I show up smelling like smoke I’m the number one suspect. 

My boss has actually pulled me aside and confronted me about this odor and I have explained it’s not me. However if this keeps happening I’m worried they will get involved. 

I don’t want to go to the property manager since I’m worried they might lose their apartment because weed is not legal here. I am also afraid to confront the male because of the people that come to his apartment. On a daily basis I see about 20-30 people come empty handed, leave with small bags and smelling like pot. All of them look really sketchy and I am afraid that I will be targeted since I’m the only neighbor they see daily. My upstairs neighbors have already filed a complaint about it and moved out since he is also a government employee. 

I have tried to live this out until my lease is up in October but I’m worried that I will be in bad standings with my job. AITA for going to my property manager? Do I have enough to break my lease? Should I be concerned he’s dealing and smoking around a small child and a newborn? Should I stay out of it? TYIA reddit xo

232,Not the A-hole,"My friend works in a casino, yesterday she told me that one client who won a couple of grand did not leave a tip. She was furious, and I told her that I don't think that she should expect to receive a tip, after all this is the clients money, besides I don't think that her job requires a tip at all (she did not contribute in any way to this win). She got really angry with me told me that I am disrespecting her and her job etc, that of course it is expected of them to give a tip because they are winning big money and that she deserves a tip because she is working long hours and do I know how tough the job can get.  My opinion is that your salary is what you should expect to receive (this is what you deserve) a tip is a bonus. If we take an example from school - if you complete your task 100% you should expect to receive a good grade, sometimes your parents for one reason or another might buy you a gift (a bonus) for the good work that you have done, its the same with this - you should expect to receive your salary (this is what you get for doing your job) but a tip is a bonus. She might want to receive a tip but she should not expect it and think that she deserves it, after all the client does not care how hard you work or if you had a tough day.

EDIT: her official job description is a croupier, however its a very small casino and they do not have any live games (only slots), so essentially what she does is to put money in the machine and bring drinks if they ask for one. The casino is also in Bulgaria - in the casinos here clients do not pay for food or drinks no matter how much money they have to play with.

SECOND EDIT: I'm not saying that she is not doing a good job or that in most cases they receive tips, what I'm saying is that she should not expect it and get furious about it.

TLDR:

Told my friend that only because a client won big money does not mean that she should expect receive a tip - she was furious and told me that I disrespect her.",25,46,0.89

235,Not enough info,"TL;DR - Younger sister is an absolute asshole and nobody wants to be around her.

A somewhat ranty post, forgive me.

My younger sister is 26 this year and is currently homeless, and will probably be homeless for a good while. Every place she has stayed in she has gotten kicked out of for 1 reason or another. Her recent place she lasted a week, making it her 7th place this year.

She has mental illnesses but is not properly addressing them.

She was the reason why my mum had to sell her house despite everybody else in the families best efforts to keep the house.

She causes issues wherever she goes and refuses to contribute more than the bare minimum and would happily watch everybody else struggle while she sits at home being a couch potato.

She borrows money and never EVER repays the debt.

&#x200B;

Her current situation involves her going out all day then at night she sneaks into my fathers garage to sleep.

I am looking at getting my own place to live with my mum to give my older sister some space with her family. There's a good chance my younger sister is going to try and live with us (my mum and myself).

&#x200B;

Feel free to ask questions and I'll answer them as quickly as I can.

&#x200B;

Update: Based on the responses I've spoken to my mum about all of this. I've told her that if my younger sister does move in, she HAS to go to school to get some sort of formal education. She cannot sit around making excuses. Her life at the moment is a complete mess, even if she had a place to stay she wouldn't do anything to improve unless forced to.

My mum agrees that if (and when) she moves in with us, my younger sister will need to find a job or go to school.

236,Asshole,"So a buddy of mine named T told me that he believes another friend of mine named K is becoming a father. 

K's girlfriends mom posted something on FB saying some stupid corny shit about how she's going to be a grandmother. So I called K and just straight up asked him, he said yes but not to tell anyone.

Our friend group have known each other for about 11 years so we are all very close. Yesterday friend M and his girlfriend B and I went to the beach. B was asking me if I knew anything about if K's gf was pregnant because she also saw the FB post and had noticed that K's gf didnt drink at any of the past events. All I said is ""I can't answer that."" I've lied before about much smaller things but apart of me really wanted to tell them. They assumed because I can't answer that it is true, I never confirmed it and switched the subject.

M and B told K's gf that if she needed any help or just needed someone that they would be there for her. 

K msged me telling me how he can't trust me with any of his secrets, which I rebuttaled by saying that he didnt tell me it and that T and I had to figure the shit out on our own.

this happend a while ago but I'm dwelling on it and I'm unsure if I'm the ass. mum was mad for a week because of this incident so idk. 

so this new movie had come out and mum wanted the family to go, this included my cousin and her 3 kids me my younger brother and 2 sisters and mum and dad. mum booked all the tickets and told me the date ect. 

I overheard her mention 3d glasses and so I asked her if it was a 3d movie, turns out that she decided to pick 3d veiwing time for the movie. I was crushed as I knew i would be unable to see it. 

I cant put them on top of my glasses as it hurts my head (both of the glasses squish my head) and if I forgo my actual glasses I cant watch the movie. 

so I told mum that I cant go to the movie, she got annoyed and told me that she had already brought the tickets so I had to go. 
i told her that I cant see 3d movies so how can I watch it? that seemed to annoy her so she told me that I was being ungrateful for wasting her money. 
we had a decent argument over it and I was able to skip the movie, but mum stayed mad for a week and told me that my cousins where heartbroken I could not make it.

240,Asshole,"I am 29 and live in a Western country, my girlfriend is 21 and is a student in an emerging market. We meet while she was traveling and have been together for a year. I fly to her about every second month. A central issue is money; my girlfriend, while not poor, has much more limited funds than me and girlfriend also, to my annoyance, is extremely reluctant to take any money from me, and rather spend her own money, which means she tries to keep up with my spending and be tit for tat and thus is burning through her savings really fast. I like traveling a lot and we go traveling several months a year.

 However, because my girlfriend does not accept me paying for her, this means that she is overspending quite hard. We had a lot of discussions on this, but she is not budging and I am extremely annoyed by it, because it essentially means that we have to artificially limit ourself in terms of what we can do, because of her pride. I also don't want her to spend her savings because her country is sliding into a recession so she will need all the money she has after graduation. She told me that she is afraid that I would use the money I gave her in the future as leverage, or that it would create a false sense of entitlement or bitter feelings towards her in the future. She is also afraid that if we would split up, I would accuse her of having lived off me and being essentially a gold digger.

This is complete nonsense. I really don't care that much about money and even if we would split up, and even if it would be a bad break up (realistically, if we broke up, it was because something I did, not the other way around, so I am not much worried about it), I would never bring it up. I more the kind of guy to just move on immediately and she is a much, much, much better person than me any more, with a less ""flexible"" moral code. 

So after a lot of discussions, I came up with this plan; I am running some web sites with a friend that make their money mostly through affiliation links in my country and I get about a 1000 €  out of it every month. Now I told her that we need a translator (from English into her language) for these websites and that my friend wanted her to do it. She agreed to it and has been translating these websites ever since. 

This a lie. There is no translation job and, at least for the moment, we don't have any use for the translations. It's just a scheme that allows me to pay her about 500 €  (which is basically the monthly income for a higher middle-class person in her country). I will never tell her about this, even there should be a bad break up. I also have zero expectations of what she does with the money.  Also, even if we broke up, I intent to keep up the scheme until afer she graduated and found a good job herself.

I talked with another friend about this and she accused me of being extremely manipulative and toxic.  I do realize that I am lying to my girlfriend and that this thing is quite big, but I think its more of a ""means justify the ends"" situations.

241,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if title is confusing, I don't know how else to communicate this. Also, I acknowledge the absurdity of coming to reddit to ask about this, but I don't really have anyone else to ask. Sorry it's a bit convoluted. 

I [19M] have a four month old baby son. Basically, a little bit more than a year ago I was on a night out for my 18th birthday and had a one night stand with a girl I met in a bar. Didn't have a condom, but she told me she was clean and on the pill and I was a drunk idiot so thought fuck it. Turned out she was a) 33 years old, b) married and c) lying about being on the pill because she and her husband were struggling to get pregnant again and she was desperate for another baby. I suppose her plan worked out a bit because she got pregnant. However, around that time, her husband found out that he was no longer able to have kids and the one his wife was carrying was certainly not his. He was actually pretty level headed and decent about it; he reached out to me and let me know that his wife admitted to lying about  being single and that he doesn't hold me fully responsible.

However. The two of them decided that they were going to raise my son as if her husband is his father and I basically got no say in the matter. They framed it as helpful, saying that they were saving me from being saddled with a kid so young. But honestly I want to be involved. That's my boy and he's beautiful. He's also very clearly not her husband's; they're both of Mediterranean descent, olive skin, dark hair and eyes etc. My boy is super pale and a redhead like me. They don't allow me any contact with him and have basically banned me from being his dad, but I do know people who know them who have commented how strange it is they have a son who looks like that. Would it be awful for me to tell them it's my kid? I know I'd cause a lot of drama, but I've kind of exhausted my resources with trying to get contact properly.",41,57,0.89
242,Not the A-hole,"My 13yo daughter is a Scout. She is naturally talented in a lot of things and achieving badges is generally easy for her.  She has just about completed achieving her Adventurer and when that's done she will have to wait a bit because the courses for First Class Scout have an age requirement on them.

Today she has a course presented by the rovers for her chess badge. My wife sent her the requirements for it a month ago and has reminded her weekly to look at the email and do what she needs to do: 
 >List the last 5 World Chess Champions and discuss with the examiner the
following points:

>* Their favourite openings
>* Their favourite defences
>* Where they won their titles, against whom they played and to whom they lost their titles.

My daughter shrugged her off and didn't even look at the mail. On Monday my wife had a bit of a blowout with her telling her it was this weekend and she should get it done. She was down right cheeky and disrespectful in her reply to her mother and I heard it from my office. I walked out as my daughter stormed off. 

Fine.

Last night while my daughter was at her scout meeting my wife came to me and asked me to help her get the information together for my daughter because she has not done it yet. My wife is Akela to the cubs and since there are a lot of her cubs at the same meeting doing their cub chess badge she doesn't want my daughter to look bad in front of them. 

I refused. More than that I put my foot down and we almost had a fight because I told her not to do it either. 
When my daughter got home from Scouts, late, she wanted to start doing her work. She asked my wife to help her with it and said she may not. I told her tough shit. It was almost 10pm. I told her if she wanted to do the work she had to wake up early and do it. 

Well she forgot to set her alarm so she woke up with everybody else. Then she wanted to do her work instead of doing her chores. She wanted her brother to do them instead. I again put my foot down and made her do her chores.

My wife just left to take them to the course. My wife is angry with me and my daughter is in tears because she is not prepared. 

If she does not get the badge today she will have to wait a year to get it because this course only runs once a year.

I just smiled and waved. I told my wife if we only found out the requirements yesterday I would have jumped in and gotten the information for her, but she dragged her feet, was cheeky as hell so she needs to face the consequences.  

Am I the asshole?

She did not get her badge, however the instructor said that since she completed all the other requirements she can email him the task and he will sign it off for her, so she will still get it if she does the work.

I’ve known her for 11 years and we are very close. At first the fainting was obviously kinda alarming but now we know we just need to help catch her and there’s nothing you can do but put her in the recovery position and wait it out. 

When this happened, we hadn’t been out for too long, we were at the mall, and I had driven us there. We had just got out the car into an underground car park when she dropped, and a guy who was walking past shot over to her to catch her. 

It creeped me out how quickly he had moved in on her and so I yelled at him thinking he hadn’t seen me because I was still getting around the car to her side. There are these huge concrete pillars that I need to navigate around and it was a squeeze to get round them. He ignored me and caught her and when I got to the otherside of the car he had laid her in the recovery and was feeling her pulse.

I told him to get the fuck away from her (busy Saturday but it seemed like no one was in that freaking car park but us) and he just looked really cool like he didn’t care and said ‘I’m a first aider, it’s my job to help’ I told him it was my job to keep creeps away from my friend and threatened to call the cops.

He looked really irritated before getting up and telling me to call 911 if she hadn’t recovered consciousness within the next minute and left, and my friend came to literally seconds later. I told her what happened and she said after a while that whilst she appreciated my concern, most people were only trying to help in situations like this.

She didn’t tell me off but I’m kinda pissed with her now too, so I just want to know if IATA.

She questioned my areas of pain that I brought up and talked to me condescendingly. She obviously had more important people to see. She made a few referrals and prescribed a medication and sent me on my way. This was July 1st. My RX has yet to be sent to the pharmacy even though I have followed up EIGHT TIMES. A polite woman answers for their office, apologizes that is hasn’t been sent in yet, and then assures me the PA will send it off right now. EIGHT TIMES. Now I can assume the squeaky wheel gets the oil, except this is undeniable negligence. I have had to miss work due to pain and the lack of receiving my prescription. Not to mention, the referral she gave me. I have followed up with them five times, leaving a message each time because I was sent to voicemail despite calling during office hours... I have yet to receive a phone call back. The referrals and RX orders appear to be empty promises. I am so disappointed in the care I received.

248,Asshole,"I draw on sticky notes at work, little cartoons and creatures and such. A coworker who is a couple years younger than me (I'm 23) likes my artwork, and since it made him happy I let him post the sticky notes all over his desk space. I never thought much of it. There was never any formal conversation about who owned the drawings, whether or not I was giving them to him, etc. There were a lot of instances of the following: ""I drew this thing, he's not here right now/we're both fairly busy so I'll leave it at his desk for him to see later."" Again, I didn't mind them being kept at his desk, and was glad he enjoyed them. It soon also turned into ""I drew this thing, I'm showing it to him, oh ok he's hanging it up."" Soon after that, I'd draw something (sometimes with the intent to take it home with me) and if he saw it/I showed it to him independent of his desk space he'd take it and put it there. A little weird, but again, nothing that I was too focused on, after all, it's where the rest of my artwork was. Super casual, no biggie.

This coworker is moving on to a new opportunity. I told him about a month ago that I was going to take home the sticky notes (there are about 60 of them from the past year and a half or so) and scan them. He jokingly said ""nooooooooooo,"" and I didn't think much of it. He then said that he wants the originals, not the copies. I mean, I did leave them at his desk, but it's occurring to me that he *feels* that I gave them all to him, and that they were all made for him, when that was not the intent. Only about 10 were made for him specifically.

I know this is a miscommunication that could have been easily avoided by having a conversation on the ""conditions"" of the ""giving/using/displaying"" of the drawings, but...

For reference, my sister went to art school back in our home state. The rest of our family moved to another state when she was a sophomore, but she was already living in dorms and stayed to finish school.  She's always been on the shittier side when it comes to mental health, ie eating disorders, depression, stuff like that,  but AFAIK she's been taking medication for it. She graduated in May (with no job offers, of course) and moved back in with us. She got a retail job nearby and keeps trying to work on stuff for her portfolio, but lately she's been ""to depressed to feel inspired"" and just keeps giving up after a few hours of drawing.

Basically, my wife Janet claimed she hates diet soda because it gives her migraines. Okay, fine, but the problem is that she wanted to lose a good \~10 lbs because she was starting to approach the “overweight” territory. 

I say that was a \*problem\* because she’s an absolute soda addict. She’ll always take a can to work with her while drinking another on the way, AND having at least another for dinner. 

Anyways, since the beginning of the year, I’ve been lowering my sugar intake immensely. I bought myself a huge pack of Pepsi Max, and the wife’s been taking some when she goes to work. My wife is kind of food-label illiterate, so she didn’t even take notice to the “zero sugar” printed on top of the can.

I originally bought it for me, but since she kept taking and enjoying them, I started buying it for her as well. Pretty soon, the only soda she really drank in the house was Pepsi Max. I also bought myself some Diet Fanta and she’d make some snide comments with how I’m “destroying my body with cancer” and I was just ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Anyways this all came to a head a few days ago when she shrieked from excitement for being 8 pounds down since the beginning of the year. I took it as a great chance to mention that it’s likely because she stopped drinking so many calories everyday. She asked what I was talking about and I went to get the soda can and showed her where it says 0 calories. I explained it’s in essence a diet drink with the same artificial sweeteners as diet fanta and other diet drinks have. She looked horrified and called me “such a fucking asshole” as I sat there laughing my ass off.

I arrived 10 minutes early and had to fill out some paperwork and as I was working on that, the manager comes to me and throws a 5 page packet at me and says ""Do this test"". It's based on drawings of very specific airplane components that was not required to know for the position. So I start getting a little nervous but attempt it anyway. I hear the manager then whisper to the receptionist ""she's wearing heels, who told her to wear heels? They're too high"". I was wearing no more than two inch wedges and nowhere in the description did it say what not to wear.

They take me to the office and it's the manager and a younger guy on his team. The manager then starts arguing with his employee about where the director is and he decides to go look for him. They told me to keep working on the test which I honestly was struggling with but trying my best. Then the other guy gets a phone call and argues with someone, saying ""Do this interview with me, I don't know what to ask. Can you just come up with some questions?"" He's saying this about 3 feet away from me while I'm working out this freaking test. I couldn't concentrate. Finally the manager comes in with the director and he goes ""OK what's number 1?"" I get it right and I get 2 right. From there I had some trouble and they looked at each other and start quietly laughing. It reminded me of high school boys. I tried thinking out loud and asking if the direction I was going was correct. He did this stupid shrug and with a smirk said ""Uhh I don't know!"" and starts laughing. He said ""Let me guess, you don't know the next one either?"" It's based on very specific things you would learn on the job. They asked me more questions about why I was here in the first place and ""Am I REALLY interested in this kind of job?"" (I'm there because you invited me -\_- )

It’s been planned since January and a good friend of mine agreed to stay at my place with my two dogs during the four days I’d be gone (I live alone; she lives with roommates, so it’d be a win-win. She escapes the roomies and has time to herself for a few days, my dogs don’t become attention starved.) I paid her the week before I left, because she and I have been longtime friends and I had full faith in her.

She texts me the next day and says she’s too sick to leave her house, which is really unfortunate but not ultimately her fault, so I had to scramble to get my neighbors to stop by the house at different intervals to let my dogs out / feed them.

Anyway, my friend lets it slip that she spent that whole day with another friend of ours, hanging out and doing whatever. I immediately got upset, saying we had an agreement and she lied to me and bailed. She kept insisting she was really sick and only ended up at her friends house “for a quick chat” before “accidentally” spending a few hours hanging out with them.

When I got home my poor dogs had chewed on the furniture and gone to the bathroom around the house out of frustration and anxiety. They’ve been glued to my hip since I got back. I feel so bad for them. I ended up going off on my friend, telling her I didn’t believe her bullshit story about being sick, and ended the friendship over it. She kept saying “you’re literally ending our whole friendship because I caught the flu. Wow.” AITA? Is there any chance she’s not lying?",242,1561,0.96

260,Not the A-hole,"When I got her from her dads he forgot her shoes. They where currently the only pair that still fit. So she wore a pair that where one size too small only when necessary. We didn’t go anywhere the whole time I had her because of it. But I took her to her dads today with her bare foot. 

He has bought one pair in her life. When I send her over in any cute shoes he sends her home with the tattered pair, saying he bought the new pair and isn’t letting them go to my house. I’ve gone to the point of texting receipts. 

I have full custody. He has 4 nights a month because she doesn’t have a bed or bedroom. So yeah I want her damn cute shoes back. I’m the one getting her dressed and taking her out. I want her in nice shoes. 

When I realized she didn’t have shoes on I decided to not text him freaking out. It would just start drama. I needed to get paid today to go on an overdue shopping trip for her. He doesn’t give a dime in child support, so I have to figure it out myself. 

I get texts from him and his girlfriend raising a huge massive fit over it. They didn’t even get home before they told me I’m a bad mom and the shoes aren’t at their house. I without a doubt know they are and am sick of this bullshit. 

She never walked outside. I carried her because she didn’t have shoes on. I don’t feel like I did anything to hurt her. 

Now I’m wondering if I was too focused on giving him the middle finger. 

I didn’t physically have to money to get any. I spent my last $20 on gas this morning to get to work. I had $2 left. I get paid tonight. I could have ask my mom for money or started this drama with him earlier to get the shoes. (He would have called me names for not going out and buying some, probably saying he bought that pair anyways when he didn’t) 

TL;DR 
Separated parents. I have 26/30 days a month. Dad doesn’t pay child support or buy her anything she needs. He hoards her nice shoes claiming he buys them and sends her home in dirtier ones. She only had one pair left. He brought her home without them. Instead of getting them back or borrowing money to buy a new pair I sent her to his house barefoot. She did wear an older pair that where a bit too small while at my house.

Edit to add:

We are currently in a court battle. It’s an insanely long story but essentially he tried to claim I make 2,800 a month when I just started working again from being a stay at home mom and make $800-$1000. He is trying to make it so I have to pay him. And that he gets 50/50 time. When she sleeps on his couch...

I have a good lawyer. We are trying our hardest.

Sadly my mom is actually funding my legal fees with my dads life insurance, he very recently passed. 

I’m an asshole. I had such a long streak of not even engaging myself or responding to the hate. And I went to his level of being shitty. Which is even worse that I premeditatedly compromised my morals. 

I’ll just buy a ton of shoes and drop a bunch off at his house when I pick her up. Probably just 2 of each so it doesn’t get stupid. My daughter needs me to just be a good person.",69,64,0.9

262,Not the A-hole,"ONE MORE EDIT: wow this got big. So we’ve been doing a lot of research over night (obviously I haven’t slept well) and found how non invasive the procedure could be, and the results come back in a week or so. We’re gonna go to the girls parents with this information and try to explain why it’s important for all of us to know. Thank you all for your input, I’ll try and post an update when I know more. Also, as a side note, I wouldn’t consider myself overly controlling or a “helicopter parent”. As I said, my son knows about safe sex, knows sex is normal, and has even asked my husband for condoms in the past, as we told him he should do whenever he needed to. The constant supervision we kept them under only applies to what happens IN OUR HOUSE, and I don’t think that’s an outlandish rule. Just because we’re sex positive doesn’t mean we’re celebratory or encouraging of it. 

It’s almost comical that this of all things would be what made me get a reddit account, even more comical that I’m turning to the internet for input, but I just wanna put it out there that I’m set in my thinking. I just wanna know if I’m an asshole for it. 

My 15 year old son came to my husband and I last week, telling us that his girlfriend is 7 months pregnant. As someone who became a mother very young, i am devastated and so deeply disappointed. They’ve been together for about a year, but we always thought it was a kids thing, nothing harmless. Regardless, when under our watch, we kept them under CONSTANT supervision, so this was all a shock. We know the girls parents and believed we were all on the same page about our kids. 

Turns out we were wrong. When we called them, they spun some bullshit about how their daughter had already told us, basically placing the blame on their child for us not knowing she’s been pregnant for SEVEN months. On top of this, they’ve only known for about a month or two meaning she’s had basically no prenatal care. 

We were trying to figure out what our next steps should be, so I called my older brother. Not wanting him to keep a secret from his family, I told him I’d individually call his wife and two daughters to tell them myself. When I called the youngest one, 16, who is close to my son, her first reaction was “I wonder if it’s even his.”

Upon hearing this, I immediately questioned my son, who then informed me of their very... colorful relationship. She’s apparently a serial cheater, even though I didn’t even think that was a factor in a 15yo’s relationship. I’ve never felt like such a bad mother listening to all that was going on in my sons life that I didn’t know about, knowing he’s never trusted me enough 

After this I contacted the parents of his girlfriend, and as gently as I could, informed them that we wanted a paternity test done. They FLIPPED, they were pissed about what I was accusing their daughter of, and saying the trauma of even bringing that up to her is too much for a heavily pregnant child. While I might agree, this is my child’s life that’s gonna be deeply impacted too. 

So my husband and I decided we’re gonna keep trying to get a paternity test done no matter what it takes. AITA for demanding this? Am I being unreasonable? As bad of a parent as I feel like I am right now for letting this happen, I feel I’m no where near as bad as the girls parents...

EDIT: just to clarify, weve gone over this with my son and he’s on board and understands why a paternity test is important.

ANOTHER EDIT: We have DEFINITELY discussed safe sex with our son, as I said I was a very young mother and it was important to me to make sure they’re educated. I in no way blame the girl, I just want to protect my son.",1677,12918,0.95

265,Not the A-hole,"Okay so this happened just this afternoon. I was with my roommate at a grocery store when I had to use the restroom. The stalls have a somewhat considerable gap between the door and the partition. While I was on the toilet, another woman comes in with a little girl (probably about 4 yrs old). The woman leaves the little girl by herself outside of the stall. All of a sudden I notice this little girl looking at me through the gap. I politely asked the little girl if she would stop looking at me. She moves away but not 10 seconds later she's back to staring at me. I ask her again to stop but with a little bit more 'force' (I didn't yell). All of a sudden she reaches her hand through the gap and starts sliding the lock like she's trying to unlock it. Unfortunately the toilet is not within arms length of the door so I can't reach it to stop her. I panic and immediately yell ""Get your fucking hand off the lock!"" That finally gets her to stop and then the woman she came in with says something in Spanish (I'm assuming to the little girl). I hurry up and finish and leave but not before giving the girl a dirty look (I admit this was petty). When I met up with my roommate and told her what happened and what I said, she immediately said called me an asshole and I shouldn't have cussed at a little girl. We're hanging out with some friends and she won't stop talking about it and now the friends agree with her. I stopped trying to defend myself but not now I'm second guessing if I shouldn't have cussed at her but I was truly panicked that she'd open the door completely and leave me exposed while on the toilet.

EDIT: well the results are in and I'm clearly the asshole. 

For the record, I do not make it a habit to cuss at or around kids. I used to be a preschool teacher so I'm pretty good at watching what I say. This time I just happened to panic while I was already frustrated.

And to the person who messaged me saying that I was the asshole and that if it had been your kid you would have 'beat the living shit out of me' for using that kind of language in front of them, I hope you have a nice night.",92,191,0.94
266,Not the A-hole,"A couple days ago we had some friends over for a party and I set up a 4 player minecraft lan session.  We logged the kids into the survival world my son and I built so he could show them all the sights.  We adults left the kids to play but after about an hour there was some kind of altercation upstairs that apparently one of the guests wanted op rights on the server but my son (who is a bit younger) either did not want to give him the rights or did not understand what he was asking.  We had they play something else.  


When I logged in the next day, I noticed the inventory on the character he was given, which was pretty tricked out, was completely emptied out, all our chests in the house had been destroyed, and a bunch of lava was poured over the buildings.

So I told my wife that this was not cool and he was not allowed to play video games unsupervised anymore at our home and we should talk to him that it's not okay to be an invited guest then vandalize someone's home, real or virtual, and she flipped.  She told me how it was just a game and it didn't matter since we could just do it all over again.  I tried to correlate it to other destructive acts such as ripping up a story someone had written, destroying a painting, or vandalizing their home but she dismissed it as ""not real""  and left.  She is now SUPER pissed off that I had said this and we are meeting them at the park to hopefully smooth this over.  AITA here?

Luckily she had a unique name and I figured I run it through Facebook to see if I could find out a bit more. Low and behold I do find her! The name she was using on her profile was apparently her middle name.

269,Asshole,"Hi everyone, I (F32) have been engaged to a wonderful man (M27)  for almost a year now, we’ve been dating for three. My fiancé and I agree on almost everything, but there’s one huge source of conflict in our life. He used to have a girlfriend we’ll call.. Kayla. The two of them dated for six years from when they were 16-22. Kayla eventually killed herself which is obviously very tragic.
 
However, I cannot understand my fiancé’s obsession with her. I’ve heard about their relationship, and from what I understand she wasn’t a very healthy person to be around- she was very introverted, wanted to stay inside all day, and would sometimes get into fights with my fiancé and call him names like stupid or she would call him a dick. My husband very clearly loves her and i respect that but I can’t understand how he could love an abuser. Honestly I’ve held my tongue for a very long time, when we started dating I didn’t think it would last this long.

However, we reached a breaking point last night. Today is the anniversary of her death, he always calls out sick and stays home alone- he usually plays games and reads a book so I thought that maybe we could do something different. I asked if he wanted to go out tomorrow (today) and he said no. I asked him if he wanted to do anything, I even offered to have sex with him and he refused. Eventually he got heated and told me he just wanted to relax, and I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. I told him maybe he shouldn’t be so obsessed with an abuser who has told him to shut up, called him names and that she clearly didn’t care about him as much as he thought. He lost it, he was so angry and told me it wasn’t my place to say that. I told him that he was an abuse victim and he was defending an abuser, he went to the room and ignored me. 

Today he sat me down and told me that he was sorry for yelling at me, but he didn’t consider her an abuser and that he needed my support and he didn’t appreciate it. I told him that I didn’t appreciate the cold shoulder, and I told him that there are many victims of abuse that don’t realize it, and we should look into it and process her abuse together. He stormed out, and told me he was going to a hotel for the next week. 

I called up a girlfriend and told her what went down and she flipped out on me too! She told me that I was being a giant asshole, and that he should cancel the engagement and hung up on me. I don’t know what I did that was so wrong but I guess I need to get a second opinion to show them. Am I the asshole?",94,59,0.77
270,Not the A-hole,"I am currently at Disney world with my family and my bf.  Bf and I split off (rest of the family goes back to the room and rest) and decide to go one one of the slower, more chill rides.  We get in line and there's a family of four behind us, including a daughter who is about 9 years old.  

The daughter gets really close to us so that it forces us on top of the people in front of us.  Then she starts playing a bit.  She bumps into me a few times, and does some jumps and lands on the back of my shoe.  Every time we move forward in the line, she instantly walks as close to us as she can get then continues playing.  There's a good amount of room behind her between her and her father.  Her dad is distracted by his phone.  I let this go on for about three or four minutes, then turn to face her father.  She apoligizes to me, and I tell her dad as politely as I can, ""hey, sorry, your daughter keeps bumping into me."".

He gets really in my face quickly, saying, ""She's a kid, mate.  This place is for kids, mate."". Unsure of what to do, I turn and ingore him, and he repeats ""this place is for kids, mate."" His tone was clearly annoyed, condescending, and aggressive.  

So my first question is AITA for not just ignoring it?  

Second question is more of a hypothetical.  Adding some detail- I'm a bit of a bigger guy (not huge but definitely a bit more muscular than average), and my boyfriend is too.  I'm also awkward.  My body coupled with awkward body language can sometimes be misread as more aggressive.  I kept this in mind when I talked to him, trying to be as gentle as possible when I asked.  This is probably not the case, but in the event that I failed and what I said came off as more confrontational than I intended, WIBTA?

Edit:
Thank you all for your honest feedback.  A lot of you made a good point that I should have talked to the kid first.  I was worried the parents would get mad at me for adressing the kids, I see that's kind of a lapse in judgement on my part.  I read all the replies, and appreciate them.",62,228,0.93

272,Asshole,"Okay so for some background information I inherited some property that includes a sizeable chunk of what is essentially forest. I don’t have a Fence surrounding this portion of my property because it is blocked by a river and dense vegetation. This is pretty good at stopping people from getting into my yard but not so good at stopping wildlife (I live on the edge of the woods, western Canada). I have gotten bears, cougars, skunks, trash pandas, deer etc etc. 

Most recently, a pretty big coyote (much bigger than the scrawny things I saw in California) has been frequenting my backyard, normally to devour the corpses of my neighbours pets. Over the past month it has succeeded in killing 2 cats and a small dog from my street alone, probably many more (lots of missing cat/dog posters around). I found the remains of one of the cats in my yard and the I actually saw it eating the dog (which was annoying and yappy as hell, so it’s hard for me to feel sympathy). 

So my neighbours are aware that it’s eating their pets in my yard and asked me to kill it if I see it (I’ve got a rifle, a hunting license and my back porch gives me a good shot). However, I refuse to kill it, it’s a wild animal who for the most part is living in its natural habitat. People who live here must accept that we share these places with other creatures. I don’t care it killed those pets that’s a risk you take by living here and letting them wander around outside with no supervision. If they really want to do something they could try animal services but as long as this coyotes in my yard they’re not doing shit. Anyway so my entire street hates me now but its my property and if they don’t like wildlife they’re free to move. AITA?",172,85,0.79
273,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago, my mom decided she was going to kick me off of the family phone plan. She came up to me one day and told me I had about a week to find a new service provider and that I was on my own. At the time, I worked somewhere with an in-house phone team, so I went to them and got set up on Sprint. I kept my old phone, as my mom had said everything on it would be cancelled by the end of the month, and set up service with Sprint to begin the next month.

I mentioned this to my mom, and a couple weeks later, she blew up on me, saying that her phone company was charging her about $300 because the phone hadn’t been paid off. 

About a half a year later, I did taxes by myself (I was 19 or 20). I qualified for the free Turbo Tax service, which really helps you out when you can’t afford to pay someone to do your taxes for you. My mom said that she would help me out, since my taxes are super simple (at the time I had no debt, just one job, no credit cards, etc.). She never did, and I ended up completing them on my own so I wouldn’t miss the deadline. A couple weeks later, she blows up on me again, saying I owe her $800 because she wasn’t able to claim me as a dependent on her taxes.

I’ll admit her responses to both situations leave a lot to be desired (especially since she wouldn’t give me any info about the phone plan she kicked me off of), but she still thinks I owe her $1000. AITA here for refusing to pay anything but my monthly rent to her?

277,Not enough info,"So my son is 10 and he has been having trouble with bullies at school, mostly verbal but it only got physical near the end of the school year about a month ago. My son is a great kid, but he is very passive, quiet, unsure of himself and overweight (this one is 100% my fault). So we’ve decided as a family to pursue a healthier lifestyle with better food at home and more exercise

For exercise, self defense and building self-confidence, our family friend who has a son the same age suggested that our son start taking Tae Kwon Do lessons at a local place with him. My wife thought this was a great idea, and my son reluctantly agreed. I however, vetoed the idea. I don’t think Tae Kwon Do is effective for self defense (it’s largely seen as a joke in MMA circles) so I suggest that our son joins the kids Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes at the MMA gym I currently train at. Plus we get a family discount there if he enrolls. 

My wife is not receptive to this idea, despite the fact that I can personally vouch for the quality of the training and instructors at this gym. I admit the gym is a little bit grungy, and some of the people training there look like action film bad guys, but there are plenty of kids and families training there and I’ve almost never seen bad behavior there from the instructors, the students and the professionals. It’s a respectful place where our son can get a really good workout and learn how to fight from people who do it for a living in different MMA organizations. The usual kids instructor was a former UFC fighter (he was cut after losing three in a row, but getting cut from the top 1% is nothing to sneer at). I even pointed out that just from what they put on their website, this Tae Kwon Do location looks like what the martial arts community calls a McDojo (this is true of most Tae Kwon Do gyms in America actually). It’s a place where there are 14 year olds walking around with black belts, where you have to sign a long term contract, where the instructor claims to be a former Olympic alternate but he won’t say what year this happened and his name is nowhere on the Internet, and where he also claims to be a former world champ of a nonexistent Tae Kwon Do organization. from what I’ve been told by our family friend they spend a lot of time on martial arts forms and not a lot on practical application of training and conditioning.

I told all this to my wife but she will not get over what I think is her bias against MMA and the meathead image of it. She also said that I missed the point of why we are trying to get our son into martial arts classes because I’m focusing on turning him into a fighter as opposed to just a healthy kid who can fight as a last resort",131,70,0.78

I work at a tech company that's rather well known and competitive to get hired at. I'm not part of the hiring panel but the managers will generally ask around if anyone knows the people they're interviewing, and what their impressions are of them. It's a small niche industry so often someone will know the applicant.

Also important to know, I was bullied a lot as a kid. By both girls and guys. I've not seen or heard from any of my old bullies since I was in high school, I got out of that town and never looked back. I don't have anyone on Facebook or anything. I've grown a lot since then, I don't take shit from anyone, and that's helped me a lot in my career and life.

Anyway, my boss emailed out a resume of an applicant a few days ago, and the name jogged my memory... I did a little digging online and did a quick search through my old e-journal, and sure enough he was this kid who bullied me in high school. I'm 100% certian. I found an old journal entry about something he did after I was outed as gay as a teen.

I had my weekly meeting with my boss the next day; to just check in and keep him updated on my work. We've got a pretty casual rapport, that's just what my office is like. Nobody, including the managers, really thinks twice about profanity. 

He asked what I thought of the guy's resume, and if I happened to know him or anything. Since we were from the same area.

And I said quite frankly ""Well, I haven't seen him since high school, but the last time I saw him, he called me a d*ke then tried to stick a hand down my pants to see what I had down there.""

He asked if I was serious, and I said ""dead serious, and there's more I could tell."" 

My boss told me that he didn't need to hear any more, he wouldn't be bringing the guy back for a second round of interviews.

I told some of my friends (Not work friends, these are people I know from my other hobby) about what had gone on that day at work, and a couple of them said stuff like ""What if he's grown up since he was a teenager, a lot of people do"" and ""wow you actually said that to your boss, I'd never say something so unprofessional. It looks petty."" Everyone seemed to think I overreacted. Since that all happened 8 years ago now.

Did I? I know how hard it is to get a job in my industry, it's very competitive and does rely on who you know. But i also don't care to see anyone from that part of my past again.

281,Not the A-hole," A few weeks ago, the amazon delivery guy left a package for me (6th floor) next to the elevator in the ground floor lobby of my building in plain view of the glass front door of the building that was propped open. 

I contacted Amazon, they filed a complaint with the amazon delivery people.

On Prime Day my SO treated himself to some expensive tech that he's had his eye on for a while. 

I got an email from amazon that the delivery would be arriving prior to 9pm. I got home about 30 minutes after receiving email and stayed home the entire day. 9pm came and went no delivery. The tracking went from 'will be delivered by 9pm' to 'contact us'.So I sent them a message saying, 'You wanted me to contact you about the package that didn't arrive today, so I am. Is there anything I need to do to get this package?'

Amazon replied with a bizarre message about how they understand how mad I am (mentioned about 3 different times in this email) and that they are really sorry which was confusing because I wouldn't have contacted them if it hadn't been for them telling me to. I just assumed that the package would come the next day which was fine.

Anyhow, in their email, Amazon mentioned sending a complaint on my behalf to the delivery service, which is not something I requested or wanted. I didn't want the delivery guy (usually the same guy comes to our building) being pissed and acting out especially since I had made the previous complaint.

Magically, after amazon sent the complaint to the delivery company, the package changed to being listed as delivered to me personally at 10:53pm. Needless to say, I didn't accept a package that late at night.

I contacted amazon about the package situation and they've been sending me in circles. They keep hinting that I'm in the wrong and that the package was either delivered to me or a neighbor.

I feel that the delivery driver is likely at fault for the package being missing. It's a little too coincidental for my liking that once the second complaint was sent out, the package was suddenly listed as delivered to me personally.

As amazon is jerking me around and this package is worth 300+, I looked into things and saw that I could fill out a police report. Amazon said they would have it resolved by 24th, however, they also stated that if I haven't heard from them by the 24th, it is my responsibility to continuously follow up with them until the issue is resolved.

I'm considering filing a police report because I think it will force amazon to do something, force the delivery guy to either admit that he didn't drop off the package or, if he gave it to a neighbor, force him to reveal which neighbor it was given to so that the neighbor can be forced to hand it over, and get me my stuff, whether it's a replacement set from amazon or the missing original set.

Recently they called me and asked if I could watch their kids and I said no, reasons being that I 1.do not like kids 2.am not good at babysitting and don't know how to interact with kids and 3.don't have the patience. I told them I might be willing to do it depending on how much they'll pay me per hour (since they wanted me to babysit overnight) and they pretty much scoffed at the idea of paying using the excuse of ""you're their aunt you should do it for free"" so with that I flat out refused.

Just for some clarification, I have babysat in the past a few years back when I was about 13 or 14 and never got the payment they promised me. They always need a babysitter not because they're doing anything important but because they always want to go clubbing or drinking or some other shit. I objected back then to them dumping their, then 4 small children including a baby, on a 14 y/o but I didn't have much choice in the matter as our dad made me anyway but now that I'm 18 he can't make me do anything. I don't have anything to do on the night they want me to babysit (so they can go out for drinks is what they told me) I just don't wanna deal with 6 kids for an entire day, especially unpaid. My dad says I'm being unreasonable because they wanna go because they feel like they were missing out on being in their 20s and having fun, I say that's not my problem. If they wanted to enjoy their 20s then they shouldn't have had a kid, let alone three each.

I took care of myself for the next ten years and I don't resent being kicked out because that experience made me grow up and become who I am now. We had no contact until recently when my mum found me online and wrote me a long message apologising about being a crappy mother and wanting to see me again. She said my sister wanted to see me too.

Eventually I agreed to come, but when I turned up it was just my mum. She explained that my sister decided not to see me because she is angry at me for 'disappearing' and never getting in contact (with the age gap between us I never felt like I was important in sister's life, it never occured to me that I was letting her down but I feel kinda bad about that now). Mum also felt the way for a while, she said. Apparently when she kicked me out she assumed I would go and stay at a friend's house (I didn't have any friends ??) and then come home and apologise (I already apologised straight after shoving sister ??) and beg to be taken back. She thinks I 'overreacted' by actually leaving and put a lot of stress on them wondering if I was even still alive for months and years.

I tried to argue with Mum's interpretation of events but she shut me down, saying she doesn't want us to start shouting at each other again. As an alternative she wants us to attend some kind of therapy course where we can 'air our grievances' and 'let it go' with the help of a professional. Sister might join too if she sees that it's working.

I don't want to do this. I have my own life now and I don't need them to be in it. I would have been happy to accept an apology and keep in touch, visiting them occasionally, but now it feels like Mum wants us to go through this performance so she can 'let it go' and stop feeling guilty.

AITA?  


Edit: Thank you guys so much, you really put my head straight. A ton of you were telling me to contact my sister directly so I did and we had a long talk. It turns out she wanted to see me yesterday but she couldn't get out of work (serving ice cream). She says she knew Mum kicked me out but she thinks I could have put my foot down and refused to leave, after all what could Mum have done about it? She says she puts her foot down all the time when Mum is being difficult. I think she has bigger balls than I do. She wants to come and visit me where I live later in the year so we can spend some time together (Mum not invited). It's going to be weird introducing her to my friends (never told them anything about my family) but could be fun. :)",74,211,0.96
285,Not the A-hole,"So, yesterday, my friends and I were spending some time in a nearby city that just had a Chik-Fil-A open, and my friends suggested we go.

Now, normally I don't really mind where we go for food, as long as its not a place that I can't eat at (Texas Roadhouse, 5 Guys, mainly, because of the prevalence of peanuts). However, I am an openly gay man, the only one in my friend group, and I really dislike what Chik-Fil-A stands for as a company, and I don't want even a cent of any money I've given anyone going towards the oppression and vilification of people like me.

I piped up and said I wasn't comfortable spending money at an anti-gay establishment, and my friends agreed to try something else. We ended up going to a sit-down Korean restaurant, much nicer and we all enjoyed ourselves.

However, on the drive back home, one of my friends,  said ""I wish we could've gotten Chik-Fil-A, I haven't had it in forever and was really looking forward to it. \[My name} just had to get his panties in a bunch,"" he turned to me and said this right to my face, ""didn't you?""

I haven't known this particular friend for all that long, but this is the first time he's ever called me out for something. I didn't really know what to say, but I did reply that he'll just have to make a trip back sometime, unless he wants to stop there now. He said no and we continued the car ride, everything kept going as usual again.

I never once said that he couldn't eat there if he wanted, but I guess I can see how maybe he felt I was insinuating that he was somehow wrong for having eaten there? I didn't intend that, I'm sure most straight people don't really think about that part of Chik-Fil-A's legacy, even though I do privately wish people would stop giving them money.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: I asked a coworker about this, and they mentioned something interesting: My peanut allergy would have kept me from the restaurant anyway, they cook their chicken in peanut oil. So essentially, if I hadn't voiced my concerns and we went to the restaurant. I would have ended up in anaphylaxis by the end of the meal.

EDIT 2: *About 5 hrs after posting.* I appreciate all the comments. Even the ones I argued with! I appreciate your challenges to my POV, I have definitely given my positions a thought and cleaned up some inconsistencies in my behaviour. Also learned something new about my peanut allergies, thank you everyone for that one.
Some final clarification: we had not yet decided on a restaurant at this point. This was in the brainstorming part, where we were suggesting places to go. People started to vote for CFA, and I spoke up as people were saying yes. We were in a car of 7 people, counting myself. The other person in question had been fairly enthusiastic about CFA, I should have noted how excited he seemed.",1002,1820,0.84

287,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway account. My local Farmer’s Market does a “Music and Market” night once a week where they get a band to play for a few hours and people can shop, sit, and buy meals from local vendors. This park has a strict “no dogs” policy and the Farmer’s Market stalls have signs saying dogs are prohibited for health code reasons, yet every week I see 20-30 dogs there, many off leash. They bark, fight, pee and poop near food vendor stalls and make for a very unpleasant experience.

The Farmer’s Market is run by the city using donations collected during the concerts, so I approached them about all the dogs and was met with a “yeah, but what can we do?” response. I complained several weeks in a row so they finally said they’d make an announcement. This is it verbatim:

“Hey everyone, some party poopers want us to remind you that dogs aren’t allowed in the park, so be sure to leave them at home. We’ll keep enforcing the rule as vigilantly as ever, wink wink.”

That has me pissed off enough to contact the local health department. I know if I lodge a complaint they have to inspect eventually and they’ll either force them enforce the rules or shut it down. If I can get them to come out next week it will be the busiest concert of the summer so I think it would make the biggest difference.

288,Not the A-hole,"(Throwaway because they both use reddit)
I'm not the kind of person that shares feelings and I usually deal with my problems on my own but a few days ago I was in a really dark place and I texted my best friend about it. She promised she wouldn't tell anybody about it because I don't want people to think that I'm depressed or that they have to worry about me and I like to keep those sort of things to myself.

I'm the one who introduced them and I've known both of them for years but I was never really good friends with him. Today I went to the movies with her and her boyfriend and afterwards he mentioned stuff that I only told her. She said ""of course he knows, he's my boyfriend he has the right to read my texts"" 

I told her that going through her phone is fine as long as it doesn't involve anyone else but reading our texts is none of his business and that she should warn others before texting about sensitive topics. Now neither of them will talk to me and he told another friend of ours that I wanted to break them up because I'm jealous. I understand that they are in live and want to share everything but I feel like I can't trust her anymore. Am I the asshole here?

Tl;dr: I texted my friend in confidence, she let her boyfriend read it and after I said it's not ok, they won't talk to me.

Edit: I wasn't aware that he regularly goes through her phone. Also, I don't think he really thinks that I want to break them up, but the only person he told this is someone he knows I have a bit of a crush on and I think he just wanted to make me feel bad or whatever. I don't really care about that part though.",26,27,0.88
289,Asshole,"My 14 year old son has a friend, and that friend recently moved to philadelphia. My son mentioned that his friend offered to have him come over and have a sleep over there, and that his older brother would pick him up and drop him off. Its around an hour long ride, not too bad. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, this friend is just... trashy. The whole family is. The dad is only there maybe once a week at best, the mom is a woman who is the lead singer in a band and apparently is a recovering heroin addict (to be fair, she was a heroin addict over 10 years ago, but still), there are 3 other older brothers in the house, one of whom is in trouble with the law constantly, another one who parties a lot, and the other... well the other is actually pretty okay from what I've seen. But my sons friend is still quite a bit of a trouble maker, he skateboards around everywhere, hes gotten in trouble for smoking cigarettes outside the school, he curses a lot and has somehow seen EVERY single violent movie out there. They are originally from Glasgow and apparently back in Glasgow he got in trouble for bullying a kid. I just really do not want my son staying with these people for two whole days in their house. I don't know what kind of bad influences they are gonna have there, especially in regards to the older brothers. When I went to their house I would see the older brothers would have lots of friends over in the backyard drinking and smoking, what if they decide to have a little party of some sort while my son is there? The house in general reminds me of the family from Shameless a lot. 

&#x200B;

I am sort of friends with the mom, and even she was a bit hesitant about inviting him over. She didn't outright say it but I could tell that she felt that my son might be exposed to things he usually wouldn't be exposed to. It wasn't so much that she didn't want him to go, but she knew that I was hesitant and sort of seemed like she knew why I would be. I know that she kind of thinks of me as an overprotective suburban mom. 

&#x200B;

So I told my son no, he cant go. I just said I thought it was a bad idea, and that I would be busy that weekend and wouldn't be able to pick him up in case of an emergency. I think he knew deep down the real reason why I didn't want him to go. 

&#x200B;

My husband was really upset at this. We've had issues before in regards to him thinking I over protect and shelter our son, and he was very excited for our son to 'break out' of his bubble by going to stay with his friend in the big city for a weekend. When he found out I told our son he couldn't go, we got into this big fight over it. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here? Should I have just let him go? I will admit that I have been over protective over him and I have been trying to work on not being a helicopter mom all the time, I sometimes feel ashamed for how anxious I used to be over his safety and how much I used to watch over his every step.

293,Not the A-hole,"I recently had a tire get punctured a few weeks after buying them, and I was almost certain they had come with a warranty. When I went to the store I had bought the tires from and had them installed at to get my tire fixed/replaced, the first employee I talked to confirmed that I had a warranty and I would only have to pay the $15 installation fee. I gave them the information from my previous purchase and they ordered the necessary tire. 

A few days later, when I went back to get the tire put on, it was time to pay and the 2nd employee told me my total was $203. I explained to them that the other employee had confirmed that I had a warranty and all I had to pay was the installation fee. He said that my receipt showed that I owed the $200 and that I had to pay it. I ended up paying because I needed to get to work but decided to go back the next day to get the refund that I felt I deserved. 

The next day, both employees that had helped me were working. I talked to the first employee and explained the situation, and he worked with me to get a refund. While he was doing so, the 2nd employee came over and was trying to show the 1st employee that their receipt showed that I owed them money, so I didn’t deserve a receipt. We started arguing again, and the 1st employee pulled up their records of warranties that showed that I did in fact have a warranty and that I shouldn’t have paid at all. While he finished helping me get my refund, I asked if I could talk to their manager about how the 2nd employee treated me. When I talked to their manager I explained how he hadn’t checked for my warranty even after I brought it up and essentially made me pay, and then was rude to me while we were arguing.

294,Not the A-hole,"My sister (entitled parent) threw a birthday party for her son last Saturday where me and my other sister (B ) showed up and gave very generous gifts and spent time with our nephew. I had another birthday party to attend that day so I had to leave the party early which entitled parent knew and seemed okay with.  

Today my sister (B) and I got a very rude text from my other sister (the entitled parent) for not messaging her to wish her one year old son a happy birthday that was today. She called us shitty aunts and that she doesn’t want to hear the “I was too busy” excuses from us. This was at 8pm.  

Now for context, my sister (B) is a very busy student in pharmacy school and I work two jobs and have two volunteer positions, so yes we are very busy people and yes it did slip my mind today.  

B responded that she had planned on posting a picture on social media for his birthday but hadn’t had the time to do so yet and EP didn’t believe that she was planning to do so.  I messaged EP that I wished my nephew a happy birthday in person on the weekend and had already given him a gift. I didn’t see why a one year old needed a happy birthday text...  

She proceeded to tear at the fact that I left the party early and that I’m a shitty aunt and that I don’t care about my nephew because I didn’t send her a text today. She even questioned who I am because apparently not sending a text today was “so out of character” for me. She said that it was hurtful that people didn’t think that they needed to wish her son a happy birthday.  

I think the way she came at me and B was very unnecessary and she purposely wanted to try to make us feel bad and ruin our night.  

Am I wrong for not sending a happy birthday text to a one year old who can’t even read just for his mother’s pleasure? IMO my nephew isn’t old enough to comprehend what a birthday is and that a birthday text to his mother is more for her own ego and doesn’t make a difference to him either way.

296,Asshole,"So a colleague and I got for lunch to mid level restaurant. The waitress comes and takes our drink and food orders but seemed to be in a rush. Couldn't understand why as she only had 2 other table to wait on. I think nothing of it and we carry on. She brought us our food and rushed away again. We did not end up seeing her again until we were both done our meals. I'm used to a waitress coming up after we've had a couple bites to see if everything is ok and to see if perhaps there's anything else that we require. However, this waitress did not do that. As she is clearing our plates as we were finished with our meal, we asked for the bill. She asked if we wanted the bills separated to which I replied ""yes"". My bill came back to me at $29.75 for a burger and beer.  I gave the waitress $40.00 and asked for change. As she left, I wondered if she would bring me 2 $5.00 bills and a quarter or would she bring me a $5.00 bill and change? Side note, I live in Canada and we have $1 and $2 coins.  I am usually a 15% tipper.  If service is poor, it's less and if service is great, then the tip is more.  I was not overly thrilled about her service but I thought I would still leave a $5.25 as the tip, which is slightly above the 15%. But when the waitress brought back the change, she brought me back a $10.00 bill and a quarter. I couldn't believe it! I just sat there stunned! I then asked my colleague, ""Is she expecting a $10.00 tip for that service?"" I felt incredibly insulted that she would bring the change back in that manner. I thought there is no way that she doesn't understand that the change she brings me is where her tip is going to come from. It clearly felt to me that this was her hustle.  She figured that I would either leave her the $10.00 tip. So, instead of leaving her the $10.00 tip she had hoped for, I left her $0.25. I know I could have asked for more change from her but I felt so insulted that I felt I needed to make a statement of sorts. So, am I the asshole?",845,2232,0.86
297,Not enough info,"Basically I had preordered a game at GameStop though their website. On the day the game came out, I went to the Gamestop and I gave the guy my info to pick up the game. He goes to hand me the physical copy and then he looks down at his monitor and he says, ""Oh I'm sorry, this is for the digital download, I'll have to give you a code so you can download at home.""

​

Now, I have the confirmation email open and I show him that I did not preorder a digital download, I preordered a physical copy, it says it right there. I don't want a digital download because my wifi is spotty and it would take ages for me to download the game, and what's more why would I come all the way to GameStop to pick up a download code that would have been emailed to me. He tells me that theres nothing he can do and they can't do a return on a digital code so I ask to speak to the manager. 

​

The manager basically tells me the same thing and I get pretty irate at this point. I say that this not what I purchased, this is not what I want, and I shouldn't be inconvenienced by the employee's mistake. He basically tells me that it's not his problem and it's company policy that he can't return a digital code once it's been issued. Again, I say I did not purchase a digital code, it makes no sense that I would come all the way into the store to pick up a digital code and the fact that you won't give me the physical game that I purchased is ""fucking bullshit."" I used a few more curse words than after arguing with both employees for a while because I was becoming extremely frustrated. He finally says he will call corporate.

​

He spends about 45 minutes on the phone to corporate, I guess trying to get into contact with someone? I don't know maybe he's hoping I will just leave but at this point I've completely dug in and pissed off so I'm not going to leave until I get what I originally paid for. He finally comes back and is like we will return the purchase and you will get the hard copy game. He then admonishes me for becoming angry with him and talking to the employees in the manner that I did because ""we could've figured it out"" if I had only been more polite.

​

I was then like, 'No, you told me it wasn't your problem when I was being polite, the only reason it got figured out is because I made a stink about it."" He was then like, ""Okay whatever."" and handed me the game and I walked out.

​

Now, I understand in the grand scheme of things this is an incredibly minor problem but I didn't see why I should suck it up and be inconvenienced because they made a mistake, especially since if I had wanted a digital download I could've just done it from the comfort of my own home, and nothing would have gotten done.

We also invited her folks, who have a grandma/grandpa sort of role to my kids and have bonded with them over Lion King stuff.

So, several weeks ago I purchased tickets (reserved seating) in advance for the six of us. After a time my daughter mentioned off-hand that ""mommy is going to come too."" Their mom and I are divorcing, and at this stage we don't interact too much or spend any time together apart from briefly seeing each other briefly at kid drop-offs, family birthdays, etc. Just co-parenting interactions, text messages about the kids, upcoming events, and so on. Business.

Assuming ""mommy is coming"" is just a 6-year-old hearsay, we didn't think much of this. Then yesterday (two days from showtime) I receive a text from her inviting herself along, asking if there are seats available next to us. Now, my girlfriend and I had intended for this to be a fun event for just us and the kids, and planned to go out to lunch afterwards with my girlfriends' folks. But now I'm in an awkward position of having to deal with the ex's request to tag along. Rather than simply lie and say the show is sold out or some other BS, I decided to be honest with the hope of establishing clear boundaries to avoid this sort of snafu in the future. I told her squarely that yes, there is a seat available, and provided the showtime info, but also that she's put me in an awkward position of having to be the decider for her self-inviting to our weekend activity. I mean, there's no way I can decline without seeming rude.  Plus how are my kids going to feel when they potentially hear ""daddy said I can't come along.""  I ultimately told her that I'll leave the decision to her, but we intended it to just be us.

He had two other children aside from my wife, both males (now 55M and 58M) and both were lazy college dropouts who drank, partied too much and were always drugged up.

Some background: I'm pregnant (and a poster child for why birth control isnt 100% effective), I'm single, I have severe anxiety and depression and I'm living pretty far away from my family at the moment. 

For these reasons among others, I havent really wanted to post all over social media or tell many people about my situation. I told my mother & grandmother & 2friends, but that is all. When telling them, I begged them all not to tell anyone about this, b/c most of my family is p conservative/traditional (although mom, gma, and I are not) and because it's hard enough to be going through this while I am living so far away from loved ones that I can't trust my mental state if anything turns for the worse (i am in therapy for that part). 

That said, my grandmother and two friends have been very understanding and sweet about things. My mom however, while respecting my wishes, has tried to sway me otherwise.

You see, my cousin found out she was expecting shortly after I did and her mom and mine are both incredibly close, although there is a big air of competitiveness between them. Shortly after my cousin announced that she was pregnant, my mom has started being more and more upset over me hiding it, saying that she feels excluded for not being able to show everyone how happy she is for me. 

That said, I've been trying to celebrate in my own way, with the few people I've told. I take update photos and videos of the baby kicking  on the condition that they dont save the videos, had 1 friend take some really nice maternity photos for me, etc. I read to the baby and try to call my mom when I do. I've asked my mom to be @ birth. I'm also saving everything on a drive that my family will be able to access after the baby is born. 

My cousin, meanwhile, posts weekly updates on social media about her pregnancy, had the whole gender reveal livestream thing (not personally my cup of tea), is planning a huge blowout baby shower, had 2 separate maternity photoshoots done professionally, etc etc. 

Now that I'm reaching the end of my pregnancy, my mom is getting more and more insistent that she be able to celebrate in the way Cousin and her mom are,  which is frustrating because I feel like it's my choice who does or doesnt know about my pregnancy. She's started making comments when we talk about how beautiful my cousin is in her photos, how excited the family is, how shes upset that my memories of pregnancy are going to be ""uncaptured"", and once that I'm ruining her first months as a grandmother. The added stress of upsetting my mother is causing a lot of issues with my health and school, and I'm unsure how to proceed. I understand shes excited, but I feel like I'm trying to respect her in a way that doesnt break my own comfort levels.

TL;DR mom is upset because im keeping pregnancy secret while cousin and her mom are all over social media about hers and says I'm ruining things because she cant celebrate.",90,162,0.93
306,Asshole,"Wife and I are in our mid forties and we've been together since high school. 

Recently, I was looking at some pictures of my wife when she was in her twenties and I edited a picture to use it as my lock screen picture. She looked really great in that picture and I decided to use it as my lock screen picture. 

So yesterday,my wife was using my mobile and asked me about the picture. And I told her that I found her really attractive in the picture and decided to use it. 

She started crying and accuses me of finding her unattractive now. I was kind of surprised and asked her if she was jealous of herself. I mean it is the same woman right? AITA here?",187,1047,0.96
307,,"For context - I have a 3 year old, a 2 year old and a 10 week old. (I know, insanity - this will be my last). My husband has been traveling all month for work and I’ve been getting a little overwhelmed with two toddlers and a colicky newborn. Then it all gets worse when I get news my mother was ill. So I decided to pack the kids up and visit her for a few days until she could fend for herself.

I ended up leaving my mom’s at like 3:00 am to avoid traffic, since it’s a 2.5 hour drive. 

Well things did not go smoothly. Baby is screaming and, eventually, so are both toddlers. My mom is still not 100% so she can’t really help me wrangle the kids. Needless to say, I’m a bit stressed and exhausted and just hoping the motion of the car will put them all to sleep. 

Finally I get out to the condo parking lot and I’m managing to strap them all in to my van. And that’s when my 2 y/o starts whimpering that her stomach hurts. I lean in to try to adjust the car seat, thinking maybe her strap thing is too tight and pressing her stomach. And that is when she promptly vomits all over herself, her car seat, and partly on me. 

And then I just broke a little. I think all four of us were crying by that point. 

That’s when this random woman comes up behind me and touches my shoulder. She says “Hey hon, let me help you!” I had never seen her before and I was creeped out. Also, mind you, it’s still very dark out. 

So I said calmly “No, I’m all set.” 

But she doesn’t leave! 

She goes, “It’s okay, I get it, I have kids too” and proceeds to try to move around me to my car where my children are! That’s when I screamed at her “BACK THE F*CK UP and leave us alone!” 

The woman stares at me with a shocked/angry look and says  “Go to hell then”. 

Lovely...But she finally did leave. 

Anyway, I’m back home now, thank goodness. Kids are fine. Husband is coming back tomorrow so that’s great. But I keep thinking about that woman. I’ve never really had a confrontation like that with a stranger and it rattled me a little. AITA for how I handled this?",1370,4035,0.94

310,Not the A-hole,"Background story: my dad remarried when I was 14, and I moved in with him, my stepmother, and her five kids. At the time my mom was an alcoholic and dealing with serious mental health issues, and I was dealing with some trauma and not “the best” teenager. 

However, my stepmom continuously put me down for years- comparing me relentlessly to her perfect five kids. Overall making my life very hard. Major depression in my teens. Thankfully I am now a super well adjusted, happy adult. My dad ignored the bullying from her, not wanting to get involved and jeopardize either relationship.

When I moved out at 17, I ceased all contact with her and am much better for it. My dad has only been in contact with me over the phone since. I am now 26- the last time I saw him I was 18 or 19. My uncle (his brother) thinks he abandoned me and they have fiercely defended me.

I am getting married next year and my uncle offered to walk me down the aisle- which is exactly what I want. I am inviting most of my dads family, and I don’t know whether to invite just him (not my stepmother), and have him watch my uncle walk me down the aisle, or if I should just accept that we have no real relationship and not invite him. I don’t know what to do, we have talked over the phone and I feel like not inviting him at all basically pulls the plug on my illusion of him still being my dad. Also it will be very weird for his family coming that don’t know the details of it. I think my grandmother will have a literal meltdown if her son is not there. I don’t know what is worse, inviting him and taking away all “dad” privileges or just not inviting him altogether.

Side note: extra painful because he is an AMAZING dad to his step kids.

Edit for clarity: He is not a bad man, just a very very very absent father. Leaving a lot out because it got my original post blocked my mods. But long story short- good guy, just has made no effort to be present in the last ten years. I think he is afraid that the sour relationship between me and his wife would cause a lot of issues, so he chooses ambivalence. Sucks more to me because he knows my mom can’t parent, so I’ve been parentless all of my adult life.",68,318,0.96

312,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend and I have been friends for years, but made our relationship official last week. Ever since, I've been in a state of bliss. Because of this, when I went to work this past Monday, I changed my desktop background from the boring default to a selfie she had sent me over the weekend. (NOTE: There's nothing weird about this picture - just her smiling outside.) I work in an office setting, and have a high degree of privacy, so people don't spend the day looking over my shoulder at her smiling face. 

On Thursday, I sent her a playful photo of myself at my desk, and the picture of her was visible on one of my monitors. Within a few minutes, she sent me two photos of herself in her work uniform and said ""use these instead."" She looked absolutely stunning in the photos she sent, but I still preferred the old one she sent me -- primarily because it was a nice casual picture, and she was not in her work uniform.

Thursday night, the topic came up when we were talking on the phone. She again said that she wanted me to change my desktop image to one of the two which she had sent me. I said that I had been using the selfie image for days, didn't mean to flaunt it to her, and that I preferred to keep it. She was adamant that she wanted me to change the photo to on of her in her work uniform. I asked why she wanted me to change it, and her answer was that she liked her pre-selected photos more. Okay.

Now I feel conflicted. I want to respect her wishes, but I also feel like she is micromanaging me. Part of me wishes that I had never showed her that I had changed my desktop to a picture of her. I came in to work this morning and felt a sense of dread when I opened my computer - not something I want to feel when I see her face smiling at me.

Do I acquiesce and let her choose my desktop background, or shut up about it and keep the old one? Avoid everything by changing it back to the boring default?

My wife is pregnant with our twin children. She recently took a break from her job because she's too tired to work and it is a high risk pregnancy.

315,Not the A-hole,"I am a student at the Sorbonne, in Paris, and I am gonna spend next year abroad. Up until last week, everything went smoothly, I aced all my exams and had all my documents, the plane ticket was bought and the only thing left to do was showing up at the university to sign a document - a mere formality, and I had an appointment.

When I arrived there, though, the (horribly rude) clerk (C) told me my department head (DH) didn't send her a personal mail with a list of students allowed to go abroad. I had a printed document signed by the very same DH proving that I was allowed to go, and C could look it up on the uni's server, but she said she wouldn't let me have that last document without DH's mail. ""I *could* let you have it, but if I start making exceptions, everyone will want one and it's going to be a headache.""

*My plane was taking off the very next day at 5 am*, so I couldn't just ""come back tomorrow"" as C told me to. I explained that, and that I couldn't leave the country without that last document, but C didn't give a fuck. We argued for a while, both getting heated up, and C told me that I needed to GTFO because one appointment isn't supposed to take more than a couple minutes and I was keeping other students from having theirs; I told her that I wouldn't move without my signed document.

I told C to call DH, she refused, so I called DH's personal number myself and handed C the phone. ""I cannot touch a student's phone, it's against policy."" So I put it on speakerphone. To be clear, it was in a big open space, with 10+ admins in a row of desks filling documents and 100+ students waiting in line behind me and the other desks, so everyone could hear us arguing with each other, as well as the phone.

On the phone, DH said that yes, I can go abroad, she forgot to send the mail but please sign the document. C refused, said she won't make an exception, she needs that mail. DH said she will send it tomorrow morning because she was not at work, and C repeated ""come back tomorrow,"" and I retorted that I would be *out of the fucking country* then. At that point, we were literally screaming at each other, and everyone else (admins & students) were openly telling us to shut up and that we were bothering everyone and slowing down the whole line.

Security was called, who in turn called a higher up of the uni. Upon hearing everything, the higher up told C to just sign the stupid document, which she did without a pip. She could have done that from the very beginning and just didn't want to, so when the higher up lectured me about making a scene, I refuse to accept blame. I eventually left in a huff of rage with my document, and anger hasn't dissipated yet. Overall, the whole thing lasted over 1h at least.

Was I the AH?

EDIT: To people saying that I am to blame for doing the thing at the last minute before flying out, I didn't have any choice. I had to squeeze that appointment on the (*literally*) only day I had between the end of the school year, an internship and my flight. I had all the documents ready and no reason to believe there would be an issue, as the mistake was made by someone else without my knowledge.

Well we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

When I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.

But then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now. Some classmates called me AH, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, AH was one of them. I just said to her ''You need to calm down and relax'' and walked away.

317,Not the A-hole,"My son’s favourite band announced a concert in our city a few days ago, and he’s been begging me to let him to go ever since. He’s only 15 and I don’t feel comfortable with him going unaccompanied as there’s almost definitely going to be a drinking/drug environment at this concert. The tickets also say that children must be accompanied by somebody over the age of 16. I already know I won’t be able to take him as I’m attending a wedding that weekend. However, he LOVES this band, and I know it would make his year to be allowed to go. 

Last night my daughter (17) also decided she also wanted to go as a group of her friends are planning on attending. I had a bit of a brainwave - my daughter could go with her friends and just keep an eye on my son as well. I figured I’d get a ticket for my son’s friend who loves the band as well so that they could stick together and just stand near my daughter and her group. They’re only 18 months apart so my daughter’s friends all get on well with my son as well. 

My daughter did NOT respond well to this offer - she doesn’t think she should have to “babysit” while she’s having fun with her friends and screamed at me for even suggesting it. I’m not asking her to hold his hand for the full concert, I just think if I’m buying her a ticket that she can keep an eye on her brother during it. Him bringing a friend would make him less dependent on her but I don’t think it’d be an issue with her friend group either as they all get along quite well. 

I’ve told my daughter that the only way I’ll get her a ticket is to take her brother and his friend and she said “over my dead body”. My son doesn’t care about going with his sister, he’s just so excited to even get to go.

AITA here? Both kids want to go and I can’t take my son myself or I definitely would. My son can’t go without somebody over the age of 16 accompanying him. I feel like it’s a fair compromise but my daughter thinks I’m an asshole for forcing my son’s presence on her. He’s going to be so excited for the band he won’t have the time to annoy her in my opinion, so I think she’s really being entitled and unfair when I’m the one shelling out for the ticket in the first place.

322,Asshole,"My wife and I are both south african, she’s black and I am white. We met during Apartheid and we’ve been in love ever since; we got married as soon as it became legal in 1985. We have two children together and while we have had ups and downs, our marriage has been a happy one.

From the moment our relationship came to be, we both were criticised for having a “immoral relationship”; her family didn’t want her to be with the oppressor and my family didn’t want me to be with “lower people”. This caused our relationship to be very strong and stable. As we became used to insults and whispers around us. 

When Mandela ran for office, we both voted for him, I thought that things were finally going to change, that “races” were going to be a thing of the past, and they were for a while. But soon enough my wife was being seen as a “traitor”, and so was I, and why? For the same reasons I previously mentioned; marrying someone of another colour. We are now used to this and now don’t care for it, but in recent years our children (ages 13 and 9) have been insulted relentlessly for being “coloured”. We put them in a black majority school first, were they bullied for having a white father and being “afrikaner dogs” and then we put them in a white majority school hoping for the best, but the process repeated itself. In the end we put them in a french school, which is mixed. But my eldest kid still gets insulted and my smallest doesn’t really have any friends because no one wants to play with the “half-breed”. 

Due to all of this, I’ve come to the conclusion that it can only be good if we move to a country like the UK or Australia, where mixed-race communities are now a normal and accepted thing. However, when I told my wife about this, she said that I had no right to remove my kids from their country and that it would hurt our family in many ways. I tried to explain to her that this was the only way our children could grow up normally without any sort of prejudice against them. But she wouldn’t have it, she isn’t talking to me and is staying at her parents house with our children. I now feel really bad and have to ask myself, am I the asshole here?

Edit: After reading your comments I see how I am the asshole here, I should’ve approached the situation differently, and heard my wife out more than I did. You’re right, a marriage is a partnership not a dictatorship. I’m going to sit and have an actual discussion with her about what honestly is a massive change.",238,1452,0.97
323,Asshole,"I have a six year son from a previous relationship. My GF has a seven year old daughter. My GF and her daughter live with me. I like to make a habit of at least once a month going somewhere small and doing something on a day trip. I've made it clear that while we can always do things, anything bigger (I.E. something outside of town) I want to wait till I have my son so he can go with. She has always obliged in the 3+ years we've dated.

My GF wants to take her daughter and me to Calloway Gardens this weekend. Despite living fairly close, I've never actually been and neither has my son. So I don't really know what to expect there. I told her that if we postpone it a week until I have my son, I would enjoy the trip more. I have a harder time enjoying things if I'm thinking ""My son would have liked this, I wish he was here with us."" 

&#x200B;

This set her off quite a bit. I understand to some level. It does make planning trips harder because we have to wait till weekend that she doesn't have to work, and we have my son. Her exact words were, paraphrased ""It's starting to hurt my feelings, everything revolves around your son \[being here\] and it's like my daughter isn't as important. He's at the beach having fun with his mom, so my daughter should get to have fun this weekend too."" I conceded that is a good point, but I would rather wait if we could because I honestly can't enjoy it as much wishing he were with us. 

&#x200B;

So she un-invited me on the trip. 

(Which brings up a whole other bag of emotions with me, because she goes off on this single mom tirade, and I tell her that if her daughter doesn't see me as a father at this point, it's because my GF treats me as though I'm the optional member of the family. To be fair that's probably not 100% accurate or fair. I could definitely try harder but it feels like there's so many walls up with my GF, I'll never really be allowed to have that role.)

&#x200B;

I get her frustration to some extent, but we have never canceled a trip or doing anything because my son can't go. Her daughter has never been denied anything because my son couldn't go. 

&#x200B;

But I have to consider if I'm being unfair? My son gets to do things with his mom that my GF's daughter doesn't get to do. A lot of it goes back to one time when my son was 4 and he saw a picture of me, my GF, and her daughter at a playground and he realized we DO go places without him.

324,Asshole,"So my gfs parents have never been well off financially. Her dad is the only one that works and doesn't make a lot, they usually live paycheck to paycheck. Her mom stays at home with her brother who has autism and when I've asked in the past why not put him in public school, I always get ""he has special needs"". I understand autism is a real thing, but 1) He's not that bad, just has outbursts and tried to hit when he was younger but I think he grew out of that (I've been with her for 7 years, I know her brother very well).  2) I don't think they're doing him any favors keeping him sheltered when he goes to get a job or something and has no idea how to behave in public because his ""socialization"" was 2 hours at church each week. 

Recently my gfs dad was recently diagnosed with colon cancer that unfortunately has spread. He has short term disability for 12 weeks that covers 60% of his pay and some vacation time for another week to receive his whole check until then. They don't have any savings and he is at risk of losing his job if he isn't able to return to work when his 12 weeks are over, and it won't be likely that he will be able to. 

They expect my gf to pay all of their bills during this time. She is a nurse at a doctors office so she gets paid decently, but she has her own bills to take care of too. Not saying she shouldn't help out, but I don't think the burden should be 100% hers. I understand they like to baby their son, he's 12, but this is a very special circumstance that I think needs special arrangements, like putting him in school that starts next month, and for her mom to get a job to help out. 

I suggested this yesterday and my gf basically blew up at me saying I don't know what's going on and I don't understand. While she's right, I thankfully don't have experience with this kind of situation,  I think this singular aspect of the problem has a pretty straightforward solution.

325,No A-holes here,"With no pressure/discussion my wife would have a bottle of wine a day or more.  She was doing this recently for a few weeks and I had a talk with her and she promised to reduce and did.  

However, she still drinks a glass of wine EVERY day and it is clearly something she needs/depends on.  She is also on a couple medications for anxiety, depression etc.

Reasons I am concerned about it:

* I have to regularly monitor and talk to her about it or she goes back to drinking a bottle of wine a day.  When this happens I usually notice it when reviewing our credit card statement (wine is $15 a bottle here).  There have been months where we spent over $500 on alcohol.
* I feel a little responsible for the most recent issue because we went on vacation and I bought us the drink package.  We both drank probably 10+ drinks a day for a week and I think this may have triggered something.
* It really does seem like an addiction.  One glass isn't too bad I know, but she NEEDS it.  If we have no wine in the house she will go out of her way (or ask me to go out of my way) to get it.  Then again I do the same with coffee.
* She will sometimes drink during the day by herself.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if she is using cash to buy wine to avoid me knowing about it.
* This hasn't happened recently but in the past on several occasions I have come home to her and our son in the house and she was IMO too drunk to be a responsible parent.
* I feel it's a bad example to our son (he is ten and knows the names of several types of wine).
* She frequently complains about her skin, arm fat, blah blah and drinking is not helping her achieve her fitness goals.
* At family and other events I feel she sometimes drinks more than is appropriate for the situation.

I'm posting this because I am well aware that I can sometimes ""have a stick up my ass"" and I also do not want to be a controlling husband.  Many family members of mine have died from alcohol related issues so I am also slightly anti-alcohol.  I still partake though fairly infrequently and moderately.",98,170,0.93
326,Not the A-hole,"In my family, we share a lot of things and I’ve had no problem with it in the past as long as people ask. My sister, M, on top of being a total jerk and textbook definition of troubled teen, won’t usually ask. She’s had a history with coming into my room and taking my phone charger when she wants and not even having the decency to give it back or tell me she took it so I’ll search the whole house looking for it. Last time I let her borrow my charger, she broke it and refused to apologize. Because of this, I’m already reluctant to let her use it. Especially after yesterday. 

When she handed me back my charger yesterday, it had bite marks and the inner layer was exposed. It still works, but probably not for much longer. She asked to borrow it and returned it when I asked, but I’m angry that now I’ll have to buy a new one and my family and I are already low on money as is. 

This, plus the fact that she was up all night blasting music and talking really loud (her room is next to mine. She doesn’t have a door and I leave mine open so the dogs can get in and out), has me already annoyed. I didn’t say anything till this morning since she was having a serious convo with my mom all night, but I did ask her to turn the music down around the 4th time I was awaken (and she laughed and said no). Because of this, I’m already annoyed. When she asks to use it shortly after, I said no. Her response? She grabs the charger and tries to take it anyway. I grab onto it and tell her no cause she damaged it and to stop pulling on it. 

M calls me rude and says the damage was from our niece (who just turned 3) biting on it when she was babysitting her. I tell her she still can’t have it and my mom yells at me from the other room to give it and I still refuse. M calls me a Bitch and my mom says she can see why M doesn’t want a relationship with me and that’s good. 

That last bit stung because M recently told me she didn’t want a relationship with me, so I took away her Netflix and Hulu account since I pay for it and the tv. I gave it back to her (altho her Netflix was deleted and I gave her a new profile) but now I’m thinking about taking it away again if not now, then when I leave for college in a month. 

Our mom never follows through with a punishment. M isn’t supposed to have her phone for the summer after running away. It’s why M always feels entitled to everything. She’ll do something bad and look me in the eyes and say it doesn’t matter cause she won’t get in trouble anyway. I’m not her mom, but I’ve done my best to support her and this household for years. If my mother can’t stick with a punishment, I feel compelled to do something so she loses this sense of entitlement and awful behavior before it’s too late.",25,73,0.94

I'm not even going to go into the fact that we have 3 cats that don't meow much (we have cameras), that we have succulents that we don't water as often as she complains about water dripping, and that neither of us smokes. The fact is this woman is driving us crazy. For several years now, we would listen to her complaints, apologize and try to keep it down, but a few weeks ago we had some repair work done at our apartment so while my boyfriend was doing the work, I went down there to ask them for some patience and understanding. To my surprise (horror?) I could hear extremely muffled sounds in their apartment. Almost nothing. And he was literally HAMMERING and DRILLING shit upstairs.

I asked him if he was going easy with the hammer/drill, he said no, that it was super loud. So the conclusion was - they can't hear shit. We've been walking on fucking tip toe for fear of disturbing this poor old couple, I listen to music so quietly, I can't even hear it. So we decided to stop living like church mice and behave normally and to ignore them completely. Now when she calls after me, I just keep walking. When she knocks on my door, I don't answer. Same with her husband. And my boyfriend does the same. Last week, she knocked on my door for a straight 10 minutes, shouting ""I know you're in there"" and would only leave when my next door neighbor told her to gtfo or they'll call the police. Yesterday, she waited until 6pm which is when I come home after work, and started shouting from her window at me. There's a kids' playground in front of our building, and everyone could hear her screaming.

This is where I start to feel kind of bad. She's becoming a nuisance to other people only because we're ignoring her. I don't know what to do. I want to keep ignoring her. But it feels shitty to put other people through this.",218,3414,0.98
329,No A-holes here,"(my first post, please be gentle)

Me (32) and my wife (32) have been married for almost 10 years. We got pregnant shortly after our wedding. Unfortunately, due to unknown reasons, our son was prematurely born at 6 months, and unfortunately only survived 4 days.

Each passing year, in the days coming up to what would be his birthday, my wife understandably goes through an array of emotions. However, on his birthday, my wife likes to act like it's his actually birthday.I mean, she will buy birthday cakes, balloons, little presents and even go to the cinema/bowling and other things a child would do on a birthday.

It would be our son's 9th birthday this weekend, and my wife again has plans to celebrate and throw a mini party.

AITA for thinking this is going too far? Or is this acceptable behaviour?

330,Asshole,"Alright, so... I'm 26y/o (M) and can barely cover my rent in a flatshare. My brother asked me and my roommate if he could stay over after parents threw him out. They'd threatened to do this as soon as he turned 18y/o, so they came through I guess.

The flatshare is barely big enough for the two of us (roommate and I), let alone another person. My brother is currently sleeping on the hallway floor. However if I tell him to leave, which my roommate wants me to do as soon as possible, he won't have anywhere to go except a homeless shelter. He doesn't currently have a job or any savings.

331,Asshole,"First-time poster, so apologies for any mistakes.

I (early 30's F) bought a little fixer-upper cabin deep in the woods, and have been slowly transforming it into my dream home. The whole reason I went for this particular house was its rural location. I really like my privacy.

That being said, being this isolated can make a person feel vulnerable. So when I realized that someone was regularly walking on this tiny little deer path behind the house, with an unobstructed view and access to my bedroom window and backdoor, it creeped me out. The path doesn't lead anywhere in particular, just deeper into the woods, so I couldn't imagine any reason for anyone to be needing to walk there.

I never saw the person, either, just found the tracks afterwards. I didn't have a dog at the time, and legally I couldn't set up cameras, because the path is not on my property. It made me feel unsafe and paranoid to know a stranger could be around at any given moment, without me having any idea they were even there.

After a couple of months, I realized I had to do something. I decided to wait for the person to show up, and then have a polite conversation about the situation if they didn't look like an ax murderer. However, they managed to keep taking their walks exactly when I wasn't looking. The only thing I could think of was to write a note for them to see. I used a super friendly tone, apologized for the awkwardness, and made it clear I understood this was a 'me problem'. After the next day or two, the walks stopped. The woods feel friendly and safe again.

I got what I wanted, but I worry I might have been out of line and/or unreasonable. This person must have been just enjoying the nature, not even realizing someone would mind. Me confronting them may have embarrassed them or made them feel like I was accusing them of being a creep. Also, legally I had no right to ask them not to walk there.

AITA for the way I handled the situation?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I don't know if this makes a difference, but I see people referring to the deer path as public property or a community space, so I thought I'd clarify. It's someone else's private lands, and not any kind of a public recreational space. You literally have to come up to someone's house in the middle of nowhere, and then keep walking past their house and yard. Also, the area is chock-full of similar tiny little deer paths. You have plenty of options if you just want to take a nice walk in the woods. I suppose this person just really liked this particular path for some reason.

If the consensus is that I'm the asshole, I'll accept it. I appreciate everyone's comments (even the one who suggests I'm simply crazy and the stranger didn't, in fact, exist :D ).

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thank you for all the verdicts and comments. I was clearly in the wrong. I have to say, though, that while I fully agree that the note was a tacky and awkward way of dealing with the situation and I really wish I could take it back, I'm surprised almost no one would feel uncomfortable in a similar situation. Like, you are all alone in the woods, over half an hour's drive from civilization, surrounded by nothing but trees and wildlife. No traffic, because there is a long private road that leads to your house and nowhere else, from another tiny road that has maybe 2 cars passing every hour. You don't need to lock your doors or close your curtains, because the idea of anyone showing up is ludicrous. Then you realize that actually, one person keeps coming up to your place on a daily basis or at least every couple of days. You never see them, you don't know who they are, you never know when they are coming. Just that this one person keeps going out of their way to take walks behind your house. You are not a nervous or helpless person, and you tell yourself it's just someone who's enjoying the nature. But time passes, and you never once manage to see who it is and to verify that it is, indeed, just someone harmless who doesn't feel awkward about walking so close to someone else's house. You guys would just be like, 'nah, that's fine'? You wouldn't feel uneasy at all? Really? If so, then you must be a hell of a lot braver than I am, and I congratulate you on that. :D

&#x200B;

EDIT 3: It's getting difficult to respond to individual comments, and I worry about crossing the line between 'engaging in conversation' and 'jeez, get a life, because you are hyper-intense and cringey and too damn invested in this'. I feel like my mental health has been speculated on enough already, especially since I was not asking, 'AITA for being really into privacy?'. I don't think I'm mentally ill for finding it a little weird and unnerving that a complete stranger with plenty of options would specifically choose to walk unnoticed right next to my completely and utterly isolated house basically every day. I don't think I'm spoiled or a Karen for wishing the person would just choose another equally pleasant option in the vast isolated woods with literally endless amounts of identical deer paths. Like, go left half a mile earlier and enjoy the same exact scenery you get if you walk all the way up to my house. 

I also don't think that if you live alone in the woods that you can never feel unsafe, or you are just not cut out for it. Crime and violence and stalking and Bad Stuff happens, even if statistically, the chances of it happening to you are very slim. I think being aware of potential risks to your safety and well-being when you are in a vulnerable position is a perfectly common sense thing to do. Doesn't mean you are shivering under the covers, clutching a cleaver, just that you feel uneasy and wish to make sure everything is okay. In my case, I had no way of verifying the person who made me feel threatened was just a harmless nature enthusiast, even if most likely I had nothing to be afraid of. What I wanted to know was if I handled this situation that caused me discomfort poorly, fearing I had. You guys confirmed that was the case, and I thank you for that.",125,71,0.84
332,Not the A-hole,"Title sounds kinda bad, just bear with me here. I’m under 18 & female & live with my parents. My mom was raised in an unstable household and sometimes has boundary & privacy issues. I try to be empathetic because I know that’s probably how her parents were with her.
Just for some context, I have a friend who is a huge homebody and doesn’t usually come to my house often. It’s okay, I understand the want to be at your own house & I am always up to go over there. I don’t feel offended at all. My mom has expressed offense and thinks that my friend doesn’t like her, even not letting me go over to her house because of it.
Cut to a couple days ago and I had said friend plus another over at my house as well (this is a rare occasion) and we were just chilling in my room. We had some snacks in my room that my mom had bought for us and my mom came in a couple times (without knocking) to get snacks or bring them back. I am used to my mother not knocking so it didn’t matter. 
And then this friend was changing into pajamas, had just taken her bra and shirt off and was looking for a different shirt when my mom came in and didn’t knock. 
I thought my mom would see her changing and say sorry and leave but she didn’t. She had been drinking and was obviously drunk. She REFUSED to get out unless we gave her the snacks. I saw how uncomfortable my friend was and then tried to yell at my mom even more so that she would leave. I screamed, told her to get the fuck out because my friend was changing, whatever. I normally would not have cussed directly at her but my friend looked very uncomfortable. She came in anyway, grabbed the snacks she wanted, mocked & laughed at me and then left. I apologized over & over to my friend & was actually really embarrassed because of how my mom had acted. If I had been in my friends shoes I would have not come back over. 
(My mom also had a guest over who witnessed all of this) 
I didn’t talk to my mom for a day or two afterward and then when she asked why, I told her. She said she wasn’t looking at my friend and didn’t see anything, and that I was disrespectful for cussing at her & embarrassing her in front of her guest. She said that it wasn’t a big deal and that I was cruel to make her feel bad for it when she didn’t see anything. 
I tried to tell her that this is why my friend prefers to stay at her house but she just kept turning it back on me and making me feel like I was being too harsh. 
I don’t see how I’m TA, please help me out.

Edit: My mom NEVER knocks, this has been a long term issue. I have had issues before with smoking or whatever but I would say I’m a pretty good kid and I’ve told her several times it makes me uncomfortable- she sees it as me hiding, so eventually I just lost steam. 

2nd Edit: The reason why I cussed at her was that it was all I could do. I thought she’d see my friend changing and understand and leave, so when she didn’t I told her to please get out and then from there started yelling because she wouldn’t leave. I couldn’t have tried to close the door on her or make her leave physically because my mom can get aggressive when she’s drunk like that.",44,138,0.96

334,Not the A-hole,"My sister and I are twins (35) and she has a 16 year old son. I'm an openly gay man, and my whole family knows and loves my partner. A few months ago, when my nephew came for a visit, he came out to me as gay. He said there was a boy at his school that he's in love with and that they've been together for about 2 months.

He said he hasn't spoken to his parents about it and asked me to keep it a secret and I said no problem. Then he started asking me all sorts of questions, about dating and love, about being gay, about me and what it was like coming out 15 years ago, about my partner, and at the end he got enough courage to ask me about sex. I told him everything I deemed was important and necessary for him to know and asked if he was thinking about sleeping with his boyfriend. He said yes, so I gave him some concrete advice concerning lube and condoms and whatnot.

Anyway, it was a pleasant and normal conversation, he seemed very happy and that was that. Some time later, he decided to come out, last weekend, during a family lunch. His parents and grandparents were there, his sister, myself and my partner. He had a little speech about what a great family we are and how lucky he is seeing how much everyone accepts me and my partner, and knowing he would be equally loved and accepted.

After lunch, he was helping his mom in the kitchen and (this was all told me to me by my nephew; I wasn't there personally) my sister asked him if he was seeing someone. He told her about his boyfriend and she said ""Don't go doing anything silly! Do we need to have a chat about the birds and the bees?"" And he said there was no need since he talked to me already.

My sister flipped out. She came out to the porch, pulled me inside and started screaming at me that what the fuck was I thinking talking to her kid about sex. That he's only 16 and I was only encouraging him to do it. I said that if he had decided to do it, he could have done it without asking me anything first. Then she backtracked and said it was not my place, that I am not his parent and that herself or her husband should have been the ones to talk to him. I said they probably don't know much about gay sex, and she got even angrier and demanded I tell her what I told him. I only said that she was being ridiculous.

As a result of all this, my nephew is now grounded (because my sister and her husband don't want him having sex?) and I'm not getting my calls answered. My partner thinks that maybe, just maybe, I should have advised my nephew to talk to his parents before talking to him about anything. But I think that's silly. What kid wants to talk to their parents about sex??  I don't think I'm an asshole, my sister and brother in law do, and my partner is neutral. What do you think?",1255,8048,0.95

336,Everyone Sucks,"For context I am mixed race but look “white passing”, although for the most part I am racially ambiguous. I grew up with my Jamaican family so some of my mannerisms are what would usually be associated with black culture. 

I was in a shopping mall when I got into an argument with another shopper who pushed me on the escalator. A black male security guard came over to see what was happening and as he did I happened to call the woman a common Jamaican insult. I usually try to refrain from doing this but there was a lot of give and take insults going on and my temper got the better of me and when it does, the Jamaican just comes out.

The situation finally de-escalated but as I was walking off the security guard stepped in front of me and told me “little white girls [I’m 23] shouldn’t be using Jamaican language” and that it’s a “disgusting insult to Jamaican culture” because I “don’t understand or respect the people” and that I should leave the mall because I was racist.

I told him I was actually mixed race and knew exactly what the words meant and that he should mind his business. My lock screen on my phone is a family photo which I held up to show him. I told him I would not be leaving if he didn’t kick the other lady out also (although neither of us did anything worthy of being asked to leave, just a bit of an argument). I walked off without letting him say another word (he didn’t try to stop me) and carried on my day. 

When I got home however the situation was nagging me. I feel like I was unfairly judged and that the security guard was actually the racist one. So I wrote a formal complaint to the mall and provided details of the guard that addressed me. I did accuse him of racism and of unfairly trying to kick me out. 

My boyfriend thinks I overreacted and could cost him his job and because I don’t look obviously black the security guard wasn’t wrong to call me white. He thinks because he didn’t actually kick me out I can’t complain. AITA for complaining about him?

EDIT: because people want to know how the argument happened. This wasn’t the original basis of my question so I didn’t put it in. I more wanted to know about the security guard but if y’all find it important: 
She put her hand on my back and pushed me forward two steps because I unintentionally stepped on the toe of her shoe (I just put my foot on the step behind me, didn’t even know she was there). I admit I jumped the bat on getting a little angry but the woman had literally pushed me before I had a chance to apologise. She started the insults by asking if I was blind or “just fucking dumb” and then I kind of lost my temper. She called me a fat whore, I called her a bitch and so on.

EDIT 2: I called her a bumboclaat. Wasn’t my classiest reaction, I’ll admit. Didn’t put it in the original post because I wasn’t sure of Reddit’s rules.

FINAL EDIT: thank you everyone for your judgments and views. I am aware that I could have handled the argument with the lady better and I accept I suck for that but tbh it barely affected my day. After hearing from everyone I no longer feel bad for reporting the security guard; he was racist and a little bit sexist and he needs to know that’s not okay. I feel better having talked about it and heard other people’s stories, I’m glad I came to AITA.",238,346,0.92
337,Not the A-hole,"My brother (47m) is a real piece of work. He has various children he never sees. His latest batch of kids with the most recent baby momma are in and out of foster homes due to the mothers drinking and drug habits and also domestic abuse because of the types of men she chooses to shack up with.

Today I (34f) heard from my mother that my brothers daughter (11 year old) has been put in a foster home in another city when usually she'd be placed with another member of her mother's family but apparently they have issues as well. My brother suggested to my mom that I take his daughter for 6 months. 

Currently my brother lives with another woman with a handful of her kids. He hasnt stepped up to take in his own kids yet is expecting me to do something about it cause I don't have kids, am not married so apparently my life doesn't seem to matter.

If I do this now, it'll likely be a lifetime thing and I'll end up taking in his other kids as well, my nephew and 2 other step nephews. So 4 kids total. 

My extended and immediate family is a train wreck and my first thought is that it's best for the kids to be in a foster home far away from our dysfunctional family so at least they'll have stability somehow or a chance at a somewhat decent life if they're lucky. 

Am I the asshole for not sacrificing my life for this despite not having anything going on right now?

*I just wanted to add, I love those kids. Dont get me wrong, I've helped them a lot when my brother and that woman never had enough food for them.

339,Asshole,"I'll start with a bit of background about me. I'm highly educated and successful. I earned a doctorate a few years ago and subsequently got a job making ~$125,000. I eventually decided to quit that job and go back to school for a second doctorate that will (if all goes according to plan) increase my earning potential to more than triple that amount within the next decade.

My ex-girlfriend, whom I dated for more than five years, was also highly educated. She only had one doctorate but completed years of postgraduate training that enabled her to work in the top 1% of the field. While this was a benefit in many ways (e.g. being able to connect with someone who was intellectually on my level), it was also surprisingly challenging in the sense that our demanding schedules often conflicted. It was a situation in which I would suggest, for example, that we go to an event in our city, but she would have to fly out of town for a conference. Or she would want to take a trip, but I had obligations and couldn't get off.

I'm currently dating a woman who is certainly not stupid but isn't quite on my level or my ex-girlfriend's level. She only holds a bachelor's and has bounced around a number of different types of employment since finishing college. The other night she was complaining about not knowing what direction she wants to take her life and feeling like she's just floating along. I decided to open up to her and admit that since my profession makes good money but eats up an exorbitant amount of my time, I honestly wouldn't mind having a housewife. Coming home to a clean living space, a home-cooked meal waiting for me, the laundry done, and the dishes washed sounds lovely. It's not like we'd need the money with my salary, and she could spend her extra time on her hobbies instead of slogging through jobs about which she isn't passionate (I'm vehemently opposed to having children, so childcare wouldn't be an issue here). Or she could get a part-time job just to have something to do. It seems like a win/win to me in the sense that whenever I have the time outside of work to have fun with the money for which I've worked so hard, my partner would be available so we could enjoy our leisure time to the fullest extent.

She got upset, called me a ""misogynist,"" and has been distant for the past couple of days. I don't understand what I did to warrant that reaction. I never said or even implied that I hate women. And I never even said that I feel that women shouldn't pursue careers if they choose to do so. I simply said that if she felt happy with the idea, then I wouldn't mind it if she'd rather not work, which is a considerate way of recognizing her frustrations with the jobs she's held and proposing a mutually beneficial solution. All she had to do was say, ""Thanks, but that would make me feel even less satisfied than I do now,"" and I would've dropped it. Thoughts?",671,816,0.84
340,Not the A-hole,"This is my first time posting something, bear with me. English is not my first language, throwaway.

So, this happened like 7 years ago when I was 17(F). This needs a little bit of back story, my parents since my father moved to another town (I was 10) for work had a really weird relationship. As in, my father was cheating. They were together when he was in town, it happened like every 2 months if even that(he lived 1h30 away, just to show you how much he sucks)

So it was a public holiday, he was in town, they decided to have dinner at home with me, my brother, my mother’s “best friend” (MBFF), herself and my beloved father. All went well, my father and the MBFF had a lot to drink, we were all talking until it got kinda late and me and my brother had to go to bed because we have school the next day.

&#x200B;

I wake up thinking oh I need to pee, innocent, thinking that’s why my brain woke me up. Ear some noises, still not fully awake, go to the living room, see my mom sitting on the couch, she always sleeps on the couch and realize the noises are coming from my “parents” bedroom.

Realize MBFF is in there with my father. Now, I **HATE** my father with all of my heart and I **despise** MBFF, I was not letting that happen.

&#x200B;

I get to the bedroom door, which is closed, and this is how it goes:

&#x200B;

**Me:** what the fuck is happening?

**\*silence\***

**Me:** I will ask again, what the fuck do you think you’re doing?

**F:** OP. go away. Go to sleep.

**M:** Not happening, you have 1 minute to get out of this house or I will get you out myself. (no way would I be able to, my father is a fat fuck and so is she. Didn’t care).

**F:** JUST LEAVE

**M:** Listen here you crazy motherfucker, I thought you couldn’t go lower on the Shitty father scale but you somehow manage to find a new level. I’m serious, you get the FUCK out right now.

*(While I was screaming I was also kicking the door and simulating I was about to open)*

F and MBFF open the door, she’s crying and he’s red like a tomato. Still with only is pants on, thinking that he would just open the door so SHE could leave but that’s not fucking happening.

**M:** You think she’s the only one leaving? No, **YOU** are also leaving and I do not want to see that ugly face of yours until they are lowering you down to your grave.

He left, didn’t say a word.

Before every birthday or gift giving holiday, I remind my beautiful fiancé that my ears are not pierced and to not get me earrings. I get that a lot of women do have their ears pierced and it’s a pretty savvy gift to give if that’s the case, and I wanted to always set him up for success.

342,No A-holes here,"Hello all,

first, a little bit of background:

This happened about a year ago, when me and 3 friends of mine went on a cruise. It is important to know, that everyone on this 13 hour flight to Jamaica was a guest of this cruise.

When we reserved the seats, we checked a website where you can find the best seats for a specific type of plane, and decided to get the first middle row (4 seats) in the front of the cabin, where you would not have anyone sitting in front of you and at least a little bit more legspace. Let me add here, that we are are rather tall (between 6.1 and 6.4).

Now to the actual story. When we boarded the plane, a flight attendant and a woman with her practically newborn baby were standing in our row, asking if they might sit there and we shift to the back of the plane (cramped up seating), as this row would have a mount for baby-bassinets.

I asked the flight attendant, if there would be an option to get us economy plus seats (emergency exits) or shift us to Business Class, and the flight attendant declined. The flight attendant also did not formally ask/order us to switch seats, as it is possible to fly without the bassinet. Like this, we declined the request, as we needed the legspace, made the reservation early enough, and appearantly the airline didn't really care.

On a side note: I can not understand, why young families have to book a 13h flight and a carribean cruise with a newborn baby. Europe (Where I am from) has a lot of beautiful places with a lot shorter flights until the child can at least sit on its own.

So reddit, AITA for not giving away our seats to the family?",213,637,0.93
343,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my mom was super restrictive about what I wore. As a kid and teenager. I was only allowed to wear pink baby blue and red. Worst it all had to be one color and the same 2 outfits. A polo shirt with a skirt or a sweater with a long dress. No winter jackets or pants which wasn't a big deal because I live in NC but still. I also had to wear pigtails all the time. I had to wear this outfit at all times except when in bed.

My parents are divorced and when I went to my dad's she would force me to send her pictures of myself every hour or so and if I wasn't dressed up to her standard she would ground me for two weeks when I went back to her house.

Eventually I had a breakdown around 16 and to make a long story short I ended up living with my dad and basically visiting my mom every once in awhile. 

Around this time I got into the whole Industrial cyber goth thing. Ended up dying my hair black, wearing all black and getting a ton of piercings. I was like this for rest of High School.

Eventually started adding more color to my outfit. Iike white and purple and ended up becoming a bit less goth but black is still my favorite color.

When I visit my mom now I make sure to be as goth as possible and sometimes go overboard like painting my skin white and stuff. And I know it drives her insane but I only visit her when she has other family members over. She doesn't really have the balls to say anything when other people are around.

344,Not the A-hole,"I recently graduated med school and got a job in the ER of a fantastic hospital. This hospital is short staffed when it comes to doctors in the ER so I have been working some long shifts usually 12-24 hour shifts.

My family loves coming to me for injuries and stuff before going to the hospital and urgent care because they don’t want to spend money unnecessarily just to be told it’s the cold, a bad bug bite etc..

One particular family member has been coming over right after my 24+ hour shifts. She would have her kid checked out for very minor things that no normal person would even ask about like scraped knees and a busted lip. After I get home from the long shift, I go right to bed because I am dead from exhaustion. Every time this family member comes over, I am effectively woken up out of my sleep. They have been just like the injuries above, scraped knee and busted lip. This time it was another scraped knee, albeit a nasty one but nothing some antiseptic and a big bandaid would cure. Once I bandaged the kid, I sent her outside and the lost it on this family member. I told her “I am tired of being woken up for basic first aid injuries. I have been dealing with patients ALL NIGHT that have severed fingers or a whole hand in an accident or gunshot and stab victims and car crash injuries. I have been awake all day and night helping those who have an actual need for a doctor and am getting sick and tired of being woken up after my long ass shifts for a fucking scraped knee”. She looked shocked and just walked out, she grabbed her kid who was playing in the front yard and left. I had asked the family member not to bring herself or her kid over for med help or advice if it is something that she can truly take care of at home without a doctor, just like before I was a doctor. My mom says I am an asshole for snapping at her but I was beyond exhausted from my shift and tired of being woken up to just administer a bandaid.

AITA for snapping at a family member?",47,124,0.95
345,Everyone Sucks,"So a couple of years ago my sister needed a place to stay , so she moved in with my wife and I.  Unfortunately after just a few weeks my wife and sister got into some heated arguments. My sister said some awful, hurtful things to my wife, and my wife said some awful things to my sister. They almost got into a fist fight, but were separated quickly. 

Anyway my sister moved out of our house, but ever since that day, my sis and wife have not seen or talked to each other. Their relationship is so bad I don't speak with my sister on the phone when my wife is around, because my wife starts crying. I usually talk or text my sister during breaks at work or when I am out alone. All of my family took my sisters side, and no longer speak to my wife. 

My sister is getting married soon, and invited me, but  told me she did not want my wife to be there.  My parents who live 800 miles away, and who I don't see often, are coming to the wedding and need someone to take them to the ceremony and reception. I offered to take them and am planning on going to my sisters wedding just for like 3 hours or so. 

Months ago my wife agreed that I should go with my parents to the wedding. However now that the wedding is closer, my wife has been feeling sad, acting different and has told me her friends think I am a jerk for going to my sisters wedding, while she stays home alone. I just don't know AITA??

Edit: Not sure if it matters or not, but the fights between my sister and wife were over my sisters dog, and how my sister didn't take care of it, (had the dog  tied up all day and did not pay attention to it) while she was living with us. Also my wife is so sensitive because we had helped my sister with alot of different things in the past, and my wife feels like my sis was ungrateful.

Edit/Update: I realized IATA and have been for a long time now. I decided I will not be going to the wedding, and instead will be spending the day with my wife doing something fun.  Thank you everyone for all the great points that were brought up.",413,1435,0.96
346,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because people know my main.

&#x200B;

I work for a medium-sized company, but my team is extremely small.  Seeing as I just started not too long ago, I've been making an effort to get to know everyone on my team on a more personal level. I grabbed lunch on our break with a coworker on my team today, we'll call her Jennifer. I'd had time to get to know pretty much everyone but her prior, so I was looking forward to actually getting to know her.

&#x200B;

So, I asked her what she does outside of work. She said she pretty much only goes to church. That's all she said she does. Trying to make conversation, I asked her about her church. As it turns out, it's a very conservative southern baptist church. She then turned the line of questioning on to me, and asked about my faith. I'm Jewish, but a pretty secular, almost non-believing Jew, like some of the other people on our team. Jennifer found it hard to process that I could identify with being Jewish, and at the same time, not really believe in God. It's fairly common to see that nowadays- people who identify as Jewish, but don't really believe in it strongly. She asked me why I think that Jews are ""straying away from God"". Here's where shit happens.

&#x200B;

I mentioned (among other reasons like society becoming more secular) that some Jews in particular might believe that a loving God would not allow atrocities such as the Holocaust to happen, and as a result, stopped believing. I've seen it argued before. Jennifer told me that God is a loving God, but he is also a just God, and wanted to punish the Jews for rejecting Jesus when they had been given so many opportunities to accept him.

&#x200B;

Hold up. What? She then went on to say that God is merciful, and did save some Jews. I straight up asked her if she was saying that the Holocaust was justified. She danced around the question, but ultimately said that it was predicted in the bible that the Jews would be punished for straying from God, and that clearly, they had strayed. I asked once again if she was saying that the Jews deserved to be systematically murdered. Jennifer simply replied that God's blessing is not a right, it is a privilege, and the Jews can't turn their backs on god for getting the punishment that was predicted for them. In my opinion, this is a needlessly callous and cruel view of a genocide. I would call it needlessly cruel if she said this about Armenia, or Rwanda, or Cambodia.

&#x200B;

I was fuming. Here's where I might be the asshole for going to HR. She will get deported if she gets fired as she's on a work visa. Her wedding is in a few months, and she's getting married to someone also on a visa. I know we shouldn't have even gotten on to this topic, but the cat's out of the bag about how she feels. I have to sit in meetings with her. I have to go to work events with her. I'm at a crossroads here and I want to know if I should tell someone or just let it go.",64,67,0.91

348,Not the A-hole,"I have a female friend (I'm a dude) that has a very annoying habit of sending me a text message, then calling me right after.  If I don't pick up she will call back every 5 minutes, usually at least three times.  It's been up to 5 in a 1/2 hour.  

I've talked to her about this before, and indicated it really irritates me.  She said she understood and would stop.  She was good about it for awhile, but she's been slowly starting to do it again.  

Tonight when it happened I sent her a text saying I would call her when I got a chance, and to stop the multiple calls.  I also reminded her we've had this conversation.  

When I was done eating I called her and she didn't pick up.  Went to take a shit and of course there's a message and a missed call.  Called her back and she was in tears.  Asked her what was wrong and she kept saying I obviously didn't care because I didn't want to talk.  

I don't really talk on the phone to anyone but family.  I don't think I was at all harsh.  I think she's too old for this behavior (30s), and for essentially ignoring what I consider a completely reasonable request.  I admit to being a little hard to get a hold of at times, but calling me once or calling me 5 times isn't going to make me call someone back any quicker and is frustrating if I'm doing something and have to mute the phone.  

Is the multiple call thing some social norm I'm not aware of?  Do women do this with each other?  I have a fair amount of female friends and notice that they will call multiple times a day if I don't pick up (like 2 times over 5 hours which doesn't bother me at all).  I don't really ever talk to my male friends on the phone unless we're trying to nail down specific plans.  

I'm honestly a little lost because of the reaction from someone I consider reasonable.

TL/DR :  Friend will call multiple times in a row if I don't pick up after being asked not to.  Cried when I told her to knock it off today.  Think I'm probably missing something because she's otherwise very normal and easy to read.",31,25,0.84
349,Not the A-hole,"A few weeks ago, my family and another family we are close to decide to take all the kids to the neighborhood splash pad. We arrived about 15 minutes before the waterworks were turned on, so I took our kids to the playground while we waited. Fifteen minutes go by and the splash pad opens up. The entire playground emptied except me and a mysterious, and adorable, toddler-aged girl who was attracted to my hula hoops. Well, I figure her parents are close by and I help her out with a hula hoop for a few minutes. She was really sweet, couldn't talk yet, but a very happy baby. After a few minutes, we're still alone. I don't see anyone looking for her. So, I think maybe they can't see her where we were and I walk out into the grass field by the playground equipment, knowing that she will follow me. She's super slow because she's so tiny and we get about 30 ft before I decide we need another plan. I walk back towards the playground and the parking lot, with little one still in tow. To be clear, I never coaxed this little girl to come with me, picked her up, or touched her in any way. We get to the parking lot and an older girl walks up to us. She said that's her little sister she was supposed to be watching. I've been alone with this toddler for at least 10 minutes. I asked where their mother was and she pointed to a car in the parking lot. There was a woman in it, on her phone, with the windows rolled up. I approach the car, with the two girls following me. I knock on her window to get her attention, and let her know that her sweet baby was following me around, I had no idea whose kid it was, and that wasn't ok. I was FAIRLY civil because I just wanted to get this girl to an adult so I could go spend time with my family. This woman blames the older girl (later found out that she's 8) because ""she was supposed to be watching the baby"". I said ""I'm sorry, but no. You're supposed to watch her. Don't put that on your daughter, she's too young to be responsible for a toddler."" At this point, the woman gets out of her car and starts screaming threats and insults at me, so I called the cops. The cop said I should have left the little girl on the playground alone and found a park worker. He also did nothing about her screaming at me and threatening me and said he would NOT be reporting her to CPS or giving me any information to use to report her myself. I did manage to take a picture of her license plate and called Tennessee CPS hotline. The girls were well dressed, clean, seemed happy, but leaving them unattended in a park is the WORST idea. No one seemed to care enough about that, so I called CPS. I don't think she's an awful mother or anything, but when I tried to warn her about the situation, she threatened me and the cop didn't care enough to say anything to her.

350,No A-holes here,"I've been friends with this individual, let's call him Keith, for awhile now. We went to high school together, saw each other during the summers while at separate colleges, and hung out frequently since we both ended up in the same area post graduation. During college I started dating a mutual friend, we'll call her Cindy. She also went to our high school and ended up at the college I went to. Cindy, Keith, and I all had very similar friends, so we hung out often. We dated for about 1.5 years and broke up when we realized there were some core beliefs that we didn't have in common. It was pretty hard for me right after the break up and I still care about her, but I realized it was for the best in the end. While we aren't very close anymore, we still share a lot of mutual friends and see each other at social events with no issues.

Fast forward about a year after the break up and Keith, a few friends, and myself are at a bar. Keith asks to speak with me privately and wants to know if it would be ok to ask Cindy out. He says he has had a crush on her since high school and they had recently been talking more frequently. He made it sound like they had discussed dating in detail already but he wasn't going to start dating her until he talked to me. I was honest with him and I told him I wouldn't be comfortable with him asking her out/dating. While I can handle seeing her at social events I don't think I would be comfortable with a close friend dating her. It'd make going to those events awkward for me and I honestly don't think I would go to them if they were there as a couple. Keith reassures me that he won't act on it if it's going to make me uncomfortable.

A few weeks pass and I don't hear anything on the topic until I get a message from Keith saying he can't keep his promise. He's wanted to date Cindy for awhile now and he feels like this could become something serious. I had a feeling in the back of my mind that he may end up breaking his promise but it still took me by surprise when I read the message. I was pretty frustrated and felt betrayed by a pretty close friend. It's been a couple of months now and I haven't spoken to him or gone to any social things where I know one or both of them will be there. A couple of our mutual friends feel like I'm being the asshole for not wanting to interact with him after this. They say I'm acting childish by avoiding him and that friends date their friend's exes all the time without issues. He's apparently not doing well with the fact that I'm not interacting with him, though he hasn't directly talked to/messaged me about it. Obviously I don't think I'm overreacting by not wanting him in my life anymore. I don't think it's fair to put a friend in that position and wouldn't do it if the roles were reversed.

351,Not the A-hole,"
this happend a few days ago and the fallout has been pretty bad so I want to hear your thoughts. 

I have a wonderful 8 year old girl who is my entire world, it was her 8th birthday a few days ago so I decided to throw her a family and friends birthday party for her. 

one of the people she wanted the most at the party was my brother, or uncle Joe. 
he promised he would be there and told her that he would not miss it. he pinky promised (over the phone)
he also promised a big present. 

2 hours into the party and Joe is nowhere to be seen, I had tried calling him but he never picked up. finally he turned up, he looked very disheveled. 

my daughter runs up to him, she is pretty happy he turned up, that's until he hands her his gift. 

it's an unwrapped 2$ shop barbie that had already been opened and was missing a shoe, now I have taught my daughter to be grateful about gifts but you could tell how crestfallen she was, she asked Joe where her big present was and he said ""oh I'm sorry I forgot it"" she burst into tears and ran off crying, she was already getting annoyed because she thought uncle Joe was not coming, so this was kinda the icing on the cake. 

my brother got annoyed and demanded I make my daughter apologize, I told him to get fucked and kicked him out of the party. 

my family are so devided on this that I want some non family members to tell me if I was the asshole.",274,1021,0.97
352,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently at an Airbnb in an area where it has been consistently high eighties and humid. I am renting one room in an apartment for a couple weeks for work. The listing had AC listed as an amenity which was something that was important to me as I don't deal with this kind of weather well. 

Anyways I get here and I notice the guy has the AC set to 80. I got in late and just wanted to go to bed so I didn't do anything. Went to work and got back and the AC wasn't on. So I texted the owner asking if I could turn the AC back on as it was super hot and somehow it had turned off. He said sure but note the thermostat has the wrong temperature it says it's 4 degrees hotter than it is. So I set it to 77 thinking 73 was reasonable. He gets back and sets it back to 80... sigh. 

A couple more nights go by where I'm sweating in my sleep and waking up in the middle of the night because my room is super hot. It's a small room and if the AC isn't running no air is circulating...

Finally tonight I had enough and said I'm not dealing with this heat and lowered the temperature to 77 again. I immediately got a message from the owner telling me not to do that. Then we get in mini argument over text where he says I should use the fan he provided...

So the thing I've been iffy on is AITA for touching the thermostat tonight (the only other time I did I had asked first)?

Tldr: rented a super hot room and turned on the air conditioning without asking first. Argument with the host followed.

EDIT: after reading some of these I sent him another text explaining that since AC was listed I felt I should be comfortable and that my room was much hotter than the rest of the house. He turned it down from 81 to 78. Small victories. I'll see how I sleep and decide whether I should push harder on this or not. Provided fan is on max btw.",122,297,0.97

I've known my friend ""Amy"" for a few years now. I'm a preschool teacher and so I met her by watching her son. Over the past three years we grew pretty close, but still had a semi-professional relationship. Amy works as an intern at a therapist office, so she deals with clients that have issues. Sometimes my friend Amy wants me to babysit after hours, which I have done again for years with no real problems. Except one. She's like CHRONICALLY late to pick up. At my job she's pulls in the minute after we ""close"", if I'm watching him after hours for a date night she will be hours late sometime. All without a text saying ""hey gonna be late"" or whatever.

She also tends to introduce me to new people as ""her nanny"" instead of by my name, which is embarrassing when I'm invited to her parties as well. A few months ago she offered to take me to Hawaii if I would watch her son some of the time while we were there. I haven't traveled much so I was excited. Until we got there. I didn't get to rest or relax whatsoever. I was working constantly, and most of the time the family hardly talked to me. It wasn't a vacation for me at all like how she made it sound. I was just in a different location watching her kid for free. Which also meant I was out of a week's worth of pay, even though I worked the entire trip.

A few days ago she asked me to babysit again for Monday and Tuesday after my work because her husband was in another state visiting her dying Grandma. So of course I said yes. I had her confirm the pick up time of 9:15 pm MULTIPLE times. Monday goes by no problem, she picks up on time. Tuesday she drops her now sick child off. My coworkers called out so I worked alone all day, and then had to watch him for another 4 hours. 

915 comes and goes with no text. 920, still no text. I finally text her and ask her where she is. No reply. I tell her I'm now sick and would like to go home. No reply. 935 she calls and tells me that one of her patients was talking about really dark stuff and so she had to stay late and call her supervisor. I told her that I was upset, and that I felt like she was taking advantage of me at that point. By 955 she's still not here. Her sister finally picks him up by 10.

Today's now Thursday, and we had her son in preschool. When it was time for everyone to go home, of course she is the very last one to pick up. Literally pulling in at the time we close. She walks in, I say ""hey!"" She completely ignores me and won't even look at me. She tells her son ""okay baby we got to go"" and just leaves without saying a word.

359,Not the A-hole,"So, for background, I’m 13 years old and at a STEM program summer camp. My class, Robotics, is missing 75% of our supplies and we paid 2.4k to be here. Our Engineering side course was missing 100% of supplies. The Engineering advisor was very nice and told us that they’re missing SOOO many supplies and that the advisors barely even know each other. She told us to inform our parents about this. 

I was telling my mom about this and that my Robotics advisor was honestly hard to get along with, talk to, hear directions from, etc. etc.; he even got on his phone during our classes.

My mom called them and they said they’d call her back. They NEVER did in the span of 1-2 days. So my mom called corporate and the head advisor had to hear it. She finally decided to talk to me...

She was very friendly and nice at first, but when I expressed my concerns, she told me how I “stirred the pot” and everything’s been blown bigger than it should’ve been because I went to my mom instead of her (I didn’t know how to contact her, and I still don’t even know her name). She told me that she has 200 kids to worry about and my problems aren’t her priority because of that. She summed up what she said with “you and your mom need to mind your own business about our supplies because it’s none of your concern. I’ll be talking to the advisor that told you to call her and talk about it”.

I was left in tears. I didn’t know what to say to that, and I felt weird... I’m not sure how to explain it but I felt like someone had punched me and I couldn’t speak. I told my mother about this. I believe she called corporate again, and now I’m worried I’ve possibly ruined the head advisor’s summer job by doing this. I just really want to know... am I the asshole in this situation?

Update:
My mother called their main base in Washington and corporate isn’t happy about how the advisor acted. They’re currently going to deal with her, as this isn’t her first time doing this, but she’s never done it to this degree. Thank you all for helping me in this confusing time.

Every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a “classic movie night” at my house. We drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be “important to film”. Good times.

The problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. Our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (The first time was Rosemary’s Baby and the second was Taxi Driver, if that matters.)

Of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). Independantly, friends from the group have asked that I not invite her the next time, because we want to watch Clockwork Orange which will definetly be triggering to her. Since I’m hosting, it is up to me, but since I usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

God I feel like such a dick but my friends and I really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. WIBTA if I went out of my way to NOT invite her?

Tldr: My friends and I want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - WIBTA to just not invite her anymore?

EDIT: Wow. So it took just 45min for me to realize Im an asshole! Some smart commenter posted an obvious solution: i will be using https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ from now on to vet our films before movie night.

He's done this to many of his family members. The boyfriend's only argument is that he feels bad for him having to sleep in a tent.  I keep telling the bf there is a reason he got kicked out of his rental and there is a reason NO ONE WANTS TO HELP HIM.  He is from this area and has plenty of family and 'friends' he should be able to turn to but has burnt so many bridges that even his blood relatives will not throw him a bone.   I am not going to allow someone in to my home that'll put my safety, security and over all well being at risk.  To most people I would be super sympathetic and welcome them into my home for a while, I am not a monster. If this guy was seeking treatment for his drug problem or trying to do something productive I would let him in but NOPE, AH HELL NO is he staying here like he is now.  

The bf says I am being a big ol'bitch and cold but I think I am just looking out for my personal well being. So.. AITA?

362,Asshole,"So my fiancé recently proposed to me and we’ve been planning our wedding together. It’s all very exciting and I love him very much!

I’m worried about just one thing though: my fiancé’s glasses. He has albinism and as a result is visually impaired (nystagmus or rapid uncontrolled eye movement, poor depth perception, visual acuity of 20/100 with glasses and 20/800 without, and extreme light sensitivity). I consider myself to be very supportive of his low vision and helpful when possible and I do love a man with glasses! I am very pro-glasses on the whole (I wear them too!).

Due to the lack of pigment in his eyes and skin, he has to wear transitions lenses to protect his eyes. I’ve for sure teased him about it but day-to-day it doesn’t tend to bother me. However, the more I think about it, the less I want him to look like he’s wearing sunglasses in our wedding and engagement photos. We’re having an outdoor ceremony, and even if it’s cloudy outside, his glasses will be slightly tinted no matter what. (Edit: the ceremony is going to be under half an hour right before sunset in December)

I’m thinking of asking him to buy a pair of Warby Parker glasses or something. He tends to gravitate towards more pricey frames (his current ones are Tom Ford) since glasses are essential to his ability to live a normal life — without glasses, he for sure could not get to or from work or read from a computer screen or piece of paper. I think that it would be perfectly acceptable to ask him to buy a pair of fashionable, but under $100 glasses WITHOUT transitions lenses for him to wear on our wedding day and for engagement photos. WIBTA here? Does it seem like I’m asking him to change or making an unreasonable and vain demand?",73,53,0.79
363,Everyone Sucks,"My younger brother Bryan just turned 19 about month ago. About an hour ago, he casually mentioned if I could go get this moscotto (wine) that he likes because he and his girlfriend is celebrating their first year together. He said he needs it by 9 and just expected me to go and get it for him.

I told him I’m not really comfortable giving alcohol to someone whose underaged. It’s not like it’s far or anything (just a couple min drive from my house). But I live in America, so it’s illegal, and call me a straight edge or whatever but I don’t like breaking the law. Additionally, I don’t want to give him the impression that this is something that I’m willing to do often; if I give him alcohol now, he’d expect me to do it again in the future.

I said he can ask our parents but I’m definitely not going to break the law for him. He got pissy and said to “stop being a bitch, who cares?” I said I do, and so I’m not doing it, end of story.

He texted our parents, and they called me. I expected them to take my side so I put them on speaker phone, but they said they were planning a date night tonight and told me to handle it. I said no and explained why I didn’t want to give my underaged brother alcohol, but they said to “stop being difficult and just give him the damn wine”.

Bryan had a shit-eating grin after that and said “I’ll see you before 9”. I went to my car so I guess he assumed I was getting it for him, but instead I just drove to a friend’s house. I group texted Bryan and our parents, and said I wasn’t going to put my livelihood at risk and break the law for anyone, and if anyone had a problem with that, well too bad. I then put my phone on airplane mode and am currently typing this on my computer.

Did I do the right thing? I feel like my brother will be absolutely furious when I turn my phone on, but I feel like he’s acting like a little turd. AITA for how I handled the situation?

Update: turned my phone back on. Mom and dad are furious. All Bryan  texted was ""you know, you ruined what was supposed to be a special night and I hope it was worth it."" Starting to question if I did the right thing...

UPDATE 2: Got home last night. Brother wouldn't even look at me. I sent him a message saying that it wasn't anything against him or anything; I'm just really against the alcohol culture and I felt uncomfortable with the request. All he sent back was ""tbh, i don't really give a shit about your excuses, just leave me alone"". He won't answer any of my calls or texts anymore. My parents are furious for ""being such a square"" and said that between not giving my underaged brother alcohol and not being a legal slave (like forcing myself to do the shit they try to tell me to do e.g.  plant the garden that THEY want or spread the mulch that THEY want), they're genuinely considering kicking me out of the house or forcing me to start paying rent...",3494,4693,0.89
364,No A-holes here,"I’m 28. My mom recently passed away suddenly in a car accident. 

We had the service for her yesterday. 

I’ve struggled with alcohol abuse for a few years now and I’ve been sober for about a year. Until yesterday. 

The prospect of facing the funeral sober was just too much for me and before I got to the funeral I went to the liquor store and filled up my flask. I drank a little bit before the funeral and took my flask in the cab to the funeral. 

I wasn’t belligerent but I was steadily sneaking drinks from my flask when I could. I barely talked to anyone and was keeping to myself. 

Towards the end of the service my brother pulls me aside and asks me if I’ve been drinking. I told him I was and I explained why. He said that he was disappointed in me and that “mom would be too.” 

I told him it was just a one time thing because I couldn’t do this sober but he said that I needed to go home. I tried to fight him on that but he wouldn’t listen and people were starting to stare so I gave in and went home. 

I’m super upset that he made me leave the funeral of my own mother but I don’t know if I was entirely in the wrong. I wasn’t being loud or acting drunk at the service. Like I said I was alone most of the service. I need some perspective here. Be brutally honest please.

366,No A-holes here,"My ex and I share custody of our two children (4 and 7) every other week. Just before our younger was born she became vegan. I am not vegan and our older is not on a vegan diet. This has never been a problem for her. Our younger from the age of 2 has been kept on a vegan diet.

Since we split (mostly amicably) over a year ago I've maintained the vegan diet for our younger out of respect for her disposition. However for a multitude of reasons (practical and principle) this is very much wearing on me. Yesterday I mentioned to her that I would not mind our younger having a non vegan diet and she became extremely agitated. Am I the asshole for not wanting to continue providing a vegan diet for my younger while he's with me?

368,No A-holes here,"So I'm an intern at a company where we just had a meeting between all of the other interns and the CEO. This company is known for having a really relaxed culture and we had a really friendly chat with the exec, asking him about his life and how he got to where he was. It then came to the second part of the meeting where he asked first asked us ""what do you like most about the company?"", picking someone randomly on the spot.

He then asks the question ""what do you hate most about the company?"" - and he picks me. So being caught quite off guard I said something on the lines of ""I've been here twice and I love it (which I genuinely do), there's not really anything I'd change... I wouldn't mind getting paid more though"", to which there was a lot of laughter.

The thing is, I retold this to a few people and I've had a mixed reaction so far. The interns there thought it was really, really funny; on the other hand, my parents think that talking about wages is a definite no-no and could potentially be a fireable offence. I don't dispute that - but what I really just want to know is AITA for making that joke in the environment I was in? Just a note that I'm not so clear on what the CEO's reaction was.

369,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post here so I apologize if it’s long and rambling. Tl;dr at the bottom.

My boyfriend and I bought our first house together in February. During the home inspection we met the sellers, who seemed a little strange. They were supposed to leave for a couple hours while we were there but we didn’t really mind even if it was incredibly awkward. We scheduled closing for about 60 days from when our offer was accepted which is pretty typical for a purchase. We went through the whole process and on the closing day had our whole apartment packed into our rental truck. When we arrived for the final walkthrough, which was scheduled for a couple of hours prior to closing, we found the house still FULL of stuff.

A lot of it was junk but these people also had clothes hanging in all the closets, clothes in the dryer, food in the pantry, dishes in the dish washer, etc. Every single room had items left behind. We had to push closing back a day and sleep on an air mattress in our empty apartment. When we went back the next day there was still stuff everywhere but they signed the paperwork agreeing that anything left was now ours. We found their wedding album and the wife’s fathers military medals during our 2nd walk through and brought them to closing because they seemed important. There was not enough time to sort through all of the items but we tried to do the right thing by bringing them. 

We wound up taking the weekend with help from our family to go through everything and did keep/give away some things that were left behind. The rest of the stuff we hauled to the garage to be taken away by junk collectors. Then a couple months later they wrote to us for something involving the water bill and also requesting back some items. Mainly jewelry that the wife had left behind. 

I wanted to send it back to her but my boyfriend told me it would open up a can of worms. A week or two later they had their realtor contact our realtor because they didn’t take their cable boxes and Verizon wanted them returned. At that point I was decided that they would continue to contact us about items left behind and told our realtor to pass along the message that we junked the entire house.

I feel bad about lying but if we give one thing back I don’t think they’ll ever stop asking us for things that are probably already gone.

Tl;dr Home sellers left items in the house and have contacted us multiple times asking for different things back. AITA for lying and saying we got rid of it all?",32,28,0.98
370,Not the A-hole,"I PT with a small group of people three times a week.  Every week we all run together.  This week it has been very hot, hotter than normal.  Our department requires us to PT with hydration on site.  Basically everyone brings a water bottle or a gatorade/etc.  This week while on our normal run we stop to fill up, water access is a little ways off the road we run on.  I was asked by one of the group to refill their gatorade bottle.  The gatorade bottle was about 25% full of gatorade.  I run to the water access while everyone takes a breather.  I do not dump the gatorade and fill the remaining 75% with water.

I return and hand them the gatorade bottle.  Apparently this was unacceptable.  They ask me why the water is light blue, and I inform them its because the gatorade they bought was blue.  They now ask why I didn't dump the gatorade out before refilling it with water.  I told them it didn't seem necessary as the gatorade and water are so similar, its not like I was mixing water with soda or some other beverage.  They begin to go on a rant about how it will taste nasty and that I should ""stop and think"" before I do stupid things.  I apologized and told them I honestly didn't see the harm in it and it seemed wasteful to dump 1/4 of the gatorade.

371,Not the A-hole,"So my husband and I have been married for 3 years and are currently expecting our first child.
Since day one, his family has been totally 
passive, rude, unwelcoming and just nasty to me and our relationship. 

His ex girlfriend lived with his family for a period of time while they were together/after they broke up, and she has driven a wedge between us and the family. She wanted to get back with him (even his mother admitted this to him) and he wasn’t interested. She has continually instigated and antagonized me, and us, from day one. 
There has been a multitude of drama from this situation, but the key points include:


-MIL and ex gossiping about me and husband in text messages

-MIL/ex posting rude things about me on Facebook, other social media 

-inviting the ex on family vacations (even after she moved out, remarried, and husband and I were married)

-MIL threw the ex and her new husband a baby shower (yet has not shown interest in talking about mine)

-MIL and FIL inviting the ex and her husband and baby to family brunch on Sunday’s 

-MIL/SIL, future SIL hang out together (and sometimes with the ex) while excluding me  unless I am at a family event with my husband

Basically any way they can show disrespect, they have.

I have expressed my distaste and hurt multiple times, and each time, the family gets defensive about how it’s none of my business, they can have relationships with whoever they want, etc. or they just shut down and act victimized and say I’m a rude person.

Furthermore, my husband’s siblings (who have all expressed distaste/impartial feelings for the ex to us) recently began developing a closer relationship with her since my husband and I decided to “cut ties” with the family.

My brother in law and his fiancé are the “god parents” of her baby.

I think it’s worth noting that the ex has siblings, her own family and in laws, and a huge support system in general besides my husband’s family, so it’s not a situation where “these are the only people she has” 

BIL’s wedding is in November (same month our baby is due) and we have opted to not go/husband not be in the grooms party because the ex will be there, and the family wouldn’t even think of uninviting her. 

It has been over three years now and I am exhausted, hurt, and honestly bitter over the way this family has “welcomed” me into the picture. 

They were never married. They share no children together. They dated in high school.

I have decided, as of now, to no longer maintain a relationship, or even cordial/neutral attitude with these people. They have treated me like absolute dog shit for three years, all the while feeding into this game and these childish antics.

372,Not the A-hole,"When I was a kid, if your friend invited you to a party or event, it was understood that basic needs would be taken care of by The friend’s parents, and it was reciprocated when you invited that friend along with you. A hotel room or food would be covered, but anything extra you used your own spending money. Fast forward and as I am now the parent allowing my kids to invite friends along I do the same; however, I’m finding this is a rarity among other parents. My son goes to a birthday party at a well-known restaurant/gaming place and he has to purchase his own game credits AND food ( not to mention another kid had no money so he covered that kids stuff too—we had a talk about not being taken advantage of). Then another friend invites him and other kids to meet at his house for a couple hours before going the movies for his birthday. My son buys his own ticket and food, again covering for another starving teenage boy with no money. 

Today my son says another friend has asked him to go to an amusement park overnight with the boy’s family. My son will have to sleep on the hotel floor, pay for his own park ticket and food. We are easily looking at $200 with this BS and I’m sure he’ll end up buying something for someone else. I said no because I see what’s going on.

376,Asshole,"So, my (22m) girlfriends (22f) mums friend has asked my girlfriend to housesit and look after her cats for her for two weeks when she goes on holiday. Now, my girlfriend is currently out of work due to debilitating agoraphobia and PTSD. My girlfriend was really excited for this as this woman’s house is very lavish, surrounded by woods and canals, she loves that kind of peaceful shit and is overly excited to spend time with the cats.

Anyway, I’m really not happy with this and think it’s a terrible idea. My gf currently doesn’t leave the house and is on meds due to her mental health and it’s all very controlled when she’s in the comfort of her own home, but what if she has a flare up over there and none of us can get to her? What if she gets scared or triggered? I will be working and she doesn’t have any friends so will be completely on her own other than when her mum goes to see her after work. I will pop there a couple times when I’m off however. 

Her argument is that it will be good for her head and nice for her to have a break and some alone time and that she can look after herself. I was kind of offended by that tbh, I’m with her a lot to make sure she’s okay, why wouldn’t she want to spend our free time together? We go abroad for 10 days, a month before this house sitting shenanigan.. surely that’s enough of a therapeutic break for her? 

She hasn’t said I’m an asshole or argued with me as she isn’t the argumentative type, in fact she said she will reconsider but now it’s left me feeling funny.  I do not believe it’s a good idea personally. Let me know your thoughts or if this needs any more info. 

Tldr; gf excited to house sit all alone half an hour away but she has bad depression and anxiety so I’m worried about her being there alone.

377,Not the A-hole,"I work as a barista and shift manager at a local coffee shop. I have a regular customer who has an autoimmune disorder as well as OCD, and she makes this known every time she comes in. She usually orders 2-4 drinks and requests the following:

-	All steaming pitchers, espresso cups, blenders, etc. that are required to make her drinks need to be fully washed, rinsed, and sanitized no matter how recently they were cleaned: if she didn’t watch us do it, it didn’t happen.
-	Any ice that we use needs to be scooped from the back right hand corner of the ice machine.
-	Cups have to be taken from the middle of the stack.
-	She has to watch us do all of this. She will sit there and stare at us and make sure we follow her rules to a T. If we do it and she doesn’t see it, we have to remake her drinks. This can be problematic because we start making drinks while the customer is ordering, so she isn’t always watching or paying attention while we make them.

Earlier today I was working on drinks while a coworker ran the register. We had a line of about eight people behind her. I made her drinks as quickly as I could, conforming to her standards, and she demanded that because she wasn’t watching that I had to remake her drinks. I did it, but told her in the future that we can’t just remake drinks that have nothing wrong with them.

About 5 months ago I got my sister a job working with me. I know they say not to work with family but my sister is 19 and is high functioning autistic. I work with animals and my boss and I thought it would be good for her. Since then she's graduated high school, came our of her shell, and started handling grown things. She has her own bank account and handles her own money. The autistic part is more so her social and learning skills.

Everyday I clock out for 30 minutes to go get her and bring her to work. At first is wasnt an issue but its causing strife at work. I get a 30 minute break and then get another 30 minutes to go get my sister. At work we are not siblings, we are co workers. We dont treat each other as siblings and she doesn't get any special treatment.

I have a scooter that needs fixed. Just an oil change and a new starter relay. I did the math and I'm losing $1680 a year at minimum by getting my sister so I suggested to my mom that she fixes the scooter and drives to work. It's all back roads and is only a 10 minute ride. My mother said it's not going to happen. ""Riding a scooter is dangerous and how will someone with anxiety handle that."" I told her she needs to stop sheltering her and get her ready for the real world.

It ended up in a huge argument because she doesn't feel she can do it but I feel like it's not my responsibility to get her to work every day. It upsets my coworkers. I wouldn't leave every day to get a coworker like that, why do I need to do it for her.

I gave my mom an ultimatum last night. Told her my sister can either fix the scooter and I'll take her to work until she can get it running or monday when she gets paid shell have to uber, take the bus, or the town club car to get to work. I will not take her anymore. My mother tells me I need to stop being an asshole and get the d*ck out of my ass. Shes my sister and my responsibility. My sister hears all this and is completely against it too and I cant help but feel it's because my mother puts her down so fast.

I cant help but feel it's not my responsibility. My mom wont be here forever and I'm not going to take care of my sister forever.  She has money saved and is capable of fixing it. She can handle having a stable job, managing money, in my mind this is the next step to her self reliance. Am I really the asshole in the situation? The scooter sounds the most realistic to me.

However, while they've been talking, R has been repeatedly hitting her up, going so far as to ask her out to dinner dates despite knowing she's uninterested in anything but friendship. 

This escalated to him following her out to the parking lot and kissing her when she was distracted by her phone. He kept messaging her after that, and NOW follows her around work, too. Leaving his station (screwing the rest of us over) to hover around her area and generally just creeping. 

I told J that he needs to tell his lady to stand up to the guy and say something. We're at work, and she should feel safe and comfortable. But when she did, he IMMEDIATELY disregarded it and starting liking her pictures on FB and STILL chasing her around the workplace. I'm sitting here with things like #RIPBianca in my head and finally told J that if neither of them says anything I'm going to speak with a supervisor or higher on behalf of her safety. 

He's speaking to her tonight, which based on what I see from R tomorrow I'll be basing my decision off of. If nothing I can put a stop to him harassing her here at work, but I'm hoping if he's confronted he'll leave her alone otherwise, too. 

So, WIBTA? It's only affecting me in terms of him leaving me and the others with more work cause he's screwing off somewhere else.

We were patiently waiting our turn to take our pictures when another couple decided to just barge on in, cutting off everyone who had been waiting. I’ll admit I was rather tired by this point and couldn’t believe they couldn’t wait their turn like everyone else. So I did the first thing that came to mind. I started clapping and cheering really loudly for them as they tried to take their picture with remarks such as “Way to go!” and “You cut that line!” and “so smart you skipped kindergarten!”  Well, they did not like that and left pretty quickly after snapping a few pics. A few of the other couples who were waiting patiently had a good laugh and I thought I had come up with the best Defense against line cutters.

I KNOW we’re assholes for some of the gifts we send. We’ll get drunk and send the kids the loudest, most annoying toys we can find. We really challenge ourselves. The parents know exactly what we’re up to and think it’s hilarious hobby we have. 

Now, on to the agenda gifts. My BIL has been doing the princess thing with his daughter since she was born. I think it’s weird and gross and refuse to buy gendered presents for the little girl. For example, for Christmas when she was three, BIL asked us to get a STEM style present for the little boy and a vanity for the little girl to put make-up on with. Apparently they give her make-up. Their kid, they can do what they want, but I refused to spend $400 on a vanity so a three-year can doll herself up. Instead I bought her and her brother a bunch of really cool STEM gifts and books.

They recently asked me to get her a princess costume for her birthday. She is super spoiled and loves to dress up in costumes and order people around. She is of the mind that princesses get to order people around and that’s one of her favorite pastimes. So instead, I bought her *I Dissent*, a book for small children about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsberg, and a Judge’s robe so she could boss people around while dressed up. I’ve been told she loves gift and *I Dissent* is her favorite book. 

My husband thinks I’m an asshole and I should just buy her princess stuff if that’s what she wants. He says she is a little girl that knows her own mind and exactly what she wants. My response is small children can only want things they are exposed to and she always loves my presents, even though they admittedly do have a feminist agenda behind them. AITA?",270,855,0.93
384,Not the A-hole,"Awhile back it was my 20th birthday [20F]. I was told about a month prior by my best friend - let’s call him Bryan - that he was going to be taking care of the planning. To be clear, I wasn’t planning anything as it is. If it were up to me I would have probably spent the day as any other day, hanging out with friends after work. Knowing that B loves this kind of thing, I let him have his reins on it. 

~ Backstory: about three months before this entire incident, I had planned his birthday. He loves big groups, expensive dinners, and to be the center of attention. I personally invited over 20 people, made sure it was at this brand new Italian restaurant, and gave him a big birthday boy sash. He loved all of this.

I didn’t hear anything about it until the day before my birthday. I wasn’t even sure it was happening. Anyway he told me that it was a [very small] get together at my favourite restaurant that I’d been going to with my family since I was little. I let him know that I was very happy with this, as I don’t like extravagant parties. Fast forward to the next morning we had plans to hang out - again it wasn’t anything planned. He told me that he had an appointment to get his hair and nails done and wanted me to come along. As I was having a really slow morning, I told him I would hangout afterwards. 

This is where things changed: he told me that he wasn’t going to hangout and would just see me when it was time for dinner. This was said in what I took as a passive aggressive tone. Even though nothing was planned, I was upset that I was going to spend the first half of the day alone because he was cancelling. I let him know I was upset about this. He then told me that he invited way more people than he had told me before, and that it was at a very expensive restaurant that I’d never been to. (Two of these new guests where girls I hadn’t talked to since middle school). All of this he neglected to tell me because he was worried I wouldn’t be excited about it otherwise. 

Both out of anger (I’ll admit) and anxiety about a large group of people, I cancelled only a few hours before the dinner was planned. After quite a big argument, and some time passed, I let him know that I was going to have a few close friends over for take-out and movies, and that he was more than welcome to come. He replied, telling me that he was going to dinner with a few friends (the remaining list of people that he invited to my birthday that I wasn’t close enough to invite to the movie night). 

Just for a small cherry on top, it was at a restaurant that I had been trying to get him to come to for months that he kept sticking his nose up to because it was “fast food sushi.”

The reason I am asking is that later that night, when talking to my friend she said that we were both being dramatic and jerky - as I am the one who cancelled last minute. 

Any comments welcome! Thanks!",39,97,0.94
385,Everyone Sucks,"I'm going out of town for a wedding this weekend and was supposed to stay in an Airbnb with three friends - Mandy; Annie, who is six months pregnant; and Annie's husband, Dan. It will feel like 100+ degrees F when we are there this weekend.

&#x200B;

Yesterday morning, I noticed that our Airbnb did not have air conditioning. I reached out to the host and asked them about window units, and ultimately they were only able to install one, in the living room. I was worried for Annie's health, and I didn't want to stay in that heat, either, so I called Airbnb to see what my recourse was. My intention wasn't necessarily to outright cancel, but to see if maybe they could move us, and what our options would be if they couldn't. After two hours on the phone with them, the only option they gave me was to cancel, and they managed to negotiate with the host to let us cancel with a partial (half) refund - originally, the host wanted to give us nothing. I was on the phone and forced to make a decision, so I accepted and canceled. We each lost about $50 with the cancellation. Had this all been happening over email, I would've texted them and gotten their okay before proceeding, but I had to make the choice over the phone.. so I did.

&#x200B;

I hadn't told Annie about any of this because I didn't want to stress her out, but I did tell Mandy. She was of course frustrated that we had lost $50, she agreed that it was the right choice. Then I called Annie. She was livid. She told me that I had no right to make ""decisions about her health and her body"" and that I should've talked to her before doing anything. She didn't let me explain how this had all come about. I told her I had spoke with some friends who would let her stay with them for free, and she said she didn't want to do that. I told her we could book a hotel and Mandy and I would even split the cost if money was the concern, and she said no. She told me she would talk it over with Dan and get back to me on next steps. A few hours later, she texted me and said that I could book a hotel but she would only pay up to a certain amount, and we ""owed her"" for stressing her out.

&#x200B;

I was surprised by how angry she got, but whatever, I figured it was over. Then this morning she texts me and says she needs to tell me how she feels for the sake of our friendship. She sends four very long texts saying that ""unless \[me\] and Dan are dead, you don't get to make decisions about me and my family"" and there are f-bombs and saying that I had no right to make any decisions or get other people involved in this situation.

&#x200B;

I'm flabbergasted at how upset she got last night, and I'm even more flabbergasted by her texts this morning. I've never had a friend speak to me this way, and I feel like she's blown things wayyyyy out of proportion. At this point I have absolutely no interest in being around here, so I'm planning to pay for my part of the hotel but stay with my friends. AITA?",51,137,0.92

387,Asshole," I live in Boston and this happens fairly regularly- I'm walking down the sidewalk, with ample room on either side of me, and someone walking the opposite way has their head down in their phone, completely oblivious to the numerous other pedestrians around them. Quite often, these people are swerving erratically all over the place, and many times their path ends up directly converging with mine. I feel I am justified in giving someone a nudge back to reality. I don't deviate my path, but make a point not to in order to initiate contact. My basis of reasoning behind this is that if you are on a public walkway, you should be aware and considerate of others around you. So, AITA for shoulder checking them?",87,59,0.85
388,Not the A-hole,"In February, I started working at a small mom and pops shop in my downtown area. At first I got along with the owner fine- I was the most experienced person on his staff, and so anything I asked for he got me (I work as a barista, so I’m talking mostly ingredients and tools for art, ect). He would also stop by the store every day to see what was going on.

 In May, a new opportunity presented itself so I jumped at it- and it was a big mistake. I truly hated that job, and asked the owner if I could revoke my two weeks. He didn’t seem to have much of an issue with it, and just had a conversation with me regarding why I wanted to leave. We then got a new manager, and that’s when things got worse. 

The owner enlisted a “no contact rule” in which we couldn’t directly contact him, and stopped coming in to the store. I was constantly being criticized by him with the manager being the delivery pigeon, as he did not want to address me personally. I would be reprimanded for the smallest things, and blame was pinned on me for things that happened when I wasn’t even working. The owner specifically requested that I not get my time off in June that I scheduled in April, and started working me clopening shifts (close and open) up to 3 times a week. 

I then found out that he was talking about me with other employees, and was threatening to fire me- though he couldn’t find a solid reason to. He cussed me out numerous times, and started picking on the coworkers I was friendly with at work He lamented that as in the highest paid employee (I make $1 more than minimum wage- he pays all the other employees UNDER minimum) he expected me to be fulfilling manager duties- which he never told me.

After being accused of lying about a family emergency, and then being told I had to go into a shift while my uncle was severely ill because he wasn’t “that close of family”, I’d had enough. I realized that they were stepping all over me and I was letting them.

I had a conversation with my manager, in which she said (and I QUOTE) “he goes through phases in which he has it out for certain people. You’re his new punching bag- but he’s going through a lot with his divorce). She tried to be understanding, and when I put in my weeks notice, she said that she would sit down with myself and the owner to air things out. 

Today was suppose to be the sit down, with my last day being Sunday. Manager is nowhere to be found, and owner came in to fulfill a catering order, asked me when my last day was, and said “hopefully I’ll see you before then.” And leaves. 

I think I might leave my key in the till after my shift today and inform the manager and owner  that since he doesn’t have 15 minutes to sit down with me, I don’t have the time to come to the rest of my shifts. However, the manager is going through a tough pregnancy and I don’t know who else would cover my shifts besides her, as all of the other key holders are working. 

WIBTA if I quit today? I’m just so over everything, and feel like I’m at a breaking point.

392,Not the A-hole,"NOT NSFW.

I am a kid, so please keep this in mind with my decisions.

My younger sister and I have a history of having lots of disagreements that end in shouting. As a result, we both have lied about it in the past. But the past few years I have grown more mature, and do not lie about this sort of thing. She, on the other hand, still lies to get me into trouble. My mom always either dismisses the situation or gets us in trouble because ""she does not know who to believe.""

I am fed up. A few days ago my father was on a work call and my mom was gone so I was the supervisor of my younger sister and brother \[8M\]. Being the great babysitter brother I am, I give my sister the iPad, which she does not always get to use, so she can play Minecraft PE. As I am the one in charge, I can give/take from them whatever. Eventually my brother comes and asks for a turn as she is not letting him use it. It has been over an hour and I told him he could get it after 30 mins.  My brother says she pushed him down and hit him. My parents tell me I have full authority when I am in charge, for context.

I go into her room and ask her to give him the iPad many times. He walks over to her to try to get it from her, and she hits him. I decide this would be a good time to prove my honesty, so I pull out my phone and start filming. There is video evidence of her hitting, taking my phone and throwing it, and even throwing the iPad.

Eventually, she slams her door and my mom arrives. I have prepared, and have the videos in my hand to prove it. My brother walks to my mom as well.

As soon as we are about to calmly present this to my mom, my sister comes down screaming and crying and claiming all sorts of things like ""they aren't telling the truth"" and ""I didn't do anything"" and ""he told me I could!"" Even though we haven't said anything yet. My brother and I try to but in, but my mom shushes us, grabs my sister by the shoulder and takes her to their closet (where they can't disturb my father). This allows my sister to give my mother her bull version of the story before my brother and I can *show her the* ***evidence****.* 

Eventually, they get out  and my mom tells my brother and I to down, where my dad has finished. Now, I try to show them the evidence and my brother tries to explain as well, but we are shushed for ""disrespect."" My mom then says ""electronics are always the problem"" and proceeds to take my phone and the iPad, then says ""you will not be getting these back until the end of the summer"". I know in the end, it will only be about a month, but this is no punishment to my sister because she could care less about playing video games, just when she does she likes to do it for a while.

At this point, I am so fed up with it that I get up and call my sister ""a princess with entitled bull attitude"" doing my best to not curse in front of my family. My dad starts to walk over to pull me away so I run up. My sister is shaking and screaming.

393,Asshole,"I know it sounds horrible and this has been a weight on my conscience so I'm asking here.

My ex and I broke up after 5 years of being together. We went NC after attempts at being friends led to flings and eventually she became involved with someone else and did some cruel two-timing manipulation with me. I was done with her after that.

&#x200B;

Some time back I was just browsing a particular NSFW subreddit and came across a couple of gifs of her fucking some guy. No face, but there's enough identifying markers for me to know it's her. And...I didn't care. I chuckled but stopped when I realised she would not post this willingly.

&#x200B;

So I checked the user and they've posted different girls in different posts and claimed to be one person. I called them out in the comments, reported to the mods (involuntary pornography) and washed my hands off of it. 

&#x200B;

Here's the deal. I'd tell someone if they were made a pornstar without their knowledge.  No one deserves that kind of trust violation happening to them.

&#x200B;

I don't want to tell her. I like being No Contact and away from toxicity. Having her in my life fucked me up more than once.

I figure it's okay because 1) No face 2) It's reported and OP deleted his posts 3) I have no way of letting her know indirectly without violating her privacy and shattering her world.

394,Not the A-hole,"My ex-husband cheated on me with a woman we’ll call Violet. This happened numerous times before I finally confronted him and he admitted they were in love, and that they wanted to be together, but because of our daughter, he felt obligated to me. We ended our marriage and split custody of our daughter. Violet and my ex never married, but she became pretty much like a step-mom figure in my daughter’s life (they lived together), to the point where I know Violet loves her like a daughter. Which I am fine with. My daughter having many people that loves her is a good thing.

4 years ago, my ex-husband passed away when my daughter was 7. Violet by her side was a huge help, because she was apart of her father’s life. Despite the awkwardness and me not really wanting to be around this woman, I sucked it up for my daughter’s sake. We did some activities together and she’s remained in my daughter’s life, taking her out and keeping her at the house she once shared with my ex. Again, I know it helps. I also got her therapy during this time. There were a few times I felt Violet overstepped and I would be careful about talking to her, because I didn’t want to hurt feelings and I knew it was tricky.

Now my daughter is 11. Recently, I got a job offer out of state. I have much more family in this area and it’s a more lucrative offer. I know it’ll be an adjustment for my daughter, but she’s excited to move and make new friends, especially as she’ll be starting middle school anyway so she’d be starting fresh at a new school. I plan to bring her back at some holidays or some random dates to where we currently live, but nothing set in stone.

When I told Violet this, she asked if I would be willing to do a custody arrangement of sorts. She wants to take my daughter one weekend a month (she’ll come get her) and for a few weeks every summer. I was turned off by this and told her no. I said we’d be back to visit. She said I didn’t get how close they had become. I reminded her that while I appreciate that, I don’t want to agree to anything permanent. She got really hurt and said this isn’t what my ex would’ve wanted.

For some background, her son is 3 and when she was pregnant she had one babyshower in the city where she lived and then flew to our hometown to have another babyshower - I get it, she wanted to celebrate with friends from all over and that made sense to me. She told me she would be having a babyshower for her second child and I thought she meant a sprinkle: you know, friends over, more laid back, not a lot of pressure for gifts, etc. I was very, very wrong. Last month she had a full blown baby shower in our hometown and is having another shower in the city where she currently lives. There's a tent, she's registered for gifts, games and food, invitations went out, you get the gist.

However, I’m the only one (in a group of 8) that is not in our school’s Honors College. Many people, including them, have assured me that this doesn’t mean they’re smarter than me or harder working than me, and I’ve accepted that. 

However, Honors College people all have some required courses to take that are just for them, so they all have classes together without me.  And sometimes when we hang out, everyone talks about their classes and I feel completely left out.

My mom spoke to my sister 2 days after they came back. She tells me that T was hysterically crying about how L did not have money saved to pay rent after they returned. Now they got papers stating they will get evicted if they don't provide money by next week. My mom asks if I could give them money to help out. 

I got really upset and said no. She told me I was being selfish because I made good money as a part time nurse. She also knows that I have money saved in the bank and insisted that I take money out of savings to help them. She also said that I'm really fortunate to live at home and be able to save money unlike my sister.

For the record, even though I do still live at home, I have been giving my parents $800-900/month for rent and $200/month for groceries. I just paid off my student loans and only just started saving money for an emergency fund. This is not an emergency to me and I refuse to give my sister anything. They aren't terrible people but I have given them $600 a year ago and never got it back.

Before even I start having a bite of the muffin, this one guy who looked like a manager came up to me and asked if I can move to a bar seat so other people with a meal can sit on a table?

Wtf? Excuse me, but I paid for this food as my 'meal' as a customer and I have every right to sit wherever the f\*ck I want.

Plus, it was not like I was occupying a 4-people seat, which would not have been the case in the first place since I have a common sense during a lunch hour. Just like many people at the deli, I was sitting in a two-person table by myself, and it sets me off that he explicitly asked me to do so while some other people were doing the same.

Additionally, I don't know how he's managing the deli with a mindset of 'a customer who's having for less pricey food deserves to be treated less as well'.

Also like I mentioned above I'm visibly pregnant in my final month of pregnancy, where I'm in a dire need of back support wherever I go, so bar stools are extremely uncomfortable to me.

Its not like you really needed the food you fat pig"". She blocked me right after and even deleted the messages. So am i REALLY the asshole here? Or is she just being a petty baby who participated in a really stupid prank

Edit: To clarify my description of the girl i stepped on is purely from present day me. Back then i didnt know this girl personally. I just ""knew"" her from seeing her in the halls, people talking about her, and seeing her perform in the school pep rallies.",65,37,0.86
404,Not the A-hole," I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let’s say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M

I got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I’ve allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I’ve decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there’s not someone renting full-time.

 My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she’s upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she’s also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it’s not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She’s my older sister and I’ve always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I’m feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?",3465,27912,0.92

407,Not the A-hole,"Im Indian, but born here. My parents are immigrants so I have a very deep connection to my roots still. This comes through in my cooking. My aunts and mom taught me, so I mostly know how to cook Indian foods, and I love them so it’s rare when something I cook isn’t Indian. 

My fiancé has had no problems with this in the past, he loves my cooking and Indian food and culture in general, or so I thought. This changed when we moved in together. According to my boyfriend, the fragrant foods I cook “make our whole floor smell” and he claims it’s bothering the neighbors. I doubt this because I’ve actually had some neighbors comment about how great the food from our apartment smells. 

Lately he’s been coming home and making a fuss out of what I’m cooking. Saying “this again?” Even at dishes I haven’t made in some time. This has been going on for weeks, but he ends up eating it regardless. Hell wake up in the mornings and go “ugh, still smells like last nights dinner” almost passive aggressively. 

My last straw was recently he texted me before coming home from work, saying he wanted carbonara for dinner. This is fine, except I don’t know how to make it and he knows that. I genuinely assumed he was kidding, but he was very upset when he got home, saying that I’m refusing to learn to adapt to him and that his preferences matter too. My response was that that’s now his problem, and he can cook for himself whatever he wants, while I stay with my Indian food loving girlfriend for some time. 

He has since been a mix of hot and cold, sometimes apologetic but when I refuse to change my stance he goes off on me again. Maybe I should learn to compromise since I’m the only one home in time to make dinner. AITA?

EDIT: because a lot of people are curious about our dynamic at home, we both work. I just happen to get home earlier and enjoy cooking, so I almost always do, but it’s not an agreed upon situation or anything. It’s not my job, I just enjoy cooking Indian food. I sometimes cook other things as well, but Indian is the most common.",166,131,0.93
408,Not the A-hole,"Some background: this woman and I have been friends since high school. She lives several hours away and has an almost five month old baby, and wants to visit soon since her husband will be out of town for work. He's going to be gone a week, so she's wanting to stay the whole week. 

She's repeatedly hinted and is now starting to outright ask if she and the baby can stay with me that whole week. The problem is, my place is insanely small. One tiny bedroom, one microscopic bathroom. No room for an air mattress even, let alone the playpen thing she lugs around for the baby. When I brought up the space issues for why she can't stay with me, she suggested that I simply go stay with my boyfriend that week so she can have my place to herself. 

I'm aggravated by this request because my friend's in-laws live nearby, and they have a large house with multiple guest rooms, yet she refuses to stay with them because she finds them annoying. Truth be told, they are annoying, but they're not horrible people, and I'm sure they'd like to see their daughter-in-law and grandchild.

I have tried to tell my friend that I'm happy to spend time with her that week, but my place is simply too small for two adults and a baby. This was when she suggested I go stay with my boyfriend and essentially let her use my place as a free AirBnB or something. I don't want to be unsympathetic, I'm sure it's hard dealing with a baby and I know she doesn't want to stay with annoying relatives (she can't afford a hotel either) but I don't really see why I should have to rearrange my life for a week because of it. 

So would I be the asshole if I put my foot down and tell her no, she cannot stay at my place? The number one reason I don't want her to is only inconvenience - I would have to clean before she gets there and she would use the baby as an excuse to leave it messy, so I'd have to clean after she left too. Plus I'd have to impose on my boyfriend and pack a week's worth of stuff...but it feels like a petty reason not to help her out. On the other hand, it's not like she has nowhere else to go. If that was the case it might be different, but the fact is she has a much more comfortable place to stay, she just doesn't want to.

409,Not the A-hole,"A newlywed couple with two babies and three dogs moved into the house next door to me and my boyfriend (he’s 31, I’m 24)

The neighbors are nice, friendly, and I never hear the babies screaming or crying or anything like that.

The issue comes in with two of their dogs. Two pugs... at night the pugs get locked in the backyard inside of a chain link dog run that’s about 5 ft long by 3 feet wide. It has a dog igloo and a bowl of water. (I can see it from my bedroom window) 

Starting from about 10:30pm every night until 2-3 in the morning, the pugs just bark and bark non stop. And it only gets worse if I have my bedroom light on, turn on my tv, or make any noise in my bedroom. 

Every time we have tried to say something to them about keeping the dogs quiet, they are in a hurry to leave, or have their hands full with the babies.

I haven’t gotten a decent night of sleep in over two weeks cause of the dogs. I’ve tried ear plugs, having a fan on in my room, keeping the window closed, but I still hear these dogs.

I love dogs, and I have a dog as well, a German Shepherd. If she barks, I immediately go outside and tell her to quiet down.

I have recordings of the dogs barking, and times written down, so it’s not like the dogs bark every once in a while, it’s EVERY NIGHT. 

I tried to give it some time and thought that maybe the dogs are just getting used to their new home, but it’s been weeks. 

So, WIBTA to knock on their door at midnight so they can get their dogs to shut up?

UPDATE: BF and I ran into the neighbors when we were leaving to take our dog for a walk. BF mentioned something to the husband of the couple about the dogs. They were incredibly apologetic. It turns out their male pug, impregnated both the female pug AND the boxer mix within a month from each other. They have 4 week old puppies, and 2 day old puppies. The male pug, is mean to the newest litter of puppies and tries to attack them, which is why they’ve been keeping it outside. They are working on rehoming all the puppies, and trying to find a solution about the daddy pug. 12 dogs and 2 babies. They have their freaking hands full. I’m glad I didn’t turn into the angry neighbor immediately. Thank you guys for all the input.",71,78,0.94
410,Not the A-hole,"My parents had a very litigious and messy divorce almost 10 years ago after my mom had an affair. I know what she did is wrong and I don't support her, but this is mostly in the past now and I have the rest of my life to live. My father on the other hand still harbors a lot of resentment and so does his family. It's not uncommon for them to talk shit about my mother and her family, this made me avoid family gatherings like the plague and to even cut ties entirely with some of them.

&#x200B;

Which brings us to yesterday's gathering. We were all sitting around my grandma's dinner table talking about random subjects and everything was fine until my aunt decided to remember us all of how awful my mother is as a human being and about her many flaws of character. While everyone seemed to agree with her I had enough and asked her to stop. She said ""I won't because I'm right"". I got up and said ""It's possible to be right and still be an asshole"", but she repeated ""But I'm right"" and I said ""Yes and you're an asshole"" and left while she kept telling everyone what she thought of my mother.

&#x200B;

Today I made the bad decision of going to my grandma's house for lunch. Everyone acted sort of cold around me, specially my aunt who didn't even greet me or look at my direction when I arrived. The weirdest thing is that when I went to grab lunch my aunt followed me and shoved me with her body. I asked her wtf?! and she acted like it wasn't intentional but then tried to mock me for being too emotional, but after I ignored her she stopped and got quiet.

&#x200B;

Later I asked my father what he thought of the situation and he said I should apologize to my aunt for offending her yesterday, that she was only speaking the truth and she was angry today because she was hurt from being called an asshole.

I'm also relatively chill about buying drinks, driving friends places, and I'm of the mindset that with your close mates bits of money here and there shouldn't matter and this would go both ways.

Me and some friends went on an expensive holiday last year. So that he could come, I lent my friend £500 for flights / accommodation with no real deadline for him to pay this off. He said he would pay me within a few months of this holiday, I told him I wasn't too fussed if he was struggling with money I don't mind when he pays me as it will just go back in my savings whenever he pays me.

Paying me back took much longer than he anticipated and over a year later he still hadn't paid. I wasn't annoyed and still made it clear that there was no deadline, as he would mention that he was trying his best to get funds together to pay me back. About a year later he had to move into a new place, and needed money to buy a sofa. He asked me as a last resort; I said no problem, it's no issue for me I'd like to help you out and again I'm not bothered how long it takes to repay me.

He finally paid me everything back in a lump sum as I had requested rather than instalments. I thanked him.

On saturday last week we were going to a party. He was shopping and I asked if he could buy me some clothes from the shop that would be about £13. He said no problem and bought them. He has sent me a few messages since then asking for money for that and for fuel as he drove me to the party. I said yeah I would pay him, forgot, and I had another message chasing me up for payment as he needed the money for bills. I wasn't planning on not paying him, but I told him it was annoying me that he won't leave me alone no more than two days since paying the money, and there were things I've let him off recently such as cinema tickets and using my streaming subsciption service for free. I also contested the amount he wanted for fuel as it seemed excessive. I told him I would not have even asked him for fuel money as it wasn't an overly long drive, and that if he didnt have the money to lend me for the clothes then he should have said that and just asked me to send him the money straight away so that he could buy them with my money.

I expressed annoyance that he probably owed me for many things that I let him off, and that he had also chased me up various times for owing him small bits of money whilst he still owed me the £500.

Yes, I had the money to be able to pay him back straight away and he claimed he needed it for bills. But given the circumstances, AITA for how I reacted?",49,162,0.95
414,Not the A-hole,"I know it sounds bad, but I can still go to the funeral, they’re not happening at the same time. My tattoo appointment would be almost 2 days before. 

The reason this is so important to me is because I’ve been waiting for YEARS to get tattooed by this particular artist, but traveling to see him has never been possible. He’s currently doing a guest spot at a local shop and I have an appointment for next week! Yay!! Unfortunately it’s set for the 2 days before my grandfather’s funeral... 

The reason my family wants me to cancel it is because this particular tattoo is on my face... I’m not looking for anyone’s opinions on that. my body is mostly all covered by now so it wouldn’t really be the craziest addition, and it’s not like it’ll be any sort of offensive content. I tried to talk to my artist, and he says he feels for me but is on a tight schedule and can’t move out appointment. 

So I’m refusing to move it. So far, I would say NAH, however my family is taking it further. I was extremely close to my grandpa, and he actually loved my tattoos, but my family is refusing to let me go to his funeral if I don’t cancel this appointment. It’s not like they hate my tattoos, the reason is IMO way stupider. My grandfather is a veteran, and there will be a lot of other veterans there, who MIGHT be put off by me, my grandfather’s only grandson. My aunt has even gone so far as to say I should cut my hair (it’s long) and COVER MY VISIBLE TATTOOS IN MAKEUP so I don’t “stand out” too much (I’m also kinda tall so that’ll happen regardless, especially if I’m smearing everything in MAKEUP). 

So I’m putting my foot down. I’m getting my face tattoo, I’m going to my grandfather’s funeral as is because I love him and want to be there, and I’ll leave it up to them if they don’t wanna let me in and cause a scene. AITA for that?",84,270,0.89
415,Not the A-hole,"tldr; AITA roommate for dressing like I would if I was living with all women (sometimes no bra, sleep in underwear & t-shirt, brush teeth in towel after shower while others use the bathroom)? Is this ""inconsiderate and rude"" to my male roommates as my friend says?

I'm a mid20s woman with a ""gifted"" figure and am currently living in a house with 5 other guys, all in their 20s (early to late).  Growing up, I always lived with women so I learned to dress ""comfortable"" around the house. To me that means a shirt with no bra and a pair of tiny cotton shorts, though if I plan to be in the common areas a while, I DO put on a bra.  I sleep in a t-shirt and underwear and will get up to go to the bathroom dressed like that. Sometimes I sleep naked and in that case I have a cute silk robe that I put on. Also I will brush my teeth in my towel after a shower (our shower is separated from our sinks so other roommates can still use the bathroom while I'm getting ready). None of this was ever a problem living at home or with girl friends and when I moved into this new place, I kind of just kept being me.

Somehow, this came up while hanging out with my friend and her BF. My friend got upset and told me I'm being ""inconsiderate and rude"" and basically an asshole roommate for not dressing ""modest enough"" around my male roommates. She thinks it's unfair to them and that my behavior is inappropriate. She said that I have to be more modest ""because of"" my figure (an argument I hate) and that I'm acting slutty by dressing how I do around the house, despite the fact that this is how I've always dressed around the house. Also, a little off topic, but she also suggested that I stop wearing regular jean shorts too so I don't upset my roommates' girlfriends (of those that have one), because I ""don't want to be the reason for drama"" (which I think is BS and immature). The only thing her BF had to say was that ""they're probably all jacking it"" to me because of how I dress.

None of my roommates have ever said anything about how I dress, NOR their girlfriends (because their girlfriends are mature and secure people). I'm not walking around in lingerie or naked, I'm just dressing comfortably the same way I ALWAYS have. Plus, I seriously doubt they're ""jacking it to me"". And if they are, I really don't care, because it's not my business. Why do I have to change the way I dress in my own home? I pay the same rent. I don't bring strangers over, I clean up after myself, I'm pretty quiet. So again, AITA here?

Edit: Thank you for everyone that replied. It sounds like mostly you guys think my friend should mind her own business and stop being so judgmental, so I'll stop freaking out about whether I'm an a-hole roommate. It was actually bothering me to the point that when I put on a dress yesterday I questioned if I should change because it was low cut and I worried about my roommates seeing me- but now I see she got in my head and that's just crazy thinking. I did notice I got downvoted (very) slightly in the comments for defending her, but I refuse to end our decade-long friendship and we're going to have a ""talk"" about her projecting her issues onto me. We did talk recently about how we speak to each other and being more respectful (I'm not perfect and this goes both ways for us) so it is an issue we're working on. We've become VERY different people as we've gotten older and so we're working out the kinks.

421,Not the A-hole,"My mother in law (MIL) is a real piece of work. I have a long and contentious history dealing with that narcissistic abuser. You only need to see my post history for extensive details.

I'm August 2018 an incident occurred where mother in law and father in law both said they ""we're sick of her"" and had ""wiped their hands of her"". Her being MIL's own mother,  Grandmother in law (GMIL).


In December 2018, MIL stated that she wanted her mother out of her house and into permanent care so she could rent out GMIL's unit on Airbnb. Mother in Law has SEVERE financial difficulties. So this would seem like a viable option to her.


2 months ago in May 2019, after many months of suspicion, I called MIL out as an elder abuser via email. I had gathered enough evidence and/or witnesses to back up my claim. My claim showed evidence of social and psychological abuse, and neglect. I took this claim directly to MIL and called her out as an elder abuser. 


It went as well as could be expected from a narcissistic abuser. In that, she denied all wrongdoing, went on the attack, turned herself into the victim, and me the offender. She has been on the war path slandering my name since then.  This state of affairs has continued for the last 2 months.


After sending my email calling out the abuse I was told, in writing, by MIL,  that :

""I was also hurt and distressed at your allegations about GMIL's care, in which I follow the recommendations and advice of GMIL's medical practitioners to ensure she is looked after to the best of our ability. GMIL's medical practitioners have confirmed their satisfaction with her well-being in my care.


3 weeks ago, GMIL was found collapsed on her front driveway. She was so ill that FIL thought she might die. When they got her to hospital they found the following:


☆GMIL had undiagnosed and untreated diabetes

☆ GMIL was anaemic

☆ GMIL's medication had not been administered correctly by self or others  

☆ GMIL weighed only 47kg (103lb)


GMIL is now in permanent care, recovering, and healing. She will not return ""home"" to live with her daughter and son in law.


I spoke with my GP this week about the situation (again) and the first words out of her mouth were ""that's abuse"".


I fully believe that GMIL is where she needs to be right now - away from her abuser and getting the help she needs. She is now recovering and thriving and that's great.

I know that GMIL won't speak up against her daughter. I know that GMIL is now relatively safe and cared for. I know that GMIL will likely die before she gets any justice. 


So, WIBTA, for reporting my MIL for neglect/elder abuse anyway? My husband thinks I would be, given nothing will change except driving a wedge between him and his family. I feel like saying nothing would be a disservice to me, GMIL, and all the other abused/vulnerable/exploited people of the world.

422,Not the A-hole,"I'm getting married in a couple weeks. It's going to be small, only 12 guests, so we're having dinner at a 5 star restaurant rather than having the event catered. I met with the restaurant manager a couple of months ago and explained that I was lactose intolerant. She assured me they could accommodate. A few days ago she emailed me the proposed menu for the 5 course meal everyone would be eating. Every item except one looks like it contains dairy.

&#x200B;

I asked if they'd be using dairy substitutes, and she told me no, they had a ""separate menu"" planned for me. I don't want to be an asshole or a bridezilla, but I am honestly baffled and annoyed. If they have to plan a separate menu anyway, why not just make the entire thing without dairy? Is it really easier to do two separate 5 course meals?

&#x200B;

For some context, I am not dairy free by choice, and I was not born this way. I developed the intolerance about 4 years ago. I am a foodie and I LOVE cheese, creamy sauces, ice cream, all things dairy.  The ""actual"" menu the restaurant manager sent me looks amazingly delicious, and I don't want to be staring enviously at what everyone else is eating. If it weren't my own wedding, I'd suck it up and be grateful someone accommodated my issue. However, this is going to be an expensive dinner and it's my own freakin' wedding! My fiancé is very supportive and has given up dairy with me except for the occasional pizza. Would I be a selfish bridezilla if I asked the restaurant to serve everyone this ""separate menu,"" whatever it is?

&#x200B;

Would I be an asshole for not letting my guests enjoy the dinner the restaurant has planned for them? Thank you for any feedback! I have not yet decided whether to make an issue out of this or just let it go.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I agree that I WBTA if I were restricting everyone from ordering what they wanted off the restaurant's normal menu. This is going to be a pre-set 5 course dinner. Salad, App., Entree, 2 desserts. Everyone has the same thing (but could opt out of one or two if they didn't like it). It's not going to be a normal catered wedding where you have 3 or 4 options.

EDIT: Since people are asking, I don't know what the ""separate"" menu is. The restaurant manager hasn't emailed it (yet?). I think that's mainly why I'm upset. If this restaurant is as good as I've been told, the non-dairy menu should be great too, but it seems like they've focused all their energy on the ""main"" menu, so I don't know.",84,38,0.81

We were in public so she didn’t yell, but was pissed. She told me she didn’t think that would work since she planned on hosting, because my brother (and possibly sister) would be coming from overseas, and they’re HER kids and she wants to do Christmas at HER home. She could still have them stay with her the night before, have Christmas morning with them and then drive to mine for lunchtime.

I decided to forget about him but my brother used to be really close to him and he got angry but at the same time he expected him to come back.

Reason for this post: About a month ago Father found Brother on social media and decided to start talking to him. Brother was over the moon and could not shut up about it. I just listened to what he had to say and eventually he would leave. Yesterday Father invited Brother to meet up with him this weekend, Brother asked me to go with him. I said I could drive him there but I would not stay. 

Brother started questioning why and saying that it would be fun, that I was ruining his plans. I told him that his plan should be between him and Father, not me. He said that going alone made him feel like he was doing something wrong and he wanted my company. I once again told him that I could drive him there and if he wanted I could go pick him up. He said he wanted me to be there during the entire thing because he wanted it to feel like family and started to really push it so would agree with him.

At this point I was already annoyed with it and once he brought up the whole family thing that rubbed me the wrong way. I told him that I did not want to do it because I did not see Father as family, if he wanted to hang out with him that's fine but I could not do it in good conscience. Brother got very upset by this and said I was being a dick and that I was judging him. Our mother refuses to step in the middle of this one because she avoids saying anything about Father.",22,68,0.94

429,Not the A-hole,"I walk around wearing headphones with no music so strangers won't talk to me.  I always thought that it was a universally understood thing not to bother people with headphones.

Apparently not. In this past week alone,  three different people have tried talking to me. I ignore them,  I'm usually looking down,  writing something,  washing my hands, etc.

And then they wave their hand in my face really hard and way too close. I don't mind if it's important but one person literally only wanted to say hello. 

Last night I was in the bathroom, washing my hands, like you do, and it happened again.  This woman asks me what the time is and I say I don't know. 

She points at my phone and says, ""Really? You can't be bothered to check?""

I look back at my hands, covered in water, then back at her and say, ""My hands are wet?""

She then says, ""I apologize. I don't mean to be rude or annoying or anything."" But in an annoyed tone. Then she literally runs away before I can dry my hands.",33,40,0.85

432,Not the A-hole,"We bought our house about a year ago. Neighbors are a mid-50’s couple with grown kids with none at home and they are renting. Up until a month ago, there would be the occasional visit/babysitting of a couple of their young grandkids.

Then, suddenly, there were 5+ kids from infant to probably 5 there every day. Its typical that they are put in the back yard to play and the result is never ending screaming/yelling and noise from several different electronic toys.

I suspect day care because there are a couple of women around who don’t live there and I have overheard comments that line up with the parents picking up their kids in the evening.

All in all it makes enjoying our back yard in the summer a bit of a challenge as they are sometimes there until as late as 8pm.

I decided to check laws, and also if they were licensed, so I called around to various state departments to see what I could find. I eventually spoke with one that was able to confirm they didn’t have a permit that was a first step to getting the right license, so they couldn’t possibly be licensed. I was also given the contact of the proper agency to report this to.

At this point I haven’t reported them. Not sure if their spidey senses activated but there hasn't been much action for a week or so, but I am very tempted to report it if it all fires off again.

**TL;DR** neighbors may be running an unlicensed day care of the noisiest sort and I am tempted to report them",80,115,0.9
433,No A-holes here,"My husband had a baby with a woman when he was 19. They were never ‘together’ but he loved the idea of being a dad and stepped right into the role when she told him she was expecting. He’s 34 now and his son is 14. 

He has always paid child support, and actually has always paid a little more than he is required to. He only has his son 2 days a week usually, sometimes more, sometimes less. Lately he’s had him more often  as he has stopped working for the past 4 months.

We’ve been married for 4 years, and something I’ve noticed over the duration of this period is how often my stepsons mom will call up asking for money for cigarettes, or alcohol, or that she ‘really needs a gym membership because she doesn’t trust stepson to go alone’. To pay their internet bill. Things like that. At first I never said anything, because I felt uncomfortable and felt like it wasn’t my place.

Lately however, our financial circumstances have altered slightly- I’m the only one with a job at the mo. We have deep savings, and my husband is still paying his ex with that money. She is continuing to ask for extra and I want to ask my husband to stop giving her an extra $40 here and there because those are OUR savings that need to be spent on either myself, my husband, stepson, or the house. NOT his ex who wants grey goose and cigs. 

His attitude to this is ‘an easier life for her means an easier life for son when he’s over there’ but in my opinion he needs to buck up and realize that it’s needless and kind of disrespectful to me that he’s using our money on her very nonessential desires.

435,Not the A-hole,"I work at a small tech company where it's basically split between designers and project managers. I'm the admin assistant, so I do a little bit of everything until we find out what I'm good at. The others in the company come from much different experiences and life backgrounds than me. On the PM side, it's mostly women, and they love to talk about all the things they buy, travel, etc. 

One of them pulled me into a conversation about travel and said we should all bring in passports to compare places we've been. I said ""Oh, I've never had a passport."" She was shocked, asked me why not. I just said ""Oh, I can't really afford to travel."" She looked confused and asked about when I was growing up, where would we go on family vacations. I said we didn't and changed the subject. She kept looking at me weird after that.

Then came the purse thing. I've carried the same bag with me for about 6 years. One of the girls laughed at a fraying strap and said it was time for a new one, and suggested this brand I'd never heard of that kind of matched the style. I looked it up and said ""That's a really nice one! But wow, $150 for a purse!"" She looked at me funny and said ""Do you think that's a lot...?"" I said yes, that's basically two weeks groceries for me. She was very taken aback.

The ""inciting"" incident happened last week. One of the women recently started the process of buying a house. She's really excited and got her a nice candle. One of the women said that I was next, and I just said ""Haha, yeah right!"" One of the women asked when I thought I'd start looking, and I was honest and said that I don't really see home ownership as a part of my life. They were all shocked and kept trying to tell me why I was wrong, and I admit I got a little annoyed when they wouldn't drop it. I said ""With what money?""

It got awkward after that, and the next day one of the women pulled me aside and told me that they're sick of the way I always have to be a downer about money, and that I always make it awkward when I talk about what I can't afford. I said ""Well, how do you think it makes me feel to have you guys constantly flaunting all the purses and high end makeup and designer clothes you're wearing."" She said that they were bonding, that's what women do, and that from now on, I should try to be more discrete about the income disparity between us. 

I said ""Sure, if you guys will be, so will I."" She gave me a look and said that I'm acting kind of like an asshole and punishing them for something that's not their fault. I told her that she was certainly entitled to that opinion, but that I think it's tacky to brag about all of the lavish things you can buy.

There are more people who participate in the drawing than there are tickets, so about 10 people unfortunately do not get to go to a game each year. There is an employee that has a reputation to take other people’s ideas and sell them to the boss as their own. Obviously this person is not well liked by the others.

438,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so I’ll try to keep this short, but it’s been really bothering me the past few days and I’m unsure what to do. 

In August my husband’s friend is getting married across the country. A large group of my husband’s friends decided to rent a large Airbnb together. I was hesitant to do this because the cost total is rather high ($3600 for 3 days), and wanted to stay in a smaller place with either just my husband or a smaller group of his friends. However, my husband adamantly wanted to stay in the larger place with his friends. Okay. 

So one of my husband’s friends takes charge, gathers names and says he will be in charge of calculating payments, etc. I’m under the impression that combined my husband and I will be paying a total of ($450-650) for the three nights based on this guy’s information. All in all we have 12 people confirmed and 3 people on the fence. 

Now the wedding is coming up in three weeks so I decide to check in on the price (my husband attempted to multiple times over the past few months, but his friend couldn’t give a straight answer). His friend keeps telling me “Oh well, so and so bailed, such and such can’t come.” I responded that I had a very set budget for this event. 

We’re now looking at paying upwards of $900-1000 for this airbnb where we might not even get our own room. I don’t get paid over the summers and might be losing my job in the next month and a half. I don’t have the extra money to foot the bill for all the people who bailed. 

Now here comes the asshole part. Would I be an asshole if I did one of two things?:

1. Refuse to pay above my high end estimate ($650...hell I’d even pay $700 begrudgingly) for the Airbnb. This friend claimed that he had it all figured out, and never bothered to check in with everyone along the way. 

2. Ask all the people who bailed last second to cover some of their portion of the bill since they enthusiastically agreed that they were in, and that was the ONLY reason we booked such a big place. (One friend already has communicated that she’s more than happy to do this since she realizes we made plans with her being there in mind).

439,Not the A-hole,"All my (32F) life I have worried about my ability to conceive because when I was 13 I listened in on a phone call between my mother and my aunt where my mom described her fourteen miscarriages to her sister, my aunt, who had so far had 5 miscarriages. I worried it was a family genetics thing. I was taking biology in school and learning about genes. 

My mother is very anxious and overprotective, which I believe is related in part to the fourteen miscarriages.  

I got married. My husband wanted kids, I did not, I relented. I scheduled coffee with my mother to talk about conceiving. I knew it would be hard for her to discuss; she 
I couldn’t get any info out of her
Three coffee dates later she told me her trouble conceiving stemmed from a bacterial issue that was cleared up with experimental antibiotic treatment. 

I told my doctor and she said such bacterial issues are not uncommon, but aren’t usually inherited. 

I got pregnant. I miscarried at 8 weeks on Sunday. I feel like I am dying and to everyone who has miscarried I am so sorry you have gone through this it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. 

After I miscarried my mother said she had to tell me something. 

She has a genetic issue that greatly increases the risk of miscarriages.  They didn’t find out about it until after my younger brother was tested for something else when he was small.  He has it. They don’t know if I have it. I have the letter from the hospital describing the issue.  urging my parents to get me tested. 

There are treatments now to help people with this genetic issue but they are expensive and I should have been doing them from the start. 

My mother doesn’t understand science. She told me she personally thinks the bacterial treatment can fix the genetic issue. That’s not how it works. 

She told me she was under no obligation to tell me about the issue since she “can’t be sure” if I have it.  She told me I am ungrateful person for being angry that she didn’t tell me sooner.  I fucking asked her what the issue was. She told me I am weak and she had so many more miscarriages and that my “reaction to adversity” is “disappointing.”

She should have told me

She hasn’t told my brother he has this genetic issue

He thinks I’m being an asshole for “lashing out” at my mother, who is “just trying to help me through a tough time.”

I told her if she didn’t tell him by August 1, I would tell him (he needs to know. He and his long term GF deserve to know, treatment works better when you are younger, I’m too old now). 

she Said she didn’t tell me because I am a hypochondriac with a defeatist attitude and I never would have tried to get pregnant if I knew and she knew the doctors would figure it out faster for me than they did for her, and I have such a head start over her I should be grateful.

442,Not the A-hole,"This happened about 30 minutes ago. 

I was driving home with a friend. We were coming up to a roundabout that was clear from my side. As I was passing over, a woman came speeding past from the left, causing me to have to slow down substantially in the middle of the roundabout. 

She was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. I blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

I don’t know what happened after that, but it’s a busy roundabout so I doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. The person I was driving with blasted me, saying I shouldn’t have done that and I was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. I disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. But, my friend is insistent that I was an asshole.

EDIT: women to woman.

EDIT: okay holy shit this blew up. I can’t read through all the comments, so I’ll just try clear up a couple things. 

1) This is in England, we give way to the right and not the left. The roundabout was a 2 lane on a busy street, no pedestrian access. 

2) For those saying obviously NTA, karma whoring etc - I get it. If I could lock this post now I would. However, there’s been quite a few ESH’s and YTA’s with good points, and I’m now thinking whilst NTA feels good, and there is a sense of instant karma, ESH is probably more appropriate. I shouldn’t have blazed my horn, it wasn’t really an emergency, and in doing so I could’ve caused a worse accident.

Some people don’t seem to understand how roundabouts in England work. To try clear things up, I’ve drawn the worlds worst diagram.

444,Not the A-hole,"So I recently got a short term job lasting a couple weeks with this IT company for the summer. The company sent us to another country for these few weeks to help them out with a client. The way our time sheets work is that we just sort of do our work and at the end of the day we put in the amount of hours that we worked and then someone from HR approves them at the end of the week. Well this method of clocking our hours seems pretty vague because we might stay longer and so it’s difficult to get an accurate amount of time clocked in. One of my coworkers on this trip is a pretty “eccentric” guy to say the least. He would constantly complain about the food and would make it clear he doesn’t think eating it is safe(when it perfectly was).


Sometime in the second week we all went out to the restaurant we’ve usually been going to. He ordered some spicy seafood platter and an entire 1.5 liter of lemonade. Well suffice it to say he drank the entire lemonade and didn’t feel right after that. He said afterwards that he didn’t feel too well and would not be coming into work the next day. We were all like sure no problem but our work calls for us to reach a quota of computers patched so that made the rest of us have to pick up his slack. The next day we all went out to eat breakfast at the hotel and we saw him there. He seemed fine so we were like “hey didn’t you not feel well yesterday?”. He seemed fine but he said he still had a little bit of a stomach ache and would still be staying in. We were like okay whatever and went to work. During that day some of the crew had a few questions for him so they asked him via text. He answered like 5 texts and that was it pretty much.


Later on in the day after we all got back and were exhausted. We had to put in 11 hours instead of 8 because we were behind. We came back and all ate and afterwards talked to our coworker. He said that it was an exhausting day as well for him (he stayed in bed all day). His reasoning was that he was “on-call” all day answering texts from us and his supervisor.  Then he said that he would also be putting in 11 hours because he had to be alert and up all day to be able to answer our texts and to talk to his supervisor. We were all pretty upset but didn’t say anything. I feel like that’s not fair to everyone else that put in actual work for the entire day. I want to report him to HR but I feel like that would get him fired or maybe even worse, but my other coworkers say that he deserves it. So, WIBTA if I report him to my employer?",76,216,0.96
445,Not the A-hole,"This happened several months ago, was speaking about it to a friend so wondering whether I was the AH.

I (20M) in college. Several months ago a student group on the campus was doing some protest regarding sexism or something, some activist crap like that. I'm not politically involved in anything, doesn't interest me. I just go to class, party and work out.

So I was walking to class one day and this protest was blocking my way to class. They were physically blocking people from going to class. I try going another way and there's a protester there, who looks to be about 19 year old dude.

I tell him ''Get out of my way, I'm going to class'' and he starts rambling incoherently about whatever the fuck it is he's protesting. I say it again and he says ''No'' and starts rambling. 

I just look him in the eye and say ''Dude, get the fuck out of the way. NOW, or I will call the cops''. He looks a bit scared, at that point I knew this kid didn't know jack shit about anything, was frightened at the mention of cops. He gets out of my way and I go to class. No issue.

Now yesterday I was talking to a friend (20F) about this and she called me out for being an asshole. She said I shouldn't have done that as these issues are important. I said I don't give a fuck, my parents are paying for me to go to class and that's what I'm going to do. AITA?

450,Not the A-hole,"For the first few years I was married, my MIL and her husband would barrage me with prejudiced questions, the occasional insult, and passive aggressive remarks. 

Over time, it became obvious my “dark” features and the fact that I’m American (they’re from a wealthy European country) were things that they just couldn’t pass up an opportunity to point out to the point of making me feel like I’d always be that dark-skinned foreign girl that their son married and not a true and welcome member of the family.

I’d say the breaking point of it was when my MIL came to my house while my husband was at work. I’d just ended work with my company in the U.S. because I wanted to find a local job and gain international experience. She said all sorts of horrible things, drilling me on my search, saying the only thing I’d be qualified for is scrubbing toilets. 

Not that this would be alright even if it were true, but it felt like even more of a slap in face because she’s well aware that I‘d been successful in my career. It hurt. And I believed her. That visit really drove me into a depression where I started to hate everything about myself. 

It’s been so painful to know them. I won’t sugarcoat it. I’ve spent more times than I can count crying my eyes out after a visit with them. But I try to remind myself to be kind. I guess I’ve always hoped being a good example could challenge their narrow views and help them understand we’re all just human. 

But everyone has their limits. I realized, after years of this, that they’d always see my color and ideas about “status” before seeing how much I love their son and want to love their family.

I started keeping my distance for my own self-preservation. My MIL realized this. In the last six months, in the times I’ve seen her, my MIL has laid it on way too thick. Forcing long hugs, complimenting me, and telling me how proud she is about my accomplishments.

It’s had me kind of creeped out, mostly because there was never an apology and we don’t have the intimate or friendly relationship that she’s suddenly pretending we do. She used to ignore my texts or calls. Now I get a flowery one from her every couple of weeks. I feel like I went from “colored daughter-in-law” to “My FaVoRiTe PeRsOn EvEr!” overnight without a conversation or chance for forgiveness and healing.

So, that brings me to my birthday this year. In the past, if they sent a gift, it was something like a book about prayer or something for the kitchen. This year? I opened the gift this morning and it’s  a set of pearls from a very expensive jeweler. 

I feel uncomfortable. Even if my husband bought me something this expensive, I’d feel it was too much. Heck, I’m not sure I’d feel right receiving this gift from my own mother. Coming from my MIL, it’s like she’s trying to buy me, almost. Would I be the a-hole if I told her I don’t feel comfortable accepting this gift?",19,47,0.95

She currently works as a store assistant in retail, earning £8/hr and complains about it a lot, so she started getting into photography, doing mainly wedding photography. She has had a lot of success because of connections so she has managed to get quite a few jobs doing it and earned a fair bit of money (probably like £3000) doing a few jobs here and there.

Bear in mind she has only done about 10 weddings, so she is still considered a beginner in the eye of the customer, seeing as she has a relatively small portfolio, so this means she doesn't get paid as much as a professional, experienced photographer. She hates this.

For a wedding, she will get paid anywhere between £300 and £700, depending on time, but then she needs to edit the photos in her own time - on average she makes roughly £30-£40 per hour which at 24 is not bad if I'm gonna be honest. I'm really proud of her.

But now, she has started saying she's going to refuse to do weddings because she thinks she's being underpaid, which I think is so ridiculous - she's willing to work £8/hr doing something she HATES, yet she won't do something she enjoys for £40/hr??? I told her shes making a stupid decision and that better pay will come with experience, but she says shit like ""this photographer gets £100/hr so I should too"" and now she gets pissed off when I tell her she's taking it for granted

I don’t want to be a dickhead so I say yes but I say she has to pick her own tab since I don’t know her and we are going to an expensive restaurant. The 12 of us show up and are seated and the night goes great until the bill arrives.

I pay it and we then leave I then go over to her and ask for my 80 dollars (she ordered a 45 dollar steaks and a starter and dessert) she looks at me like I’ve just stepped off mars and then just laughs. I see nothing funny about it and ask again, my friend now comes up to me and asks wtf why are you asking my gf for 80 dollars and I remind him that I said she would have to pay for herself. He says he thought I was joking and now the girl is saying she won’t pay it.  I’m now annoyed and say either you pay me or we’re not giving you a ride home (all my friends side with me).

Ben is one of those lucky kids who has money given to him by well-meaning adults. My husband and I started Ben his very own bank account. Ben is aware of his account and has access to his account through myself and my husband. If he wants something and can afford it, we go to the bank and he buys what he wants.

My MIL found out about the bank account and it pissed her off. Apparently by taking the money she (or anyone) gives Ben it's disrespectful because by being in the bank it isn't being used for it's intended purpose. Basically it's like we're spitting in the giver's face. Recently my MIL had my son for the afternoon and she gave him three hundred dollars in cash and told him not to tell me or his daddy that she did, not to put it in the bank, to keep it somewhere and use it. My son was raised better than to hide things from me when he knows the reason is wrong so he told me about it when we got home that night. Apparently he felt guilty and he didn't feel like he could keep the money if he was lying to me. I'm very proud.

I called my MIL and requested that she not tell my child to lie to me in future or I'd be cutting short her visits and time with my son.

It's a good idea to note my MIL hates me and I tried for a long time to change her mind without results. So now we just tolerate each other (badly).

&#x200B;

Everyone there knew it was also a b-day party so they gave him cash and gifts as well. My MIL gave me an envelope and told me it was a card and check for Ben, stuck her finger in my face and told me it better get spent on toys and games or, and I quote, ""I swear to God I'll call the cops on your trashy ass for theft."" I told her we were done, she wouldn't be seeing her grandson for a long time, and then we left. My husband was furious at her but thinks cutting her off from Ben isn't the right thing to do.

&#x200B;

Here's the AITA part: I put the check in Ben's bank account but didn't tell him it had been given to him, essentially removing his option to spend it. Since it was a check she was obviously notified of it's being deposited. I also sent her a note thanking her for the check and included the fact that it was deposited in Ben's account.

&#x200B;

AITA for this or am I justified? (I'm also considering posting this in r/parenting and r/JUSTNOMIL but I wanted the good opinion of this sub first!)

&#x200B;

ETA: Ben woke up about an hour ago and I sat him down while he ate breakfast and I explained to him that his g-ma gave him a lot of money but that she and mommy had a tiny disagreement over it at the party and mommy did something wrong and put the money in the bank without telling him about. I explained to him that sometimes when people fight their pride kicks in and instead of handling things like adults they decide to be petty and passive aggressive. I explained to him that mommy acted on pride and anger instead of thinking of Ben. I told him that they money was right there in the bank waiting for him to use it and in this one instance if he wanted to use all of it on a gaming system and games that I would totally allow that as part of my apology for keeping it from him. I apologized to him and told him that it was never okay for me to keep his money and presents from him. I told him that he was a good kid for coming to me when someone wanted him to lie to me and I should have given him the same courtesy. Ben was very understanding and forgiving and has made the very grown up decision to save his money up so he can buy a newer gaming system and better games. But he said he wants to take out some money to buy his mama something so I'm crying a little. He said it was flowers because I told the truth. I raised me a good one!",513,3680,0.96
456,Asshole,"I am a bartender in Aus and one night the group of 4 come up and one of them looks about 14, so I ask for ID and looks legit and all and says he is 19 (For you Americans the drinking age is 18 in Aus) I study the ID for a while trying to find any mistake or whatever because I don’t feel comfortable serving someone who looks 14. I can’t find anything and ask him his date of birth.

458,Asshole,"Fiancé*

The title basically sums it up. 

It is an open secret in my family (though never openly talked about) that my sister worked as a sex worker in her early 20s. Just to clarify this wasn’t to pay off any debt - her college was fully paid for by our parents - it was just her preferred way of making money at the time.

Anyway my sister is engaged to a nice guy, let’s call him Ben. Ben didn’t know of this open secret despite being engaged to my sister. I’ve never judged my sister for her actions, but this would personally be a deal breaker for me and I thought that Ben needed to know **before** they get married so he can make an informed decision.

I gave my sister a month to tell him herself as I thought it would be best coming from her. She didn’t think I’d actually tell him and so never came clean. I told him, and he has broken off the engagement while he reconsiders the relationship.

As you can imagine my family thinks I’m the worst thing since new coke. I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong, past sex work is a deal breaker for most men, and Ben deserves to know.

459,Not enough info,"About a month me (21M) and my gf(20F) moved into together after 2.5 years of dating. We'd lived together in separate bedrooms for the past year and in general before that we spent most night at one of our flats together anyway. We had issues before we moved in together but I always thought we could make it work.

But on Monday she broke up with me and did the whole normal thing of it's ok for you to stay until you've got somewhere to go. We'll I might have found someone to move in with but that won't be until November, and she said that's too long to wait and I need to go asap. I work in a bar and don't earn that much money but I've spent the past year saving to move into this place, learn to drive and go back to college to do a couple of courses, so in total I have around £1500 in saving. I could afford to move into a crappy flat until November on my own but it would involve spending all my savings and I don't know how quickly I could save that kind of money again and that would put my entire life plan on hold for at least a couple of years and I'm not willing to do that. I live in a pretty student area and they're are lots of places advertising that they need one person to fill a room until December. But I know what will happen if I go back to student halls, I'll drink, all the time. I was a bit of an alcoholic the past 2 years while at uni but the past 6 months or so I've really managed to cut down how much I drink or at least how often. I don't want to go to a student house because I'll think I'll just drink all the time and especially now that I'm on my own nothing will stop turning into a full-blown alcoholic.

The only option that seems viable is I go home for 4 months. But I don't think I could do that, I haven't been home much at all over the past 3 years because my relationship with my parents is very fragile, I told them I was bi before I went to uni and they didn't take it well. I also don't want to go back to being alone with no friends, especially if I have to watch her carry on with my friends. I'm also up for a promotion at work and I'm about to start an apprenticeship there and moving would stop all that for at least until 2020.

She thinks I'm being really unreasonable and self-centered because living together would be really hard for both of us and our other housemate. But I think me moving out now means that my life gets thrown into turmoil and I don't know what to do?

Tl/Dr - moved in with gf, broke up and I need to move out. But can't until November and there's no really option that doesn't really Fuck me over in the long term. She thinks I'm being an arsehole

EDIT - I'm the one that is choosing to move out. I can't afford the rent with the other house mate and we can't get a third because I'm currently sleeping in the living room on an air mattress while I wait for a sofa bed to arrive. I agreed to move out - there is no sexism or anything at play, it's my choice to go and make it easier for her and  the other housemate.
Also after looking through the lease and by an amazing bit of luck - my best friend is moving back to where we live in August and I will e moving in to live on his sofa, rent free until November (he still student and gets a grant to cover the rent, I'm not just being cheap)",30,43,0.92

My mother proceeds to flip the hell out because apparently penne isn't my brother's favorite type of pasta.

Since I still have to work every day, he spends about 9 hours a day alone. When I come home, he shows me his drawings, and they look really really good. One day, he showed me an extremely elaborate drawing that I recognized, and I said something like: Wow, this looks exactly like the comic, how did you do that?? And he said: Well, like all of my drawings, I traced it.

I almost blacked out when he said that. I went to my comic collection and started opening them up and I saw traces of pen all over them. Some of the pages were slightly torn in places because he pressed too hard with the pen. He spent about 3 weeks drawing, every day, for hours, and he traced a pen over about a half of my comics. My initial reaction was pretty bad, I got really angry and shouted at him, told him he was too old to be doing stupid shit like this and that he should know better than to ruin other people's things.

When I separated all of the ruined comics, I calculated they cost about 600 dollars. I told him I was going to tell his mom and he begged me not to. He said he had some money saved up and asked if he can buy the comics off me. He said he had 400 dollars, and that he would save and give me the other 200 in a few months, but I said he can have them for 300.

When his parents joined us last week, his mom noticed he was missing 300 dollars. (She knew he had 400 because he said he would get some new clothes and look for art supplies in my city.) She asked him what he had bought that was so expensive, and he eventually told her the truth. Then, my sister and her husband freaked out on me for ""taking money from a child"" and demanded I give it back. I said I was already doing them a favor for forgiving him half the cost. They said he needs that money, and I said they can reimburse him then since they didn't bother teaching him not to destroy other people's property.

When my granddaughter was born, I helped my daughter and her boyfriend as much as I could. I was always told that her birth control failed and that’s why she got pregnant.

Fast forward a year later and they’re pregnant once again, “birth control failure”. I was suspicious but my daughter swore up and down she was taking her pills and I was picking them up from the pharmacy for her, so it shouldn’t have been a problem. 

I guess I wasn’t the only one suspicious. Her boyfriend started doing some snooping and one day, I come home to find he’s gone, and he took the baby. My daughter is a wreck. I ask what happened. She said that he’s accusing her of getting pregnant both times on purpose, is calling her crazy and wants full custody of both kids. I got her to calm down and asked her a few times if he was right about her getting pregnant on purpose. She finally confessed. She admitted to just not taking her birth control the months she wanted to conceive, and flushing them.

I have never been more pissed. These pregnancies have caused our family to go into a state of disarray. We had to rearrange our whole lives. I love my grand baby but life is ten times harder.

My friend and I had made plans earlier in the day to see the movie at our local AMC, and I decided to buy the tickets online since seats at a Marvel movie usually fill up quickly. AMC requires all ticket buyers to pick specific seats upon purchase, so I bought two seats towards the back on the left-hand side of the theater.

We ran a little late and got there about 10 minutes into the previews, and noticed a couple had taken our seats. We opted to take the seats next to them to avoid a confrontation. The theater sits about 100 people, and I'd say about 85 seats were taken when we got there. Soon enough, a father and his young son politely ask my friend and I to move, since we were now sitting in their reserved seats.

With no option I turn to the couple and explain that they're in our seats and we need them to move. They refuse. The wife tells me that someone had already taken their seats and they were forced to move here. I told her that that's not my problem. I recommended she get an employee to get her seats back, but she told me she ""doesn't come to the movies to fight"" and she won't be doing that. I explain to her that we paid in advance for the seats that they're in. She said she can't do anything about it. At this point my friend tells me it's not worth it and we can sit in one of the empty spots up front. I'm not having that.

Throwaway

Okay, I have a two-month-old and am currently on paternity leave. I’m fortunate to work at a place that’s family-oriented and where I’m a senior employee. I’m able to get a longer than typical paternity leave by working remotely from home. However, I had to go into the office to get documents that could only be accessed on my work computer. I thought I would give my wife a break and let her sleep in. So I grabbed my kid and headed to the office.

Only my boss knew I was coming in, so the office was surprised. And as people do, they gravitated towards the baby. Lots of cooing, holding, passing around, etc. This was all taking place inside my office. Then my baby started crying. I told my assistant that she can rock baby or walk around the office and they’ll go back to sleep. My assistant took her outside my office by her desk and I worked on gathering what I needed from my computer.

I stop hearing crying and look up to see my assistant on her phone, no baby in her arms. I rush out and ask where my kid is. She said asked one of the interns, let’s call her Mary, to take her because she got a call from a client.

Like most places, my office has summer interns who are college students. I’ve only met them once during the interviews months ago but I went on paternity leave before they started and haven’t worked with them like the rest of the office has. I know nothing about them personally since I’ve been out of the office.

I went over to where the intern desks are and ask where Mary was and they said she went to the bathroom. I asked if she had my baby they said she thinks so and I asked one of the female employees if she could go to the bathroom to get her. A minute later, they both come back, baby with Mary and diaper bag on her arm.

I took my kid from her arms and told her I didn’t appreciate her walking off with my kid. Mary said my assistant asked her to hold the baby and when she did, it seemed like baby needed a diaper change so she went and did that. I told her I appreciate the sentiment but didn’t like the idea of a stranger walking off with my baby.

In private, I told my boss that how I felt and that I would feel uncomfortable extending her a job offer at the end of her internship but the status of her employment now was up to my boss to decide.

When I told my wife, she said I went too far. The girl was doing a simple task and that she probably was given an “intern task”. I reiterated that the girl was a stranger and we wouldn’t let a stranger change our kid’s diaper anywhere else why work? Work doesn’t stop people from being psychos. Wife said she understood that but that I didn’t need to jeopardize the intern’s future employment and that I was throwing my weight around since I’m high in command.

I just said I know it's a tough and uncomfortable situation, and upsetting but I am always going to put my daughters feelings first. And I'm not going to let the playdates happen anymore. She seemed really bothered by everything I said, but that's her own issue to deal with now I suppose. After a long weird pause, I went back to my house. So we shall see if this settled it, and everything calms down.




________________________________________________________________________

Hi. My daughter is 6, and my neighbors daughter is 6. They moved in around 3 months ago, and we introduced our kids and my daughter asked if they could have a playdate. So the neighbor came over, the played dolls, ponies etc. After that they played almost every week at least once or twice. 

About a month ago, my neighbor brought my daughter home from their house very upset. I asked her what happened, and she explained that the neighbors daughter had gotten mad from my daughter not playing the way she wanted her to- and had started screaming at her, throwing things and crying non stop. The mom started apologizing, and saying her daughter generally gets her way and isn't good with listening. And then her daughter came running over to my house where we were talking about what happened and she grabbed my kid by the shoulder and arm, pulling and screaming ""COME BACK OVER, NOW NOW NOW!"". I grabbed my daughter and picked her up to separate them. After that the mom had to carry the daughter home kicking, screaming, and crying.

After this incident my daughter asked if she could never have a playdate with her again, and I said of course- I only want you to be comfortable and having fun. She just said that the neighbors kid scared her and she didn't like the way she yelled. 

I've been doing this song and dance of avoiding seeing them, so there would be no offer of having a playdate. But lately it seems like they've been waiting for us to come home and catch us outside. The mom and daughter come over about every other day, asking 2-4 times if they can play/why she can't play. 

I've made all the excuses, but it's gotten to the point where they'll send the daughter over by herself crying asking if she can play. (Im the only one that answers the door) Would I be the asshole if I talked with the mom and told her exactly why my daughter doesn't want to play with her, and why I don't want her to?",60,162,0.97

480,Not the A-hole,"I am currently in college, working for the summer at a small company in South Carolina. However, I am originally from New York.

My first day at work, I met the two women who I would be sharing an office with. One woman, Madison is only 2 years older than me.

When I first met them both, they seemed very friendly, and asked a bunch of questions. I told them I was from New York and Madison said “oh we’re not going to get along. I hate people from the North.” I thought she was joking so I sort of laughed it off. 

Well, it turns out she wasn’t kidding. Over the last two months or so that I’ve worked there, Madison has complained about “yankees” a lot. Her most common complaints are:
- northerners are too “sensitive” (politics)
- northerners don’t respect God enough
- northerners have no “southern hospitality”
- northerners don’t have family values
- northerners have no morals

(She has made all these assumptions from one trip she took to NYC in 6th grade because a homeless man called her mother a bitch for ignoring his request for money.) 

Madison is particularly critical of my boyfriend (who she has never even met before). Ever since finding out he was both from New Jersey and black, she has made many insensitive and rude assumptions about him.

She has accused my boyfriend of being abusive, rude, ugly, “ghetto”, selfish, and many other negative things without ever actually meeting him. And, she always goes on and on about how her “country boy” is God’s gift to earth. She constantly tells me that I need to find a religious southern man like she has. 

So, all in all, Madison is the worst and I try to keep my distance from her by any means possible. 

Today, I was in meetings all morning. When I came back, Madison was crying and the other lady was comforting her. As soon as I walked in Madison told me through heavy sobbing that a girl had instagram DMed her to tell her that her boyfriend had been cheating withher for the past YEAR. The girl only told her because he had just recently “cheated” on her with ANOTHER GIRL and she found out. 

After Madison told me all this I said “hm.. looks like dating a “country boy” doesn’t work out for everyone” and then I went to my lunch break. 

I honestly didn’t really feel bad about it cause I didn’t think what I said was that rude,but the other lady from our office said that I was out of line with that comment. She doesn’t like Madison either, but she thinks I took it too far. So, now I’m torn. 

AITA for “mocking” my coworker after her boyfriend of three years cheated on her?",1484,7088,0.96
481,Not the A-hole,"I've \[F21\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. 


I went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


It came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


As I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""Dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". I looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

I was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don’t want to go after anybody’s job, but I don’t want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

Will I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?

Edit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said “I appreciate your openness and honesty tho” (like that mattered after anything she just said 😩) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said “thanks” and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn’t even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. 

Also, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. 

And for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I’m having more fun than u 😘


UPDATE

Before I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you’re obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so “closing my legs” or “quit being easy” doesn’t fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single “whore” had one thing in common and that’s that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody’s business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

Now to the update: 
I called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn’t have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she’s most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn’t hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. 

The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she’d “call the doctor (her supervisor)” right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn’t be back in the office until next Monday. 

With all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You’ve truly been so helpful. 

And for the people calling me a slut for this, I hope to God this same thing doesn’t happen to your daughter, your mother, your sister, your aunt etc.",1248,23296,0.83
482,Not the A-hole,"I was at Wendy's today with my dad and brother. I only went to see my brother; I don't like spending time with Dad at all. Whenever I do, I just give him robotic one word answers. I can't bring myself to act enthusiastically around him due to reasons. Bro saw this and asked me about my Spain trip.

I'm studying abroad in Spain, which tuition and board is paid in full by my parents. I'm incredibly thankful for that. They're wealthy, but it's still a huge deal and I appreciate their generosity. I offered to pay for as much as I could (though I only have a few hundred bucks). They said no, they were well equipped and it hardly made a dent in their pocket.

I haven't really showed that appreciation, though. I feel bad about it, but I just shut down around them as a defense mechanism. I'm afraid of them, especially my mother.

Bro called me out on my behavior and said that it was awful of me to act like this to dad when they've given me so much. I didn't have the heart to explain myself, so I just left Wendy's crying. 

Thing is, my parents used to be abusive--not physically, but emotionally. I have PTSD from it. My dad sexually harassed me for years, which is why I hate spending time with him.

To their credit, they're not abusive anymore. That ended four years ago. Their behavior toward me has changed, but mine hasn't. I still treat them like they're going to abuse me anytime. But my dad, at least, probably won't.

I've told Bro this, but I highly doubt he believed me because he brushed it off. It was unfair to me years ago, but now I'm being unfair to them. AITA?",48,119,0.89
483,Asshole,"In 2012 I purchased about 100 acres as an investment property. Prior to this, the property had been in the same family for about 150 years. I met the previous owner who explained the land had a lot of personal significance but it wasn't financially possible to keep the acres. Since then I've built some cabins that I rent out and have sold off smaller portions of the acreage to lumber companies and other landowners.

&#x200B;

About a week ago the previous owners 21 year old daughter contacted me. Both of her parents had died in a car accident, and while he was alive her father (the previous owner) indicated he wanted his ashes spread on the property that I now own. More specifically, he wanted them spread at a specific spot, which is near one of my rental cabins. I refused since it's bad optics for the renters and I feel uncomfortable with the idea of a dead man's ashes being scattered on my land. The daughter completely went off at me telling me I was a bad person, had no sympathy for her, and called me a bunch of other names.

&#x200B;

I feel like it's my right to not allow her to spread her fathers ashes since it's MY property. I've owned it for 7+ years, it's no longer a part of her family and she's not entitled to anything. She also admitted her father didn't have a will when he died and she's going off things he said when she was a teenager.

&#x200B;

However when I told my wife about this she completely flipped out on me and said I'm TA. I also learned from a friend (it's a small community so word got around about the previous owner and his wife dying) that the daughter doesn't have any other family to help with funeral arrangements, the estate and her younger siblings.

&#x200B;

While I'm sorry for her loss, I don't feel like she has any right to access to my property and after having spoke to me with such disrespect earlier I'm not inclined to be sympathetic towards her.

edit: grammar and clarity

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me if we can compromise on another spot. She was ***insistent*** on a particular spot because it's what her dad allegedly said he wanted. Beyond the renters, I really don't feel comfortable with this mans ashes anywhere on my property

His fiancé who he hasn't told is flying home in 3 weeks to visit family for 2 months and interview for her dream job. he told her he can't go because of work. So he essentially plans to be dead by the time she gets back and she plans on having him move back home with her if she gets her dream job. He told me he can't tell her because he doesn't want her to miss an interview for her dream job because she stayed with him and have nothing when he's gone and he wants the last of their time together to be happy times. As a result he's asked me if I'd give her a letter from him when she gets back. I've told him I don't know.

487,Not the A-hole," 

A couple of weeks ago, I met a guy at a mutual friend’s bbq, and we hit it off well enough that I ended up going home with him. 

It was a really hot night - and I mean that completely aside from the sex - it was boiling in his bedroom, and he didn’t have an air conditioner so by the time the morning rolled around, I was kind of a sweaty mess.  I woke up early, and the guy (let’s call him Dave) was sleeping like a baby.  I jumped in the shower - for like 10 minutes, tops, just a quick wash to get the funk off! - and he was just waking up when I got out. We had a kind of awkward goodbye - not unexpectedly, and while I didn’t really expect to hear from him again, I didn’t think I’d done anything terribly wrong, either.   
Well, the next day, the mutual friend calls me to say she’d spoken to Dave, and he’d told her he thought it was rude and even a little bit psycho(!) that I’d showered without waking him up and asking him first. The mutual friend mostly laughed it off, but she also said she kind of saw his point - that it probably was weird for him to wake up with someone in his shower. I don’t know if she was just trying to be a good friend to both of us, or if I really broke some kind of rule here?   
A little bit of extra context - I’m a 44 year old woman who has been divorced for nearly 3 years. Dave was only the second person I’ve slept with since that divorce (I had a brief relationship last year). Dave is 26 years old, and the mutual friend is 30.  So maybe it’s a generational thing? I’m honestly flummoxed here, and I’d like to know if this is something I should be aware of in the future.

489,Not the A-hole,"I am a stay at home mom. As of this year both kids are now in full time school. I am now looking for work, but it has been difficult finding one with the limited hours I'm available. 

My husband owns his own business and works incredibly long hours, and regularly has after hours or weekend obligations as well.

My husband pays for everything. He pays all the bills. He gives me a portion each month to pay for the day to day stuff (groceries, clothes, items for the house, any gifts or special events). I have had trouble in the past making that amount last for the month. I wouldn't say with over the top spending, but I'm certainly not counting every cent. It's conservative yet comfortable - minimal money for myself or savings.

The issue is, I get made to feel like the ungrateful asshole every time I ask for something. We got new phones 2 years ago, I'm the asshole for looking at upgrades. I had to beg for an upgraded PC, I got low end. He decided he wanted one too, he spends almost triple on his. Our house is 60 years old and falling apart around us (we've lived in it 7 years) and I've been asking to renovate it. I painted it myself and we got the floors done. He wanted to spend the rest of our savings on a holiday to his families country - I argued that the cost was equal to a new bathroom and kitchen. He argued that if the kitchen works then we don't need to replace it. We couldn't agree, so nothing happened.

His business gets a great boost, and he tells us we can look into buying a new home. I was over the moon. Everyones happy for us, says it's about time and it'll be great for the family.

It didn't work out. The loans were a complicated mess and it just wasn't possible at this time.

He buys himself a luxury sports car. An insanely expensive, purely selfish purchase. Says he deserves it for sacrificing for so long. I say we're all sacrificing and it's a bit weird to be parking this beautiful car in our little rundown houses driveway. It didn't make sense. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice car, and it's increased his happiness.

I just feel my needs or wants keep getting shafted. But I also feel that I don't earn any money and should be grateful for the life he is giving us?

**Edit:** thank you everyone for all the replies, I didn't expect so many. I've stopped replying individually as many of them are getting similar, and some of them are taking small tidbits and running wild with assumptions. That's cool too, I'm always up for listening. 

A few things I wanted to clear up. My husband doesn't deserve hate or a divorce. He could certainly do with pulling his head out of his ass though. He's an otherwise good dude, and has forged a very financially stable and well provided for family. It's the luxury extras that are in question. He also discussed the sports car first, he didn't just go out and buy it. I voiced my concerns, he assured me it's well within our budget and wouldn't take away anything from the family or buying a house. While it wasn't the car that prevented us from getting a house, I feel like a bit of an idiot for actually believing his reasoning. Of course this flippin' car was going to impact finances, it's half of what we owe on our house! 

Another thing is, I see it being said that sahm is hard. It definitely was when the kids were at home full time. Now I feel my responsibilities have eased greatly. I literally have 25 kid free hours a week. I have more time for the house and errands and most of my days are low stress. I guess that's why I feel like a moocher. My husband is stressed and giving 110% effort every working day... And I seem to just be... Fuffing about, on my own schedule, at my own pace. I have the easier ""job"" overall, I feel.

Somewhere along the line over the years our dynamic shifted, and even though my job got ""easier"" my personal value and standing within the family shouldn't have decreased. He will be hearing about it. Now that I know I'm not being an asshole for wanting a say in finances, I plan to be more vocal about what WE do with the FAMILIES money. Especially when it comes to the family home. I also won't be denying him luxuries that he does indeed deserve. It all just has to be in the budget. For everyone.",172,349,0.9
490,Not the A-hole,"I always wanted one of each gender when I set out to have a kid. Our goal was to have three kids total, but I wanted at least one boy, one girl, could care less what the third would be. Our first two were boys. Then we had our third and ended up with another baby boy. Don’t get me wrong, I love all my sons. I wouldn’t trade them for the world or change them and make them girls. They’re amazing, wonderful kids and we are a happy family. I cannot stress that I love these little boys more than words can say. I also know that even if I had a girl, there’s a chance that she could identify as trans in the future (and I’d be 100% okay with that). Even so, there’s a part of me that just feels like there’s something missing. I know I’d feel the same if I had three girls and no boys.

My husband and I were talking, now that our youngest is 3.5 years old. I said I really felt like I wanted a little girl. He said that he felt the same. However, we knew that even though we’d love and accept a fourth boy, we wanted to do what we could to have a girl. I had heard of a process to select the gender of your child through IVF and we’ve been looking into it. We also haven’t ruled out adoption, either. Nothing is official. We’re still in the looking stages and saving stages as well, as both of these things would be costly, but it would be worth it.

I was telling my mother about this, as we are very close. At first I just mentioned that we were planning on having a fourth baby, either through pregnancy or adoption. She got very excited, until I mentioned that we wanted to make sure that we would have a girl. She got upset and said that she thought it was selfish. She said that my older two sons are old enough to understand why I want that and that I’m being selfish. She said that we don’t get to pick the gender of our kids and that if I want a fourth kid, I should just go through with it. I suddenly started feeling really bad about myself.

492,Asshole,"So to start with some context. My girlfriend and I are in our mid to late twenties. We've been together for 5 years, talked about the possibility of getting married and having kids but figured we would at least wait until we have both finished school. I just started my first job after college, she has a 2 years of uni ahead of her. I come from a working class background, her parents are rich.

Since I'm starting a new job and finally get a decent salary, my girlfriend and I wanted to move together. When her parents heard about our plans, they offered to buy us a house or an apartment. They got enough money, they said, and it would be better to put it to use. Her parents would own the house legally and we'd be tennants although my girlfriend would inherit the house at some point later. (To be clear, that is not some house they already own, we'd be looking for a place together and when we found something nice, they'd buy it.) 

So far so awesome. However, they want us to pay some rent. They haven't said how much, but hinted that it'll definitely be more then just the costs to offset taxes and utilities. It would probably still be way, way cheaper than renting a house like that ourselves. (To be clear, they don't need the money at all. I think it's part for tax purposes, part a principle thing.)

I'm not to sure what to make of this offer. On the one hand it seems foolish to turn down the opportunity to live in a nice house with low rent. On the other hand it seems unfair that I'm paying rent toher parents, since all the money that I'm giving them will some day be inherited by my girlfriend. For her, it would be like putting money in a savings account, for me, if I were to someday split up with my girlfriend, the money would be ""lost"".

I haven't brought this up to neither my girlfriend nor her parents since I'm not to sure if I'm being a greedy asshole or if my concerns are reasonable. (That's why I'm using a throwaway.)

Anyways, this has been going on ever since I started puberty.

My body hair has always been something I was self conscious about so I don’t like it when people point it out. I shave and/or wax everyday or every other day so that it’s not so noticeable.

My dad recently got married to my stepmom, but we moved in awhile before that. Now, I’m not gonna say I had a bad relationship with my stepsisters. Before our parents got married, we were completely fine with each other, even though our parents were basically forcing us to be friends. I once saw my stepmom talking to my stepsister, Lacy, and pointing at me. Lacy then came over to where I was sitting, sat down and started talking to me. We were both extremely uncomfortable.

Anyway, despite all that, we had a pretty good relationship until we all moved in together. Now we barely say more that “hi” to each other whenever we’re in the same room together. The fact that we share a bathroom does not make things better. I’m perfectly fine with my older stepsister, Bree, and my older brother, Kai, though.

It seems our parents have realized that things are awkward between Lacy and I. Whenever me and my dad are alone together, he gets on me about it being awkward in the house and he says that he doesn’t want to live like that, with his kids vs. my stepmom’s kids. I asked him to give us time, as we’ve only been living together since March, we’re only with them half the month, and Lacy and I are fine with our arrangement.

My dad gave me less than a week to figure it out, and after that, he said that he and my stepmom would start forcing us together. I didn’t try starting up a conversation with Lacy once, and neither did she. 

After that, my dad called me into his office and asked me to shut the door, close the blinds, and sit down. I don’t remember exactly what we spoke about, but a lot of it was him taking about how I seemed to have lost the ability to have a normal conversation with people, was rude to Bree once, and didn’t care about creating a peaceful environment. The rest was him looking at me, waiting for me to explain myself, during which he told me that we would be there all day if I didn’t speak, and me trying not to freak out. I eventually got through the talk and didn’t leave my room for the rest of the day.

I spent the next day out with friends, and the day after my brother and I went back to our mom’s. I asked her with advice, and she told me to just fake it till I make it, but I just kinda want to keep on doing what I was doing and let my dad get mad at me.

500,Not the A-hole,"I recently attended an informal family and friends get together. During this reunion I was told that a particular family member was suffering from kidney failure and because long term dialysis wasn't an option for them, if placed on a waiting list, they probably wouldn't survive. This individual's mother automatically assumed, like everyone else, that I would be a willing donor and had made me an appointment to be tested for compatibility. She was convinced that I was the most likely to be a match and excited to have me tested. However, I flatly refused and made it perfectly clear I was unwilling to help this individual.
I refused for two main reasons. First, this person is extremely toxic and had made accusation against me in retaliation for reporting them for theft. If not for the competency of the people involved these accusations could have been devastating to my life and my future.
Second, I have a medical condition and take medication that makes any type of surgical procedure extra risky for me. I've worked all my life and now I'm at a point where I can travel and do all the things I love. I'm simply unwilling to risk the time I have left to help this particular individual.
Needless to say, this has caused a huge outcry. I have been cursed, threatened and even accused of murder if this person dies. The general consensus is I should be forgiving because this person is young and deserves a second chance.

Important note, only his name was on the electric bill and he opted for budget billing, meaning the month to month bill would remain around 50 dollars every month and we would have a balance to pay at the end of the year. 

In mid March, he asked if his friend could move in to help him get back on his feet. I met his friend and agreed. I was under the assumtion he was not paying rent, and I genuinly wanted to help him, so I was ok with it.

I ran into him when he came into the restaurant I was serving at, and after some small talk he mentions that he has an apartment with his girlfriend and is ""only paying a little bit more per month"".

so I'm 19f I turned 19 last week. 

my mum messaged me a few days before my birthday, she told me that she planned a birthday dinner for me. I was pretty excited untill I learnt what the location was, its 1 and a half hours on 4 buses, there is no way I can do that. I asked mum if I could pick the restuarant and she told me she had already booked it. 

when I asked for a ride mom agreed only if I got to hers, it's an hour by 2 buses and 30 minutes if she drove so it was kinda annoying. I told her I could not bus to hers or the dinner and told her to cancel everything. 
I said that we could do something at a restaurant closer to me but mum did not agree. 


she was not pleased and told me that I needed to be at the restaurant by 6pm, I never agreed to that. 

on the day of my birthday i decided to head to a friends house and celebrate it there, fortunately she is in walking distance from my place. 

turns out that my mum came to my house to pick me up and I had no clue, when I checked my phone (an hour later) I had heaps of miss calls from her, my whole family are super unhappy that they all went to the restaurant to celebrate my birthday withought me.

My sister is a toddler, and as such has the usual temper tantrums and is a little gremlin for bedtime. My mum is nearing 50, going through menopause and perhaps not the most patient of people.


I am a first grade teacher. The way I handle kids is by using positive reinforcement and positive language to guide them away from negative behaviour. It's also the way I handle my sister.

My sister never misbehaves for me and as such I look after her the majority of the time- as soon as I get in from work and all weekend, but mum does bedtimes every night. If sister doesn't want to go to bed she will have a tantrum, and mum's response is to shout while standing at full height (only about 5'5 so not too tall, but tall to a kid) in an attempt to intimidate sister into doing as she's told, whereas when I do bedtime I just say it's bedtime now, take her hand, put her in the bed with her bunny and tuck her back in.

515,Not the A-hole,"So to preface my parents are divorced and I (22f) have always been close to my dad and my sister (17f) has always been close to my mom. About half a year ago there was a huge fallout between my sister, dad, dad’s gf, and myself. My dad’s gf ended up saying she wasn’t allowed back over to their house until she apologized. 

Since then my dad and his gf got into many arguments about letting her over, which eventually led to her kicking my dad and I out of the house making us rent an apartment for a few months until she deems is ready to move back in. I just graduated college so I didn’t have a stash of money laying around to just get a place by myself otherwise I would’ve. 

The issue starts when the other day I start taking to my sister again after many months and decide I wanted to have a relationship with her again and I missed her.  I’m planning on meeting her this Friday for dinner. My dad was glad that I was going to dinner with her, but his gf was very upset by this and kept advising me to cut contact with her. I was pretty upset and told her that I miss her and I’m going to meet her for dinner, and I asked her very nicely to please stop trying to get me to cancel. My dad invites me to go over to dinner the following night, and I am greeted by a “why is she here?...” by his gf’s crumb snatching shit head 12 year old, so I’m already pretty upset. The next thing I’m greeted with is his gf bombarding me telling me that I should cancel on my sister and why it’s a bad idea, so I turn around and walk out the door. 

I’m now being told that I need to apologize for walking out like that, and need to be more reasonable with his gf and her daughter (whom I find generally annoying and cannot stand).

516,Not the A-hole,"I, 21 M, am attending college in the US and I travel back home for most school breaks. I currently live with my mom and dad as well as my two older sisters. My 26 year old sister is currently dependent on both my parents due to a smorgasbord of mental and physical ailments including Cushing’s Disease. She had brain surgery 5 years ago and since then, everything has gone downhill. She goes to the hospital at least 6 times a year. If I had to guess, she has had over 30 surgeries regarding her health issues. This has caused a lot of stress in our family but we don’t mind taking care of her, the main issue is how she treats us, her family.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My sister has gotten almost everything she has asked for since her brain surgery which has become an issue. Because of her mental illness she acts like a child and goes into a fit when someone within our family says no to her. My mom receives the brunt of this hysteria as she is her caretaker. She treats my mom terribly and always tells her what to do and if she refuses she flips out and guilts her into doing as she asks, saying things such as, “I can’t drive, you’re really going to do this to your daughter who is mentally and physically sick, you’re a fucked up mother.” She even has gotten out of the car at a stoplight in busy traffic several times during her fits. This goes on to the point where my mom has gone off crying. The most frustrating part about this entire situation is that my sister says she can do things when she wants to and that she doesn’t need my mom’s help but when she does need my mom’s help she verbally assaults her when she doesn’t help her immediately.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The straw that broke the camel’s back for me happened earlier today. My sister demanded that our mom pick something up for her and our mom said that they can pick it up later today or sometime tomorrow. She started putting away some laundry and my sister storms into my mom’s room screaming that they need to leave right now, calling her a “terrible mother and a fucked up individual” and that my mom is acting childish and that this is some power move. I walk in and ask her to leave our mom alone and she continues to berate her. My mom at this point is on the verge of tears and I decide to try and move my sister out of the room. Admittedly, I was very angry and started to pull her out of the room which she considered “man-handling.” We began yelling at each other, I kept telling her that she can’t live here if she is going to be so abusive to our mom and she keeps calling me an asshole and a terrible brother.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mother has given up so much time taking care of someone who seems so ungrateful for her time and effort. This has caused me so much mental turmoil and I have several mental breakdowns. I’ve reached out for help several times, but I don’t know what to do anymore. I have been thinking about leaving my family and not looking back. WIBTA for leaving?

517,No A-holes here,"I’ve been married for 6 years now, and I have known my wonderful stepdaughter for 10. I have a 3 y/o little boy who is a rambunctious little booger. 

I have always been in therapy ever since I was maybe 12, because I have intense behaviors that are repetitious and I become upset if I can’t do them. For example, constant hand washing, a ritual of lysoling my outside clothes down when I enter my home, etc. 

One of those behaviors is the need to maintain control over my own food and drink. It has taken me a LONG time to be able to eat outside, and trust other people to prepare and handle my food and drink.

When I found out I was pregnant I was elated but terrified. I doubled my therapy visits and my therapist is very good and coached me through managing some of my more destructive behaviors for my son. For example, skin2skin was very difficult for me, letting him crawl all over me, etc. It has become easier over time and the newest thing is that whatever mom is having, my kid wants. He has no qualms about eating from my plate, taking food out my mouth, ‘sharing’ his spitty backwashed drink cup with me and getting inordinately happy when I accept the gift, etc. 

I have begun to try and conquer my own fear of sharing eating utensils, and lately when I drink water he’ll beg to drink from my cup. Of course, my therapist has suggested it’s best for his development if I share, so I do. But it’s hard for me. 

My stepdaughter is in her mid to late teens now, and sometimes she’ll go ahead and take a sip of my soda or grab my fork and take a bite when we are having dinner. She’s very busy with school so she won’t often have dinner, she’ll just take a bite or 2 from mine and call it done. 

Recently I sat her down and explained that I have major issues with food control etc, and told her I pretty much had no choice but to share with my kid as he sees it as a bonding exercise in his early years. I explained I love her just the same but if she’d please take a separate fork if she wants to eat from my plate (which. I don’t mind) and grab a seperate drinking utensil altogether if she wants a drink of water.

she was very understanding and got it completely but my husband thinks it’s a little unfair and asked me why what was good for kid 2 wasn’t good for kid 1. I explained that as much as I love her, I didn’t *raise* her from this young age as I’m raising my son and so my comfort level is totally different. He thinks I’m just being biased. I straight asked him if he thought I was playing favorites and he admitted ‘NO, it’s just hard to see me be so ‘carefree’ with our kid but not SD.’

AITA?

520,Not the A-hole,"I ordered takeout from a local restaurant, and chose their bento box, but asked if I could swap the roll out because I don’t eat the one that comes with it and was only doing Japanese food because I wanted a specific roll. The waitress said this wasn’t an issue, but there would be an upcharge - totally fine. 

15 minutes later and I’m there and hand her my card.

She disappears with my card, and comes back with boxes and cash, and tells me that they can’t actually swap out the roll, and they can’t do refunds, so they were going to give me cash for the upcharge. The issue is that I never would have ordered the bento box if I couldn’t change out the roll, and this restaurant is one of the most expensive for this style in the area. 

I said no, and that I didn’t want the bento box with that roll, so she (still with my card) disappeared again. 

After another 5 or so minutes I saw her and asked if I could get my card back, because I was running out of time on my lunch break. She brought me over to the manager, who yelled at me about refunding/returning the food, and that I should have taken the roll they had. I was a little disoriented and felt super awkward, so I just apologized, took the cash refund (they said they can’t refund to cards) and left. 

So my question is, given that they did refund me, is it still reasonable to leave a two star review for them charging me, trying to make me take food I didn’t order, yelling at me, and wasting half of my lunch break?

521,Not the A-hole,"I \[28M\] started dating my first girlfriend when we were both 21. Before we met, she adopted a cat who was a little over a year old at this point. We didn't date for a terribly long time (less than a year), but it was serious and both of our first 'real' relationships. Her lease ended midway through our relationship and both her and the cat moved in with me for several months before she chose to travel abroad for a season, leaving the cat with me in the interim. At the time, I didn't really have strong feelings about this cat, one way or the other. Our relationship ended but she stayed with me for a few weeks when she returned home, and she soon moved to another city but we stayed on good terms. When she moved, she left the cat with me as she figured out how to get on her feet in a new city, with the understanding that she'd return to pick her up, but neither of us really discussed a time frame or some sort of payment (I never had any problem paying for the cat's food, care, etc.). However, all the while, I'm growing more and more attached to this cat, and the cat is growing fond of me (she's not well socialized).

&#x200B;

Well, about six months after my relationship with my ex ended, I got involved with my current girlfriend. My ex ends up cutting off contact with me, but she still knows I have the cat, and I keep her updated on any issues that arise (which are few and far between). Over a year later, my ex is on better terms with me and tells me she's coming to town and wants to know if she can pick up ""her things,"" which includes the cat. At this point, it's been two years since we dated, and the cat's lived with me longer than she lived with my ex. I've cared for her, and my current girlfriend loves her, too. So I flat-out tell her no - after two years, I've formed a serious, borderline-therapeutic bond with this cat and reclaiming her isn't fair to me, my girlfriend, or the cat, who's lived almost her entire life with me and might not fair well being totally uprooted at random (she could be considered anxious). She's welcome to see the cat if she's in town, but if she was serious about taking care of this animal, she would have moved with her or made real plans to pick her up before 24 months had passed. As expected, she was pissed, but didn't push the issue beyond cutting off contact with me (again).

&#x200B;

My ex and I are on good terms again and I consider her a friend, but she still brings the issue up and frames it as ""I stole her cat,"" which I don't think is particularly accurate. I'm comfortable with my decision, but I'd still love to know: AITA for keeping the cat?

TL;DR - my ex moved in with her cat and left the cat with me after moving to another city, claiming ""she'll come back for her,"" and waited a full two years to make any effort to reclaim the cat.

So I'm the only person in my friend group who has a car. We all live together and go to the same university. I always ask my friends if they want to go to the supermarket with me, or to grab lunch or go to the university with me, and I drive us without asking anything in return.

If we go out to party, I have to drive us. So I always have to stay sober (or moderately sober) and I risk the chance of getting pulled over. This bothers me, but so be it.

Last semester my parents stopped paying for my gas and I had to start using my own money. I continued to let my friends drive with me for free, because I'm going to the same place anyway so it wouldn't cost me more, even though it would be nice if they sometimes offered to pay for gas since they get lifts for free like every day, but that's still fine.

Fast forward to today. We decided ahead of time to go for burgers tonight. After we all got back from class, I was supposed to take the 4 of us to the restaurant. My one friend wasn't home when we were supposed to leave. I messaged him and asked if he was still going with us, and he said that he was at another friend's house. He told me to come pick him up. This house was completely in the other direction than the restaurant, and far as well. Gas prices just went up, and I just started paying for my own gas. So I said that I really couldn't afford to come pick him up, and that he should ask the guy whose house he was at to drop him off and that we'll wait. The guy refused.

He (my friend) says I'm very selfish and childish for not wanting to pick him up. He still didn't offer to pay for the gas it would take to pick him up. We got in a huge argument and eventually I just went and picked him up since the other guys wanted to go eat already. He didn't pay any gas money, or buy me a drink or anything. So I graduated from letting my friends tag along on rides to the same place I'm going, to literally just driving them around. 

This friend also asked me to take him to the hospital to see his mom one night at 10pm, this is obviously different and I was happy to take him. It's just that I would personally buy someone a chocolate or drink to say thanks for that, but this guy didn't even say thank you with words. 

I feel like if I'm the one to always drive, the other people should maybe just offer to once in a while pay for gas or buy me a drink or something. It gets really expensive.

530,Asshole,"I moved to brooklyn very recently with my girlfriend. We are from New Hampshire and we kind of wanted a more urban environment to live in. Its still a great place but we are kind of far removed from the parts we wanted to move to (williamsburg, park slope etc) which is frustrating.

Anyways, last saturday, we started hearing noises from outside, like music playing and groups of people talking. I look outside and I see smoke and large amounts of people gathered around and music playing. Then around 6-7pm, it went from 20 people to like 50 people on the block, music got louder, and they had 3 grills out. I also saw them drinking a lot in public. Me and my girlfriend are vegan and the BBQ smoke was very annoying. We like having fresh air flow through the house and now we had to close the windows because of the smoke. The music was so loud I could hear it through the window even while it was closed. I felt frustrated, like I was being subject to all this stuff that I did not sign up for when I moved here. I decided to ask someone what was going on and they told me they were having a block party, which apparently happens often, and I asked if they could keep it down, and they kind of guffawed at me and acted like I had zero opinion on this because I just moved here. They said they would start keeping it down typically around 10-11pm. I was upset. For one, this was not legal, they cant just grill in the street, even if its on the sidewalks. There were kids playing soccer on the street too which I am pretty sure isnt legal, and VERY CLEARLY there were people drinking in public, which I know isn't legal. The people I was talking to then pointed at another group of people, like a group of people in their 20s, at the block party, and jokingly said ""look! they're having fun, they moved here just like you! Why cant you have fun? What? You have a problem with all of this"". I noticed that the people he pointed to were white, so he thought I was only complaining because I was white? I mean come on.



By 10pm, nothing had died down, and at this point I even smelled weed smoke when I went to the front porch briefly. This was absurd to have on a public block like that. People drinking and cooking food and smoking pot on the streets and playing loud music. My girlfriend mentioned that we should just call the police, and I was hesitant because I didnt want them to get arrested, but eventually I just gave in. The cops came and told them all to pack it up and go home. They were very upset, I could hear about a dozen people say ""THIS IS RIDICULOUS"" loudly. You know whats ridiculous? Having a damn party in the street!



When I told my brother about this, him and his wife said we were completely out of line to do that. Easy to say from their nice suburban neighborhood. Am I the asshole for calling the cops?",1103,878,0.76
531,No A-holes here,"So I work at a place with quite a lot of people. At lunchtime the whole room is basically packed. It's generally a close knit type thing, and most people seem to be friends with each other. Me not so much. I don't sit with the others, i don't talk to them outside of working together, and I'm definitely NOT friends.

Basically, there's too much of a divide between me and the others. There's a clear demographic at my workplace, mid-20's to 40's, sociable and non-neurotypical. Then there's me, as standard as they come, young and with an active social life outside of work.

Basically, the people at this workplace are close-knit enough to go on work holidays together, I only work with others when necessary. I'm there to work, not to have fun. But apparently some people have complained to the boss that i don't sit with them and whatnot.

To clarify, I'm never rude to anyone, I make small talk if they initiate, but the bottom line is that I work there, I don't care about anything else there, I wanna work, make my money and go home. AITA for not wanting to be buddy-buddy with my workmates?",157,100,0.88
532,Not the A-hole,"EDIT I'm 19. 

Firstly, I'm not ungrateful for what I get for my birthday, and them giving me the difference wouldn't change how I feel about the situation. 

My little brother (10) got a PS4 last year + games + other presents and a party last year. So were talking about £300. 

My sister (17) got 20+ driving lessons last year for her birthday plus some other bits and bobs and they aren't cheap. That's at least £23 a lesson... So say minimum £450. 

My Birthday was next and I didn't get a party, I went out with a few friends to town. I never ask for much and to me £70 just felt like a bit of let disappointment, if we did something as a family on my Birthday I would't of felt so slighted but on the weekend of my birthday, they went away when the Saturday night whilst my friends came round to celebrate it with - then go out. 

I didn't really think too much into it thinking maybe money was a bit tight round the house, even though they bring in over £100,000 between them a year. Plus my Step-Dad was given a lump some £20,000 earlier to not leave his current job. I just sucked it up and moved on.

But recently it was my mums best friends birthday, they did an escape room, meal out and a night in Manchester together. She told me it cost her £125 just for the meal and escape room. This kinda upset me and got me recently thinking about things.

I live in a pretty bustlin' city called Toronto. Population is around 5 million including the greater area of of Toronto. I about 45 mins from the downtown part of my city so it's busy but not crazy busy. 

&#x200B;

The street I live on always has cars going up and down, its pretty busy but not enough that you would not feel safe about riding your bike on the road alongside cars. However I've noticed since moving into this area there are a large amount of people riding their bikes on the sidewalk and not just slowly but some are still going quick enough to knock you down that it would hurt. 

&#x200B;

I get that small children shouldn't be on the road with cars, I'm not opposed to them being on the sidewalk. My issue is with grown adults that are using the sidewalk as a traffic free bike lane. It took about three times that I was almost hit on the sidewalk by a bicycle until I started saying something to people. Stuff like ""Get on the road"" or ""Watch it asshole"" nothing too crazy I think.

Cut to a few days ago this guy is riding his bike on the sidewalk at a decently fast speed with one of the kid carriage things in the back and it runs over my dogs tail.

This happened yesterday and I will try to be brief with the story. We went to dinner with another couple at this nice Japanese restaurant. I let my bf, let's call him Jim, go through to his seat and then sat down myself. I was hanging my purse on the chair and making sure I had my phone/wallet when suddenly I was pushed into the center of the restaurant walkway. 
When I turned to see what happened, Jim was looking at me and taking his seat. I glanced at my friends across the table and they seemed a little surprised that he pushed my chair. 
When I asked him why he did that he said that he was struggling to get in his chair and that I should've made room for him. I told him that I was preoccupied with my purse and that I didnt see him struggling to sit down. I also told him that he could've used his words and asked me to scoot over, but he says i should've looked over to make sure he was seated before i even sat or looked at my stuff.

537,Not the A-hole,"I guess the first thing I should clear up about this is that I genuinely despise my in-laws. They abused my wife well into her adult years, and they've continued to be manipulative even years later. 

My side of the family shares a Netflix account, and nobody minds my wife using it because we just share it under my little profile thing. While visiting my sister-in-law, we logged onto our netflix account on her XBOX one, and we forgot to log off. Fast forward two months or so, we find out that my sister-in-law is still using it. I don't have too much of a problem with that, I can tolerate it just being her. Then, the in-laws find out that I'm okay with her using it, so they assume its completely fine for them to use it as well. I wouldn't necessarily have much of a problem with this if they had asked me for it, because I can tell them no. My wife, however, suffers from trauma from their abuse, and has a near impossible time telling them no. I'm 100% sure that they are aware of this fact. So, rather than going to me for the password, they go to her, and she gives it to them. She doesn't tell me this, which I don't hold against her in the slightest; she was afraid I'd be angry with her for it and wanted to find a way to tell me that she thinks wouldn't make me angry. Again, this is more trauma from her past abuse, as her father has had horrible anger issues and has lashed out for the most minute of issues.

At some point, she forgets about the fact that she had given them the log in stuff, and it isn't until a few weeks later when I ask about all of the weird things in the recently watched sections that are not to her taste that she remembers.

She has asked them to get off of the account, and they agreed to. Only problem is, there is still somebody regularly using it despite them agreeing to get off of it. They can't afford their own netflix account, but I'm passed the point of caring.

539,Asshole,"My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. 

I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

540,Not the A-hole,"So, my in-laws have had an insurance policy for over 30 years. They started it for their kids when they were little - to cover any accidents at school or during trips etc. Their kids are all now adults in their late 30’s and early 40’s.

At the end of last year one of their grandchildren (my eldest) broke a bone and spent a few days in hospital. 

My mother-in-law, soon after discharge, encouraged us to make a claim, which we did, repeating a few times that we might as well, as they never have and they’ve just been paying all this time. 

Today, the decision on the claim came back with a very meagre sum, but money nonetheless. 
My mother-in-law, after having many conversations with us encouraging us to chase the claim, responded (via text message) that she’d like half.

Now - she’s not struggling for money, is retired, lives fairly comfortably, always seems to be making purchases for herself with no issues, whilst we penny pinch and just about manage to get by (and we live frugally). 

I was quite annoyed by her suggestion. I spoke to my partner and carefully expressed this, but my partner sort of shrugged and said if that’s what mother-in-law has decided then it’s not our place to question it. (My partner’s not one to rock the boat, something I find often frustrating, and other times admirable). 

However - This made me even more annoyed, and I don’t feel like I can just let it go - the child who broke their bone is going to a new school after the summer holidays, and that pay-out will essentially cover their new uniform costs, whilst mother-in-law will probably just spend the money on DVD’s, books, and some quilting supplies. 

Am I the asshole for being pissed off about this? The way my partner reacted makes me feel like I’ve got my head all skewed over it, and maybe you guys can set me straight?

545,Not the A-hole,"I (22F) started a second job this month at an ice cream shop. The business is new and privately owned. My sister has been working there, and when someone quit and they needed some shifts covered desperately; I was hired. 

The owner (27F) has been very critical of my work since I have gotten there. She has OCD, and every time she comes into the store she’s super anxious about everything and tends to take it out on whoever is working that day. Mind you, I am not a perfect worker. I have made some mistakes for sure, but I have also worked much more complicated jobs in retail. This store is mostly empty and there’s not a ton to do for 6 hours, but I’m always on my feet doing something. 

Last week I was opening the store with her. We have an opening list, and as I was following the list she would stop me and say “NO don’t do that do this first “ etc basically micromanaging everything I was doing, which were very simple tasks. And it went on for the whole time, making my work go slowly. But then she would be upset I couldn’t do the work faster. She started speaking to me in a very condescending tone, talking crap in the other room about me, and then swore at me and told me I was annoying. She apologized later that day, and while I made a note of it in my head, I told her I understood she was going through a lot. 

So last night, long story short; A customer asked if I could mix two flavors for him. I didn’t know that we could do that. I said I could, but I’m not sure it would be good. I do understand that wasn’t a great thing to say to a customer. I didn’t mean it the way that it came out, but it definitely was my bad.

After all the customers leave she came into the store and started ripping me a new one. “How could I say that!? Why would I say that !? This job is so easy, a monkey could do it. Why aren’t you getting it? Your sister can do this job and she’s younger.” (And some other awful things that I can’t remember). Lastly, she accuses me of flirting with that same customer who was definitely 15 years old. Gross. I apologized for what I had said to the customer and said, “maybe it’s best if I don’t work here anymore. You make me feel on edge, and maybe we just don’t work well together”. She spirals into “I don’t even work with you. I’m a nice boss”. 
She comes back into the store later and says “I want you to work here, but I want you to be better”. 

I just nodded and went back to my work, because I was not sure of what to say. 

I think I definitely need to quit, but I have one more shift this week. Not sure if I should text her that it’s not working out, or go in there. I’m afraid that she’ll make a scene, so I’m thinking of texting.

546,Everyone Sucks,"i met my “step sister” (S) when she was 11 and i was 15. we hit it off at first but over time she became insane.

S is not related to my step father or me at all, but he married her mother when she was around 3. he raised her and she always thought of him as her second dad. he and her mother got a divorce because her mother is crazy (schizophrenic) and did drugs + other things.

we would see each other once in a while and she would stay with us for the weekend. she would make everything about her when she was over and one time told my best friends little sister she was fat and ugly. (she was 15 at the time and the girl was 10) when i moved out she stole a bunch of my good makeup and jewelry that i had left behind. 

about a year ago she was claiming her bio dad was being inappropriate with her. she would tell all of us this and we later found out it was because her mother would let her do drugs / party etc and her dad made her do chores and punished her. 

well then, her biological dad OD’ed on heroin. and all of a sudden she was ‘oh woe is me my dad died look at me i lost my dad’ and she’s still doing that TO THIS DAY. i get it, she lost her father and i won’t understand, but she’s constantly bringing it up. she won’t even speak to me or my stepfather. and when she tries to talk to him she messages him on facebook when we’ve told her that he doesn’t respond on there and to text / call him. and she WONT. and then she will post shitty things on facebook about him. it hurts my stepdad so badly because he Raised this girl. he loved her as his own and she only uses him when she needs him.

she will message me if it’s about ‘drama’ with her friends to get me on her side when she’s in the wrong. & i agree with her to not cause a fight. she’s told us time and time again she would come visit since i’ve moved back (february and it’s now july). 

she bad mouths my sisters and my mom. she makes everything about her. constantly wanting attention or pity and i’m honestly tired of it. i completely ghosted her and don’t respond to her messages and she’s flipped her shit on me for it and had her mom go off on me too.

am i wrong for this?

edit to add : she’s done a lot more things than just this. and ALL she did while her bio dad was alive was talk about how much she hated him etc. yes i get it, her dad died, but jesus christ you do not need to bring it up in EVERY single conversation.

also yes her mother is crazy. she’s upset because my step dad found someone who cares about him and not to mention stole 30,000$ from my stepdad and makes rude ass comments about him all the time. and tried to send him explicit pictures of herself.

548,Not the A-hole,"Context: I'm autistic (without additional intellectual disabilities, so basically what used to be called Asperger's), and I'm trying to work out if I'm being a dick or not. 

I recently realised I'm a lesbian and I'm not properly out for lots of painful reasons that I don't want to go into. My best friend knows, and he said we could go together for my first Pride. I was very anxious about it, because of my sensory issues and also because I'm not out. However, he knows a lot about the autism and the difficulties I have in crowds so it was something I felt I could handle so long as we could get a few breathers (which I did express beforehand and he said he was cool with). We're both introverts so it wasn't like either of us were there to party, it was more just the parade we wanted to go to.

A few days before my friend invited his friend (who I don't really know but fine), then the night before told me his housemate (who I also barely know) was coming and retrospectively asked if it was ok. I said yes, because a) he had already asked her, so what else could I say? and b) I didn't want to be a dick and figured I needed to try get to know his friends.

I had a difficult time getting in by public transport, I usually drive everywhere because of the autism but it wasn't going to be possible to park given the day. He didn't tell me where to meet him so I had to text his friend to find out where I was going, so I was a bit stressed when I arrived. After his housemate arrived too, he completely ignored me and left me trailing behind him and his housemate for the whole of the parade, to try and manage the sensory difficulties I was experiencing, the ambivalence I was feeling about being there as a closeted gay person, and also talk to his other friend who a) didn't know I'm autistic and b) doesn't really know me. 

My anxiety reached a high point at the end of the parade when they wanted to go for food but everywhere was heaving. I couldn't cope with the noise and people anymore and was on the verge of meltdown but was also trying not to start flapping and twisting up as I was in public. I tried to tell him (with his friend and housemate looking at me like I was completely nuts) but he didn't seem to get it, and was more interested in getting him and his housemate some food. I said I wanted to go home but the station was miles from where we were at this point. So they left me alone to get some food saying they'd meet me later. 

I ended up catching an Uber trying to hold it together until I got home. When I did, I lay underneath my bed in the dark for about 4 hours and didn't speak out loud for about 2 days.

As my learners license is now valid my parents have set me up an insurance policy so that I can drive it with them sat next to me for extra practice. 

My mum suggested that my boyfriend (17M - same birthday) gets insured on my car as another learner driver. He doesn’t have a car of his own yet and his license hasn’t even arrived yet because he’s foreign so a lot more goes into getting his and frankly because he wasn’t organised enough to do it in advance but he’ll get them eventually. 

My mum asked me if I would be comfortable with this - I answered that no; I wouldn’t. I know my boyfriend well enough to know when dealing with cars and driving he is overconfident and not exactly responsible. I know he’d be fully covered but I just don’t like the idea of him damaging my first car which I’m expecting to keep well after I’ve graduated uni even if if it would get repaired. We were talking again today when he was sat next to me and I once again stated to my mum when she brought it up that I wasn’t comfortable with that happening.

She immediately took his side (a thing she does a lot lately even though she agrees with me when we talk privately) and told me I was selfish and spoiled. Telling me it wouldn’t matter.

All he did was give excuses and said that wasn’t evidence of him behind overconfident.

After about 20 minutes of playing, a guy and his wife approach and ask us to stop as they are trying to relax.

My boyfriend and I go to the same school, but he's not from the U.S. so he often will go back to his home for summer breaks. I decided I wanted to go visit him over the summer, since I had never travelled to his country and frankly I didn't want to go three months without seeing him. 

When I started booking my tickets at the end of May, I realized my passport had expired and I needed to renew it. This wasn't an issue at all, it just meant that I would have to wait 5-7 weeks to receive it. Seeing as though I wouldn't have had a valid passport until the end of July, I booked my tickets later than I had planned just to be safe (plus, my birthday is at the beginning of August so I decided I wanted to be with him for that). 

Anyway, my boyfriend then told his best friend that I was planning to go visit him, as well as the dates of my trip. His best friend, who is a girl, got really upset and started saying that I booked my trip intentionally on the same dates as when she was planning to go so that she wouldn't be able to stay at his house. I had never spoken to her about traveling to this place, let alone did I know the exact dates of her trip. 

I decided to text her (since I considered her one of my good friends) and explained the situation with my passport being expired. I apologized for overlapping my dates with hers too, taking ALL of the blame and suggesting that we talked about directly rather than through my boyfriend. 

Her response: ""Ive been planning to go for a long time since my best friend lives there and i'm going at the beginning of August. I'm not dumb and I know that you don't want me to stay with [my boyfriend]. My trip had nothing to do with you yet you conveniently booked a trip during the time I wanted to go. I don't have a problem but it seems like you do."" 

I explained how I didn't have a problem with her staying at my boyfriends house, I just had to book my trip later because of the passport ordeal. Then I apologized if it seemed like I was intentionally ruining her trip. 

Her final response was something super snarky like ""You didn't ruin my trip, enjoy yourself"" or some shit. 

When she sent that I broke down because I felt so bad. My boyfriend was with me at this time and offered no support nor did he say anything about her acting unreasonable. Our mutual friends also stayed out of it for the most part, besides making up excuses for why this girl was so mad at me. 

After this, the girl started shit talking me to my boyfriend and all of my friends saying that I'm stupid, manipulative, bitchy, whatever. 

Not really sure how to end a post, but Reddit AITA here?

tl;dr Booked a trip to see my boyfriend later on in the summer than I had wanted since my passport expired and it takes a bit to receive the new one. Turned out I was overlapping a week with his best friend who is also traveling there, who then accused me of intentionally doing it so that she wouldn't get to stay/spend time with him. 

Edit: Thought I would give some more background since I'm not sure I was very clear originally.
> We all go to school together, and I was friends with her BEFORE I started my relationship.  
> My boyfriend didn't stand up for me because he was confused as to what the conflict even was in the first place, and also didn't want either of us to get more angry. 
> I have LONG been speculating that she has/had romantic feelings for him but never said anything, and again my boyfriend is too oblivious to realize that and never believed me. But she's always demanded from him the same level of attention he gives me.",128,241,0.92

554,Asshole,"Early last month, my 12 year-old son Jason found a malnourished corgi hybrid puppy when walking home from the park. It had no collar on or anything and it admittedly looked in pretty bad shape. Jason brought it home, fed him, gave him a bath, and basically nursed him back to health. When he originally brought it home, I told him under no circumstances would we have a dog live in this house. Partly because we can’t really afford one, but mostly because I hate dogs. 

Well he begged me to let us keep it and put up lost-dog signs until I finally relented. I told him he has until the end of the month to get rid of it,

Well July 1st came and he promised he was working out something with someone from his school. He said it’d be gone by that weekend. On July 6th, I had a weeklong business trip, and I told him I don’t want that dog in my house when I came back. Come the 14th when I return and the damn dog was still here. I told him he had until the end of the day, and I’m not asking him again.

Well Monday and Tuesday and it was still here, so this morning, I took it to the nearest animal shelter. Jason found out about an hour ago, and he’s been non-stop **bawling** ever since. My wife’s trying to say I should’ve resolved it differently, but I gave him over a month and a half to get rid of it. Trying to see if I’m in the wrong here, or if I was justified.

EDIT: I let him keep the dog for a month SOLELY so he can find the original owners. I also made him put up lost dog signs around the neighborhood. What was I supposed to do, kick the stray out immediately when he got it?

Also, I DID take it to a no-kill shelter.

Edit 2: Alright, I’ll take him to the shelter later today so he can say goodbye. I considered adopting it so I can rehome it myself but I’m pretty sure it costs money, and seems kinda pointless when we’d give it away anyways.

As to why I took it to a shelter? Because it’s a puppy corgi hybrid! It’s obviously going to get adopted. I didn’t think it was such a big difference between taking it to the shelter and trying to rehome it myself.

EDIT: Mods banned me for saying ""fuck off"" to someone who called me an idiot and a shitty parent, so if I don't reply, you know why. [Because the mods want to say what I said was untrue, I very well could have violated other rules, but this is the comment they said I was banned for](https://imgur.com/a/gBPFTLV) (the person's reply is now deleted, but it said ""are you an idiot or a shitty parent; I think both""). Edited to post the full exchange for transparency; I'm not denying I didn't break another rule or whatever, but at least that wasn't the reason given in my ban message. Mods muted after my last response

Anyways last edit, just got home from the shelter. Jason was distraught at first all day, but i talked to him about *why* we couldn't have it, and agreed to take him to the shelter every week or so until it's adopted. He knew it was coming since the first day he brought it home; he was just a little shocked when it actually happened.

555,Not the A-hole,"This has been bothering me for awhile so I hoped to get some insight from reddit. Obligatory mobile warnings do throwaway.

Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long.

Last month was my mother’s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant.

That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words ‘hey do you remember when we tortured you-?’ In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he’d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely.

I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist.

AITA for reacting that way to my father?

556,No A-holes here,"I’m 19F and live with my parents while I work and go to university. I’m currently taking summer classes so I couldn’t go away on vacation like most people. Just because I couldn’t go away doesn’t mean I expected my parents to stay home, so when they said a few months ago they were planning something for July I told them to go for it and don’t worry about poor me. 

It turns out what they were planning has been my dream vacation since I was 15. They knew this (in fact I was the one who brought this place to their attention) and still chose to go. I was a bit hurt but I know it’s not really any of my business so I didn’t say anything. They just got back from the trip and went on about how amazing a time they had. They asked if I wanted to see pictures and I said no because honestly it was my dream vacation they just want on and I’m a little sad because I don’t know when or if I’ll ever get to go but I was glad they enjoyed it. That’s all I sad. 

They immediately got defensive and said they forgot that was my dream place, they were getting old how much traveling did they have left and it’s my fault for taking summer courses and they’re not going to cater to me etc. 

I don’t feel like I did anything wrong as I didn’t throw a fit or make a whole scene about how I was upset with them. I just said I was a little sad. AITA? Should I have lied? Or are my parents overreacting?

557,Not the A-hole,"I’ll preface this by saying, I do have further issues with my brother-in-law. He’s obnoxious, rude and overall, spends way too much time with us, but my husband thinks it’s great because he grew up with so much family around. However, he does do great things for the kids, so despite him bothering me, I do try to swallow it and only intervene if he’s doing something that affects them.

My son is 11 years old. Since late this spring and now this summer, my brother-in-law has been pushing for my son to come by his house and do yardwork and other chores, including mowing, cleaning the gutters, washing the windows/his car, etc. I don’t want my son doing that. I know how particular my brother-in-law is, I know he’s not going to pay him and I just know it’ll turn into a huge nightmare. My brother-in-law always asks my son in front of me and I turn it down. My son never says “Oh, well I want to do it” and if I ask my son if he wants to do it in private, he always says no.

Recently, my brother-in-law and his wife took the kids out to eat while my husband and I went out for our anniversary. According to my daughter, brother-in-law brought up my son doing stuff at his house again. My daughter told him that I had always said no, which apparently upset him. I told my brother-in-law that he needed to stop asking my son and that if he went behind my back again, we were going to have a problem.

My husband is upset with me, because he thinks that it’s just “family helping family”. He doesn’t agree with his brother going behind our backs, but he thinks that it won’t hurt our son to help out his uncle, saying that he spent summers doing chores for his family.

558,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I are two 20-something guys. We've been dating for nearly a year. My family has known about my sexuality since high school, but BF only came out to his last year and introduced me about 4 months ago.

His parents and siblings are pretty open people and I'm under the impression they want to demonstrate how they're cool with the LGBT community and those topics, which is generally nice of them.

However I feel like they can go overboard with certain questions... Like, they've asked my BF or even the two of us together some arguably intimate things: who's top and who's bottom in our relationship, does gay sex hurt/is it messy, his relative even straight-up asked for advice on blowjobs after a family dinner. Inappropriate much?

Maybe I'm overreacting and I should appreciate that BF's family is being acceptive? The whole coming-out process was much more mentally challenging for him than it was for me for anxiety reasons, and he's happy that his family has responded so well. That's why BF doesn't react in an overtly negative way when asked uncomfortable questions... He even answers some of them, which I don't particularly like to be honest.

559,Asshole,"Made an account for this, I don't think I'm being unreasonable but perhaps I need a wider and maybe younger perspective on the situation.

My daughter is 24 and has been dating her boyfriend for around 10 months. It's her fathers 60th birthday this year and we're having a big party at our house with lots of relatives. Daughter and her boyfriend are invited and are staying as they don't live too close and want to drink. 

We were discussing sleeping arrangements and after listing off a few others the following conversation happened

me: ""you can have your room but you'll have to share with your aunt and boyfriend can sleep on the futon in the study"" 

her:""what, why can't me and boyfriend have my room and aunt sleep in the study?""

m:""I don't think you and boyfriend should be sharing a room""

h:""older sister and husband are sharing!""

m:""Older sister and husband are married, it's completely different""

h:""so you'll only take my relationship seriously if I get married? What if I never get married? Me and boyfriend aren't going to do anything at my parents house anywayso why does it matter and why is it OK for sister and husband to have sex at your house just because they have a stupid piece of paper.""

m:""I just don't like the idea of it under my roof, what you do elsewhere is up to you but at my house I think I get a say in these things, I'm sure you'll be fine without each other for 1 night""

h:""you don't take me or my relationship seriously, I'm an adult but you don't treat me like one, it doesn't matter if it's one night it's the principle behind it""

She left after this and we haven't been able to come to a conclusion, I still don't want them sharing a bed at my house and my daughter is saying she wont stay if they can't. There are no nearby hotels as well live quite a way out in the country so if they didn't stay they'd have to leave early to get home and wouldn't be able to enjoy the party as much.

Husband says he doesn't much like the idea of them sharing either but wants his daughter to be there on his birthday. I don't know what to do here, I really don't think I'm asking much for one night of them not sleeping together, but maybe I am being unreasonable?

Edit: I posted this on reply to a comment but thought I should add it to the original post as well:

I intend to call my daughter and firstly let her know that I did not intent to make her feel like I don't view her as an adult and that clearly this relationship is important to her so it should be important to me too. I'm afraid I'm rather set in my ways and although all these posts have been very enlightening my feelings aren't going to flip like a switch and change instantly. That being said, my daughter is more important to me then my own personal beliefs and if changing my attitude is what it takes to keep a strong relationship with her in certainly willing to put in the effort. To make a long story short, they can share the bed.",910,2846,0.92
560,Everyone Sucks,"Okay so I've never used reddit before so forgive me if I get anything wrong here. Just wanted to post on here bc I've seen the videos and twitter threads and that with this sub and thpught maybe y'all could give some insight. 

It's basically what the title says. I'm a vegan - definitely not one of  *those* vegans though. Like I legitimately do not care if someone eats animal products, I just choose not to, partly for ethical reasons and partly because I have various food allergies and a vegan diet is the best way to avoid anything that will nake me ill. I also don't expect to be catered to and am more than happy to bring my own food to parties and things, or eat before/after. 

Recently, my flatmate and I hosted a party. She prepared a bunch of non vegan finger food dishes for people and I did some vegan ones - spicy crispy tofu, black bean sliders and tempura veggies with a homemade sweet chili sauce if you're curious. A friend of ours brought her flatmate and he made a big show of being disgusted at all the vegan food, even taking a bite of a black bean slider and spitting it out and retching because ""all vegan food is disgusting and there isn't a single vegan dish he likes."" I was offended by this because 1. I cook for a living and take pride in my food and 2. That's nust fucking rude anyway. Note: he was incredibly hammered when he did this, but didn't apologise and still hasn't. 

Now, since he did that, I've kinda made a point of pointing out when he eats something that is vegan. Like, he has a piece of fruit? I'll say ""you know fruit is vegan right?"". He eats some oreos? I'll say ""oh but I thought you didn't like a single vegan food?"" Etc. He's begun complaining to our mutual friend that I'm being an annoying, preachy vegan. I think I'm just making a point.

561,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I are raising our children without religion. We've taught them it's a thing that exists and always answered questions about it as honestly and truthfully as possible ""They believe X...

My parents are devout Christians and love our children just as much as we do. I can count on one hand the people I trust with my kids and they're on the list. 

However, they simply don't respect the boundaries my wife and I have set, assumedly because they believe they're saving my children from the eternal damnation they couldn't save me from. I feel their hearts are in the right place,  but the last time they visited for summer (we live in a different state from my parents) they came back speaking like we'd been raising them as Christians from birth. ""God says this and that"", etc.  

The most recent conversation went like this: 

""Why don't you believe in God, daddy?""

""Because he's not real sweetie.""

""But Grandma and Grandpa say he is!""


After this one I told my parents that if they keep doing this they won't get to see the kids without my or my wife's supervison.

563,Everyone Sucks,"My wife and her cousin are the same age we both have kids that are 3 weeks apart in age. My wife is a teacher and is off for the summer so she spends her time doing activities around town with our daughter that is almost 2. Her best friend lives close to us and is also a teacher so they’re always doing things together.

Her cousin has a son that’s 3 weeks older than our daughter and while I was at work, called my wife and asked if she could watch her son. She had an emergency at work and needed to go in, their normal babysitter was sick and her husband couldn’t come home either. My wife said sure, and told her their days activities and asked if there was anything she didn’t want her son to do. She told my wife she didn’t feel comfortable with her driving her son around and asked if they could just stay home and play.

The issue I have is this: she’s doing her a favor by watching her son last minute. She had a play date set for a while with several other moms and their kids. Nothing was prepaid but events were planned. If they don’t attend, we wouldn’t be out any money. My wife has a hard time saying no to people she really cares about, so she told her she would stay home with the kids today and forgo their fun day. She called me and explained and honestly, I’m pretty upset on her behalf. She was looking forward to today and having fun with other moms and kids at the local splash pad then aquarium.

I called my wife’s cousin, admittedly behind my wife’s back and told her she needed to call my wife back and tell her she doesn’t mind if she takes her son. I explained to her that we were doing her a favor and I don’t want my daughter and wife to miss out because of her insecurities. She understood where I was coming from but basically refused to budge because she “feels the way she feels and shouldn’t have to put her child through a different routine that what she told him.”

I know from experience they have a routine based home. Same nap time every day, same bed time, snacks at the same time etc. We don’t run out r house that way because our daughter is able to tell us what she wants and when she wants it, in a toddler way, and then we decide if we feel it’s appropriate.

I called my wife after and told her I called her cousin and encouraged her to take both kids out, regardless of what her cousins wishes were. My feeling is that they shouldn’t miss out and we’re doing her the favor here. My wife isn’t happy I didn’t let her know beforehand but understood that if I told her that she wouldn’t have wanted me to call. She’s grateful I did it though, after the fact.

I’m hoping she takes me up on my suggestion to take the kids out, I won’t know for a while though.

My neighborhood is large—it has about 7 exits to the large roads surrounding it and also has two subdivisions tucked away into a much larger one. There have been a bunch of crack downs lately-which are absolutely necessary. There is a school hidden away in the back and we have an issue with speeders and unsafe driving as a whole. So, police presence is huge.

Anyways, I was driving on Road A, which does not have a stop sign. It intersects with Road B, which does. As I turned onto Road B, not stopping at the intersection, there was a cop stopped across the road. He waved for me to go past him, then turned on his lights and pulled me over. I looked at my mom and asked what I did wrong-neither of us could figure it out.

The cop came over and asked me why I ran a stop sign. I explained to him there wasn’t one there. He said there was one. I explained to him from his view, he had a stop sign on his road, but that on the road I was coming from, there wasn’t one. He said it was a four way stop, when it is not. (Side note: in 2016, I got pulled over for the exact same thing...so I guess perceptions based on where you are located is rather important.)

I told him to go and verify; that I would gladly wait outside of my vehicle. He said he would take my “word for it” and let me off with a warning (which don’t even exist but that’s another story).

566,Not the A-hole,"So my ex's sister is disabled and has bipolar and has a carer. She would buy rabbits which she cared for somewhat poorly. 

Would leave them outside in way too cold temperatures, breed them in the middle of winter resulting in many dead babies due to her leaving them outside and them literally freezing to death. Not vacinate any resulting in death from diseases. She also bred dwarf x dwarf resulting in many unviable babies that died.

So after I think 6 adult rabbits she had die of disease (plus multiple before this and she just didn't take them to the vet) mid winter last year after she didnt vacinate them and like 4 babies also dying. Her last rabbit ""escaped"" last week due to poor housing (neighbour dog digging in or it ""getting out""). 

She now wants to get another rabbit my ex told me on the phone. I lost my shit and was like ""you gotta be kidding me she killed all the other ones, no way"". Turns out she could hear me and it didn't go well.

I've threatened to call RSPCA over the matter.

Anyway now shes all upset and ""crying"" but I'm sick of her not taking responsibility, medically neglecting and outright neglecting the rabbits to their death. Ignoring actual animal husbandry advice then blaming others who actually hold her responsible for the fiasco she and she alone caused.
It dusgusts and enrages me.

(Also I didnt find out about this stuff till after the fact as they hid it from me. I only found out second hand off my ex who has a long history of lying).

Update: I ended up having a fight of sorts with my ex because he kept trying to defend the poor animal husbandry by his sister and downplay the severity. Kept trying to act like its not really her fault they (~possibly 20 rabbits) died from not being vacinated and other crap/neglect/inbreeding/poor breeding. He basically threatened me saying if i report and they come to his house or whatever that his family wouldnt talk to me again. I told him it was worth it if it stopped the animal abuse. And that i dont believe for a second that she will get a rabbit and care for it properly. Said she wouldnt desex it and i said she will just bring 1 home and breed again like last time and say it was an accident like before. So I ended up blocking him in a fit of rage because i have been put in a hard position because of them and im sick of it. Ill be reporting the animal abuse today by phone.

Whenever we on trains or in our room at night, I'll pass the borderline AITA's to her and we'll say at the same time what we think. Don't worry, I've also passed her the good ones - I wasn't about to let her miss 6ft sub guy. 

 So anyway, today we were taking the bullet train from Osaka to Tokyo. Seated in front of us was an American woman and her preteen son. As we neared Tokyo(the final stop on the train), everyone started to gather their things and head towards the exit doors, with this woman and her son leading the charge. 

My wife and I had a bunch of baggage, so we lagged behind a little bit. While gathering our things, we looked at the seats in front of us and saw a whole bunch of food trash on the floor and in their seatbacks. On the mom's seat was her phone. 

My wife grabbed it and chased them down by the doors and returned it. I said she should have just left it like they left the rest of their things and she immediately said ""you would be the asshole!"".  I disagreed and we both thought it would be fun to have Reddit adjudicate for us. So here are our cases:

My case: They did no favors for the staff of the train, so we shouldnt go out of our way to do favors for them. Also, the train wasn't going anywhere, so she'd have come back in 2 minutes to face her filth.

I've been nothing but impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency of Japanese mass transit. A good chunk of that comes from the fact that riders do their part to keep things clean and orderly. To leave all that trash anywhere, but especially while guests in a foreign country, is a huge asshole move.  The attendants also come around every 10 or 15 minutes asking for trash, so you'd have to try to accumulate this much filth.

Her argument(written by her): Its a total dick move to leave someone's expensive phone because you're feeling self-righteous about their manners. 

So Reddit, would I be the asshole?

Edit: made it more clear that my wife returned the phone and were just working in ex post facto hypotheticals.

Edit 2: thank you Reddit! It's clear that I would have been the asshole in this situation.

574,Not the A-hole,"I am a single parent. My ex wife and I separated when my daughter was only 5 because ex was dealing with her excessive drinking. So I got the full custody. I can see that the divorce has affected my daughter badly and it also has strained her relationship with her mother. Daughter is now 16 and a very quiet introvert young girl. 

Last month, I was at work when I got a phone call from my daughter's teacher. Apparently she got into a verbal fight that almost got physical with a classmate and was having a breakdown in the principle office. From what her teacher told me, this boy had verbally assaulted her and it prompted her to attack him.
When I asked her later what had happened, she got really defensive and told me to just let it go and wouldn't say anything at all. So I called one of her friends Lisa later that night and she told me this boy Jesse once made advances at my daughter, which she rejected, and it prompted him to start bullying her and (this is the most horrible thing to find out as a father) after some clever coaxing because I could sense that Lisa was hiding something, she told me that my daughter just recently broke up with  her boyfriend, with whom she was in a sexually active relationship. And this motherfvcker is also friends with that troll Jesse, so he shared all the detail of their intimate relationship with him, which they later used to humiliate my daughter. She couldn't really report these bullies to the school principle without me getting involved, which was clearly something she wanted to avoid. Not to mention the embarrassment. Okay these kids have sex. But they don't talk about it with adults. 

As a father, knowing that your teenage daughter is sexually active really is not something you would want to find out from somebody you barely know. I was beyond helpless. I did not know what to do. I can not just go to her school and talk to her teacher about this without embarrassing her even more. She's been through a lot! Maybe I was driven by anger and frustration and did not think clear, but I decided to take matters into my own hands. 

So I tracked down these two boys. First I went to her ex' house and had a long conversation with his parents, who were beyond horrified when I told them. I carefully made it very clear that I can sue and send their son to jail for this. They promised me that they would talk to him and he will be grounded. 
Then I went to see Jesse at this restaurant where he was working and I wish I could say I beat the shit out of him. But no. I warned him in my most convincing and threatening manner, that if he ever so much as goes near my daughter again, I will find him and make him pay for it. I also gave him the classic ""I have been to jail once for killing someone. Don't give me a reason to go back there!"" which genuinely scared the life outta him. 

I personally think that maybe I have gone too far indeed. But Lisa recently told me that both boys have stopped taunting her. Am I the Asshole?

UPDATE : Thanks to everyone who have DMed me  and yes I've been thinking of and considering taking her to theraphy as soon as this whole bullying thing subsides.
And about the birth control and sexual education talk, I really have no idea where and when to start. I mean it would be really awkward and embarrassing for her. Is there like any kind of professional help for this matter?",84,178,0.94
575,Not the A-hole,"So short and sweet. I chose my brother to be one of my groomsmen, and in Brazil we usually send a special invitation to all the groomsmen and bridesmaids (except when they are an actual couple, in which case the couple just receives one invite). My soon to be wife is making the formal invitations and is refusing to send one to my brother claiming it's not viable to send him a formal invitation because he lives out of the country (He lives in Barcelona, she's in Brazil). She claims that it would be too expensive and basically pointless since he'll probably just throw it away anyways.

AITA for basically wanting my brother to receive the same treatment as everybody else? I understand his case is special and yes it is quite pricey to send that invitation, so my suggestion was to make the invitation and hand it to him a day or two before the wedding. He's already aware he's one of the groomsmen.

576,Not the A-hole,"I (35M) have three sisters (31-42) and our father passed away recently. It has fallen on me to plan the service since our parents divorced a while ago and my sisters ""don't know what to do"" (their words, and yes they're grown women..). 

Our dad was a sperm donor and it has always been a touchy topic in our family. He donated solely because there was (is?) a shortage of donors in our country and he fathered 7 kids to 5 families which is the maximum number of families permitted by law.

Our dad had a relationship with two of his ""donor kids"" that had reached out as adults. One of them has reached out and obviously offered their support, but cannot attend the service. The other had become very close to our father to the point where our dad literally referred to her as his daughter etc. She didn't have a dad of her own (lesbian parents) and so bonded quite quickly when she reached out.

Anyway, cutting to the chase, his donor daughter wants to attend his funeral service and is just as broken up as we are. My sisters are all against the idea and think it would be ""creepy"", ""weird"", etc. They all expect me to tell her no because she isn't ""real family"".

But I'd feel like absolute shit saying no. She literally said she wont say a word to anyone and will just attend the service in silence. She just wants to honor dad, I don't get why my sisters are so vehemently opposed to her presence. Our dad left her some money from his estate so he obviously considered her family.

Anyway, since my sisters left it on me to plan, I told her to come and intend on making her feel welcome. I don't think a funeral is a time to exclude and alienate someone that is hurting.

577,Everyone Sucks,"I'm almost 70 years old, my daughter is in her late 20s. I had to adopt her as I have never been able to get pregnant myself. While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.

She was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.

She has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to ""fall asleep"", you have a problem. But she was ""doing well in school"" and then ""had a good job"" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.

She always wanted children. After getting married, she actually did stop with the drugs and alcohol and got pregnant three years in. She lost the baby fairly late stage (18w). I hate to say it, but that's for the best. She and her equally...not well husband held a funeral for the child, which I of course attended. 

They were devastated, and for health reasons had a full year wait to try again. The year has passed and they're having the same difficulties and more. Her husband, my son in law, is a frequent flyer in the psych ward for depression issues. She's gone back to previous drinking and now takes Xanax on a daily basis. Her old medical issues that forced her on the pill are back. 

She is in therapy that clearly doesn't work and is always in hysterics about it. I'm sorry, but objectively, this is for the best. I'd rather go to a funeral a month for the same dead child than subject a living one to a life with these two as parents, with the high chance of inheriting it themselves.

She wants to still be called a mother, which people oblige her in. I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent. I'm apparently the asshole and ""don't understand pain"". Am I really the monster here?",1235,6116,0.94
578,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Girl and I were staying in a very small hostel in a very small town and were the only two sleeping in a multi-bed room. I got strong vibes, but thought it was inappropriate to go for it since she was practically forced to sleep in the same room as me. Would I have been the asshole for going for it?

Long version: I \[26/M\] am from the US and traveling another country solo. I had a bad experience in the main city, part of which was a Brazilian girl being too clingy at the hostel I was staying at that I didn't connect with - so I went out to a secluded small town on the coast to try and get away from any sexual stuff and hear some traditional music. My first day in the town is great, I go drinking with a group of people and the room of the hostel I'm in is full. The second day everyone leaves but this German girl and I. We start talking before dinner and she takes my offer to walk to some cliffs near the town and eat dinner. We talk for a looonnnggg time, and at first we both connect and agree on how we keep hanging out with people who want to hook up when we're not into that for this trip (her some guy from the country I am from and at the time I was getting hounded by an older nurse that had her own room at the hostel we're staying at...which is still going on as I write this and honestly is making me want to leave town).

But by the walk back we're flirting super hard, like I make a surface joke about her trusting me to put something strange in her mouth (a shot she never had) and her telling me she swallows and has kissed five guys this trip, four of which are the same ethnicity as me. When we get to the bar we're playing never have I ever over drinks/shots and it's just...obvious - but when we're leaving the bar I decided, very specifically, not to take the initiative and let her walk back alone while I walk to the pier. My reasoning was that there was too much pressure in the situation because, at the end of the night, we \*have\* to end up sleeping in the same room -it wasn't a choice for her. I thought that this context and power dynamic would make me an asshole if I tried to use that situation to get laid.

When I talked this over with a guy friend he basically called me a ""nice guy"" and said that if I wanted to kiss her/initiate, and if I was getting strong signals she was into it, it's not my responsibility to worry about the power dynamic or situation from her point of view. We had separate beds, she's a grown woman, etc etc.

I was just saying it as if to say ""on her behalf, thanks"" or ""thanks for saying something nice about her"" 
I was quite surprised by their strong, slightly offended reaction and I definitely felt an element of because I'm a guy and they are 3 women and we're talking about a woman that they were quick to react. I'd also like to add that I get on very well with all of them

580,Not the A-hole,"My brother's (brother 1) wife is pregnant of their second child. For the first child, they chose my other brother (brother 2) as a godfather, so it may make sense to choose me now as we have no other siblings and they indeed asked me earlier this week. I would be glad to be a godfather of a child, but I have a gut feeling that I better turn it down. Brother 2 did so many things for them and for the first child, I truely think he couldn't do more. He visited them more than weekly, although it's a half hour drive, he bought lots of gifts for the parents and the child, he even paid a part of their extremely expensive baby shower, he plays with the child and the child loves him. Since a year, he doesn't visit them that much anymore as he has a girlfriend now. The child is almost 3 year now.

Now when my brother 1 asked me, he said that it would come with certain responsibilities, especially that I have to visit them a lot. And then he complained about brother 2 not visiting a lot anymore. I was pretty shaken about this as I can't imagine doing a better job than brother 2. Also for me it's a half our drive, but I never pass through their region, contrary to brother 2, who regularly jumped in when passing through. I feel that their expectations are too high and I am scared I will not fulfill their expectations.

Second issue: my girlfriend and brother 1's wife don't get along. I would constantly have to visit them alone. I tried to understand the problem between them and tried to convince my gf, but she refuses to restore the relationship, so it won't be fixed. (What happened between them is another story...)

However it seems very difficult to refuse this, I don't know how to explain this or how to say this. In addition I am convinced that my father, if he would find out about me having refused, would be very angry with me and that it would even possibly destroy our good relationship. He even now already hates it that we don't have any kids and is not afraid to mention it. He thinks we don't like kids because we didn't want kids 5 years ago. However we just lost one during the pregnancy, but no one in the family knew about the pregnancy as we planned on telling them only a few weeks later.

582,Not the A-hole,"For background, I am Australian but I currently live/work in Singapore. I have two houses back home, one of which I have been letting my sister and her family (3 kids) live in almost rent free (just enough to cover property expenses). They've been living there almost 10 years now without any issues.

My sister is married to a top bloke called Campbell. Great guy, works for a mining company and makes a decent living. My sister is a kindergarten teacher and doesn't make very much. This might be relevant which is the only reason I'm mentioning it.

Anyway, it recently came out that my sister has been having an affair for a while now. Campbell is obviously fucking devastated and the two of them immediately agreed to separate and eventually divorce. Now, the both assumed that being my sister, she should continue living at my house (with the kids) while Campbell rents an apartment. When I found this out I called Campbell and asked whether he was okay with this arrangement, or whether he would prefer to continue living at my house (with the kids) while my sister moves out. He obviously wanted to continue living there with the kids and only moved out because he assumed I'd side with my sister.

So I tell my sister the new arrangement and she loses her mind over this. I basically told her in no uncertain terms that going forward Campbell will continue living at my house, whether they divorce or not. 

My family thinks I'm being a manipulative asshole for:

1. Not siding with my own sister

2. Inserting myself into ""their"" problems

3. Doing this despite knowing it will help Campbell get primary custody since my sister can't afford to take care of them + pay rent

I take the opposite view: I think I am doing the morally right thing by not letting my relationship with my sister cloud my judgement. In my opinion, Campbell is the one that deserves to continue living there since my sister is the one that ruined the marriage by cheating.

583,Asshole,"I went to the gym today and was getting changed in the women's changing rooms. As I took my top off I heard a deep voice and the door open. I turned to see a young woman who was supporting a young man who clearly had autism/learning disability. 
As she came in, she quietly apologised and asked her client to go into the private changing area with her, meaning he had to walk through the changing room filled with women and into the private area. 

I knocked on the door and the girl opened up - I politely asked her if she could remove him from the females changing rooms as it wasn't appropriate. The girl told me that she had to change him here as he needed support, she explained that previously he had been using the male changing rooms but she wasn't allowed to enter them so he was having trouble getting changed and was touching the men so she had been told by hotel/gym management that she must take this man into the women's private area so he wasn't unnatended but that she couldn't access the men's due to their policies. They don't have a disabled toilet or changing area. 

I told her I sympathize with that but that it really wasn't my problem and I shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable. She responded that this client wasn't sexual and wouldnt be in contact with us. I said that I stand by my argument. The boy with her was making some noises so I told her I'd really appreciate they left and the boy started shouting so she got him out of the room - he was ready for the pool so he went into the swimming area. Due to her refusing to listen to me or cooperate I went to the hotel manager and complained. He said they had no other option that let him change in the females and I made my point again, he said he understood and would speak to them. I went to the pool and saw the manager take the girl and client aside and they were handed his and her clothes in a plastic bag and asked not to return to the changing rooms. The girl got aggitated asking if they expected them to walk home in their swimwear and the manager said he had no choice due to a complaint and that they didn't have the right facilities for him so he'd have to use the closest other pool to us which is a half hour drive. The girl shot me a dirty look and told the bot they had to leave, he began shouting and crying and she kept looking at me implying it was my fault. They eventually elft and when I told my husband, he said I was an asshole and that it was a mild inconvenience and I probably ruined his day. But I don't see why I should have to take the brunt of the issue that they don't have disabled changing rooms?

584,No A-holes here,"The MCAT is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the US. Applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

Results for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn’t have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

So when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  I asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. She had already sent out some primaries but haven’t gotten any secondary applications back.

587,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway since my friend is on Reddit.

I [F23] have friend, ""Jen"" [F24]. Jen has
 strong opinions about things, especially things she doesn't like. Sometimes she also has the attention span of a goldfish, for example, if we watch a movie, she'll watch it for the first ten minutes and if she decides she doesn't like it she'll just stops paying attention and starts doing something else. 

This is basically where the AITA is based on.

There might be some spoilers about the new movie Midsommar, I am trying to keep them as vague as possible, but consider yourself warned. 

Jenny invited me to watch a movie, and as I am currently on a VERY STRICT budget (I am saving money so I can move to a new apartment) I had no other choice than decline, and asked if we could go another time. 
Jenny said that it is fine and it will be her treat since we haven't seen each others in a while. I tried to say no again because I would feel like I'm indebted but she insisted, so I had no other choice than to cave in. 

She didn't have any movie in mind and asked me for my opinion, so I suggested Midsommar since we are both quite horror movie fans.  

When we met up I thanked her for inviting me, she bought us some popcorn to share and we were excitedly talking about the movie. 

At the theater though I could see she was not interested at all.  After the first 30 minutes of the movie she took her phone and started messaging her friends. 

There were those few scenes that made her gasp out loud when she actually did pay attention, but when she realized this is going to be quite  a ""different"" horror movie, she just commented how shitty it is and moaned. When she saw that I was into the movie she started poking my arm and asked how can I watch this shit. 

And then the whole ending (if you've seen the movie you probably know what I mean) she just laughed which pretty much echoed through the whole theater. 

When the movie ended she just shouted ""Well that was a waste of my f-ing time!"" and we left. I really enjoyed it and wanted to talk to her about it but she just kept interrupting me and telling me it was shit. When I tried to ask why it was such a shitty movie she only said ""because it was."" 

I just dropped it all but she still kept on going how shitty it was and how movies suck nowadays. I started to get annoyed and just told her that ""Maybe if you actually WATCHED it and payed more attention you probably would not think like that."" I obviously know that all movies are not for everyone but if you don't even focus on the movie it's pretty dumb to act like that. 

She  got mad at me and told that SHE bought my ticket and since I suggested HER the movie I should pay back for my ticket, especially for snapping back at her. I told her that I was invited here by her and it is not my fault she didn't like the movie. This is the part where I might be TA but I just got super annoyed and went home without saying goodbye  and kinda just left her there dumbfounded.

I’ve just returned to work since having my Bub. I’m a coeliac and obviously can only eat gluten free. I make a special lunch everyday for work. 

4 days in a row my first week back at work and my food was ‘going missing’ when I’d go to get it from the fridge. I sent out an email to all staff in the office about it. 

The next day the same thing again so I went to my boss. He sent out an email reminding people to only eat their food. 

The next day it happened again. FYI I have my name on it. I asked my boss if we could put cameras in the lunch room, he said no. I asked if he would comp my lunch expenses as I had to buy from the local cafe and shits expensive yo! He again said no. I sent out another email and spoke to as many people as I could (about 15 out of the 20 in my office). 

The next day I was feeling more positive. I left a note on my food again stating it was mine and to not touch it. Lunch time comes around again and my food is gone. I was pissed so I threw out everything that was in the fridge. 

No one technically knows it was me, as I haven’t admitted to doing it, just like the jerk off stealing my lunches hasn’t come forward. 

The boss sent out another email threatening written notice for anyone who touches anyone else’s food. My lunch hasn’t been touched since. 

My Husband told me I was an asshole because everyone in my office didn’t deserve to have their lunch ruined because of one person stealing mine.

592,Not the A-hole,"I've been seeing the same girl (SO) for about 7 months now. We are not exclusive, but I couldn't see myself with anyone other than her. Her classmate (CM) is a friend of mine from back in public school.  CM knows that me and SO are dating, but they are not close friends.

Fast Forward to last weekend. SO is visiting her family, but we keep in contact multiple times a day. I go to a dorm party with my college friend and get extremely drunk (Like 1 or 2 levels below black-out drunk). I do not know anyone at the dorm, and i lose my college friend in the crowd. ""Luckily"", I run into CM. She is trying to get attention from a guy she previously hooked up with. He is ignoring her, so she gets sad, grabs my hand and drags me away from the party. I'm really drunk and feel weird about the situation, but I still wanted to comfort her if she was feeling down. She drags me into a living room area where I then comfort her. She tries to kiss me multiple times which makes me uncomfortable. I do not verbally tell her no, but I drag my head back each time. At some point we actually kiss **mutually** but I feel horrible before, meanwhile and after. I tell her we need to talk because I wanted to tell my SO because i felt bad. CM leaves saying she doesn't wanna talk.

I sit for a long while afterwards just feeling horrible. I get a text from CM asking if we can talk which I was not expecting. I tell her I am still sitting in the living room and really want to talk. Other people from the dorm are also present in the room, so I didn't find it odd that she dragged me away if we were gonna have a personal talk. She drags me into her dorm room and we kiss again. I am feeling fuzzy and the kissing still feels bad. I ask her if we can talk but she says there is nothing to talk about. We keep kissing in her bed and I keep asking if we can talk but she just repeats the same answer.She initiates sex and it does get sexual but I tell her that I do not want to. She goes to grab condoms and I turn her down twice or thrice. She gets annoyed, leaves to make herself food and I feel really disgusting immediately. I go to my college friend's room and sleep there feeling extremely horrible about myself.

The next day I tell my SO that I've kissed CM and she gets extremely mad and hangs up. I want to tell her the rest but I can barely process it myself. I feel extremely used, because I didn't wanna be in that situation and now my SO is judging me for it.  For the last few days I've had breakdowns in public and at work and I feel so ashamed. I do not feel like I had any control in the situation and I can't really stand the thought of anyone touching me right now. I never imagined I'd feel this way since I am a guy.

Ive been as supportive as I could be because she no longer has use of her dominant hand as it heals. Responsibilities we typically share, Ive happily taken over. Cooking most meals, washing all of our dishes, washing her hair, etc.

She got her stitches out two days ago and comes home today with a little container of specialty lotion. She asks me to massage the lotion into the surgical cut on her finger. The cut is healing well but the incision is still very prominent.

The thing you should know about me is I am VERY squeamish with bodily injuries and even some normal bodily functions. I can’t watch anything with body gore and will have a physical reaction to being forced to touch something like an eyeball (for contacts). My girlfriend is the complete opposite: watches surgery videos “for fun” and seems to enjoy doing things like popping pimples on my back or pulling sea urchin spikes out of my bleeding foot.

As soon she asks me to lotion her finger, I physically cringe with the thought of touching someone’s still healing wound with my bare hands. “You want me to do what?!” I say immediately. “Massage the lotion into my cut.” “Can I use some rubber gloves?” “No way.” “Can’t you use your other hand to apply the lotion?” “That hand needs to cradle my surgery hand.” “I will happily cradle your hand as you apply the lotion.” “No. I want you to do the lotion. Stop being a wimp.” She continues to berate me and I give in, take the lotion and begin massaging it into her finger—with my eyes closed. She tells me to open them. I open them and stare at her face. She calls me a pussy for not looking at her scar as I touch it. Things devolve from there.

She argues that if I can’t even put lotion on a finger how can she expect me to take care of her if something happened to her in the future like a bad car accident or serious illness? I tell her that if for some reason something like that happened, I could get over my squeamish tendencies because she would be physically incapable of caring for herself. I tell her that she is physically capable of applying lotion to her own finger. She says Im selfish. I tell her I probably shouldn’t have had such a visceral reaction when she asked me and that I would be willing to help—gradually. She says thats not good enough. She reminds me her step-father left her mother after her mother was diagnosed with cancer and that I would probably do the same. She says I should be willing to care for her in any capacity, no questions asked; if I can’t do that, I’m wasting her time and maybe we’re not right for each other.

595,Not the A-hole,"Need some thoughts. Excuse the format I'm on mobile.

Recently I had a relative pass away unexpectedly. This was this past Saturday. I told me supervisor on Monday and told him I may have to take a day or two off for the services depending on what time they were held. Our company has a bereavement policy that allows us to take a certain amount of days off (separate from our PTO time).
   My boss tells me that I'm allowed two days per our bereavement policy and I told him the services are Thursday and Friday but I'll only take Friday off as the Thursday service is being held after I get off work. My boss has his own little policy that he ask that people bring in the Funeral service pamphlet when we return to work I guess to ""prove"" we went to the services that day and at a time where we would have to take a day off work
  I tell him I'm not comfortable doing this and that our policy handbook doesn't mention this anywhere. He proceeds to tell me that it's for him and that he just wants to be sure I'm not ""taking advantage of the policy"". I looked shocked and tell him that's rude to think I'd lie about my relative passing away and that it's ridiculous to have to bring him ""proof"". 
  I told him I'll just take a personal day so not to have to go through the process of proving my realtives death. Needless to say he approved the bereavement policy anyways but now. Worried he'll Target me for not following ""HIS"" POLICY.

596,Not the A-hole,"Username relevant: I feel like I'm probably the asshole, but my SO and some family members don't think so. I don't always figure out ""social norm"" stuff easily, so decided I would submit it to the best, or at least widest swath of, judges I know of...

&#x200B;

A few years ago I joined a comic book group hosted out of a LCS (local comic shop) in Northern California. It was a group designed to focus on women in comics and it had a catchy name that was kind of a pun. The name has ""Girls"" right in it. We focused on female creators but also sought out other marginalized creators (LGBT+, POC). We read some fluff stories and some gritty stories and some main stream stories while having pretty decent and balanced conversations.

&#x200B;

Around the middle of last year, a few gender binary people joined our group. It shifted our discussions a bit away from balanced and we started discussing more ""gender politics"" issues and focusing more and more on LGBT+ stories.

&#x200B;

At the end of last year, our comic store closed and I thought that our group would end. Thanks to everyone pulling together, someone even contacted a podcast that used to use the same name as our group to get permission to use it,  we found a new space and kept going. But it's been more and more focusing on gender, gender expression, and sometimes almost feels like a therapy session. It's been increasingly frustrating and less fun for me. There are times I feel like I can't state criticism of the comic because it would come across as anti-LGBT rather than a critique of the comic.

&#x200B;

Now, there's been one report of someone who didn't feel comfortable coming due to the name and in one of the meetings it was decided to change the name to be more inclusive by the people who were able to attend that meeting (no idea how many were there). I'm pretty against it. I LIKE our name. Someone else in the group started a twitter for us and started a blog for our reviews. It's all branded. There's a logo. Changing the name for 2 or 3 people seems like pandering to me. If we change to a more gender neutral name, how long before someone male presenting wants to attend? Previously we could state this was female focused and it was kind of understood. (Yes, I know girl groups excluding men are inherently sexist, but it was nice to talk about comics without guys there steamrolling the conversation.)

&#x200B;

I want my girl group and I'm tired of every meeting being about trans inclusion, but trans and genderqueer people are fighting for the right to be seen for who they are. A comic group that's stated goal is focusing on marginalized pops? It makes perfect sense they'd be drawn to it and want an inclusive name. But why does it have to come from MY GIRL GROUP?

Am I right? Am I the secret asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit for INFO: 

Currently, the website says Girls\* and says ""girls, gals, and non-binary pals"" in the header. I don't have any problem with transwomen and genderqueer people coming and joining in the discussions, but when I joined the group I understood it to be largely female presenting. We don't ""gender test"" anyone, but up to this point haven't had any issues with male presenting people joining because the name was intrinsically gendered.

Rule 9 - don't ask for advice, but I appreciate the posts that had some ""next steps"" like creating a mission statement, setting ground rules, gathering a consensus from other members of the group . I know that I'm treading on some delicate ground regarding inclusion and don't want to come off as a TERF. I don't know HOW to go about polling the rest of the group or getting some other idea about how they feel about the shifting focus without completely sticking my foot in it. Social cues and I ... it's like going for a handshake and getting a hug or vice versa...or a slap in the face.

There is one fairly active gender neutral person. They're very active in the trans community and actively push our group as inclusive at a trans meetup they attend. They are the person who said there was a transkid who felt they COULDN'T attend our meeting because of the name that started this 2nd attempt at a name change. There's one or two others who come sometimes who identify as genderneutral/NB. There may be other people who attend who are on the genderqueer spectrum but have never expressed any distress with the name before. 

I don't know if there is room in the town for a 3rd comic group (the second one is mixed gender)

597,Not the A-hole,"I (21F) have been friends with my ""Kate"" for 10 years. Her and I had a falling out at the end of highschool because I realized she was using me for money, an ego boost, and was constantly manipulating me. I decided enough was enough and stopped talking to her when I was 17.  

A few months ago, I visited her and her new husband in Hawaii. She seemed to do a complete 180 in her behavior. She was considerate, nice, honest and just seemed to have changed as a person. I really enjoyed my time with her and her husband, and I planned on going back to visit them as soon as possible. I mean, I had my friend back!
 
Kate's husband decided to fly her to the continental us for a big road trip to see her family and friends. Kate willingly has no job, so he had to pay for it. This comes in later. Kate's in a polyamorous relationship, which I have no problem with, as I am in one too. This also comes in later. 

Kate has feelings for a friend here in the states and wanted to fuck him while she was here. Her husband agreed for them to spend a couple nights together to be intimate, but that was supposed to only be a few days of the trip. She was supposed to then drive up to my state and stay with me for a week. We were really excited to have a whole week of girl time together and were greatly looking forward to it. 

The night before she was supposed to come over, she suddenly asks if she can bring her ""friend"" to come stay at my house for a week. I know the boundaries that her husband set because he asked me for advice, and I don't have space for two people, so I told her no. She kept pushing it and tried to guilt me like she used to. I stuck to my guns and told her no, that this was supposed to be a girls week for us to catch up and I didn't know the guy at all and didn't want him in my house. 

The next day I get a message saying ""I booked an air b&b for the week"" and I was really upset. I told her she's disrespecting myself and her husband by not following the boundaries they set, and by blowing off her friend of 10 years to fuck some dude. She became infuriated with me and threatened not to hang out with me if I was going to be upset about this. I told her to do whatever she wanted. 

Well guys, she leaves tomorrow and not one peep from her. No invites to hang out, no phone calls or texts, nothing. So at this point I'm ready to cut her out of my life again, and tell her husband that she broke the boundaries and decided to make the entire trip about being with this guy rather than being with her friends. I feel like she's being incredibly disrespectful towards both me and her husband, and I feel like he should know what she's doing behind his back. I mean, she's using her husband's money (at least $500 ) behind his back for a week of a hotel so she can play house with this new guy. 

I'm pretty fed up with her shit, and I feel like her husband deserves to know what she's doing. WIBTA if I told him what has happened?",35,56,0.95
598,Asshole,"A couple of months ago, I ran into some legal trouble, and I needed one of my incredible close friend's help to write me a letter of good character. I was still in a bit of shock from what happened, and I impulsively texted her out of the blue saying ""need you to draft a letter for me for good character. Need it by Friday thanks so much"" and she responded with ""you need to ask before you demand something of someone."" 

I immediately apologized with ""my bad I'm sorry. I still think you're the goat."" She agreed to write the letter, but kept on saying ""I'll write your letter today"" or ""I have an exam today/tomorrow but afterwards I'll write it."" She did this multiple times. She slowly stopped communicating, and the letter ended up never being written. She continued to post on all social media of her going out to bars/parties while not communicating with me whatsoever.

Eventually I reached out to one of our mutual friends to see what was going on. The mutual friend said that I never ""asked nor apologized correctly"" to the close friend. 

I ended up texting the close friend, saying ""I’m not mad but I’m pretty disappointed. I don’t mean to sound like a parent, but you really let me down with this letter. I understand that you’ve had exams, but you’ve also had two weeks notice. It takes maybe an hour out of your day to write this. If you were in my shoes and you asked me to write a letter, I would’ve dropped everything to do it. The fact that you post on your private Twitter, finsta, and private snap story and don’t provide some sort of communication to me doesn’t help. I would’ve been totally fine with you saying you couldn’t do it, but because you made a commitment I am holding you to it. Thanks again.""

600,Not the A-hole,"Not a throwaway because this is petty enough that it doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things. 

I received a phone call on my cell phone yesterday from someone claiming to be from the Social Security office: it was a recorded message saying to call them back at the number they called from because my social security number was at risk. I knew immediately that this was a scam, but since you can’t really stop these calls (they usually scramble their number, so blocking the number essentially does nothing: it was not the case this time) I decided to call back and have some fun.

I called the number and an Indian gentleman answered the phone, and requested my name and social security number. I told him my name was Mike Rotch (thanks Simpsons) and started rattling off a fake SSN, and inserted “FU” as the last two digits just to make it clear I wasn’t falling for their “brilliant” scam. The nice Indian gentleman responded with “fuck you motherfucker” and hung up. 

Now if this is where I ended things, it would clearly be a validation post: it didn’t end here. I was thinking about how these guys could be getting actual SSNs from elderly or more gullible people, and decided to keep the ruse going. Luckily for me, they called right before I left work for the day and I had a 50ish minute commute home. I am able to essentially redial the number hands free through my car, so for my entire commute home, I kept calling them back: roughly 40-50 times in total. I found out that there were about 5-7 different Indian gentlemen all near each other at an airport-like setting (could hear background noises). They became increasingly irritated, but I kept calling. From my point of view, if they were busy dealing with me, they weren’t getting other calls (I would sometimes get a recorded message saying “the person you are trying to reach is unavailable at this time”).

I stopped after my commute home, but lo and behold I get another call from them today. I decided to pick up the joke again and the first person to answer started with “did I talk to you yesterday?” but I said no and gave him a new boring name (Mark Smith). He quickly discovered it was me, and I began repeat calling again: roughy 50 times today. They threatened to freeze my bank accounts, then told me if I paid them $1,000 that they wouldn’t call me anymore: I told them I’d stop calling if they gave me $2,000. I was telling a friend about it and he said IATA because I took it too far. From my point of view, they’re attempting to scam people: if I have the time, why not disrupt their scheme a bit?

TL;DR - scammers called for my SSN, I called them back bothering them roughly 100 times in two days. AITA?

Edit: Early indication is I may not be TA. This wasn’t intended to be a validation post, I was more wondering if the excessiveness of my calling was a determining factor or not - it appears it is not a factor. Going to bed now, but will check in to see if the comments swing in the other direction overnight. Lastly, my friend is a really non confrontational guy, so his questioning of me being an a-hole had everything to do with the excessiveness of my calling. I value his opinion, and that’s why I created this post.

Edit 2: a lot of people requested the number.  The number is 1-844-xxx-xxxx. I just tried calling and got their automated message. They didn’t try calling me until after 10AM CST yesterday, and it was closer to 3:30PM CST on Monday. The best I can tell, they work an overnight shift somewhere. Note that a few people pointed out it could be a pay per call number, so proceed with caution.

Edit 3: removed the number per mod request.  Apologies for posting it.

Final Edit: didn’t remove a comment that contained the phone number, so I’m banned. That was my bad misunderstanding the original message from the mods. I still get to vote on new AITA posts, so I got that going for me, which is nice.",362,1739,0.92

This just happened an hour ago.

We are attending a bible camp at this church, not the church I go but other one.

There are kids from Prek to 6th graders, like 150 kids, and my son is 8yr.

So the video of ""this bird"" playing and building a nest was shown.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopoe)

So at the end of the video, MC asked, ""Wasn't that a pretty bird? I've never seen one. Does anyone know what this bird is called?"" Someone raised his hand, (I didn't look), MC walked over and gave the mike. The boy said ""Hoopoe"". I noticed it was my son's voice. Then the MC said ""What?? a Hippo? it looked nothing like a hippo."" Then everyone laughed. As MC walked away, I could hear him saying, ""No I said Hoop..."". I thought the lady probably didn't even know what that bird was.

My son would never ever make that kind of silly joke. So I googled ""a bird name Hoopo""(I've never even seen or heard of this bird called Hoopoe so I typed Hoopo"". Then, there it is, Hoopoe...

I personally thought joke wasn't funny at all. Kids do get offended when their knowledges are mocked or joked.

When everything was over, the pastor asked all the leaders to remain and debrief for 10mins.

Pastor said ""What a great night! any thoughts?""

I raised my hand and told both my kids to come to the front. On my phone, I had that wikipedia pic prepared.

I said ""Could you not ask a question when you don't even know the answer? \*looking at the MC who asked question and showing my phone. So this is what my son meant, Hoopoe, not hippo. If you knew the answer, you wouldn't have made the joke and made him feel embarrassed.""

The MC said ""oh...sorry, I knew what it was and just made a joke out of it.""

(I'm a dad by the way)

I said. ""you knew??""...\*brief pause\*...""Well, it wasn't funny...You are in children's ministry and you should know that.""

I told my wife about this as soon as I got home and she, (didn't tell me that I""m an ass\*\*), but definitely was an over-react, and didn't have to make that ""public"" and embarrassing the MC.

On my way home, I asked my son if the joke was funny and he said, ""uh...no. dumb.""

I teach my kids that when someone does a prank, and the person who got pranked doesn't find it anything funny but anger, it's bullying. When someone makes a joke on a person, and that person doesn't find it funny, it's harassment.",449,2573,0.97

603,Not the A-hole,"Honestly, the title is misleading but that is technically what the situation boils down too. 

For some back story, my friend is a recovering heroin addict. She’s been struggling with addiction her entire adult life. I’ve always shown my unconditional love, sometimes to the point of enabling though I work really hard to tow that line. She’s lived with my husband, son and I on and off throughout the years.

I’ve always been there when she called. I’ve given money and endless amounts of time. I’ve put in so much effort. Picking her up late nights, driving 45 plus minutes when she needed me. 

When she went off to get sober, she and her bf made the decision to leave and head across the states. It was abrupt, she didn’t tell me until the night they were leaving. I gave her the money to make the trip safely. 

When she came home the first time she passed out in our driveway and was so far gone I thought she had OD. I helped her leave home again.

If anyone has ever loved an addict maybe you understand, but when they call or text and seem erratic or upset it leaves you super uneasy, especially when they are in recovery. 

That leads us up to now. She has been sober again and made the decision to come home for good. We spent one night together and had been texting every day after that. In the middle of the week she suddenly sends me an erratic string of texts about being “SO FUCKING UPSET” and “screwed completely out of money”. I texted her back on my break and on and off days after, attempted calling and all that. We had made plans for the weekend and the weekend goes by and I still haven’t gotten a response. I reached out to her sister finally, because I was worried, and was told she is fine. 

I look on Facebook and she’s been posting, acting normal. I finally text her again and tell her basically “Wtf, I’m hurt? You could have let me know you’re okay?” And I don’t get a response for another few days, when I do she tells me I’m being bitchy and that her phone was broke. She had no way to text anyone, but we talk on FB messenger.... and she was on FB. I don’t bother hashing that out though. I just explain that I’m hurt because she could have just told me she was fine but busy, I wouldn’t have cared and I just wanted to know she was safe and okay. Instead of replying to my message she starts posting stuff about “People change up on you when you start doing stuff for yourself for once.” And the like, which really hurts because most of our relationship has been seriously one sided.

I decide my last message said enough and I block her on everything.

One of the new girls she’s been hanging out with reached out to me and told me I was a bitch, the reason addicts have trouble getting sober, and all other kind of things because I blocked her and haven’t been returning her phone calls.

So this story takes place over 2 years or so when I was 17 and 18. When I was 17, my Junior year of high school my mother had a medical procedure done and something went wrong during it. They cut her nerve and it left her unable to use her legs and she lost all feeling in her legs. It was a procedure in the lower part of her body so they really affected it. They thought it maybe would come back but it's been almost 3 years and she's still in a wheelchair. My parents are divorced and our dad has nothing to do with us.

So I am the oldest and have two younger siblings, 8 and 9 years younger then me both still in elementary school. I graduated high school this year and was supposed to head off to college.

So right after her injury, she came home and was a mess. She sat in bed and cried for all hours of the day and wouldn't leave her room. She talked about how unfair it was, etc.. and I fully agreed.. I was on the phone with doctor's a lot. So because she wouldn't do anything, I had to take over and become the mom. I had to get the kids up, breakfast, get them to school, get them home, help with homework, lunches, bed routine, etc... My mother pulled me out of school during my junior year and I did 2 years online. Because of this I was not allowed to attend prom, or walk at graduation. I missed out on so much. I managed to keep a job but would work 9-2 overnight that way they would be sleeping. I spent all of my time working for my family. I would make dinners, buy groceries, refill medication, do all the laundry, drive her to every doctor appointment, get haircuts for the kids, sports, band, etc.. everything was on me.

She wasn't very talkative for a while. But after a while she kinda became mean. If I messed up at all she would scream at me, not talk to me for a few hours and then pretend nothing happened. She would make me cry nightly for a while because of how bad it got. I tried to be so sympathetic because of what happened but it got hard.

​

It was so hard to see everyone go to sports games, prom, class pictures, senior awards, and graduation while I wasn't allowed to.

​

So, I am supposed to start college in fall and was accepted into a bunch of schools not local because I had great test scores, gpa, etc... but she made me reject all of them and accept our local CC because she won't let me leave. She made me schedule my classes around my siblings and her and told me I will be living at home all 4 years. Now here's the thing. I secretly accepted my spot at a college pretty far away because it was my dream school. I guess I feel guilty because I don't think I can leave because it wouldn't be fair?

Next morning I gave them a suitable Dad speech. I told friend he should tell his folks what happened, because I wouldn't lie or cover for him. He promised he would. Friend went home and son and I discussed consequences of his poor choices (a combination of grounding and electronics restrictions).

A few days later, friend's mom calls me to see if my son could join them at the beach that weekend. I told her my son was grounded because of last weekend's shenanigans.  What shenanigans? she asked. So I told her. It was all news to her.

Two hours later friend's parents show up at my door. They are pissed I didn't call them about the drinking and everything else.  They go on and on about it, in angry tones. I eventually snap back and tell them to be glad I was there to rescue their kid, that they should be thanking me, and maybe they should be glad the kids felt like I could be trusted and called upon. The mom was even more angry and called me a few choice names, including asshole.

613,Not the A-hole,"Okay first off I am 18 years old, I feel like this type of thing could be acceptable for little kids and younger teenagers, but I am legally an adult and this is driving me insane. 
So a few months ago my Mum took me aside and told me I am watching “inappropriate” content on Netflix, (as in Orange Is The New Black most likely) and then promptly decided the way of dealing with this was to install parental control software on both my laptop and iPad. 
This software allows her to track all my searches, activity on apps and how long I am spending on apps, I think its a breach of my privacy and a better way around this issue would be to sit down and have a conversation with me if she feels she needs to put boundaries in place for my internet usage. 
What’s confusing about this is I am probably the most vanilla internet user you could find, and we have always had a level of trust between us in terms of how I use the internet, I think that the most upsetting aspect of this situation is I feel I have lost her trust, not that I can’t freely browse porn without her seeing it. 
I feel like she doesn’t deserve me being angry at her because of all she does for me, but I feel like this is quite overboard and it does make me angry! I wish she would have talked to me first before doing this.

614,Not the A-hole,"I work at a school.  We operate on the 5th floor of a building.  There are other businesses in the building as well.  Our students are predominantly non-black adults who come to take classes.  It's training for a specific career field.  We've had maybe 2 or 3 black student enroll in the last 5+ years.  Fred was one of them.  

Fred comes early one morning and is waiting inside the school for the teacher to arrive and open the classroom.  It's normally locked until we open up for the first class at 9am.  There were other students waiting in the hallway with him.  The security guard comes up to the 5th floor where he was waiting in the hallway, and tells him to get out of the building.  It's cold outside and he feels angry because he feels he was treated unfairly.  None of the other students waiting in the same hallway were asked to leave.  

When I confronted the guard, he said that Fred was a ""homeless.""  He even said he offered him a piece of bread when he kicked Fred out.  We told him that he had his tuition fully paid for and had every right to be here.  The guard said he's just doing his job and blamed our school for this.  I asked why he didn't ask any of the other students.  Or why he didn't believe Fred when he said he goes here.  The guard started getting defensive and started using profanity saying he doesn't take orders from our school because he works for the building and we're just tenants.  He probably couldn't imagine that a black man like Fred could take classes here (again, a very non-black part of town).  Our school doesn't issue a student ID or anything and Fred didn't have his paperwork with him that would verify his enrollment.  Fred is a large black man with a beard who smells like incense.  He sometimes wears worn clothes I guess but I never had reason to believe that he is homeless.

I accused the guard of being a racist, gave him a bad look but in the end just walked away.

I don't know how, but I do want to hurt this security guard for what he did to Fred and cussing us out.  I feel that it was unfair and humiliating to be treated that way.

616,Not the A-hole,"My son’s birthday is tomorrow, he’s turning 5. His party was on Sunday. As of last week, he recently added a new thing to his wish list: a very specific toy car. We looked everywhere for it and so far, all we could find were really expensive ones out of budget. We also had gotten him other stuff that he had asked for previously, so we didn’t think it was a big deal if we didn’t get him that. (We also never promised said toy, keep in mind. He just said he wanted it.) We told him ahead of time that he probably won’t be getting the car.

He didn’t open his presents at his party, but he opened them after in front of me, his dad (my husband) and my mother-in-law. Every single gift, he threw it aside and said “It’s not xyz.” He did this with mother-in-law’s gift, and it was something he had asked for in the past and we knew he’d like. We told him that’s not how you behave when you receive a gift, and that you need to say thank you. He said “I want my \*insert specific car\*”. I reminded him that he shouldn’t be expecting it and that we’ve told him that. It lead to a huge tantrum. Honestly, I’m pretty disappointed with his behavior.  He knows to act better than that. He’s been doing the same if he opens a card from someone, despite us talking with him about it a few times.

Fast forward to today. My husband found the car and in our price range. He asked if I wanted to buy it. I told him no, given his attitude. I said he has enough gifts and that the way he’s been acting, I don’t think he deserves it. He needs to learn to appreciate what he has, and we’re not going to reward this bad behavior. He didn’t buy it, but said I was being too harsh. Am I?",135,637,0.93

So the actual story, I’ve been busting my ass for four years to get a first class undergraduate and masters degree. For graduation, of course, the people who were going to come for me were my mum and dad. The day of graduation is less than two weeks away now and suddenly my dad drops on me that he’d like for his girlfriend of about a year to come along.

I told him no fairly straight up. His girlfriend is a lovely woman but I’ve only met her a couple of times. I feel that given how hard I’ve worked, this one day could be about me, I just want it to be family and close friends as I don’t really feel like getting to know somebody new when I’m just trying to celebrate.

I don't have secrets to hide (I've never cheated or anything like that), but like everyone, I have private thoughts, whether they're serious or just kind of loopy thoughts that I feel like writing down and exploring for whatever reason.

619,Not the A-hole,"I'm 21, and I was born with a severe medical condition that requires me to be on TPN for the rest of my life. Due to medical negligence, I lost all my sites as a toddler so my mom had to learn it all in a very short time period to keep me alive with the single site I have left. I literally owe my life to her, and for that I will forever be grateful to her.

After I married my wife my mom said she'd NEVER do my medical care because my mom didn't trust my wife not to mess it up and kill me. This didn't bother us because all our needs were being met at the time.

Then my dad died and my mom got remarried. My mom immediately dumped all of my care on my untrained wife and my 1 nurse. My mom refused to teach my wife because she was busy, so the nurse had to teach her on top of now needing to work 7 days a week.

My mom was rarely home, but when she was she and her new husband would criticize the smallest of things me and my sisters would do. It got to the point where we needed to move for our sanity, but we couldn't because she convinced me when I was younger that it was ""just easier"" if my SSI was deposited directly into her account. 

She also refused to consider my SSI rent (SSI increases if you pay rent depending on how much rent you pay), instead considering money I owed her as payment towards family expenses like toilet paper. Which she didn't buy anyway. We were given $85/mo to spend, this is all we had to spend for food, which was never available in the family fridge so my wife was basically forced to eat once a day, twice if we were lucky.

My mom didn't take care of me for free by the way, she got paid by the state for it, as well as getting 100% of my SSI which was over $500/mo.

She'd get pissed at home that she had all these disabled kids to take care of and refuse to deal with us, but the second she was with people outside of the house she'd play it for pity and sympathy. Even after she had nothing to do with my care she acted like she was some infallible woman who could do no wrong. Any disagreement was disrespectful and she'd gaslight us all constantly.

622,Not the A-hole,"I’m [22F] in college &amp; still a dependent on my mom’s health insurance. A year ago, I was prescribed Adderall XR to counteract the effects of other medications. My parents are divorced, so my dad (who is more financially stable) paid the upfront medical fees that culminated in my treatment (about $1000) and also generously offered to pay the $120 for the appointment with my psychiatrist every month. My mom (again, generously) offered to pay for my monthly refills ($9 for Adderall, $36 in total).

Recently, my mom demanded I give her thirty 20mg pills— my entire prescription. When I refused, she called me selfish and ungrateful. According to her, since she pays for it & I’m on her insurance plan, I should give them to her if she asks. She also said I didn’t actually need Adderall and that she’d stop paying for it— I told her that was fine, I’d pay for it myself, so she blew up and started threatening to end my phone plan, etc. She also accused me of selling it to people at school. If she had asked for 1 or 2, I might’ve looked the other way, but she’s demanding an entire month’s worth of pills. She said I shouldn’t be taking it in the summer anyway since I’m not in school, but refuses to listen when I try to explain that I wasn’t just prescribed it for academic purposes.

AITA for refusing to give her my meds? I understand her point about paying for them, but they improve my quality of life so much that I don’t want to give them away.

When the guy comes back tomorrow to return the pot I’ll apologize for my attitude. But I would encourage all of you to be nice to your baristas and throw in a tip when you can! 



I’m a barista at a very popular and busy shop that happens to be in a very wealthy part of town. Me and the other workers are not so well off. Like most service industry jobs, I rely on tips to survive. I wish that didn’t have to be the case but I live in the US. That being said, people are usually very generous tippers and our regulars treat us very well.

Recently a man has been coming in who will order 15 cups of coffee, which is a ridiculous amount to carry by himself back to wherever he is going. He would carry two four cup trays stacked in each hand and carefully make his way out the door.
Not only that, it’s hard on us. A batch of coffee usually is about 10-15 cups so we would have to basically brew two pots of coffee just for this guy. Usually a pot lasts us an hour or so since most of our customers get lattes and whatnot.
 
I suggested multiple times that he order a pot of coffee just to take and bring back later, since it is cheaper for him and it would be easier to take back in his car. He never took me up on the offer, stating that it was no problem and that people liked the coffee that way. I should mention that he never tipped for any of these orders, which bothered me but I held my tongue. Also important: he always paid in cash. 

After about a week of this he finally came in and ordered an airpot. I enthusiastically prepared one for him and supplied him with cups and lids and even put them in a cute little milk crate. As I was ringing him up, he pulled out a credit card. He wasn’t used to using a card so it took him a second to get through the POS signature and tip page, and then he asked “where’s the button for no tip?” I was appalled. I replied “I don’t know, I always tip.” And gave him a dirty look. He seemed upset, and said “have a good day!” As he left and I said “okay man”. And yes, I had a pretty snarky tone.

My coworkers of course were also mad about the lack of tip but some of them said I shouldn’t have called him out. It was pretty poor customer service but I think since he was such a tough customer we deserved a tip and he set himself up for a bad reaction by bringing attention to not tipping at all.",157,109,0.73

She still lives at home and has no job besides selling decorations on etsi.
My husband often is on business trips so I take care of my daughters (f 18 and f 14) all alone.

So yesterday my daughter was running arround the block when her cellphone rang and it was her sister, so I just took the call and talked to my other daughter. When I hang up I notice that the home screen has the tinder app. I was honestly shocked because I had never allowed my daughter to used dating apps as they are very dangerous. I had read so many articles that young girls ended up abused and worse by their tinder dates, that I had made a point of educating my daughters and telling them that you only find your real love trough real life.

So I opened her profile and was horrified. She had some explicit photos of her on her profile. I mean in bikini and stuff and her quote on her profile was "" I solemnly swear I am up to no good"". I never thought my daughter would be like that. And I was even more disgusted by the guys she was talking to. The youngest was a 22 y.o mechanic. And she even set up a date with him!

I took her phone, deleted the app and waited for her to come home.
Once she was I confronted her and told her that it was unlike her to have such an app and that I foebidd her from seeing the guy because she never knew what his intentions were.
She told me that he was a sweet guy and she was safe. That she would share her location with a friend and only meet him in public.
I told her it was not acceptable and that I knew that tinder was an app for casual sex and I would never let her do that because sex is something Intimate that she could not give away to everyone.

We got in a heated debate and I told her that until she learned her lesson I would take her phone.

She looked very mad and left. I don't care because she will see that I did it because it was the best for her.

My younger daughter made a side comment on how technology and social media is evolving and that I had to get with the times.

But that's what they say. I am their mother an I have more live experience than them. 

When I told my husband the whole story a few hours ago when he came back, he was totally pissed and told me off for being controlling. In his words
"" she is a young woman and as long as she keeps up with college work and isn't getting pregnant she can see whomever she likes even I I feel weird about it.""

My reasoning behind it was, my house my rules and as long as she lives here she has to abide by my rules, plus it's a phone we bought so it's technically ours and I can take it as I please and see fit .

The oldest is 16 and a boy. He has always been on the more feminine end of the spectrum and I know that doesn't mean he's gay. As he got older I started to suspect that he might be gay based on certain mannerisms and comments he would make about boys and girls.

627,Not the A-hole,"
I just bought a house and threw a housewarming party, inviting a bunch of friends. All in their late 20s or early 30s. I made a Facebook event and since I wanted to be clear it was a party-party, not a family event, I put this in the description:

""Drinking age only please; and I don't mean apple juice!! This is a big kids night, y'all! 😁""

(I'm in the US btw, where the legal drinking age is 21.)

So the party was pretty great in general, until something happened that's caused some drama in my friend group.

My friend Jack from my hiking club, who I'm not super close to, but I'm friendly enough with, brought a girl he was dating. She looked a little young for him but I didn't say anything at first. 

Till I heard someone else say she was a college freshman. I asked Jack how old she was, and he said 19. I asked him what the hell he was doing, bringing someone underage for drinking to party at my house. 

He said that everyone parties at that age. He did, he knows I did, it's no big deal.

I said yeah but I still don't want to be the one serving someone alcohol illegally. I could be in trouble as the homeowner if something goes wrong. And honestly she was too young for me to be comfortable partying with. Yeah we all drank in college, and damn if that wasn't a bad idea sometimes. College kids can be messy at the best of times.

He got defensive, saying his girlfriend was mature, and it was insulting for me to act like she's a child. 

I reminded him about the Facebook invite... And he said that was obviously talking about little kids, what did I think he was, a cradle robber? 

I was getting frustrated and said ""Well you said it first"" which pissed him off, but he actually left after that. 

Afterwards, Jack and a couple of his friends texted me saying I went too far. Jack was mad I embarrassed his girlfriend by kicking her out because of age. And a few other guys he's buddies with said I needed to chill, drinking at that age is normal, the cops aren't going to come by and ID everyone at a relatively tame housewarming party.

So I don't know if I overreacted. After buying my house, I heard so many horror stories about homeowner liability. Like what you're liable for if someone gets hurt in your property, if someone is drinking underage there, etc. So it bothered me a lot that Jack would break my rule for the party that everyone had to be legal to drink.

628,Everyone Sucks,"Hey there Reddit,
My girlfriend of 7 months has recently started smoking cigarettes and weed while at parties, and I don’t like that. I hate the taste it gives her, I hate the smell, and on top of all that I hate the fact that it is so bad for her health. I’ve lost someone (who smoked a lot during her younger years, and stopped 10 years before dying) to lung cancer, and that made me very Anti-Smoking. 

We were speaking about smoking the other day, and I half-jokingly said to her that if she were to start smoking, I would leave her immediately. She then started asking about all the little details like if she could smoke even just one cigarette, or weed, to which I replied nothing except if you’re at a party. 


She told me that it was her body, that she had every right to do whatever she wanted, to which I replied that she absolutely did, but that I also had the right to not want to be in a relationship with a smoker. She then told me that if I really broke up with her just because she had smoked, it would mean that I didn’t care about her and didn’t love her. I just told her that I was serious, and that if she couldn’t abstain from smoking even if it meant losing me she should just date the cigarettes. 


She completely disregarded that and proudly told me that she smoked two cigarettes while out with friends two days later, so I left her, only to get back with her a day later because you know I love her and I’m not really good with leaving people I care about. 


But I really don’t want her to smoke.

I walk into this certain coffee establishment and don’t see my drink at the mobile order pick up. No problem, I figure the barista hasn’t gotten to it yet so I’ll wait. I’m waiting for what seems like a very long time, and I’m debating interrupting the barista to ask if they saw my order. Right as I’m about to do so, an older man (maybe about mid 40’s) walks up to the counter and says he accidentally picked up the wrong order. I look at the cup in his hand and see my name on the mobile order sticker. The man says he just noticed the name was wrong. The barista looks over at me, watching, and says to the man, “I think you took her order.” The man turns to me and says, “I’m so sorry, I ordered the same thing, I didn’t even think to look at the name, I’m so sorry.” Obviously, this guy didn’t mean any harm and I can understand how if you’re busy you might accidentally grab the wrong cup. So, I smiled at him and said it was no problem and that I understood. 

At this point, I expected the barista to offer to re-make my drink, as it was touched and possibly altered by another person. Instead, the man passes the drink to me, finds his proper order and sits back down at his table. The barista goes back to making other drinks. I stand there for a moment, unsure what to do, when the barista looks over at me again and says, not kindly, “Are you waiting on something else?” I looked down at the drink in my hands and then back to the barista and say, “I’m really sorry but could you re-make this?” The barista replies, “is something wrong with it?” I say something along the lines of “well, that guy took my drink and I don’t know if he drank out of it or did something to it, I would really appreciate it if you would re-make it just to be safe.” The barista rolled their eyes at me, and reached forward and roughly took the first drink from me. They then said, “you’ll have to wait for me to get through these orders first,” meaning the drinks she was currently working on. I said that was fine, and that I’d wait. 

I kid you not, I stood there for a good 10 minutes while they made two lattes. I could feel my face getting warm and it felt like every clank of their pitcher was directed at me. 

Finally, they re-made my drink and said, “here.” as they placed the cup on the counter, almost knocking it over. I said a quick thank you and apologized again and got the hell out of there.

For me quality time is important to differentiate from because my dad was always around when I was a kid but I wouldn't call it quality time.

&#x200B;

As a family we take 3-day vacations every few months just to stay connected and get aways from friends, school, and electronics so we can hang out like a family.

&#x200B;

I only started this long hours schedule recently and some posts have made it clear to me that I need to talk with my wife more about how she feels and check in on her more. She does have the option to take a vacation and I would take a couple days off to make sure things go smoothly with the kids and keeping the house clean. I don't know why she hasn't but I plan on talking to her about it this upcoming Friday, thanks to you guys.

About the money. I know this can be a sensitive topic but with my current job 2K of paid off time is a drop in the bucket, and for my only me time every year I think its personally reasonable.

633,Asshole,"I’m a 23 year old guy. I’ve always dated women and I’ve slept with my fair share. 

I’ve never felt happy or fulfilled with them though. And recently I have been noticing guys more and more. 

I’ve been best friends with Jeff for a long time. He came out to me in high school. 

We got drunk together and played video games last weekend. 

At one point Jeff got up to go to the bathroom and my eyes wandered and watched him go to the bathroom. He caught me looking when he came back and asked me what I was staring at. I just started to cry and I confessed all of the confusion and things I’d been feeling. He started to hug me and we just ended up kissing and we eventually had sex. 

I don’t remember a lot of it as I was pretty drunk and upset. 

I woke up the next morning freaking out that I had just slept with a guy and I left before Jeff woke up. He texted me later that day asking why I took off and saying that he has had a crush on me for a long time and he wants to be with me and help me through this. 

I honestly don’t want to talk to him and I have been ignoring him since that happened. He’s tried to call me many times but I’m freaking out and he keeps leaving messages like that. 

I have nobody to talk to about this because nobody else knows and I don’t want them to.

635,Asshole,"Okay, hear me out.  


I saw a similar story to mine on this subreddit and I decided to make a throwaway to talk about it.  


Last summer we finished building a treehouse in our back yard for my 10 year old son to play it. One day he went up there with his friend and ran to me telling me ""our neighbor doesn't have any clothes on"".  


Apparently our neighbor, whose family is friends with my family, was sunbathing without a top. I used to be close friends with her husband, but we've definitely drifted apart after this whole situation.   


Anyway, this happened a few more times so I told my kid to stay out of the treehouse until I could talk to her.   
I texted her husband (my friend) asking if they could text me before she bathes topless in her backyard so I could make sure my kid was inside or at least out of the treehouse.   
Within an hour, she came storming to my house knocking on the front door. As soon as I opened it she was screaming at me to mind my business and to tell my ""perv kid"" to keep his eyes out of their yard.   


In my opinion, she completely overreacted. I didn't push it further than this though. I just boarded up the window on the treehouse that faces her yard. It was a different story for my wife on the other hand. They ended up getting into a huge argument and are no longer friends. Eventually her husband started to ignore me as well and we haven't golfed or done anything together to this day.   


I feel like thanks to me our entire friendship has been ruined. I wish I would've just said nothing and boarded the window up in the first place.

636,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at bottom

My fiancé and I are looking in to getting a dog. As we’ve been talking about what breed to get, I’ve been more inclined towards medium sized dogs (beagle, corgi, etc) while he has always had his heart set on getting a Rottweiler. 

Now I’m not against getting a Rottweiler altogether, but I did tell him that I would prefer starting out with a bit of a smaller dog given that I 1) have never owned a dog before in my life, and 2) am 4’11 and weigh 102 pounds. I’m just a little nervous about my first ever dog being a dog that can grow to be quite a bit bigger than me (as I am very inexperienced in caring for dogs)

Fiancé basically said that the size of the dog won’t be an issue if it’s well-trained and also pointed out that he never really cared to have a cat, yet we got one anyways because I really wanted one. I figured this was a fair point so now we’re looking into Rottweilers. 

But now the only area where I won’t budge is whether or not the dog is neutered. My fiancé grew up in a house where they never neutered their pets. so I figured I had to tell him my stance, otherwise he might just assume we won’t neuter the dog. I’ve heard that dogs that are fixed are more obedient and easier to train. So if he wants to say that a big dog won’t be a problem for a small person if they’re well trained, we should get the dog neutered so it’s easier to train. Maybe this is just anecdotal but the un-neutered dogs his parents had were super poorly trained and failed out of doggy school multiple times for being disobedient. 

Anyway now he’s arguing me on it and saying he doesn’t see why we would have to neuter the dog. After explaining my p.o.v. I eventually told him that if we’re not going to get the dog neutered, then I don’t want a dog at all. Sorry if this swings the pendulum for some people - but I also just think that seeing dog balls on un-neutered dogs is gross, which is another reason I want it fixed. Am I being the asshole here for giving this ultimatum??

TLDR: After disagreeing about what type of dog to get, I gave in and told my fiancé we could get a Rottweiler even though I’m a teeny, first-time dog owner. Now I just want the dog to at least be neutered and he still doesn’t want to get it fixed. AITA for giving an ultimatum on neutering the dog?

And in case the question comes up: my fiancé has no intention of breeding or anything like that. Just wants the dog to keep its balls.

EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for all of your replies!! And big shoutout to all those who pointed out the risk of unplanned puppies. This is definitely something I should have also thought of and included in my original post. All the more reason I’m more confident in my stance!

EDIT 2: Thank you still to all those who have commented even more :) and to also acknowledge another excellent point many of you have been making: whenever we do decide to get a dog (and agree on the neutering issue) we will of course consult with our vet as to the best timing to go through with the procedure!",139,89,0.94

638,Everyone Sucks,"Alright so I'll just jump right in. A few weeks ago, me and my friends were at a burger joint. This particular place gives out pretty healthy portions, and I myself am pretty frugal and also mindful of wastefulness. Every time I've ordered fries here, they always give me way too much and I always have a ton leftover. On this day I wasn't particularly hungry, so I decided to go ahead and save the money by not ordering fries. My friends both ordered fries, and I asked if they'd share a couple with me. They did give me one or two, but they also asked, ""why didn't you just order fries yourself if you wanted fries?"" I responded ""eh. I only wanted a little to eat and I knew you guys would have a bunch leftover anyways."" After this, my friend got all pissed off and said stuff like ""you're such a bum. Why didn't you just buy your own fries?"" He then proceeded to get up and throw half of a full tray of fries away just so I couldn't have them. I explained that it would've been wasteful to get my own full order of fries if I knew I was just going to throw most of them away, but my friend didn't agree, saying that I was just ""trying to trick him into buying me fries."" 

Fast forward to a couple days ago, we are at another restaurant where I did get fries. My friend asked if he could have a couple and I said ""no way jose,"" citing the dispute from weeks earlier when he threw away a bunch of fries just to spite me even though he did give me a couple before. I thought an eye for an eye would be justified so I did a similarly petty and spiteful thing and refused to give him any of my fries (all of which I ate, by the way). 

A few of my friends are siding with my other friend and making it out to be like I came up with some premeditated broke boi scheme to get free fries when I feel like I just made a choice to be less wasteful and only eat a few leftover fries instead of getting an entire large order to myself. 

So what do you guys think? Who is justified here?

EDIT: to clarify, I gave out a few fries to my other friends who were there, just not to the guy who wasted a shit ton of fries to be spiteful",41,46,0.95

644,Asshole,"This happened ages ago and has been an ongoing joke in my family for years, they think I'm definitely TA but I disagree.

I have always been a picky eater and still am, I'm sure I'm not alone but I have always had people comment on the way I eat, how little I eat and I can't stand being critiqued on my eating habits. 

This story takes place when I was about 9 years old. I was having dinner with my family. I had some potato waffles and baked beans (among other things) on my plate. The sauce from the baked beans had spread over and was soaking the edges of my waffles. I don't like the way it makes my crispy waffles soggy so decided to trim the edges of my waffles with my knife and fork. My Dad saw me doing this and said very condescendingly ""pfft what are you doing?! It all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway"" and laughed to himself.

I know it gets all mixed in my tummy anyway. But before that it has to go in my mouth and I don't want cold, soggy, slightly tomatoey potato on my tongue because it's gross. I'm also annoyed that he called belittled my eating habits in front of the whole family and made fun of me for something that has absolutely no effect on him whatsoever.

So I got up, walked round to where my Dad was sitting, picked up his glass of beer and poured it over his dinner. He tried to grab my hand and stop me, but it was already too late. He shouts ""What are you doing!?"" and I said ""what's wrong, it all gets mixed up in your tummy anyway""

I remember my older brother and sister thought this was hilarious, my Mum was annoyed that I ruined the dinner she'd made for my Dad (fair enough, sorry Mum) and my Dad was furious. I said he shouldn't have made fun of me for something that didn't matter to him. I was grounded for a week afterwards but my Dad has never made fun at me eating since.

Anyway, AITA? I'm sure some fellow picky eaters will back me up.",904,5501,0.94
645,Not the A-hole,"I am a nurse that works in the OR at a hospital. I have to work every other weekend with a handful of other nurses. One of my favorite things about working Saturdays is ordering takeout, as I typically meal prep for the other 6 days of the week. When I started working at this hospital, it started with me ordering takeout and asking if anyone wanted anything. Fast forward a couple of years and it's now a thing. Every Saturday my coworkers ask me where we are eating from. I will typically pay for the food up front on my card, and everyone will pay me for their food. I eventually got everyone to use Venmo as I don't like carrying a lot of cash (think 7 other nurses handing me wads of cash of small bills). 

6 weeks ago, we had a new nurse start in our department. The first weekend, we did our typical food order. When it comes time to pay, the new nurse doesn't have Venmo. No problem, I'll take cash this one time and he can sign up for future orders. He didn't have cash on hand and said he would have go to the ATM. Over the next two weeks, he ""forgot and didn't have time to go the ATM."" 

When the next working weekend rolled around, I told him he would have to pay me for the past order and upfront for the current order because I wasn't in the market for being down $20 perpetually. He got pissed off but went and got cash. I told him this was the last time I would be taking cash because I got everyone on Venmo so that I wouldn't have to deal with cash. I'm a guy who carries a slim wallet. I only keep a single $100 bill in the wallet and it's only for emergencies. In the grand scheme of things, a single person giving me cash isn't that big of a deal, but then I have to find a way to spend/deposit it, and I worry one person turns into two, then three, etc. 

This past Saturday came, and he didn't have Venmo yet but said he would get around to it. I just wanted past the mess, and will just take his cash at this point. I asked if he has cash on hand. Nope, he needs to go the ATM. I finally said ""No, I need it upfront."" He got angry and says I'm punishing him for not using Venmo. I said he if has an issue with Venmo, I'd be willing to sign up on a payment platform of his choice. He said he doesn't use any of those. I said I would wait a few moments for him to get cash but he needs to do it now because we're ready to order. He ended up sitting down playing on his phone saying ""I'll go to the ATM in a few minutes"" and I finally ordered food without him. I didn't blindside him, I told him immediately that he needs to order separately. 

He called me a huge asshole and says I'm bullying him just because he doesn't use a payment app. He says no one else pays up front and it's not fair that he has to. I guess my only justification is that he stiffed me for two weeks before. The other nurses don't think I'm an asshole, but he thinks I'm a big enough asshole and is saying he's going to HR about it and now I'm worried about it.",427,3676,0.97

648,Not the A-hole,"So we were randomly talking about plastic surgeries. I told her that I'm not a big fan of plastic surgeries because they are still risky and expensive and can put the people involved through a lot of stress. I told her that I think that in cases where people have physical impairments due to fire or some other accidents, it makes sense but if they are for cosmetic reasons, it may not be worth going through the knife. Obviously, I know people want to feel good about themselves and there are many who go through plastic surgeries for that reason.

&#x200B;

She said that she is also not a fan of plastic surgeries but she wouldn't break up just because her partner chose to have one. She said it just means that she doesn't love him enough if she did. Her point was that if they loved each other, they have to work out a compromise regardless. I told her that it is the right of the boyfriend to break up with the girlfriend if he is not comfortable with her having surgery done just like how it is the right of the girlfriend to do what she pleases with her body. I told her that they need to have a proper discussion first and make sure they both are good with the idea, otherwise the dynamics of the relationship changes and they wouldn't be happy going forward.

&#x200B;

At the end she asked me if I would break up with her if she had some surgery done. I knew the question was just rhetorical. I told her that I love her the way she is and I would first try to understand her point of view to as to why she wanted to get something done and if there was something I could do to change her mind. Then, if she still decided to go through with the surgery, depending on how extensive it is - for e.g. if it's a minor nose job, I wouldn't really care but if it's something like a butt implant or injecting herself with chemicals on her face or some part of her body, I would consider breaking up. She was shocked and kind of got mad at me.

651,Not the A-hole,"My ex-wife left when my daughter was 3 years old. She hasn’t really been around since. She does occasional visits, but doesn’t show up for most of them. When she left, she was told she had to pay child support. I didn’t need it to get by, but it was a nice supplement to the income and to help make sure that my daughter had everything she needed/wanted.

Now, my daughter is 15 years old. Last year, I started giving her the child support directly, so she could buy her own clothes, shoes or whatever she wanted. I still buy groceries, pay bills, her school tuition (she goes private), etc. but she goes to the mall and stores without me, typically with her friends-too cool to be with her dad these days.

652,Not the A-hole,"Some information first:

My uncle ""Leo"" is in his mid-forties. He's been bringing the same man ""Mark"" to family gatherings since I was little (I'm 16yo now btw). He's also been living with him since forever.

We're a large family who come from a majority Christian country and I've never heard anyone refer to my uncle Leo as gay or Mark as his boyfriend. I think I just kind of figured out what was up somewhere along the line.

This matters because of the following:

The potentially asshole thing happened this weekend. We were having lunch with our grandparents and my sister traveled over with her husband and my niece, who's 6yo.

Niece is crushing on 2 boys in her daycare group. We asked her questions about that because it's a cute situation. She ranted about both boys and her conclusion was that neither of them could become her husband because they don't have cats. She added: ""I want to have 4 cats like at uncle Leo's house when I'm grown up"".

So I wanted to make a joke and told her: ""Then you'll have to ask uncle Leo where to get a cat-loving boyfriend"". Because it's pretty much Mark that's crazy about cats and he's the main reason they have so many.

I don't even think my niece registered that because she moved to another subject quickly. However my whole family gave me the death stare. My grandparents looked embarrassed and my mom scolded me later for saying that sort of ""adult stuff"" in front of the whole family and to my little niece. She thinks I made the lunch atmosphere awkward and confused a little kid.

My question:

Am I really the asshole for making a silly joke to my niece, just because it implied my uncle's in a relationship with a man? Is that really such an adult, unspeakable topic for a family lunch? Please tell me if I'm the crazy one here.",58,180,0.95

654,Everyone Sucks,"Posting from a throwaway. 

My husband and I have a daughter together who is 5 years old. My husband has another daughter from a previous marriage who is 9 that he shares joint custody with. The arrangement with his ex is that my stepdaughter stays with her mom every other summer. 

My husband and I try to do a big family vacation every summer. This year is our year to have my stepdaughter so we're going to Legoland in California because my stepdaughter is into legos. 

For next year, I told my husband that I'd like to do the Disney cruise because I think my biological daughter will be the perfect age to enjoy the whole Disney experience. My husband said that he thinks my stepdaughter would be heartbroken when she learns that we're going on a Disney cruise without her. Neither kid has gone to any Disney experience before. I told him that we could take both kids to Disney World in Florida when it's our turn again. My husband thinks we should wait until we can take both kids to both the Disney cruise and Disney World. 

Sticking to the arrangements, if we take both kids to Disney World in 2021 that means we couldn't do a Disney Cruise together until 2023. My stepdaughter would be 13 by then and may not even be into Disney at that age. I also want to experience showing my biological daughter Disney when she's still somewhat of a baby. 

I think Disney World is the ultimate Disney experience, which is why I'm saving it for my stepdaughter. I love her and I don't want her to feel left out. However I don't think it's fair to my biological daughter to hold off on getting to experience Disney at a young age. 

Additional background: In case you're wondering, I thought about asking my stepdaughter's mom if she would let her come with us on the cruise but the answer is likely no because her mom usually takes her traveling to see her side of the family. I will still ask but the answer will most likley be no. 

Also even if we don't go on a Disney cruise, we will still likely go on some other great vacation so my stepdaughter may still feel left out. We try to take her to places we know she'll enjoy when we have her. When my biological daughter was a baby, it was easy to go to pick vacations that wouldn't make my stepdaughter feel left out because I didn't have to worry about keeping a baby entertained. As my biological daughter is growing up, it's harder to avoid picking places that the older stepdaughter may also enjoy. 

So am I being a wicked stepmother aka AITA for wanting to go on this Disney cruise?",216,375,0.92
655,Not the A-hole,"Hello everyone, to keep the story short I am a sitter with Rover, which I charge a fee of 20$ per night. I had an owner dropped off her dog with me for around 3 weeks. During that time I given her discounts and what not due to her long stay with the dog. I've also been in contact with her sending her pictures and just casually talking with her as well. The owner eventually told me she was dealing with homelessness, because of this I told the owner book the next week (after the 3 weeks she paid for) with me and I would give it to you for 40$. When she booked it I modify the cost down to 40$ and told her to confirmed it. I even gave her a few days to confirm it. Rover automatically makes the booking expire after 2-3 days. On the last day I told her to please confirm the booking so that I am cover by Rover if anything were to happen to her dog. From there she never responded. For almost 2 weeks both Rover and I could not contact her. At this point the dog was considered abandoned. I told Rover I wanted to adopt the dog. Rover charges her for 7 days of stay with me after her last booking. I actually did not want the money to be honest. Now the owner has finally contacted me and wants to pick up the dog. WIBTA if I don't reply and not give her dog back as my family and I are pretty attached to the dog at this point.

At this point she has just contacted me and stated that she got a new place but it was infested with cockroaches and she is now homeless again with her kids. I am not sure if I should even reply because I have really been giving her the benefit of the doubt (discounts etc.). I would've really just had given her free dog sitting service until she gotten back on her feet too if she had just contacted me. July 1st was the last booking she had and July 3rd was the last message I received from her before she gave Rover and I no contact till today. Let me know what you guys think!

My coworker is a very nice person but she has this really annoying habit of eating these Frozen Amy’s Thai curry things at her desk. We both have a very busy job and we work through lunch. I bring things for lunch that will have no smells and chewing sounds as to not disturb anyone. We share a very small office space together and the smell is overwhelming and kind of obnoxious.

My husband and I have been talking with a friend about moving into a house together. It is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house, with 2 living rooms. 

My friend agreed with us that one party should take the master with the walk-in closet and master bath, and the other take the 2 bedrooms and other bathroom. Each party (my husband and I as one, her and her 1 year old as another) can have their own living room. Kitchen and dining room obviously shared. She has agreed (mostly) to this arrangement.

We would be providing the appliances for the house (fridge, freezer, washer and dryer), and most likely were going to let her use our tv in her living space as it is bigger (and newer) than what she has, so it would make it more comfortable for her. 

In addition to this, the house would be carried because of my husband's and mine's credit as she does not have good credit, or the best rental history (injury forced her out of work, she stayed with us so we could help take care of her and her toddler, but as a result she couldn't work and got evicted). I would also be the one doing the majority of the unpacking as her schedule is incredibly busy. My husband and my/his family will do all of the moving because I cannot lift anything (injury) and she would need to care for her toddler. 

We agreed the other bills would be 2/3rds on us as we are two adults, and her and her toddler will obviously use less, but she also wants us to pay 2/3rds the rent, despite what my husband, myself, and my family, feels is a pretty equal tradeoff space-wise. Are we the assholes for not thinking we should pay 2/3rds of the rent?

Edit: just wanted to mention that it wouldn't necessarily be my husband and I taking the master. If our bed (cali king) fits in another room, we would have no problem taking the 2 bedrooms instead, as we only sleep in the room (don't believe in TVs in the bedroom), so we don't feel we really need a large room.

Edit: just wanted to update that my husband and I are going to go ahead and apply for the house on our own. Despite our money concerns, we think it will be best, especially given she hasn't responded to my requests to talk for over a day now, despite our best efforts to accommodate all of her requests. I believe she has made up her mind to use the apartment she had previously secured, but wants to avoid the confrontation of telling us she doesn't want to live with us because the arrangement just isn't how she wants it.

So, I have a friend, (well, not really a friend right now because of what happened in the story) who we will call S who wanted a Reddit account, but her dad said there's ""NSFW stuff on there (no joke, he said that even though there is a filter for that shit)"" and won't let S get a Reddit account. Since it was her 13th birthday, she invited me to a convention and took me along to the sushi place she was going to have dinner, so I looked up the specifications of the legal age for a Reddit account, as a way of thanks, and wow, the minimum age is 13! So I told her this and told her she doesn't need to ask her dad, but S said, ""I don't want to go against my father"" but I kept telling her that it was okay, and to clarify, her parents are very lenient and wouldn't mind if she explained herself, then she blocked my number. I was only telling her that she doesn't need permission, and giving her evidence, but she blocked me for no reason. She has a habit of taking things the wrong way and even blocked a friend of mine for not texting her even though he's known to be the person to not start conversations but continue them instead. So, am I the asshole

tl;dr: Friend's father doesn't let his daughter get a Reddit account because he doesn't know how it works, so I say friend can get one without permission, and she blocked me",34,48,0.8

662,Not the A-hole,"Yes the title sounds very bad, but this needs provided context:
1. I live in scandinavia, where tipping is nonexistent. I know nobody here that has tipped while in the country, it can almost be seen as wierd or offensive to do. 
2. I was at the time, practically alone. I am a woman. 
3. Cash is almost nonexistent in the city I live in. I cant remember the last time I carried any. 

I was in a work building, where in the office itself there were me and a couple people left. I decided to order food and get it delivered to our office door. 
When it arrived, the delivery guy called me and told me to go pick it up. I wrote instructions in the order details of our company name and what floor it was on, but he just got to the front building door. Oh well no big deal. 

I walked several floors up and greeted him. Before I could even receive the bag he said ""tip?"". I was taken aback because once again, no one tips here and I have not been asked by this buy a delivery guy before. 

Out of backboneless-ness and because I was alone (office was several floors away) I told him yes. I assumed the app had a electronic tipping system like uber does (this turned out to be wrong). But he still kept asking me ""tip?"" and I started getting nervous because he was very insistent.

I told him that I had no cash on me at all, im sorry. By now he had several times repeated what he previously said and I kept telling him that I had no cash on me, im sorry, i will pay you through the app, whilst now starting to scurry down the stairs. I was uneasy because he was seemingly not understanding me or backing down and I chose to bolt. Whilst still being questioned ""tip?""

663,Not the A-hole,"So this is kind of a two part thing. A while back, I made my mother upset because of a couple different things I said while out with her. She was saying something about how she didn't believe in doctors and that my siblings literally beg her to go and she still puts off taking them as long as possible. I told her that's not okay, that she did that to me and I nearly died (I was hospitalized for weeks, and spent several months on bedrest recovering), and that if she keeps that up one of us really might die some day because of her. She didn't take that too well, but ended up dropping it and brushing it off as no big deal. 


Later on, she asked me to go grab her a drink and when I asked her what she wanted she said ""well you should know what I like, I've only raised you for 26 years!"" And I told her no, I do not know what you like, my grandparents raised me, I still don't know anything about you. She got upset and started crying and said ""what's your problem!? This is the second time today that you've been mean to me and tried to make me seem like a bad person!"" I told her I'm not trying to be mean I was just saying it's not cool to not take your kid to the doctor and that I'm not going to know anything about her since I didnt grow up with her. 


We ended up going home shortly after and went out again the other night, a few weeks later. Well I got my brother a phone because they kept taking his (that a different family member pays for) and I wanted him to have his own, so I made it clear they can keep his other one and this one is STRICTLY for him. Well I found out they've been taking and using this one too, so when I saw her I told her, seriously, I dont want to take the phone back because I don't want him to be punished for what you're doing, but I will take it back if you don't stop stealing it from him. That is HIS that I'M paying for, not you, it is not yours to touch, it's already bad enough that you keep all his work money at least don't touch his phone. She got upset and starting yelling and crying saying I need to stop treating her like a bad mother, and I told her well to be honest she kind of IS one. She had a meltdown and started sobbing and said well fine, I don't need you in my life anyways, and left without me.

664,Everyone Sucks,"Me and my girlfriend have been going out for over a year now, we just moved in together and we decided to throw a moving in party. The party was maybe 25-40 people, I honestly couldn't count because a lot of people were coming in and going out. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, my girlfriend had control over the music. She was playing... kind of really bland edm-pop stuff like a edm remix of a taylor swift song and ed sheeran and stuff, and I could just absolutely tell that nobody was into it. I think this might be somewhat of an urban/suburban divide, she is from the suburbs where the radio is more popular in general. For one, most of the people there were people I knew, and I know that they wouldn't like it, but also I talked to a few of my friends and they said the music was annoying. 

&#x200B;

I decided to ask her if I could play some music, something that was... you know, crowd pleasing (early 2000s hip hop hits, of course), and not just music that I personally enjoy, and right away you could see people get more excited from the music. About 4-5 songs later, she asked if she could play more music, and I told her yes, but play something different than what she was playing before because a lot of people weren't into it. She got a tiny bit upset at that, and she kept asking me to explain what I meant, and I just said that people didn't want to hear pop music at a party like that, and she got kind of really pissed off at me and took it as a personal attack on her music taste. I kept telling her that it wasn't me, it was more the guests. Truth be told, I didn't like it much either, and I think she could tell that it was also me, but I personally didn't CARE about the music, its more that it was mellowing out the party in a bad way because people didnt like it. She ended up getting really frustrated at me, saying that we've been dating for over a year and I never told her that I thought her music taste was bad. Like, why would I tell her that? We have different music tastes, she knows that. I think she was kind of in denial that the PARTY didn't like the music, and assumed it was entirely ME who was disliking the music. 

&#x200B;

She ended up going upstairs in a pout, and the next day she went to Chicago for a work trip so we have barely spoken since. I felt like an asshole the entire night. I probably shouldn't have said anything about that, it just came off like I was telling her that her music sucked, but she also kind of put me in a tough position there.",74,79,0.97

Although I was mostly raised by my mom (who is Christian- but doesn't really go to church) my dad was definitely apart of my life. I would celebrate  Jewish holidays occasionally with him . Also I have like a really stereotypical Jewish name. However I grew up around mostly black people on my mom's side so I  just say I'm black Jewish most of the time.

Kyle is Jewish as well as one of my other friends. Somehow the conversation shifted to Anti-Semitism and Jewish people. I mentioned that I was Jewish and Kyle was like completely shocked and was like ""Wait you are, no you aren't?"" .  I told him my name was literally David Goldberg (not my real name but might as well be) and he's trying to say I'm not Jewish? (this was a joke but I was just trying to lighten the mood) However he's still interrogating me about my heritage and saying ""there's no way you're really Jewish."" He starts to randomly quiz me on  random Jewish knowledge which I found stupid as hell so I just told him that my dad is Jewish and my mom is black and that my great grandparents literally survived the holocaust.

Technically according to Jewish law your mom has to be Jewish""   I had enough of this guy and said ""Well Jewish law was created thousands of years ago and is stupid as hell for the most part.""

668,Not the A-hole,"So for context I dated this girl back in 2014. It was kinda weird because she essentially ghosted me after dating for 3 months. It's been so long now that I've moved on.

Well last week I was at a drug store getting snacks and other things when I bumped into her. She couldn't get my name right, rattling off like 4 different names before getting mine. This was also late at night and I had been drinking so I was a bit spaced out. She asked how I was doing and I said I was good. Asked how she was and she said good. Then she left. Pretty simple.

So afterwards I thought I'd look her up on social media. On twitter she took a photo of me without me knowing grabbing a drink. She posted about how she ""ran into this social retard"" and how ""it was clear that I was useless without her"". I was so upset! I mean hell if you think these things I can't stop that but you don't have to blast it like that. She had DM's open so I DM'd her and I was so polite and restrained but in essence I asked her to remove it. She tells me free speech she can say and do what she wants.

Well, that's when I had it.

I reported the tweet to Twitter and gave a lengthy explanation why I'm offended. They responded saying they'd do something. Well her whole account got deleted. At first I thought she blocked me but logged out, tried incognito, everything else I could and confirmed that yeah, it was deleted. I think it's a bit extreme personally all I wanted was the post gone but I figure maybe Twitter people know of other reports or who knows what else.

Well she I guess put two and two together and is now complaining to all my friends about how I 'threw her under the bus'. People are calling me 'fascist' even.

669,Not the A-hole,"Okay I need some opinions here because I feel like a giant asshole. 

A little info first.. My mil is a nice lady, a little quirky and asks a lot of questions. I feel like I am going through an interview everytime we see eachother but she is a genuinely nice person. I have known her for 13 years now and I have three children with her son. 
There is just one thing, every year to two years she seems to have a mental break. My husband said it first happened when he was in high school and she woke him up thinking someone was trying to kill him. two years after that she called the cops because she thought someone was in the basement, turns out it was my husband eating a bowl of cereal having cops with guns drawn coming to the basement door. 

I think there were a few situations in the years following but  one of the biggest was when she went on vacation with my FIL and she was convinced he was trying to kill her. She ran through the lobby and honestly could have gotten him thrown in jail if it werent obvious she was having a delusion. This was 3 years ago and I limited contact with my daughter seeing her but I didnt outright tell her just made up excuses.

Fast forward to mid june of this year. She offered to take my 9 year old every Wednesday to a summer class only this time she was late. I texted her and she said she doesnt feel well then started asking about how my husband was. I knew it was happening again bc she always becomes obsessive about him everytime.  I told her to not come over and just rest then my FIL took her to the dr who dropped the ball. Basically she was spitting the meds the dr gave her back out bc she thought they were trying to poison her. That night she called the cops again and they came in thinking someone was trying to hurt her and her son. My FIL got questioned again and She then spent ten days in the hospital. I thought finally, they are going to find out what is wrong and help her but once again she was not diagnosed with anything. She apparently is prescribed a med but she doesnt take them. 


It hasnt even been a month and she is wanting to take my 9 year old swimming and to go places with her alone. I told my husband i wasnt comfortable with it and to gently let her know. I know it upset him but he stood by me and agrees.  So he told her this morning and she was really upset. I don't think she thinks there is a problem bc she doesn't have a diagnosis. 
When all this is written out it definitely looks like I am justified but in between all these episodes she seems perfectly normal. She doesnt act erratically or seem unstable at all. These episodes come out of nowhere. So when she is back to normal it almost makes me feel like I am blowing it out of proportion and i know they are going to wear me down again to where I trust that my kids are safe with her.

**Backstory:**

&#x200B;

A year ago I was studying abroad and I met a guy on Tinder. We had good chemistry. We went out on two lunch dates which went well. I was really into him and he was into me. Our next date was at my apartment for pizza and a movie. Things moved fast and we did the dirty. Again, two days later, after baking cookies. This time he stayed over but in the morning I could immediately tell something was wrong. He seemed distant and less affectionate than before. In hindsight I realize this could be for a number of perfectly justifiable reasons. But at the time I just thought I had done something wrong. I kept pestering him to tell me what was going on and he grew more and more distant - understandably so since I was totally acting like a nice girl. I asked him point blank why he didn't want to hang out anymore and he gave me some vague reasons - but it doesn't matter, he was perfectly within his rights to change his mind about us.

&#x200B;

But at the time I couldn't accept or handle the rejection. Just so you understand how bad it was, here are some things I did. I'm not sugarcoating it, it was pretty bad and I already know I'm the asshole for all of this.

&#x200B;

* Kept demanding via various texting channels that he tell me what was wrong with me and why he didn't want to date me
* Insisted I just wanted ""answers"" and I wasn't ""a crazy bitch who can't handle rejection"" even though I absolutely was the crazy bitch who couldn't handle rejection
* Stalked his facebook page for other girls
* Found his ex-girlfriend, befriended her under false pretenses to find out whether they were getting back together (He doesn't know this)
* Found his female best friend and facebook stalked her, also asked his ex a bunch of questions about her, to find out if he was in love with her
* 2 months later he got a girlfriend, I saw his relationship status update on facebook and messaged him again to accuse him of ""cheating"" on me even though we were never in a relationship. (they're still together)

&#x200B;

I stopped messaging him eventually. It's a miracle that he never blocked my stupid ass.

So yeah, like I said, I already know I am the asshole for doing these things.

&#x200B;

**To my real question:**

&#x200B;

Now, a year later, I am in a much better place and I can see how terrible my behavior was (not solely, but also, thanks to subreddits like r/nicegirls). I was thinking of messaging him on facebook to apologize. Nothing huge, just something along the lines of ""My behavior was shitty and you didn't do anything wrong."".

&#x200B;

Part of me says it's a good idea to let him know he didn't do anything wrong and that my behavior was entirely my fault and not his. Who knows whether he's still hung up on what happened.

Another part of me says I only want to apologize for my own closure, I'm a selfish asshole and I should leave him alone.

673,Asshole,"I'm going to be a High School Senior this upcoming school year and I've made the decision to not to go to university. I've kinda always been planning to go to college after high school, but never had any idea what to study and still don't. 
This summer I was hired by a family friend (let's call him Bob) to help out with his electrician business. I thought I'd be doing office work, but I'm actually on the field doing the work with him. I ended up loving the work and Bob loves having me. He offered to keep me hired during the school year and after I graduate I can officially start my apprenticeship with him. I told him yes. 
My parents at first weren't too thrilled. They always wanted me to go to university. But they changed their minds after I talked to them so more about it. I told them that electricians make good money and I wouldn't have to go to college for 4 years and spend $80k on a degree. They agreed with my decision.
But now they told my siblings and I that now they can using my college savings for my siblings' education. I have an older sister who just finished her sophomore year in college and a younger sister who just finished her sophomore year in high school. 
As far as I know the college savings for all 3 of us are in one bank account by my parents. My siblings and I haven't put any of our money into it (we each have our own general savings account). The college money is all from our parents that they saved up over the years. They said they have enough for 3 years of tuition and room and board for the 3 of us. I'm not sure on the exact amount, but by that estimate my share would be around $60k. 
I told my parents that it wasn't fair for them to give away that money to my siblings. My parents think I'm being selfish as now they'd be able to pay for all 4 years for my 2 sisters and still have some left over in case they want to go to grad school. They said being able to graduate debt free would be huge for my sisters.

675,No A-holes here,"Edit: (I'm a straight guy if that's somehow relevant)

My best friend has been ghosting me ever since I told her I had thought she was gay. I didn't say it in a negative or insulting way. I genuinely thought she was gay and admitted to my mistake when I turned out to be wrong, but she still got really upset about it and has refused to talk to me since.

She's always been a ""one of the guys"" type of girl. Not like a dyke(not that there's anything wrong with that), but not really a typical girl either. She's also really into LGBT rights. Her sister's an out lesbian and she's always been super supportive of her, and I know that being gay is supposed to be sorta genetic too. She never showed any interest in a guy, so I figured odds are she's probrably just gay like her sister.

Again, I cannot stress how little I actually care about her sexuality. She's my best friend and she's awesome regardless of whether she likes guys or girls.

We were having a pretty good time that day up until that point. We spent the day with some other friends at a beach, and we were chilling out at my place afterwards by watching movies and playing video games.

We were talking later in the night and the topic of relationships came up, so I mentioned how maybe if she was lucky she could find a nice girlfriend like her sister. I think she thought I was kidding at first because she jokingly told me to f**k myself and she said that I know she's not gay. I was a little surprised and told her that I did actually think she was gay. She got really serious and asked me if I really thought that. I reaffirmed that I did think that, but that I guess I was wrong for making assumptions.

She got super quiet after that. I could tell she was a bit upset. Her eyes were watering a little and her face was getting kinda red. I tried asking her if she was okay, but then she abprubtly decided to leave. Before she had a chance to go, I tried asking one more time if something was the matter, but then she screamed at me to leave her alone and was full on crying at that point(which is extremely rare for her). I had no clue how to react so I decided to let her be and she left. 

At first I thought maybe something else has been bothering her and that's why she overreacted, but she didn't act in any way out of the ordinary prior to that, and normally she tells me everything going on in her life so I feel like I would've known if something was up with her.

I haven't heard from her in over half a week now. She won't respond to any of my texts or calls. It's a real bummer, because we've been trying do as much fun stuff as possible this summer, but with her acting like this it's all been put on hold. 

I feel bad for making her upset, but is it really that big of a deal that I thought she was gay? She's very pro LGBT, and it feels super hypocritical that she'd feel this bothered by someone thinking she's gay. There wasn't any harm in it. Right? Or am I wrong?

Update: I apologize for using the word dyke, or saying anything that may have been offensive. I wasn't aware the word was a slur, and I didn't intend to say anything that was insulting to LGBT people, sorry.

I appreciate your guy's responses. I understand that what I said was pretty insensitive. I probrably hit a sore spot for her and I'm a total asshole for not thinking about how she feels or why feels that way.

I sent one last text to her in which I profusely apologized, and said that I regret being insensitive to her feelings. I told her that I want to make it up to her somehow, and I'd like to be able to hang out with her again when she's more comfortable. I also said that if she wants to, she can talk to me about why it was so upsetting that I  thought she was gay, we're best friends after all and she can always confide in me. 

Again, I really appreciate all your responses. A lot of your insights really helped me to try be more understanding of her.",437,666,0.89

Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she’s really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of “it’s fine I have my dads credit card I’m not paying ” which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I’ve told my son multiple times he’s never allowed to use my card so I’m interested to see how this girl thinks she’s going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can’t let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn’t her card but her father’s and I’m not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I’ve ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don’t think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it’s the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I’ve pointed out it wasn’t hers cashier tells her she can’t use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it’s still fraud. Girl says it’s not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she’s doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

But while on a call, SB was screaming real loud and I could hear SB say: ""I told my parents everything, they hate you and don't want to see your face ever again!"". I spared you all the mature language. The point is, it was a lie. My parents laughed and basically told SB that they're stupid. Never mentioned GF not being welcome here.

Few days ago, SB (mad) came home with GF, after a night out and told us that she was pissed for no apparent reason. SB mentioned something like, she asked him to do something, he did it, she was mad that SB did it. She was a little drunk, my initial reaction was well, that isn't nice of her. Yet, today GF told me that SB was spending a lot of time with another girl, telling GF how cool she is and stuff. I can just imagine how jealous she was. Yikes.

Today SB WAS THROWING HIS CHAIR AROUND THE ROOM, because they were arguing. When my dad came to check the commotion, SB left. And GF said that SB was really mad, because they both made tinder accounts. GF got a lot of likes/hearts (I don't know much about that app), and SB didn't get any throughout the weekend. GF said that she feels like it isn't enough for SB that she thinks they are handsome and cool.

SB constantly makes her feel bad for things like saying something stupid, or accidentally stepping off of a sidewalk. I feel like today SB felt the power slipping through their fingers, since a stupid app considered her more attractive. I think that GF is in a horrible situation, because SB uses other manipulative tactics too.

AITA for encouraging her to run away from SB? I try my best to help her acknowledge his toxic ways, I don't want her to suffer because SB has issues.",10,31,0.91

682,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because they both browse Reddit, and this is fairly specific. For some context, I have been friends with Kevin and Ellie for about a year, and they are dating. As it is the summer before we all head off to college, I offered to host a party for our friend group at my house so we could get together and have some fun. I assumed because we were fairly small and tight that it wouldn't be a big deal. This was pretty key for me offering because it is of course my parents' home, and I wanted to be respectful of noise and damage (they'd be home during the party).

&#x200B;

It was intended to be a calm gathering; we'd probably get some pizza or tacos (I'd provide, as host), and maybe some alcohol, as high school kids do. The way our previous gatherings have worked is that the host doesn't provide any of the refreshments or meals, and the attendees all contribute because finding the gathering location itself is the most difficult part for generally broke students. Unfortunately, I don't think this message was communicated well, and that part at least I admit is on me.

&#x200B;

What ended up happening that I felt Ellie was trying to take control of the party; my impression was that she basically wanted to host her own party, using someone else's house. 1) She wanted to change the guest list and add an extra 10 people I was acquainted but not friends with. 2) She wanted to change the date, and I acquiesced the first time. She wanted to flip-flop back again because of Kevin's schedule conflicts, even though that would mean two of our other friends would become unable to attend. 3) She requested a different and more expensive type of drink to be bought by my parents; no offer of contribution, and an implication that I pick up all the costs. And she made these requests through Kevin's phone, which I felt was peer-pressuring me into agreeing to conditions I wasn't comfortable with.

&#x200B;

I'll admit that I was pretty annoyed. I believed that she was over-stepping her boundaries as a rude party guest, and so I left the date where Kevin couldn't attend and therefore she was unlikely to as well. As predicted--they cancelled. But I feel poorly that they were excited to come earlier, and I wonder if they were just overeager to help organize and I've been too petty. So, AITA?",11,34,0.95
683,No A-holes here,"My wife and I are going a little bit crazy, guys.

We have an almost 5 year old son and whenever we visit with our parents (hers or mine), they totally lavish him with gifts. Tons and tons of toys toys toys. It has gotten to the point where he just associates visiting them with getting presents. So when we say we are going to visit them, he says stuff like “I wonder what kind of present they’ll have for me?!” And, as soon as he sees them he says “Hi, grandma! What present did you bring me?!” 

It bums me out because I wish he would just be excited to see and spend time with them. I feel like we need to put some kind of limit on all the STUFF he gets from them. The problem is that he is the only grandchild for all of them, and so, statistically, he gets a ton of stuff. We only see each set of grandparents two or three time a year, but that means that like 6 times a year we have this huge influx of toys that he plays with for a minute and then forgets about. 

Maybe I need to lighten up. I know the grandparents get a lot of joy out of seeing him play with the stuff they buy him. But it stresses me out to see all the toys piling up in our apartment. And I’ve done a lot of reading that says that kids with really huge amounts of toys around the house have a tougher time focusing on one thing for a while when they play.

WIBTA if I told the grandparents to only give him ONE toy per visit and no more than that? Or if I told them to only give him books or puzzles or educational or outdoor sports stuff? And, as a related question, for all you parents out there, WIBTA if I told my son that for every toy he gets now he has to donate one to goodwill (or is he too young for that?)?

684,Everyone Sucks,"So basically I’m pretty sure we’re both assholes but I figured I’d ask anyways. It might get a little confusing but I’ll try my best. 

Friend A, Friend B & Me 

So friend B and I are best friends. Friend A used to be really close with us, but since getting a boyfriend we hardly see him anymore. Friend B and I had this concert about a month ago and friend B asked friend A if he’d pick us up from it afterwards if she gave him 30 dollars for gas. (Note, it’s probably a five dollar trip at most. And an Uber woulda been 20 tops) but we never see friend A anymore and figured we could hang a little. Friend A replied ‘I’ll let you know. It depends when boyfriend gets off work cause I’m picking him up and he’s more important than you’. We’re adults. We understand partners are obviously prioritized over friends. But I felt like saying it to us was still a slap in the face and really unnecessary. Anyways long story short he picked us up, dropped us off and didn’t want to hang. 

So yesterday I was talking to friend A about it and he mentioned his father called him a little bitch for jumping out of his seat to pick us up when we called him and that he felt used. I explained to him in detail that the train would have been 3 dollars, an Uber would have been 20 tops. We didn’t NEED him to pick us up we just wanted to see him and figured it’d be a good excuse for friend time. If he really didn’t want to then just say no next time? We didn’t beg him we literally just asked. If he’s going to be cranky and hold animosity over it I’d rather him say no. I told him it was really unnecessary to point out that his boyfriend was more important than us and that I understood it’s true but it was still rude and he explained his boyfriend works far from home and friend A is his ride to and from work because the busses don’t go that way. I told him (copy and pasted) ‘No offence but I think driving your boyfriend to and from work makes you more of a bitch than occasionally helping a friend out? Boyfriend is an adult. I’d never get a job where my boyfriend had to wait up until late into the night and drive to pick me up. I’d find a job closer to home personally. If my boyfriend expected me to be his Uber constantly I’d be really annoyed. If you’re fine with it fine. But I don’t see how picking up your best friend is making you a bitch? Like you can’t drink Saturday nights cause you have to go pick him up. You can’t go over to your friends house and hang and drink cause you have to pick him up. That puts a hold on your life. If you’re fine with it then yeah that’s you. But to me that sounds worse than picking your friend up ONE time from a concert’

The wedding falls on my fall break which they were expecting me to come home for and I was planning on doing so until the wedding invite. I left home for a Summer internship in May and if I choose to go to the wedding I won't be seeing them or my siblings until December.

They said they feel as if I always choose friends over family which I thought was pretty unfair considering I spent all 3 weeks of winter break with them, spring break, and 12 days at home before leaving for the internship.

686,Asshole,"In order for this to make any sense I have to give you a brief overview of my wife's (Ashley) family tree. When she was young her biological parents gave her up for adoption, and her grandparents adopted her. Since this happened at a young age she grew up calling her bio parents (mother specifically) and aunts/uncles, her siblings, and refers to her grandparents as her parents. This has never been a problem for me and once wrapping my head around it, it's been pretty straight forward. 

My wife and I got married last September and we now have a baby on the way. One of Ashley's friends gave her a set of bi-weekly stickers that have the week of the pregnancy and a picture of a fruit that shows how big the baby currently is. So week 20 is a banana, week 22 is a grapefruit and so on. 

So, a few weeks ago we took the week 20 photos of my wife with who will be the babies grandparents (my parents and Ashley's bio parents) fine and dandy, posted them to FB and everything was great. Last week we took the week 22 photos of my wife with those who will be the babies great grandparents. This included my only living grandmother, and my wife's adoptive parents/grandparents. When posting to Facebook I titled it something along the lines of ""Week 22 pictures with the babies Great Grandparents"" and went on day.

Today, I get a call from Ashley's adoptive parents (mother specifically) freaking out that they are not our babies Great Grandparents, but just Grandparents since they are Ashley's 'parents' and that it should be either changed immediately or taken down. I politely refused because in our babies eyes they will be Great Grandparents and left it at that. Ashley agrees with me on the matter but her adoptive parents have taken to posting a few demeaning messages on Facebook in an act of retaliation.

AITA for not respecting their wishes?

I should note that I do refer to them as Ashley's parents in day to day life and have never had a problem with the situation.

Edit: Changed Maternal to Biological to clarify. 

This also isn't a hill I plan on dying on, I have no issue changing it I was just looking for your opinions on the matter.

As for the pictures and why I captioned them as I did, I was trying to be thematic by having week 20's with the babies Grandparents and week 22's with Great Grandparents. It wasn't done out of spite or disrespect.

Edit 2: I've received a lot of comments about having the word parents in quotes. I would like to mention that I did it to make differentiating between the bio and adoptive parents easier for people who can't understand the situation. It was not meant to paint them as lesser than the parents they are and have been to my wife. 

Edit 3: As stated, this isn't a hill I'm dying on. I wanted your opinions and got them loud and clear. Some of you think I'm NTA but **a majority is saying ITA so I've talked with Ashley's parents and the appropriate changes have been made. **

688,Not the A-hole,"My son is four months and EBF. He takes couple bottles of pumped milk a day(1-2 when I’m at work and 1-2 at night). 

Since he was 2 months family members(mostly in-laws)have been wanting to give him “a taste” of food or giving baby oatmeal/cereal and water(my mom pushes for these). It’s been brought up at every family gathering (when I video chat/call my mom) and it’s driving me nuts!

It feels like everyone is wanting to undermine me and make decisions about how I feed my son so it’s convenient for them. It makes my skin crawl just imagining others putting their fingers in his mouth. 

I thought my husband and I were on the same page when it came to how and how long I’d be breastfeeding for(at least 6 months, then 9 months, etc) but now, he’s jumped on the bandwagon and I honestly feel like it’s because of his family constantly pushing the issue, citing me being a first time mom is the reason as to why I’m being so strict and not letting everyone have their way with my son, therefore I don’t know much and they know better than me.
And because everyone is so pushy about it, it makes me want to double down and not give an inch. 

Yesterday at our son’s four month check up his pediatrician gave the okay to start him on solids and I’m still of the mind that I want to make it to my first goal(as recommended by the WHO and AAP) then slowly introduce things but only us(husband and I) and not everybody and their mama.",288,633,0.93

C=Jess and W=Wife. 

So, my wife and I have 2 kids, F(10), let's call her Jess. We also have M(12) and I also have one from a past relationship F(14). However only Jess will really be in this.

So my wife can be a bit lazy. She makes Jess do these small tasks for her that she can easily do herself, like getting her computer charger from the floor when it's right next to her. Also things like changing the temperature when we have a thermostat right in our room next to our bed. Also making Jess fix food for my wife. There are many more examples. I have told my wife I can do these things myself but she won't listen, and tells me that we (Wife and I) are working and that Jess isn't doing anything important. I have told her that she should then make our other kids do these tasks instead of just Jess, but she hasn't responded to this. This has been a problem for about a year now. Everytime I try to do these things myself, she yells at me to go relax/work, or whatever I'm doing at that moment.

So two days ago, I was playing on our nintendo switch (playing Super Mario Maker 2) while my wife was working on her computer. (I should have mentioned that wife works on our bed). Wife calls for Jess to go to our room, I assume to get her computer charger. I say that because a few seconds later, I heard her yelling ""Don't drag the charger, pick the whole thing up"". Then I don't really hear them talking until I hear Wife yell 

Wife: Why are you always upset?

Jess: I'm not upset. (she's leaving the room while saying this)

Wife: Don't leave when I'm talking to yo-

Jess: Just leave me alone!! 

Jess reaches her room and slams the door. I close out of the game and knocks on her door to comfort her. I walk in and ask her what's wrong/is she OK/things like that and she tells me she that Mom(My wife) is lazy and she should be able to support herself. She is really laying everything out while I'm trying to make her feel better. Around 5 minutes of this and I have calmed her down. We hug and I leave.

I then go to my wife, and she also rants about Jess, saying that ""she's always upset, all she does is stay  in her room and do nothing, she should be grateful for what she has"" ect. I tell my wife that Jess doesn't appreciate doing all these things for W that W can easily do herself, and that she was being lazy. She gets mad and tells me to get out so she can calm down and continue working. So I do.

So now Wife and Jess aren't on speaking terms. I feel like I could have done more to prevent. Today I spoke to Jess asking if there is anything deeper then what meets the eye, if there is anying internal conflicts going on, and she said no. It's just that Jess is usually always happy, but I don't know if there is anything deeper going on. And my wife doesn't usually act like this, and only now has it been a problem. 

AITA?

Quick little edit. I am going to put the three of us (Wife, Jess and I) into family counseling.
Also changed names. C=Jess, W=Wife. Sorry for confusion.

Update: My wife has come home recently, and I asked her why isn't she making our other kids do these tasks for her. She didn't respond at first, so I repeated myself. Didn't respond again. So I said that I'm putting her and Jess in separate therapy, because there is something deeper going on. Then I repeat myself again. 

She finally answers, saying that it's because our other children are at hard work and do tons of chores (they honestly don't have that much, just washing dishes, cleaning their rooms, drying dishes, ect) well Jess just watches Disney channel all day. I got a bit mad and said that what she is doing is making Jess resent her. My wife was shocked to hear that. She askes, is that true, and I say yes. She then says she didn't mean to cause harm, and that she felt horrible. I told her she should talk to Jess and apologize, and that I'm happy she realized what she was doing. They are still talking as I type, and I hear no yelling, so I assume everything is going well.

I have signed my wife and Jess up for therapy alone. I might put them together depending on how things go. Thank you for all the advice. I appreciate it!😊😊

When we decided to move here, for his work, we agreed on a minimum of two years because we had moved a lot in the previous two years. So we sold all of our things (including ALL of our furntiture/appliances that I ALONE paid for) except 2 suitcases worth of stuff, each. 

About 2 months ago he started talking about how he hates living in a country where he feels awkward walking into shops/restaurants on the off chance the people don't speak English. He also quite fairly pointed out that he's pretty much funding our stay here. I'm earning a Serbian wage, which means I can pay all my American debts and part of our rent, but not much else. That being said, he often says that he makes enough that he doesn't care about that. He ONLY brings it up during our fights about moving home.

He said he wants to move him ASAP.

I will admit that my main reason for wanting to stay here is that I have always wanted to live abroad, pretty much since birth. Everything from my college choices to many personal life choices have been geared towards being able to move abroad.

In 2016 I funded our move to Spain (selling all of our stuff that time, too) and he ended up hating it so much that we left after 6 weeks. He felt guilty about that so when he realized his company was cool with him working in the office here, he said it was his way of making it up to me. Plus the fact that he has friends at work and it was just better for him to work in person than remotely, with his new promotion.

So AITA because I want him to stick to the 2 year agreement? Wanting to stay here is selfish, I know, but I'm f\*\*\*ing pissed that in the span of a couple of years my dreams have come true twice to have them thrown out, and also the fact that if we hadn't agreed on two years we could have put our stuff in storage rather than having to spend thousands of dollars AGAIN on furniture and necessities. Not to mention the fact that we'll have to move in with my sister's family until we find a place and go through the annoying ass process of taking our dog back to the US.

Edit: TL;DR at bottom hopefully that is easier to read because some said it was confusing and hard to read.
Edit2: Rewrote entire post thanks to u/avacash to be easier to read.

First a bit about our group so this all makes a bit more sense. There are 5 people besides me going who I'll call Kathy, Lacy, Tommy, Nicky, and Waldo. Jane will be the sister in law to Kathy. We're all college age. Kathy, Nicky and Lacy have been hanging out with Jane more recently as she just got back in to town. Waldo, Tommy and I have only hung out with Jane twice but don't have any problem with her we just don't know her very well/not very close.

Me and the 5 other friends planned this vacation about a month and a half ago. We booked a hotel that will have 2 doubles beds and 1 pull out sofa. Looking at pictures of the hotel online it looks like it will be a very small and cramped room for 6 people to share but it is only for 2 nights so we figured it was fine.

Last night Kathy messaged our group chat asking if Jane can come with saying it was fine if not she was just wondering. I was the first to respond saying that I did not think it was a good idea as the room was already going to be pretty cramped. I also said that I had no problem with Jane, just that I didn't want it to be more cramped than it already was. Waldo agreed with me for the same reason of the room being cramped. Nicky was with Kathy and Lacy and agreed that he didn't care. Tommy responded(later on in the argument) saying they didn't care either way as long as everyone was happy with whatever decision was made. Kathy said okay she doesn't have too come and I thought that was the end of it.

Then a few minutes later Kathy and Lacy messaged saying Jane would sleep on the floor and she'd be out of the way and they don't see why it's an issue because we'd only be in the hotel to sleep(I think we'll be there more than that because a few of us are under 21 and wont have much to do at night). One of their points was also that she would be another person to split paying which would make it cheaper for all(not by much like $6 cheaper each). Waldo and I stood by our choice saying we didn't want it to be that cramped and Kathy and Lacy got pretty upset saying it really didn't matter and that we shouldn't be making a big deal out of it. Also saying that it was 4 vs 2 for people who wanted her(or didn't care in Tommy's case) vs us who did not. They basically said our opinions didn't matter. We asked why they even asked if she could come if they were gonna do whatever they wanted anyway and they said ""To be nice"".

This went on for about 45min of Waldo and I arguing why we didn't want her to and Kathy and Lacy arguing why it didn't matter. We didn't really come to a conclusion on anything and the conversation just ended. IMO Kathy and Lacy were also pretty rude throughout this whole argument making rude jokes and just being mean in general while Waldo and I just defended our reasoning for not wanting her here. But I'm not here for judgement on that part of it.

TL;DR
Friends sister in law wants to come on a trip with 6 other people. It is a small room with 2 double beds and a pull out coach so already pretty cramped with 6 people. I said no to her sister in law coming because I don't want it to be more cramped that it will all ready be.

697,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together 5 months and we share a lot of the same interests. He is also very into science fiction and comedy shows. So I suggested a show to him, thinking, I really enjoyed this show, it ticks all the genres that he normally really enjoys. I suggested we watch it and he agreed and I told him, if he didn't like the first episode or so, we don't have to watch anymore.

We watched the first episode together, but he wasn't impressed, saying he didn't really like many of the characters, which is fair. The characters start of rather unlikable but that's what I enjoy about the show; the characters learn to change their ways for the better good. I agreed that the first couple episodes aren't the best however, once you get past them, it gets really good and interesting. He followed up saying a show should be good from the beginning or else it's not worth watching the whole thing.

We dropped it at the time, which was about 2 weeks ago. Today, he messaged me, asking about a logistical thing that didn't really make sense in the show, I replied saying that I honestly didn't know and that it was probably done for aesthetic reasons more so than logicality. 

He then went on what was pretty much a rant saying how he was watching episode two and how he hated all the characters already and that all of them were selfish and had no concept of the greater good. I tried to explain that they learn how to care for the greater good, and how it helps along with their character development. He then said he could understand it if they were selfish but their reasons served a purpose. And that none of them have any incentive to be there and therefore why would they be there

I tried again to explain to him that a lot of the thing he was talking about don't always happen at the beginning of a show and that they very much take time to come through, especially on newer shows and that again, he didn't have to watch it if he didn't enjoy it.

Then he went on again about how it's not weak character development, its weak character material and that people arent going to want to watch weak characters and arent going to be invested in their development. 

At this point, I had had enough and pretty much messaged him that again, if hes not liking it, not to watch it and that I didnt want to get into a fight over a stupid tv show. Along with some stern wording and a swear. 

I know this is a stupid fight but I've stopped messaging him and am kinda feeling like an asshole for the way I reacted, I mean, it's just a show.

On my way in this morning I let them know that they should probably move their truck because of this and they didn't seem to care. It's been about twenty minutes and they haven't moved it.

I dont like to be a snitch or anything but I feel like this is shitty of them, and like I said, it's the only disabled space on this side of the strip mall. Should I call the non-emergency police line and report them? WIBTA?


Edit: Called it in. Cops came out pretty quick. They've moved the truck. Thanks guys!",23,29,0.82
699,Not the A-hole,"Whenever it is one of my friend's birthday, all the rest of us would buy something together for him, so he could have a really cool gift.

One of them received a full set of a manga series he liked, another one received some original equipment from his favourite soccer team.

And it was my birthday now, and the gift was comming months late, but, finally, yesterday they gave it to me.

They gave me an empty notebook (like those children use for school) with a spiderman drawing made by one of them (not really good).

At first I thought it was a joke, but it wasn't. I told them that this is so unfair, that all the others got cool things and I just got a crappy notebook with nothing inside that costs less than half the money all the other gifts costed.

Of course I got really mad, like, I waited months for this gift while they told me it would be worth the wait.

They said that they weren't in the mood for thinking of a cool gift and buying it, so I told them I didn't want it and gave it back to them.

My problem is the wedding is hundreds of miles away, and takes place over Easter weekend next year, which means everything will be more expensive. Once you take into account travel, hotels, gifts, food etc for me, my partner and my baby girl it will cost us an absolute fortune which we simply can't afford.

I've tried explaining we really can't afford it but they've suggested I get a 2nd job, this is out of the question because I already struggle with not seeing my daughter as much as I'd like. I've tried working out a budget but it seems next to impossible for us to be able to go to the wedding.

702,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway account here. I (19F) am working at an internship this summer in a new state. I'm meeting many talented people in my field and am learning a lot from them. One of these people is a 27M. He's been a great mentor and is interesting to talk to. We've worked together on some projects and hung out quite a few times. In the process, I've learned he's extremely unsatisfied in his marriage. They want completely different things in life, opposite personalities, not to mention he kind of rushed into the marriage. Right now, she lives extremely far away, so they aren't seeing each other. Every time we hang out I get increasingly more suspicious that he likes me. The fact that he's married is the only thing that keeps me from being 100% certain he likes me. He keeps asking me to go out after work, and eventually, I end up saying yes. On one hand, he's a co-worker and a potential connection for the future, and suddenly cutting it off could have consequences (especially if we work together in the future). Plus, it's nice to be treated to food, and I know for a fact I'm safe when I'm with him (let's just say this is a hypothetical condition). Also, like I said, he is a nice person to talk to, especially when I'm alone here otherwise. But to be clear, I have no intention of pursuing anything with a married man. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for continuing to go out with him. Obviously if I were in his wife's situation, I wouldn't like me at all. But I don't consider what I'm doing to be stringing him along since 1) I'm so many years his junior and think that'd be a huge assumption considering the work situation we're in, 2) I've specified many times I consider him a friend. Am I in the wrong for continuing to go out with him?

Tldr; AITA for continuing to go out with an unhappily married man with romantic feelings for me for free food and company?

EDIT: I described my work as an internship, but to clarify a bit more, it's a research internship. The 27M is a graduate student, and I am an undergraduate student. He is not a formal mentor of any kind. I'm trying not to give too many incriminating details, but I'm curious to see if this makes a difference. Also, I think a lot of people are taking my Tldr; more seriously than intended. It's my sarcastic way of describing the situation 😅",117,88,0.82

706,Not the A-hole,"So I've always been pretty close with my cousin, and when we were younger we spent a lot of time together (we live far away from eachother but we always managed to make for eachother). My cousin is autistic and suffers with Asperger's (don't ask me details about how condition because ive never really asked for full details).
Anyways, recently I've started to become more and more cold to him.

He always asks me about personal stuff I'm not open to talking about (like my personal kinks and sexuality) and when we were younger (I'm a couple years younger but we're both adults at this moment) he used to show me anime porn and honestly I was too young to know and I was just happy to spend time with him, but now being sent weird hentai photos just makes me feel so slimy.

And he always talks to me about his problems with depression and anxiety and loneliness and h
that's fine! But everytime I try to offer a solution or suggest something (like talking to a trained professional) he always brushes off any of my advice and then comes back a few weeks later.

And he's always been real physical, and I don't really mind because I am too, but he sometimes talks about like wanting to brush a girls hair and wanting to brush mine and I just really don't know how to feel about those situations.

To clarify I really do care about him, and I want what's best for him, but I'm a bit of a walking mat when it comes to my feelings so I don't know how to approach the situation and I'm always scared I'll say the wrong thing and trigger him. I also know his mental illnesses affect how he sees the world and that he probably doesn't realise what he's doing is making me uncomfortable, but ultimately I've started ignoring his messages or being really dry over text and I'm scared that I'm just doing worse.

707,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory on mobile warning. 

TL;DR at the bottom.

Backstory - Me (20m) and my sister (20) are twins but are completely different people, is long as I can remember shes always been the super sporty social butterfly and sort of the golden child out of us, I on the other hand am  somewhat sporty and a pretty big nerd, I have trouble making new friends and not into the party scene as much as my sister.

As I said before my sister is basically the golden child and I'm always being compared to her by my parents, they say things like ""you should be more social like your sister"" or my personal favourite ""why cant you be more like your sister?"" How fun. Because of this, it makes it easy for my sister bully me which she does relentlessly.

A week ago I confronted her about her behavior and she brushed me off, telling me to ""man up"" and ""if you were a real soldier you'd man the f**k up"" (I'm in the army) and I'd be lying if I said it didnt hurt me, I then told my parents what she said and because shes the golden child they took here side and that hurt more than ever, I calmly told them both and my sister to go f**k themselves, packed my stuff and left, sent my parents and sister a text telling them not to contact me again and have since received half asses apologies along with texts saying things like ""come on it's not a big deal, just come home"" and stuff like that, my sister on the other hand seems to he kind of regretful? But I'm not giving any of them the time of day, I put up with it for pretty much my whole life and I'm done...

So Reddit, AITA here?

TL;DR: twin sister bullies me relentlessly with back up from my parents, I confront them and they tell me to ""man up"" so i move out and flat out refuse to talk to them.

Edit: removed a word and spelling.

Edit 2: thanks for all the kind words and advice, I appreciate it and it really means a lot, just to clear a few things up, I do plan on reconnecting with my sister and maybe my parents in the future but for now I'm focusing on myself and my life in the army, I'm also seeing the army psychologist about my years of bottled up emotions and it's going great so far.

&#x200B;

My mom, dad, and daughter were in the car. I was driving. My mom is my daughter's favorite person in the world and copies her every move. However, she's only 2 (and a half). As we were waiting at a red light, a young woman was walking on the sidewalk. She wore a floral shirt that showed her midriff, a miniskirt, and high wedges. We did not interact with her in any way.

&#x200B;

My mom: ""That girl has no class and no education.""

My dad: (no response)

Me: ""What? You don't even know her.""

My mom: ""I can tell by what she's wearing. Classy women don't wear things like that.""

Me: ""What she wears has no bearing on her education or background. You don't know if she had class in the morning and is now going out with her friends.""

My mom: ""She has no taste in clothes.""

Me: ""You know nothing about her. She might just like that style. She might not be able to afford fancier styles. She might be trying out new styles. You don't know.""

My mom: ""I had no money growing up. I would never wear that. Maybe something like that, but not THAT trash.""

Me: ""What she wears has no impact on you and is none of your business.""

My mom: ""You can tell she has no class by how she walks!""

Me: ""She's wearing high heels. Maybe she's been in them all day.""

My dad: ""The sidewalk is uneven. That can't be easy to walk on.""

My mom: ""Classy girls know how to walk in heels and they don't walk like that.""

Me: ""The point is, you don't know her. You don't know anything about her. There's no reason for you to make any comment about her or what kind of person she is. It's none of your business.""

My mom: ""I was just making an observation.""

Me: ""A completely unnecessary one. Do not make rude, unnecessary comments about other people in front of your granddaughter. She loves you and looks up to you. Mind your own business and don't put down other people, especially young women that you do not know.""

&#x200B;

I don't usually confront my mom about these things, but I remember how I felt when she would say these things when I was growing up and it wasn't a good feeling. My mom feels like I was being critical and unfair. My dad is uncomfortable being in the middle. My husband is annoyed that I *just had to say something.* My daughter shows no indication of remembering any of this conversation and seems to have come out unscathed.

Thank you in advance for your judgment.

&#x200B;

Edit (24 hours later): Thank you, everyone, for your judgment and for sharing your insights and experiences. To those who grew up with parents or relatives who spoke similarly and those who have been the target of such speech - I'm so sorry you had to go through that and am proud of you for being aware of the harm that this behavior can create and for striving to change the narrative. I acknowledge that confronting my mom is not an ideal situation and makes everyone uncomfortable. If I had waited to speak with her privately, I would have rationalized the behavior and chickened out - something that I have done time and time again. As a mom, there are certain rare opportunities that present themselves as ""teachable moments"" and this was good practice. I am grateful for the validation and encouragement that you have given me. It is not always easy to do the right thing and it is definitely not easy to be a good parent - in fact, it can be SO hard (and she's ONLY TWO!). My parents are good people and have raised me to be genuine, kind, and compassionate. In fact, my parents are the ones that remind me that we are continually growing up and learning. My mom might need a little guidance in the area of self-reflection and awareness, and I hope that I can help her with that. Thank you for giving me the courage to continue speaking up and setting an example for the kind of person I'd want my kids to become. As a new-ish mom, surrounded by people - strangers or not - who are continually judging other moms for our missteps - perceived or not - THANK YOU.",124,522,0.94
711,Not the A-hole,"First off I’ve never met my father, he was never present in my life and I don’t have any hardships about that. I function fine without him and have never had an overwhelming need to meet him, though it would be nice to have known him. 

At the start of this year I got a message from my grandma (my fathers mothers). she basically said she was sorry that she wasn’t in our lives and that our father is with her and he misses us. Now this was kind of a shock, me and my brother had met our grandma before but she never mentioned our dad. I was quite upset because none of us knew where my dad was and to find out he had been in the same country was kind of disheartening (we thought he was abroad for awhile).

So my dilemma is my grandma keeps messaging about us meeting and frankly I don’t want to if I don’t see my dad first. My grandma is a very selfish woman who only thinks about herself, in the message she sent she talked non-stop about herself and only mention briefly about my dad, not only that but she keeps covering for him. She goes on about how it wasn’t his fault that he hasn’t seen us because he feels too guilty,  and that now is not the time for him to meet us because he’s too scared. 

I have told her that me and my brother do not hold any grudges against her or him and that all we want to do is have a relationship with our father that we never had, she responded with “Your asking too much”

712,Not the A-hole,"I recently got a kitten, I’ve had cats and dogs in the past but it’s been a few years so I was pretty happy about it. She’s about 2 months at this point. 

I have 2 cousins who visit my grandmother and I regularly, one is 10 and the other 12. They have a cat of their own who they neglect and in my opinion treat poorly. That already had me anxious but I chose to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

I ask that my grandma and them keep the door to the bathroom and her room closed as there’s places where she can get out and I don’t want to worry about her getting out. This for whatever reason is impossible, it’s been 3 weeks and even upon many many reminders, they leave the doors open and on at least 2 occasions I’ve had to intercept my kitten from getting outside. 

Moreover, despite me telling them how to hold her, they continue to not support her lower half when picking her up and putting a lot of pressure on her rib cage. 

Finally, she’s well into her playful stage wherein she like to bite toes, fingers and anything she can, as well as climbing on whoever can. Of course when they go to pick her up she then tries to climb on them and they complain about the scratches they get even though I told them that if was going to happen. And I don’t mean they cry, I mean they just complain and roughly, and on a few occasions violently throw/shove her away when this happens. 

I’d finally had enough and told them that they’re not allowed to interact with her unless she interacts with them first and even then if they are on thin ice as no animal deserve to be treated like that. They’re are spiteful though and make an point to mess with her when I’m in another room.

714,Not the A-hole,"I got married last year after dating Liam for about five years. His wife died about ten years ago, they were married for a very long time and had two kids. Naturally, they bought a house together and raised their kids there. Beth, his former wife and a lovely woman, died after a tragic accident, leaving Liam and their kids. With the boys growing Liam moved into the city I was living in and bought a little apartment but kept his house. He didn't start taking me up to his house until we had been together for about two and a half years. It's preserved in the way it was when Beth was the Queen of the Castle, her photos everywhere, her decorating style, her clothes still in the closets. I don't begrudge this. I think they should keep her things. The boys were young when she died and her death was a huge loss for them. I don't mind her things, although, I won't lie, it does make me feel like a trespasser. I feel like I'm intruding on her space.

&#x200B;

I'm getting close to retirement and I'd like a house somewhere where I can get away from the city to relax. Liam suggested we use his home. I very gently suggested that if we're going to use his house that maybe I could redecorate just a little bit so I feel at home. He shut me down, said it was for the sake of his boys that he leaves the house exactly as it is. Okay, I said, and explained to him why it just wouldn't work for me to live in ""her house"". I tried explaining that I'm not mad or jealous, but don't I have the right to feel comfortable in my own home? So I suggested we buy another house and we would keep his house for the boys. Again, I was shut down. He said he has a perfectly good house and we should use it.

&#x200B;

Once again I explained that if I'm going to live there I need to at least integrate some of myself into it because, as it is right now, I'm uncomfortable. I mean, we don't even sleep in the master bedroom because that was their bed. But again, I understand, but I want somewhere of my own as well.

&#x200B;

So I went and bought my own home in the same town with the intent that Liam and I would share it. It's not a huge house and not very expensive but it's mine. I was up front about it when I bought it but lately he's been kind of pissy about the whole thing and refuses to stay in the house with me. He'll come over but he won't sleep over. So if I want to share a bed with my husband I have to go to ""his house"". Meanwhile, I'm all alone at ""our house"". Hell, even his boys have slept over at my house before, but that was probably for my mean Sunday Pancakes.

&#x200B;

I'm curious, AITA here?

ETA: a few quick additions. His boys were 12 and 10 when Beth died so they are indeed grown now, and they've taken my side in this situation. I'm still rather young, in my forties, but a very smart business decision has ensure I can afford to retire within a year or two, after which Liam and I would like to have IVF or adopt a child, but I refuse to bring a child into this situation until the housing situation is taken care of. I don't think this is why Liam is refusing to budge though, because he was suggesting we start seeing doctors just last week and has even been suggesting names. I've suggested marriage counseling but he stopped going to therapy after four sessions when Beth died so I doubt I'll be able to get him back in. I'm willing to try everything before I consider divorce. Other than this major issue he's been an amazing partner.",129,566,0.97

717,Not the A-hole,"Throughout high school, I have put in all of my effort into my school work. I've missed out on nearly all social events to study instead, and I graduated valedictorian of my class and got in to my top choice university. **I completely understand that this type of studying is not meant for everyone and I don't think anyone should be forced to do this.** The problem with this is that my parents set their expectations up very high for both me and my sister, who is one grade below me.

My sister does not like studying that much, and when she first entered high school as a freshman, it was pretty hard for her to be compared to me by all her teachers. She got caught cheating on her tests twice, leveled down on her classes, and got average grades. Towards the end of freshman year, she wouldn't even study unless if I helped her. It was a heavy burden for me to finish my homework, study for my tests, and then go and sit down with my sister to go over her homework with her.

This whole thing continued on until my senior year of high school, where I had to apply to colleges and she had to start preparing for the SATs. What they made me do which I was highly uncomfortable with was tell me that I had to retake my SAT even though I already had a near-perfect score just so I could sit next to my sister during *her* SAT so that 1. She would be calmer, and 2. **so that she could ask me to tell her the right answers during the breaks**. I felt like I was putting my whole career at risk, but I did it.

Last year, when I was applying for this job, my whole family was in a different country, so I prepared for it by myself. Well today, she comes up to me an hour before her interview and says that she needs an outfit and her makeup done. Then, she asks me, ""Do I need to have a resume?"" and I'm like ""wait you didn't make one?"" So I hurriedly make her resume for her and drive over to the library and print it out. She tells me she doesn't even know where the interview is, so I drive her up there and drop her off just minutes before it starts. I'm pretty annoyed now but it's my sister and I decide to just let it go. Ten minutes later she walks out the interview and tells me that it went horrible. I ask her why and she says that when my boss came to interview her, she asked ""how old are you?"" (he's a young guy) when he asked if she had any questions for him.

729,Not the A-hole,"Really horrible situation. I live in a densely populated major city. A family around the corner from me left their door open and their little dog ran between 2 parked cars, into the street and right under my wheel just as I was pulling away from the curb. I was still in 1st gear- going all of 5 miles/ hr- tried to stop but it was too late. I jumped out of the car to see if I could save it, maybe get it to the vet, the dog took 2 breaths and died right in front of me. 

The child of the family (\~10 years old?) came running down the sidewalk, I guess she had been chasing the dog when it ran into the street. No leash, my neighbors nearby heard us both crying and came out and told me they often leave the door open and the dog has gotten out in the past as well. The parents didn't come out to check for another 10 minutes, I waited with the kid the whole time. I am devastated that this tragedy occurred, even more so because the kid was outside and saw it. A day later, I am going out to my car and the dad comes over and asks me for money to buy a new dog for the family. I told him I'm really sorry, I can't help. I feel terrible but the dog should have been on a leash/ supervised. Little kid is standing there sobbing so I feel even worse. AITA?",85,385,0.95
730,Asshole,"My daughter Rachael and her boyfriend, Justin are both 17. Our family is really close with Justin’s and we’ve known each other for 13 years now. He’s practically family to us and she sleeps over a lot. Now we’re not stupid, we know Justin and Rachael have been sexually active with each other. So my husband and I have had the talk and put Rachael on birth control. I don’t particularly like that Rachael is sexually at her age, but raging hormones at that age can’t be controlled all that well, so my husband and I did what we could.

About two weeks ago my husband and I went on a conference. We were supposed to be back after 3 days, but unfortunately due to some natural events the conference was cut short a day. The drive from the conference place to our home is only a few hours so we didn’t tell Rachael we were coming home early. We arrived at our house and heard noises coming from upstairs. We went up to see what was up and saw Justin and Rachael in bed with another girl. They saw us and after an awkward few moments I told them to get dressed and come downstairs. 

The other girl, Ashley is a friend of Rachael’s, but not a really close one. I don’t know her too well. We sent Ashley and Justin home and questioned Rachael. Rachael came out and told us that she was bisexual and wanted to experiment and Justin went along with it. It wasn’t the first time they had a threesome with Ashley and they had also done it with another girl before. After the talk my husband called Justin’s parents to tell them what happened. I’m pretty livid I’m not going to lie. It was hard enough to deal with the fact that my daughter was sexually active, but now she’s having threesomes? Like what the fuck? 

I want to tell her it’s not acceptable and morally wrong. I want to punish her to some extent to really reinforce that point. However my husband tells me that if we tell her it’s wrong and punish her it’s only going to alienate her from us. He doesn’t like what’s happening either, but tells me the only thing we can do is support her. Especially because she might be vulnerable as she just came out of the closet and not particularly on her own. Am I the asshole if I try and punish her over this?",1393,1890,0.85
731,Not the A-hole,"I lived in campus housing for my first two years of school- freshman year in a dorm with one person and sophomore year in a four bedroom apartment with three other people. For the apartment, we all kind of pitched in on kitchen/bathroom/living room stuff. I brought an entire pots/pans set and some cooking utensils along with a few other kitchen items as well as the TV. 

As the semester came to a close, I had to move out. I didn’t absolutely hate my roommates, but they were not easy to live with. I was the odd one out and just got thrown into the living situation. They would go out and party most nights and come back and wake me up at 2 am even when I had an 8 am class the next day. One of them drunkenly spilled an entire glass of water on my laptop while I was in the middle of writing a paper during finals (thankfully the apple store could revive it, but I still had to trek across campus to rewrite the paper). Only two of them actually did their sections of the chore chart that we all agreed on. There was rotten food on the floor that they would refuse to clean up and there were always dirty dishes in the sink. I rarely even got to use my TV because they were usually watching something, and one of them ruined one of my pans that I had bought.

When I finally found an apartment with a lease starting a few weeks before the official move out date, I jumped at the opportunity. I told the one I was closest to that I was moving because I really didn’t speak with the others and they were gone the weekend I moved out. One of my friends helped me move and we took all my stuff with me including the pots and pans and TV. Last I heard of them, they were upset that I had taken my stuff with me because they used it too, but I feel like I had a right to considering I had bought them with my own money and was going to be using them in my apartment. I promised to come back during move out to help clean, and when I did, they were all gone and had left the whole apartment to me to clean. I only cleaned my room, the bathroom, kitchen, and living room to the best I could, but there were wall damages, stains, burnt and stuck food on the ground and oven, and hair dye/fake tan in the shower and bathroom that no bleach/magic eraser/cleaning agent could get rid of. I didn’t clean their rooms, but I’m pretty sure we were all charged with a cleaning fee.

So, AITA for taking my stuff with me, even when they were still probably going to use it the last few weeks and then leaving some of the apartment dirty at move out? I feel like I had a right to take my things and I really tried my best cleaning, but it’s gnawing away at me and I feel so bad and am scared they’re going to spread rumors about me or be mad at me next year.

733,Not the A-hole,"My daughter (16) surprised me last week with a nose piercing. I was shocked when I saw it and I told her to take it out, but she kept arguing about how it was so small and she should be able to keep it in. We were going at it for a while, and then her dad broke us up, sending her to her room. After calming down, I went to talk to her again, and I realized I could barely see the piercing, so I said it was fine for her to keep it.

&#x200B;

Well, today, I came across her fake ID in her room. I wasn't snooping; I was putting her clean laundry away. She's been busted before for smoking and drinking, and now I know how she got cigarettes and alcohol, so I approached her about it, and she begged me not to ground her because, according to her, she wasn't using the fake ID for cigarettes and alcohol, she ""only used it for the nose piercing."" Well, after hearing that, it suddenly made sense, she's underage, she shouldn't have been allowed to get a nose piercing without a parent's permission, and I got upset about her piercing all over again and made her take it out. She was upset about it, claiming that I couldn't do that since I already gave her permission to have it, but I was very reluctant to give her permission, and that was before I knew she used a fake ID to get it. I basically told her that either she takes it out or I take it out, and she finally took it out.

&#x200B;

She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since, and my husband thinks I was being petty, but I feel like if I let her keep her piercing, I'd be condoning her breaking the law. AITA?",507,2366,0.96

736,Not the A-hole,"I hired my best friend to fill an open spot at work, let’s just call him TJ. TJ had very little experience but we had collectively discussed that our goal was to get him trained for this open job to become a career. 

Essentially TJ was in training to transition from a warehouse job to learning the profession of import / export freight forwarding. At first TJ was really excited about the opportunity and would do things like jot down notes and put in extra time to help around the office. A year later I feel like TJ is squandering the opportunity I have created for him. My role is as the operations manager so I have to make sure things are getting done. This past week TJ refused a job assignment by refusing to come in on Sunday. This is a rotational process so he only has to do it once every 4 months. His reasoning for refusing was because he had a flag football event. Normally we would try to accommodate this request and work around it but this week anyone that could cover for him was on vacation. 

This morning I got a text from TJ saying he couldn’t make it in because he lost his wallet and wanted to report all his stuff missing. I asked if he could take the morning off and at least come help us sometime that afternoon but he refused this request as well. I don’t think the wallet story checks out because it doesn’t take all day to fix that situation and normally TJ would be all over any request we had for help. 

Reasons why TJ could be mad: 
He still has a hybrid warehouse / office roll meaning he splits his time 50/50.
Because TJ refused to come into work and his shit attitude latterly I suspended him from work without pay for 1 week. I’m hoping it’s a wake up call for him. He used all his 5 sick days already so he couldn’t call off anymore. He told me he couldn’t come in Sunday because he couldn’t let his (football) team down but I don’t understand why he doesent t see he’s letting his work team down and using up all the good will he’s built up.

739,Not the A-hole,"My wife has a friend, let's go in alphabetical order for names.

So my wife has a friend named Amy, and Amy has two sons.

My wife knew that Amy had dealt with bedbugs in her old home but had gotten rid of them, supposedly, then she got them in her new home, apparently they were not all gone. 

Amy never disclosed this active infestation to my wife or me. 

Amy asked if she could crash out our place for a couple of nights due to reasons which are not important to this discussion.

We talked and agreed that she and her boys could stay here for a couple of nights. 

They brought pillows, a blanket each, and a couple of baskets of clothes to wash, when they got here they dropped everything on the couch and we sat them down and made them some dinner. 

They stayed a couple of nights and left.

Then I found a bump on my leg one night, over the next few nights I found more and more, I thought I was going crazy, then my wife got a couple and our kids got some as well. 

During this time they came over 3 or 4 more times, each time bringing clothes, backpacks, a game system to hook up to the TV to stay entertained etc.

One night sitting on the couch I felt a movement on my arm, looked down and saw a bug, a few minutes of googling and I discover this is a bed bug and that the bites we have had are consistent with bedbug bites. 

Around this time we started seeing tiny roaches as well. Turns out to be from the game system.

I confronted Amy. 

She admitted that they had an active infestation at her current home, including both bed bugs and roaches but that it was being handled by an exterminator. 

The problem is that we now have an active infestation, we have never had roaches or bed bugs before. 

So I call a few exterminator companies, they come out and investigate and the bedbugs have taken hold, they are in every room of the home including the basement and attic and we will need full remediation, one of them was very thorough and even moved furniture including our heavy couch and showed me a massive infestation and said ""this looks like where they started given how many are here"".

He gave us advice such as using a vacuum to suck them up and clean them out etc but said we would absolutely need service.

The service is going to cost us 2900 dollars. 

I am the only one working and we barely make ends meet as it is, we cannot afford 2900 dollars. 

So I told my wife Amy needs to pay for the exterminator, she brought over infested materials without telling us, if she had told us we could have taken precautions to prevent infesting us but she didn't. 

Now we are infested and I think she needs to pay to fix the issue, she doesn't, my wife doesn't and somehow I am the asshole for being upset about being afraid to sleep in my own home or sit on my own furniture since apparently the bugs love me and I am covered in welts from them.

741,Not the A-hole,"Posting for the bride. 

I'm having a destination wedding. There are 5 bridesmaids, one of whom, who we can call Becca, has a very young toddler child. She is the only person in the wedding party with a kid. The entire time, we talked about the week leading up to the wedding being a sort of ""girls only"" week. Becca is about 14 weeks pregnant, so she was fine with being a DD for us. We figured that since she's married to the father of her child, that she would leave them home with them. We thought she would want time to not be ""on"" as a mother.

Low and behold, who steps out of the plane this morning? Becca and her child. She says that her husband will ""fly in the night before the wedding"" and that she ""wanted the time to bond with [kid's name] before the new baby"". We were salty. 

We still need a DD, so suddenly we have a baby accompanying all of the bachelorette plans. We have no idea how we're going to alter our plans. Uber isn't a thing here, and as it's a foreign country where we largely don't speak the language, getting a babysitter isn't an option. 

Becca doesn't see the issue as she ""has the car seat"" for a rental car and ""has to be sober anyway"". I'm NOT okay with having wild nights where a baby is present. I don't know that I could let anyone else get sloppy drunk either. we now can't go to strip clubs unless they're extremely sketchy enough to let a CHILD in. We can't go to many bars. Ugh!

Becca completely ruined the bachelorette week, and I don't think I'm wrong to be furious about this. She's usually a good mother and was before this my most loyal friend who would move mountains to help out. But apparently she just has a massive gap in logical thinking that I didn't realize.

AITA?

Edit for more infuriating detail: the rental car is more like a small bus. Only two people can drive stick. Becca is still nursing, but the child is 14 months old. This is a rental villa. WE DO NOT HAVE A CONCIERGE.

**UPDATE**
We are going to split the driving more between the two that can drive and keep most of the partying at home. So Becca and the groomsman will split the day/sightseeing driving, and Becca will do the night driving. We've looked it up and apparently in Europe it's totally fine for kids of any age to be in bars, so we're just going to be THOSE people. We're going to keep the heavier drinking to the villa, and are only going partying/clubbing one night, which Becca will do the driving for. There's a park and a 24 hour diner she can be in.

**TL;DR**: Becca won this round regardless of who's the A. We aren't willing to be the bigger A, so we're calming the party and focusing on practical tasks.",536,739,0.94

743,Asshole,"Son got himself a girlfriend about 6/7 months ago, I have no complaints about the girl, she's nice enough. He brought her home to meet me and my wife, everything was fine. My issue with it is that 2 weeks ago he announced that he would ask her to marry him. I thought to myself that he just had this plan for the future but he informed us that he wants to do it by next month.

My wife was over the moon with the news but I wasn't in the least. I told him that I don't believe this will work because they barely know each other, not only that but they're completely opposites. The girl is outgoing and charismatic while my son barely has enough friends, she makes him look like a dead weight not to mention that she's completely out of his league. Of course he got mad at this and so did my wife.

Now I found out that he won't be visiting us anymore and my wife has decided by herself that she will be visiting him instead. I don't see how it was wrong for me to give my opinion, it was just that, an opinion. I'm not going to get in the way of him marrying the girl.

751,Not the A-hole,"So I just read a post that made me think of this incident from a few months back, and I’m curious if ITA on this one. I needed to buy groceries one night, but I had had a really long day at work. So rather than walk down the street to the grocery store (literally a block away) I decided to just order them off Amazon, which is supposed to (and usually does) deliver directly to your front door. I have even put directions in the delivery notes section explaining exactly how to work the buzzer and get to my apartment in the building (it’s not hard).

I live in a rather large apartment building that’s shaped like an L, so it’s a bit of a trek to get to my apartment’s actual door. I can also see the main entrance where we buzz people in because of my apartment’s placement in the building.

So I’m chilling at my kitchen table, playing on my phone and get a notification that my groceries are almost here. I then see a car pull up in front, check my phone, and confirm it’s probably the delivery driver. I can see him checking his phone and looking at the building. He sits there for a minute or two and then starts calling on his phone. I get a call from the Amazon number.

He tells me that he has tried the buzzer several times, it’s not working and he wants me to come meet him at the door to take my groceries. I’m annoyed, since I saw him pull up and know very well that he didn’t, but I feign surprise, ask him to try my boyfriends buzzer number (it goes to our cell phones) and call me back if it doesn’t work. He tries to get me to come down to meet him several more times, then finally agrees in a clearly annoyed tone.

I then watch him just sit in his car for another 2-3 minutes doing nothing, at which point he tries to call again. I’m pissed now, since I figure he is just being lazy and the whole point of ordering the groceries (and having to pay tip) was that I didn’t want to leave my apartment. So  I just ignore the call. He tries calling 8 more times and I refuse to pick up. I decide I’m not picking up until he gets out of his car and actually tries the buzzer.

Instead, he leaves an angry voicemail and drives off, marking my groceries as “undeliverable.” I immediately call Amazon customer service, explain that he sat in his car and never even tried to deliver them, and insist on a full refund, including the tip. They agree.

I didn’t know his age or anything but he looked mature and we hit it off. We had the same personality and likes and dislikes and he’s super cool. During out first shift together, he brought up that he is ready to get out of Highschool and I asked him what grade and he’s a junior. I didn’t really care and we moved on and the whole shift was fun, relaxing, and we had a good time just chatting in the down time. 

But here’s where things hit the fan. We both were into video games and he liked Call of Duty and so did I. I have friends that play with me plus my girlfriend also plays with us. So last night we were all playing and O hit me up and asked if I wanted to play. I said sure let me ask my friends and I asked and they said sure because we needed one more person to have a full party. He joins and we play for awhile and everything is going well. 

But then my girlfriend asks where he goes to college and he says “oh I’m a junior at _____” we all live in the same town and we all knew the high school.

She asks me not to and tells me she'll just give me thirty bucks to cover it but no thanks.  It's bot just about the money it's about the principal these things wouldn't have held up at all at home.  She pleads with me and I tell her to just relax but she follows me anyways.  I try to warn her to back off and she wont and we're beginning to cause a seen because she wont leave me alone.  

&#x200B;

We finally get to the artist and I demand my money back and give him the pieces I could recover.  He fucking chuckles at me and says no and basically tells me to fuck off.  I throw one of the pieces at his foot so he can see his shanty coasters are crap.  He tells me to leave, but not without my thirty.  I end up calling the police because it's basically fraud.  He knowingly sold me something defective.  The cops asked if he could just give me my money and be done with it - which he did, because he knows he was in the wrong.  My girlfriend has barely texted me these last couple days and I suspect it's because of this but I genuinely can't understand how I'm in the wrong here.  AITA?",507,706,0.81

760,Not the A-hole,"I am a 20 y/o girl. I am in Japan on exchange with some friends of mine. Most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. She was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. Currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

Anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men’s section and women’s section.

My friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

She asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, “Thanks for your concern.” In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it. They both thought it was none of my business. I explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that I’m just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

They avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. There were some looks but not as bad as if she didn’t wear a towel.

I apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said I meant no disrespect. But she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that I am transphobic, although I do not believe that I am. AITA?",643,17758,0.91

764,Not the A-hole,"We’re both 18. Me and her (I’ll call her A) have known each other since 7th grade and have been best friends through all of high school. We’re SUPER close and we’ve been through a ton of shit together that’s solidified our friendship throughout the years. Anyways...
Having known A since we were both 12, I knew her before she opened up to me about her dysphoria (she’s mtf). I have no doubt in my mind that A is trans and I support her 100%, but I’m really concerned that she’s rushing into things too fast.
A has a tendency to be really impulsive. She’s aware of it, but I don’t think she really understands how it affects her decision-making. Both of us struggle with depression and anxiety and I’m currently seeing a counselor for mine, but whenever I suggest therapy to her she says “but I’m feeling better now” and goes through another relapse after a few weeks. I’ve been depressed my whole life and I know it’s a chronic thing with ups and downs, and that it doesn’t just go away like that. A just recently moved out of her unsupportive parents’ house and has started wearing more feminine clothes in public, and wants to start HRT soon. It’s her body and her decision what she wants to do, but as her best friend and girlfriend, I feel obligated to tell her if I think she’s making a dangerous decision. I’m not trans, but I think with any kind of drastic change to your body you should learn to love yourself first on the inside. She agrees with me on that, but every time she says she’s feeling better she has a relapse. I really don’t think she’s better yet.
I really just want her to be happy. Estrogen has permanent affects on the body and I’m scared she’s not in the right mental state yet to handle it. She just moved houses, got a new wardrobe, and publicly case out as trans within the same month (although she’s known she’s trans for years, I don’t doubt her on that). I’m really protective of my friends and I’m worried I’m being too overbearing. It’s her decision and I’ll respect whatever she decides to do, but I just feel like it’s too soon and a counselor could give her a better opinion on it than I could. 
So... thoughts? Am I being a bad girlfriend to A? Should I lay off? I just really want her to be happy.",131,119,0.87

767,Not the A-hole,"So I work in retail and generally think of myself as a considerate customer. I finished my shift, went to another location to buy [item] my store didn't have in stock, and decided to grab dinner at a decent looking Japanese restaurant nearby.

As I sit down I ordered a drink, and ~5 mins later it turns up with menus. I wasn't in a rush so whatever. After a couple (max 5) minutes I'm ready to order and try to catch the eye of anyone walking by (Australia so the whole tipping culture isn't as big here). After 20 minutes I'm sitting with an empty glass and not having ordered, and decide I'll leave in 10 if I can't order.

After 10 minutes I'm still trying to catch the eye of any staff, not exactly yelling ""OI SERVICE PLEASE"" but definitely trying to make eye contact and do a little polite wave to ask them over. During this time there are staff standing by, but not looking at customers. This means I can't even get my check. I set a timer for 5 minutes and say I'll walk out if they keep ignoring me.

My timer comes up, so I stand up , gather my bags, and slowly leave. I'm a huge human, 2m tall, so I'm hard to miss, and they weren't understaffed.

I still feel shitty for walking out on my bill even though I tried to pay, because my attempts were service based, not proactive. That said, if I billed for the time I spent sitting there being ignored, the time is worth more than my drink.

You get the idea. He also disparage other members of the LGTBQ community in general, which he knows I am very active in. 

It was relentless, so much so that it got to the point that I will not visit SB when he is around. She usually comes to our place. 

SB knows I dislike him (I made it very clear), and she knows I'll support her if she decides to leave him, but she keeps saying WE'RE so excited to get an invite, implying that my partner and I are willing to welcome him at the wedding which, frankly, we're not.

Through out our relationship and marriage there has been one or two times when I did not go. I did not care that he went with out me that did not bother me whats so ever. 
This year i told him i will not be going as i need to save time at work for when we have our child. We have a almost 2 year old and one on the way. He said fine but said i should keep our son at home. I had an issue with this because its a family vacation, why arent you brining your child. He said he would like to enjoy himself and doesnt want to ask anyone in his family to watch the baby while they are on this family vacation. Thats my first issue. 
I had a backup plan. To which my mother had agreed to help out and watch the baby and stay with me while I am 31 weeks pregnant with some complication. Thats was all good and fine until my mother and i had a fight to which she said she wants no part of my life because my husband is in it.

So it comes time for the trip and me,my baby,and my husband all fall ill. Im am very very easily sick and get sick hard. I beg him not to go, to stay because he will be leaving his sick wife alone with his sick baby with no help. He left for vacation with his family, i am beyond pissed at him.

770,Asshole,"Throwaway just to be on the safe side. I’m a creature of habit and I frequent a few different restaurants regularly. At one of these places a few weeks ago, I was sat near the area where the waiters commune. I don’t have any sort of issue with them interacting and having fun and all, but this time I heard one of the servers, a young woman who I’ve been served by many times and has worked here for quite a while (more on that later) saying some not so nice things about one of her tables. She was apparently annoyed by them and made this clear by making fun of them with some choice words. I didn’t catch anyone else saying anything rude, but they did laugh. I was appalled, and I let the manager, who knows me well as I’m a regular, who said she’d deal with it promptly. 

I’ve been there a handful of times since and hadn’t seen her, so yesterday when I was there I casually asked my waiter about her and he informed me she’d been fired. My friend who was with me at the time, after hearing the story, told me I was an asshole that cost this girl her job. She said that having worked as a waitress herself, this is a common and harmless way of blowing off steam, that most servers do it but no one would dream of intentionally being rude to a customer directly. I disagree, these people are paying you essentially, it’s reprehensible to talk badly behind their backs and then turn around and play nice. Moreover, as I said this girl had worked there 2+ years, i doubt they would fire her over just this. There had to be something else.

774,Everyone Sucks,"So I'm not really a photographer, but my fulltime job allows me a lot of free time so I offer free photography sessions to help me get out into nature and share my hobby with people who get a nice little photo album as a gift for spending their time with me.

I was contacted by a community even planner if I was willing to take pictures for his event in another town. I said sure as long as my travel and accommodation was paid for along with food, to which he agreed. This took place on my two weeks off, so missing work wasn't an issue for me, the event only lasted 4 days. Everything went great, I took lots of pictures, met lots of wonderful people and just generally had a good time.

When I returned home I was confronted by another aspiring photographer. We can call her AP from here on out. AP messages me on Facebook, saying I stole one of her usual contracts (I was asked to take this job which I was paid for in a free room and free food) and told me she lost $5000 for that contract. I don't get money for my services but I had a great time and would like the opportunity to go on another trip like that again, which according to the event planner seems very likely.

So reddit would I be the asshole if I continued offering free photography sessions for an organization that another photographer has previously worked with?

Edit 1: After reading all the comments I understand that I'm not an asshole if I continue offering my services for free, but I wont continue enabling the company anymore than I already have.

My girlfriend and I just bought our first house in a quiet neighborhood where the houses are very close together and most of the people living there don't seem to mind it at all. We made a point so say hello to all of our new neighbors and build a friendly rapport - this is our first house and we really want to be good neighbors.

Our neighbors on both sides turned out to be really nice! We get along well and talk often. They both offer to help us move and give us advice and tips for places to eat around here - all that stuff. Offer to have us over for BBQs. They're nice people. 

Anyways, the fences on both sides of our backyard are very short, about 4 feet tall. During one of our conversations, one of the neighbors mentioned that she was offended, maybe even a little mad, that the person the other side of her backyard put up a taller privacy fence. Here's the thing: I like our neighbors, but they are always in their backyards. I just want to be able to hang out in peace without having to act a certain way and say hello and talk to my neighbors for 15 minutes every time I go out there. I want our backyard to be a private space for us to hang out and do our thing. Maybe I wanna act a little weird without being self conscious. 

That said, I want to plant lots of bushes and trees along the outside of the backyard to get some privacy. I believe I'm the first person to do this. If you were a cynic, you might be inclined to call it ""blocking them out"".

Prior to becoming a father, he struggled for years with heroin addiction and wound up in some pretty serious legal trouble, including several felonies. As addiction runs in our family, I make a point to give my children (seven and four) accurate, honest information on drugs and let them know they're facing a genetic predisposition toward addiction. They have asked who suffers from addiction in our family, and I mentioned Jack (there are many others, but Jack is the only one my children have met as the others are still using). We talked about how he's a good person and how proud we are that he's maintained his sobriety for so many years, but that he spent some time in jail and struggles to find work still. Fast forward to today when I got an irate phone call from my sister-in-law. Apparently my younger child told my nine-year-old niece that her father had been in jail. My niece had no idea and argued that he was lying. Apparently her parents had never told her. Now my brother and his family are all livid with me. I tried apologizing and explaining that I was only trying to make them aware of our family's issues. I would have had similar discussions if we had a tendency toward obesity or diabetes.

EDIT: Okay, so I suck here. I already apologized profusely to my brother and his wife, but I can certainly do that again.

On mobile so I apologize if this is horribly written, I’m just feeling conflicted and need the roast of reddit to find out if I am in fact an asshole here. 

SO, little background for context. I live in a complex and I’m very friendly with my neighbours. if I’m outside I never mind if someone walks by and stops for a chat, because I live in a open style neighbourhood and there’s often other humans around existing n such. 

On the end of my row is the family of the daughter, they are slightly annoying but nice enough. Theres the mom, bf, daughter(approximately 9-11 years old) and son. Bf is very clearly into drugs, idk about mom tbh she’s just strange so who knows. ANYWAY, their daughter has stopped by the backyard here and there for chats and it’s never been an issue until this week. She has been coming to my house and ringing my doorbell (which is super annoying I have small dogs and they bark a lot lol chihuahua probz) to ask if I wanna hangout or if she can come inside etc. I politely asked her to stop because i didn’t like my doorbell being rang and that if I’m inside I’m doing my own thing but she’s always welcome to stop by when I’m already outside. Asked if she understood, she said yes and went on her way. 

Cut to today. I was sleeping, and she rang my doorbell upwards of 10x until I got up and answered my door. She asked to come in and hangout. Now I’m already not a morning person and I get esp irritated if I’m woken up abruptly (ie: doorbell, dogs barking) and I end up sternly telling her to straight up STOP and not come by that I do not like this and it’s not okay and I don’t want her bothering me. 
I feel bad for being kinda harsh and I’m wondering if she wanted to be at my house instead of home cause of the bf? but that’s nothing I can just assume she seems perfectly happy and taken care of so I really don’t know but she didn’t get it when I was nice about it?? 

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

Edit#1: thanks for the help first and foremost!! I’m going out back now, hoping she’s around to have a chit chat about why she would want to hangout with a whole ass adult lady and see if there’s anything deeper at hand.

Edit#2: After having a good talk with her and explaining my boundaries and why I was stern with her I feel a lot better! She’s truly a sweet kid and i didn’t like snapping at her how I did, she’s very smart and seemed to understand exactly where I was coming from!  I also talked to a few other neighbours and its the general consensus that she’s just a really social little girl, I also found out she has either ADD or ADHD according to another neighbour whom she has taken a liking to as well! Thankfully its nothing sinister and just a harmless kid being a kid! I did talk to her mom as well and asked that she makes sure that the kiddo doesn’t ring my bell anymore and just pops by if I’m out already! OH and the druggy bf was kicked to the curb about two months ago! Woo! 
Thanks to everyone for the help with this as I was in such a weird spot and didn’t know how to handle it! Y’all are awesome 💖",26,131,0.93
787,No A-holes here,"*reposted with proper title*

Recently, I had an aunt who passed away. She was 84. My grandmother and her other siblings have been understandably sad and consoling toward each other. It’s been nice to witness that. Now personally, I have just never been all that close to my family.  We don’t really have a lot in common, and I’ve just generally isolated myself from them. 

After my aunt passed away, though, it reinforced the feeling I’ve been having of wanting to be closer to at least my own generation of the family.  I think it would be nice if we had relationships that were close enough to let us be there for each other when there’s things like death in the family, child birth, graduations, and all the other events that pop up in life.  I’ve reached out to a few cousins of mine, and they want me to go to church with them more often. Now, as I said, I’m an atheist, and my family is well known in the community for being very religious. Them being religious isn’t that big a deal for me, but it’d be a huge deal if they found out I am an atheist. At present, only my SO and best friends really know about it, as well as my youngest sister (though she doesn’t really care one way or another). 

As a result, I’ve been thinking of just keeping it to myself and trying to enjoy the time spent together with family that I’d be experiencing. But I can’t really shake the feeling that this is deceptive and wrong. AITA? 

As a side note: I’ve only been an atheist for four years or so. I’m 28 now. I’d be a more or less devout Christian before that, and there was even a time where some older family members, like my grandmother and some uncles, expected me to become a pastor. Being able to be considerate and respectful in a church setting would be the easiest thing for me.",42,29,0.85
788,Not the A-hole,"I live with another guy and a couple. Rent started on the 1st of June. I was due to move in on the 15th but my plans changed and I came back early to learn someone was staying in my room. The girl in the couple asked me if this was okay and I said yes if I wss compensated in cash or beers. No reply to that so I had guessed they'd disagreed to that.

When I got that the girl staying in my room said nothing to me nor did she pack her stuff up and leave after I was there for 2 hours. I wanted to move my stuff in and get organised I got pissed off and didn't want to cause a bad atmosphere as soon as I got there so I left to a friends house. I got back later that evening and the room was left in a bit of a state.

Then my friend went back home and someone else moved into his room. Not sure if he knew or not. He, at the moment, is at a festival and another of their friends has taken up that spot. Plus they have 4 friends who live in vans who are basically living at the flat using the kitchen/shower/washing machine has been on all day today. I should mention bills are included in the rent. I also had to wait about an hour and a half until the kitchen was free as they were making a big breakfast. Also they used a tiny amount of my olive oil. Not really a big deal but I thought I'd mention. I also thought they might cook me breakfast as they were staying at my place. They offered me a coffee which I accepted and showed gratitude for. Not sure how it took quite so long for them to cook the rest of it. It's my day off and usually when I try and put a wash through but it juts hasn't been available. Neither of them have given any financial contribution to the house that I know of.

It's getting on my nerves but not sure if I'm being a bad friend by saying this but I'm not keen for other people to be free loading in the house the whole time. I dont really like hanging out at home with people I don't know. I expect a minimum of getting the beers in as that's what I've done when I have stayed round friends houses.

She says that it doesn’t count because she was already making my dad sleep in a separate room. On top of that she spent 11,000$ of my 13,000$ college fund on dresses and shoes and shit. 

She has bipolar and has recently took herself of her meds in favor of “all organic vitamin supplements” she is trying to force the keto diet on me and my dad while constantly having cheat days. Her mental instability has reached the point where she will believe everything any video with no sources tells her. She is antivax and antimed. She is also fighting to get me off of all my meds. This includes the depression meds that she caused me to need as well as my adhd and add meds. 

She currently lives 3 hours away and demands that I drive with her out there every other weekend. She would make it every weekend if I didn’t fight her about that subject. She always says that she doesn’t get enough time with me but I think that if she wanted to see me all the time she shouldn’t have screwed up our lives. Recently as I have grown more and more independent, I have begun to resist going to her house and have begun to tell her how I feel. Because she constantly attacks my dad out of the blue for “trying to keep me away from her”, I have told her on many occasions that I am the one trying to keep me away from her.

791,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway to avoid pettiness.

I'm leaving a city I've lived in for most of my life for an extended period of time to a different country, and I'm planning a going away party to say good-bye (or see you later) to the people who have made my time here memorable. I'm renting a very small room and my parents' house is further away so I decided to make the party a going-away potluck at a public park. Doing so at a public park requires that I get a permit, and the permit specified no alcohol.

I relayed this message to the people I invited, and I also suggested bar hopping after the picnic so as not to be a complete killjoy. Most of the guests were understanding, but others reacted differently. These people told me that that was stupid and they were going to bring flasks anyway and be subtle about it. I want to gather my friends together one last time before I leave and for people explicitly tell me they weren't going to listen to this simple request makes me feel very disrespected. I enjoy drinking but I feel like there's a time and place for that and that time and place is not 3 pm at a public park, especially when the permit I have explicitly does not allow it. I'm thinking about telling these people that if they don't want spend time with me for a few hours without alcohol then to just not come at all. 

I know it's not the biggest issue, and I don't want this to get in the way of goodbyes, but I really do feel like their insistence is unnecessary and disrespectful. AITA?

792,Asshole,"There’s a paint and sip (wine) event happening at my apartment complex with a limited attendance of 15 people. I’m an abstract artist, and I paint just about everyday. So, I signed up thinking it’d be a fun way to meet some neighbors and do something I enjoy.

What I didn’t realize is that these types of events usually have an “instructor” or presenter who guides the group through painting a very specific pre-determined image. I signed up for the event before actually seeing the promotional material for it, and today I finally saw a flier for the event. It showed a picture of what we’d be painting... and I am not a fan of it. It’s just not my kind of art, and not something I’d enjoy painting. No shame on those who do like the style and the piece.

Would it be rude for me to attend and do my own thing? I’m usually good at navigating these situations, but because I don’t know my neighbors yet and I’ve never been to a paint and sip event, I’m worried that my actions could come across in a bad way.

TL;DR - The title says it all.

Edit: I realize now a lot of these paint and sip events are classes and instructional sessions. This community event is not promoted that way at all. No mention of a class or instruction. Or even instructor. That’s why I signed up initially. Seeing a flier later with a pre-determined image was a surprise because it didn’t seem to line up with how they talked about the event in other places.

Edit2: Several people have commented about how the event is limited to 15 people... for additional context, I signed up 3-4 days after sign-ups opened and I thought it was going to be full already. To my surprise, only 6 other people had signed up. So I don’t think I’m going to be at risk of taking a spot that someone else would use better.

Edit 3: Thanks to everyone for the advice and ideas! My plan is to go to the event and paint an abstraction of the thing everyone else is painting. So basically I’ll be painting with the group, but in my style and discipline.",241,554,0.92
793,Not the A-hole,"I was due in for surgery today. I waited for hours before being told that they’d had an emergency and couldn’t get me into a theatre. I’ve been offered the chance to have it on Wednesday, pushing someone else back.

1.) My surgery is non-essential and could feasibly take place at any point- my condition won’t worsen with time. 
2.) While MY surgery is not urgent, the procedure I’m having is also offered to cancer patients
3.) I’ve travelled to a different country to have this procedure done, and my parents have to drive/pay for hotels/miss work etc. Any delays would exacerbate these inconveniences.

796,Asshole,"UPDATE: I talked to Grandpa. Comments on that at the bottom of the post.

ORIGINAL POST:
About three or four times a week around 7am, the kid across the street shouts a conversation with his playfriend next door. Usually it’s an extended conversation about today’s events and when they can get together and play. These shout fests can last up to 20 minutes and don’t normally end up with any kind of conclusion. Just a long, strung out babble fest about (for example) “basketball practice being at 2” and wether or not they can play when he gets back. They never seem to end. Especially when the other siblings join in.  Just a long series of questions about the other’s ability to play sometime later that day. 

My bedroom faces the kids house. And as he megaphones to his little girlfriend across the street, he wakes my ass up way too early in the morning to function. I’m a late riser, and when I wake up by being bitch slapped with a run-on sentence being shouted at someone in the general direction of my window, I wake up ready to punctuate. 

These kids have no problem crossing the street. They do it all the time. So why do they need to shout an entire conversation across the street at each other at 7am?

AITA if I confront one of the parents and ask them to take control of Megaphone Matt and Supersonic Sally in the morning hours? Or better yet, all the time? Because seriously, I’m tired of getting rocked out of bed with the announcements about basketball practice conflicting with your afternoon play schedule. You’re 8 dude. Don’t your parents have those text machines they can use for the same purpose? There’s really nothing so important about your life that you have to broadcast it to the sleeping neighbors. Least of all, your daily unwavering schedule, same as you announced last week. I know enough about this kid’s schedule that I could pinch hit as a soccer mom. But his choice of bouncing the bear out of bed by making his proclamations in the early AM has me more inclined to come down on him (or his do-nothing father) like a pallet of bricks. 

On one hand, kids will be kids. On the other, poor parenting makes horrible neighbors. AITA?

Update detail: Thanks for the feedback. A few answers for you. 
- I work from home with late hours and frequent road trips. They are taxing sometimes I sleep in after a trip. 
- Walkie talkies sounds like a good idea at face value. But, the girl living next door is only 4. Too young to put her in direct contact with an 8yo boy without the parent’s buy in? IDK. 
- I talked to the person taking care of them this morning, politely. But my mistake I thought it was the dad. It wasn’t. It was grandpa who I never met. That can go either way I think. We shall see tomorrow. 
- I haven’t looked at ordinance. I’m leaning strictly on respect here. So for those of you who suggest that 7am is legal therefore suck it up, you’re right. Technically. But, that’s truly no way to treat a neighbor now is it?",361,1383,0.92
797,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr - I recently noticed a pattern that I seem to follow where I call in sick on my period because I'm having flu-like symptoms.  My boss didn't care when he thought it was because I was suffering the flu, but now is annoyed that it's because I'm suffering from bad period symptoms.

&#x200B;

As the title says, I've been calling in sick on my period.  I didn't realize that this was a pattern until recently when I reviewed my history of missing work due to sick days and noticed that they all coincide with the first three days of my period.  I had always thought that I was just prone to the flu since the symptoms are very flu-like (Nausea, clamminess, cold sweats, mild fever, headache, feeling generally weak/sore).  I get the typical cramps and things too, but they pale in comparison to the more flu-like ones.

&#x200B;

After I noticed this pattern I didn't think much of it.  My thought process is basically:

* if I'm feeling like garbage and won't be productive it shouldn't matter that it's related to my cycle.
* I work in a government job with 1.25 sick days a month so I should be able to use it when I feel bad.
* I'm not super worried about accumulating sick days in case I get really sick sue to the multitude of fall backs that I have (emergency fund of 10K+, life insurance, assurances from my individual parents that they will take care of me)

&#x200B;

My boss recently noticed as well and jokingly inquired if it had to do with PMS.  When I said, ""Actually, yeah."" he quickly turned sour and told me I can't do that, that sick days are only for when you're sick, and I should take unpaid vacation instead.

&#x200B;

To be clear, I haven't been obscuring the fact that I'm on my period. I always state that I feel sick with the least amount of detail necessary to get the point across, and I'm not trying to get my period days off by pretending to have the flu.

&#x200B;

So, AITA?

798,Not the A-hole,"Every week, I take my week's worth of breakfast snacks for me to eat on a daily basis. My fraps, my box of twinkies, or whatever I have for that week. My coworkers have made it a habit of sometimes taking from my stash as if they were communal snacks rather than for myself. 

Sometimes we have ""events"" where we're asked to bring something for a small party, say for instance, a pot luck. I usually bring a dessert my wife made, like cake or cookies or pie or whatnot. They usually devour them and absolutely adore my wife's desserts and always ask to bring more whenever I can.

There are days that sometimes my wife makes extra desserts and I bring her ""extras"" or practice runs to work. These are specifically for the co-workers. They get all excited saying ""Oh wow, it looks so delicious"" and so on and so forth, but then, completely forget about them. 

Instead, I find out later that they ate my breakfast snacks. Snacks that I was counting on for the rest of the week or whatever. It's not everyone, and I have a few leads as to which individuals are doing all the snack-thievery, but it hurts that they opt for my own counted snacks, rather than the desserts I brought from home that they previously applauded and begged for more of.

I get upset because my wife gets upset. She works hard to make these desserts. They're usually hand made with hand-crafted buttercreams and fillings, which take hours to make from beginning to end. It stinks that they usually end up not being touched after she worked so hard on them. Instead, they go for my own snacks, which I count on for my breakfast pick-me-up.

My family doesn't know this but I think  they notice i don't eat much. I lost some weight, I'm regularly going to gym and stuff.

 So back to today, I stuffed some pasta to my plate because I was hungy after swimming. My aunt said ""Look at OP's plate she's really on a diet."" And I told her that I don't like her making comments on almost everything I ate and asked her to not do that. She sarcastically told me she's sorry.

I walk in to make a coffee to find out that they are both talking really quietly, when they both see me, the conversation stops and they carry on doing stuff trying to look busy. I carry on and make myself a coffee and sit back down and don't bring this up until the evening at home.

When I say ""home"", We have literally been in our own place since the day before our wedding (traditional wishes and all that). We enjoy our time at home and it is still very new to us and exciting.

817,Asshole,"So a little background for this. My wife and I decided we wanted to have our first kid recently and we've been discussing things we want to do during the pregnancy to make it easier for both of us and so we have a plan of sorts. We aren't pregnant yet but this topic came up last night as we were talking about things.

She asked me who I wanted in the delivery room. I told her I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with anyone other than just me and her. It's our first kid and I want to be the only one to share it with her since this is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. She then told me that she wanted to have her mother (my MIL) in the delivery room because she wants someone who has been through this before to help her get through it. 

When she said this it kind of hurt a bit because it felt like she was saying I wasn't going to be enough support for her, which I know isn't what she meant, but it still stung a bit. 

I reiterated that I wanted to be able to be the only one to share holding our firstborn with her and only her and that I don't even want my parents in the room and that I want family to just be able to visit in recovery. 

She then brought up that her brother-in-law wouldn't let any family in the hospital when their first child was born and her mother was pretty upset about it. I'm not trying to be like that I feel like seeing my wife in the recovery room after the delivery is more than fair. 

And just before anyone thinks I'm a bit naive on what birth looks like and how you feel after, I know it's going to be a totally disgusting and horrible procedure and my wife will probably crap all over the table in the process. This is just one scenario where I want to be a little selfish and have a few minutes alone with my wife and my future child and not have to worry about sharing it with anyone else. 

So Reddit, AITA?


Edit: I just want to clarify a few things. First of all, thanks for the responses, it's really helping me know how to proceed and go about this situation when it becomes and actual decision for us.

To clarify, I'm not forcing my wife to choose between me and her mother being in the delivery room. If my wife truly wants her in there and it's not just so she can make her (MIL) feel better about what my wife's BIL did and so she can feel included, then I'm fine with my MIL being there.

And for heaven's sake. Is it really so horrible that I don't think pushing a human out of your vagina is beautiful. She's likely going to crap on the table and she'll be sweaty and in pain. Giving birth to a person is a noble and very commendable thing to do. I can think certain things are disgusting and leave it at that. I really don't think that makes me TA just because I said birth is kind of disgusting.",277,362,0.9
818,Not the A-hole,"I was in a departement store, minding my own business. And a woman stops me, she looks in a huge distress. She was searching for her children. I helped her to find them, everything is good but, during the search, we had  a bit of chat, and in her mind (i suppose) i became a ""good person"". So out of the blue, she leave her children with me, because she needs to do some stuff in the departement store, asking me if i can watch them. I had the time to say nothing and she was gone.I was stuck with some kids, during a pretty long period of time. I couldn't bring myself to leave them. When she returned, i explained with her, saying that i didn't want to babysit, and i was nice to not ask for money. (she left during \~1 H).She thrown a massive tantrum, and fuck off, i decide to leave her.

One week later (yesterday), she was here again, again in a huge distress. She saw me and asked me to look with her for the children. I refuse, and she was furious.All the employees present give me passive-aggressive reactions, eyerolls and stuff. I told this story to my family/friends, and it was 50/50. Some says i should look after one more time.So Reedit People AITA ?

EDIT : Thanks you a lot for the NTA ! I am kind of worry for her children now, i do hope she found them. But, when i think, when she returned for her children, she was all blush and stuff like that, i had the thought she was seeing someone. But it's just my mind so, nothing sure. She had three children, the youngest seems to have 3 and the oldest 6. (forgot to mention my bad).

822,Not the A-hole,"My wife’s grandmother passed away a couple weeks ago. I don’t know much about her finances or the content of the will, but her assets are being divided between my mother-in-law and her brother. These assets include a small home, which will be sold, and a small economical sedan, which is about 8 years old. 
At some point my MIL asked my wife if we were interested in taking the car “for free or for a nominal amount of money”. My wife said she thought this would be “about $1,000”. We are currently a 1-car household, and, coincidentally, our car is the exact same year and model as the one being offered. The difference is that Grandma’s car has very low mileage and is (reportedly) in great shape while our car has a lot of miles and needs some work. While this is not the kind of car we would buy if we wanted a new car (We’d get something bigger), this could serve as a replacement for our car should it break down. 
After brief consideration, we told her MIL that we were interested, but details needed to be discussed after the funeral. No one else in my wife’s family expressed interest in the car, and if we said no, the car would be sold.

A little backstory: a few years ago, my car was starting to show its age, and I decided to get rid of it. Rather than deal with the hassle of selling it, I decided to offer it for free to my MIL’s boyfriend, who is a car guy and whose son needed a car. Ultimately, the son decided the car wasn’t for him, and my MIL’s boyfriend sold the car for cheap. We split the proceeds 50/50 and called it a day.

Now the funeral is over, and my MIL tells my wife that she wants us to give her $3,000 for the car. She says that this is a great deal as the car is in excellent shape and the Kelly Blue Book value is “$11,000” . I just checked KBB, and they are actually valuing the car closer to $5,000. Also, no one has actually inspected the car and can verify it’s condition. We just know that grandma didn’t drive it much. 
I told my wife that for that price, we are not interested. The car might be worth a bit more than $3,000, but I doubt anyone is going to want to buy it for that much sight-unseen. If we had $3,000 and wanted to buy a car, we probably wouldn’t buy this one.

I told my wife to tell her mom that we weren’t interested in spending that much money on a car right now, and that she would be better off selling the car and splitting the money with her brother. Essentially our response is, “No, thank you”. My wife feels uncomfortable telling her mother “no”. She thinks her mother will be upset by this, and that we should just go ahead and take it for $3,000. I’m upset that my MIL seems to of forgotten that when I had a spare used vehicle, I gave it to her boyfriend practically for free. 
So...am I the asshole here for not wanting to buy this car from my mother-in-law?

TLDR: MIL inherited a car and wants to sell it to us for about $3,000. I think that price is too much, but my wife doesn’t feel comfortable saying “no”.",16,27,0.88

When the delivery man came to the door he was pleasant and was being very complimentary about my home, asking about the furniture etc, a perfectly normal interaction. Then he starts asking other questions that made me slightly uncomfortable like ‘do you live here alone?’ ‘Are you always home all day yourself, don’t you get bored?’ ‘What do you do to amuse yourself during the day?’ I answered his questions curtly saying that I live with my partner and he’s out just now and I avoided the other, weird, questions. 

Then he asks if he can use my toilet. I felt really awkward at this point and I said no, I didn’t feel comfortable with it. To be honest, at this point I just wanted him out the house.

828,Not the A-hole,"Short and sweet-

We went to the beach and everyone I came with was wearing shorts and t-shirt, I had my bikini under mine so I don't think they knew before hand that I would bring one nor did I know they wouldn't. We got out and I undressed on the beach excited to swim. Everyone gave me side eyes but carried on to the water. I stayed behind to unpack the stuff with SO's mother and SIL. SIL looks me up and down and says "" Is that what you're wearing?"" and I said ""Yeah, I wanted to swim too"" laughing. She gives me a weird look and says ""Around kids?"" I was hella confused so I just said ""Yeah, is that weird?"" She responds ""Well I wouldn't wear that, I don't dress like that around kids"" I said ""Oh sorry""  we look at each other for a sec before she says ""Well, what are you gonna do about it?"" SO's mum was about as confused as I was at this point. I said ""Swim?"" and she asks me to put my clothes back on before going around her children and to never dress like that around her kids. I didn't really want to swim at this point so I said ""I don't really have a change of clothes but I guess I can stay on the beach"" So I watched everyone swim while I was ruminating on what just happened. Still confused, hella confused. I thought wearing a bikini at the beach was normal?

AITA?


EDIT FAM: So to keep it easier to read and all that I'm just gonna give a quick Q&A instead of a story type thing yk?

Q: What bikini were you wearing?
A: Just a normal two piece. No butt showing and not too much cleavage.

Q: Where was SO?
A: He was swimming when it happened and after about 10mins of me sitting on the beach he came over and asked why I wasn't swimming. I told him I didn't feel too comfortable swimming anymore and I'll tell him why later. He told me to stop being ridiculous and I said something about not ruining the day so we talked later at home, he comforted me and told me that if SIL says anything of that kind again to get him straight away to deal with it.

Q: What was everyone else wearing?
A: Everyone else was either in t-shirt or shorts, some men were in just shorts. We were on a public beach but away from any of the other swimmers, so it was just us then.

Q: Why didn't MIL say anything?
A: Well tbh we both don't get along with the SIL and so we both kinda just learned to stay out of her way since when she's challenged she spins stories to her husband and he believes her and immediately defends her, sometimes a little too strongly. Also we were both stunned by her response which will probably explain as well why we both didn't say much.

To clarify, there were 14 of us at the beach, 7 kids 7 adults. No one in a bikini but me. SO's family were religious when he was young but haven't gone to church for years except of course his SIL who still attends. Only she had a problem.

830,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my partner Reddits.

My wife recently had to move back home to take care of her mother - unfortunately her mother passed away but she stayed as found herself a decent job and a decent apartment - at the moment we're doing the long distance thing before I move at the end of September.

She made friends with another lady living on another floor (lets all her Amy)
Amy suffers from severe anxiety, I suspect agoraphobia, host of other physical issues and may even be bi-polar. She suffered a lot of trauma when she was younger due to her abusive family and rely's on her father to help pay her bills and she gets an assortment of disability benefits.

Amy's apartment is a mess is an understatement - she literally cannot turn off the lights when she sleeps because of the amount of roaches in her apartment, broken appliances and no way of really cooking. 

My wife's the kind of person who will try to find a way to help a person in need.
They slowly became good friends and slowly starting helping her out like, helping her take out her trash, help her clean her apartment, get an exterminator to get rid of the roaches, help her grocery shop. To the point now my wife cooks for her three times a week.

There were times where my wife would literally cry because she felt so bad for Amy and that she really never has anyone to turn to.

By all means there have been times Amy has helped my wife.

But Amy never really grew up - she acts a like a child and pouts when she doesn't get her way.

However recently, my wife started floating the idea that if Amy could move in with us (Amy would pay rent) we'd be able to get a much larger place and my wife would be able to get paid by the state of take care of Amy. 

I haven't told my wife anything just yet - but I have no intention of taking care of a grown woman like she was our child.

This happened a while ago, but I was curious to know what everyone else's opinion is on the matter.

I went on a huge camping trip with a lot of people from my high school, but my ex-girlfriend didn't come on the trip for personal reasons. At that point, we'd been dating for nearly a year. A lot of my best friends were there and they often joked about how my girlfriend and I hadn't had sex yet, as I was one of the last people in my friend group. However, I had never put any pressure on my ex-gf to do anything she didn't want, and I always tried to make sure she was comfortable with anything sexual we did.

On the camping trip, I was quietly talking to one of my bros about it, and I casually joked that my girlfriend would probably have sex when she was 30. Obviously, I didn't mean this offensively and neither did I want to tell anyone that I made that joke. It was just between my friend and me.

However, one of my ex-gf's friends was on the trip and overheard us talking, and promptly told her as soon as we were back from the trip. With barely any communication, my girlfriend immediately broke up with me and refused to talk to me ever again. I tried to communicate with her and tried to tell her that it was a mistake, but she pretty much cut off contact with me for a solid six months.

I realized that it's wrong to say stuff about her behind her back, and I genuinely felt that I shouldn't have said that. I tried to communicate with her about that and about how I felt, but she refused to talk to me.

836,Not the A-hole,"So my life has been turned completely upside down over the last few weeks. For the record, I am 21 and my brother (28) just passed away.

Up until a few years ago my brother was living at home with me. He put all of his savings speculating on cryptocurrency when Bitcoin was around $300 and ended up selling out just before the peak. He owned lots of Bitcoin along with other coins he told me about. I don't know how much he made originally, but it was probably in the 5-10M range.

Anyway, shortly after cashing out my brother moved out and we heard less and less of him. A few weeks ago we found out he had passed away after using crystal meth. Obviously this was a massive shock as the brother I knew never did drugs, other than occasionally smoking cannabis.

To cut a long story short, surprisingly he had a will despite his age, and left almost everything to me. This includes a house worth 800K+ and almost 4M in cash/stock.

The dispute is between me and his ex-wife. He has two kids with his ex-wife and didn't leave her anything. He put $500K into a trust to be paid to his kids (split 50/50) when they turn 30, but that's it. He never saw his kids because his ex-wife wouldn't let him, so I guess that's why he left most of everything to me?

Anyway, kind of rambling here, the point is that I don't plan on sharing any of this with his ex-wife. In my opinion, the 500K he left his kids in a trust is more than enough to give them a very comfortable life. He left me the rest of his money and I intend to spend all of it on myself and my future kids.

Parents think I should at least give the house to his ex-wife so that my niece/nephew have a stable home life. Ex-wife obviously wants as much as I'm willing to give. He didn't leave our youngest brother (16) anything, but I intend to pay for all of his college etc so that he at least receives something.

838,Asshole,"FINAL UPDATE:
I couldn’t respond to every comment I got but I definitely listened to your feedback. A couple people recommended going out to a bakery or somewhere and have a gentle conversation, so I did, and it went really, really well.

I took her out to lunch to her favorite casual sit down restaurant and we just talked a bit. The conversation started out normal, but slowly turned towards our sexualities and our coming out. She asked me when I realized I was gay and how, and I answered that I kind of just always knew I liked girls, and when I found out about the LGBT community I knew that was a label I could put onto myself. Then, I asked her the same question. She sat quietly for a minute or so and then told me that she wasn’t sure if she was completely a lesbian or not. She said that she never really thought about the idea of dating girls until I came out (again, we are both in a sheltered Catholic household), and realized she might want to try to date a girl in the future. We then had a discussion about bisexuality/pansexuality, and just being curious and exploring your sexuality. She told me that she didn’t really know those labels existed, and felt that she might be bisexual, because she knows she likes boys but is very curious about dating girls. She had no idea you could like both, and is very happy knowing there is a label that fits her. When I asked about her breaking up with her boyfriend, she told me when she realized she might like girls she thought that meant she couldn’t like boys anymore, so she broke up with him. I let her know that was absolutely not true, and she decided to talk to him again after our lunch and possibly get back together with him. 

We were both a bit emotional at the end because it was a really deep touching talk, and I decided to gently ask her why she sometimes copies things I do when she previously would have never done them, and she started crying. I freaked out because I thought I made her upset, but she broke down and told me that she always was trying to change herself to be more like me because she thought that if we were too different, I wouldn’t like her anymore. That broke my heart, and I let her know that I love her so much and I want her to be herself and flourish as her own person. I told her that she can do whatever makes her happy, and I will always love her for who she is. We joked around a bit about her not having to force herself to choke down mushrooms any more, then the bill came, we paid, and left. 

I really feel like we left that restaurant closer than when we came in, and I’m super glad I had this talk with her. Thank you all for your feedback and opinions!

EDIT: My title definitely came off harsher than I meant it to be. I was never planning on flat out telling her she isn’t gay or anything close to that. I wouldn’t be “calling her out”, just asking questions like “when did you realize you were a lesbian”, “what made you decide to come out now”, etc. If she tells me she truly believes she’s a lesbian, of course I am going to support her and love her. I was never trying to sound like I was gatekeeping or anything. Sorry for the confusion.
 
EDIT 2: I think I’m going to go out to lunch with her tomorrow and gently bring up the topic. I’ll update tomorrow after our conversation and lunch. 

A little backstory before I start- I’m a lesbian and have known since the 7th grade (when I figured out gay was a thing- I was a sheltered kid), but have been attracted to girls long before I gave myself a label. I always had crushes on girls throughout elementary school, all my fictional crushes were girls, etc. I have been dating my current girlfriend for almost 2 years now (I’m a senior in high school), and I finally decided to come out to my family a week ago. I was worried because they’re super catholic, but they actually accepted me with open arms and it feels amazing to be out. 

Now, onto the situation. My younger sister by 4 years has always copied me, since we were little kids. If I decided my favorite color was blue, hers was too, even though she just painted her room pink after it being her favorite color for a long time. If I decided my favorite pizza topping was mushrooms, hers was too even if she despised mushrooms for years. It was kind of annoying, but mostly petty little things like that so I never brought it up. But since I came out a week ago, she’s now come out too, saying she’s a lesbian as well. 

Now, I would be fine with that and just have thought “oh, she probably just feels safe being able to come out now that she knows our parents are accepting”, if not for this one reason. She’s had multiple conversations with me about boys she likes, and was even dating a boy for a few months but broke up with him the day she came out. I really don’t believe she’s gay, and don’t want her to have to fake a sexuality and make herself unhappy to be like me. 

So, WIBTA if I pulled her to the side and talked to her about it? I just want to ask if it’s just coincidental or if she’s doing it to be like me. If she still insists she’s gay, I’ll drop it, I’m not going to hound her over it. I’m just having heavy doubts and want to make sure she’s being herself, and not making choices because she wants to be a mini-me.",192,641,0.93
839,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. 

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. 

TL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own. Now he's sick and wants forgiveness but I still hold him responsible for the hellish experience I had in the system.",43,37,0.91

   Fast forward to when I get off work, (stopping off to do a free haircut for a family member) we're so hungry everything sounds good to eat, but we decide on a place near by. I've ordered from before, and always got the full order, even with special instructions.

So, I place the order through UE, and its expected at about 30-40 minutes later, and about 40 minutes go by, and I'm watching this guy drive back and forth on the wrong road, so I contact him, he calls me and argues he's where he should be, and I'm wrong.
I explain I'm out front, and he's definitely not where he is supposed to be, according to the UE map, and me standing out there seeing no one.
   Skip forward 20 minutes, he's still ignoring my directions. 
    Finally, he finally  just uses Google maps,( as I suggested before) and I meet him out on the street, and he gives me HALF of my order, I explain he's missing my soup, and it looks like my soup is in the second bag in his passenger seat, but he says ""no, that's my soup"".
  I tried to be nice up unto this point, but that just really peeved me off, so I took the half order, and walked back home.

   I tipped him a penny, and gave him a 1 star review, and lit him up in the comments, (I'm usually very forgiving, but his arguing, and piss poor accountability really got to me).
   He shows up half an hour later, with a ""new bag"" and said it was the restaurant's fault, not his, and tells me I need to call UE and change his rating, but that bag was the same one I saying was mine.

I had a sucpision they were together and one of my other neighbors for the past year had been telling me they were having and affair but i chose not to believe it partially because i was being ignorant and didn't want to believe but also because she is actually insane (believes trump is a lizard man or something, jewish elite run the world, illumnait etc). After i caught them my wife decided to leave us and go with my him. She just packed up her shit and left, never even apologized and didn't give a shit about our daughter. 

  
I work for the biggest bank in my country and thus make a lot of money and have a lot of power. A few months later i get notices that Devin had missed the past 3 mortgage payments. He was struggling financially because he lost his job. He did find a temporary less paying job and was able to pay around 75% of what he owed for each mortgage payment. Although it seemed likely that he would eventually be able to pay us what he owed, i am legally allowed to foreclose on his house and take everything from him, which i did. Fuck this scumbag piece of shit, he fucked my wife for the past year, broke up our marriage, caused me to go into depression and took my daughter's mom from him.

848,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I were never married, but were together for over 10 years. This doesn’t begin to cover it but- our relationship was toxic and after years of mental, emotional and on two occasions physical abuse towards me, I got a PFA and he was forced to move out. He chose to move 7 hours away. 

Our daughter is 3. We do not have a legal custody agreement. He visits her once or twice a month, I allow him to crash on the couch when he comes. They spend time together and I try to run errands etc and allow them bonding time, and we usually try to do one activity as a family. These weekends drain me, because I’m on edge the entire time- never knowing what he is going to be like. I suck it up so that our daughter has a relationship with her dad, so long has he is on his best behavior. 

From the time she was born, my ex worked out of town for 2-3 weeks at a time and when he was home for 7-10 day stretches he did not make an effort to build trust with her. Never bathed her, nor put her to bed etc. She has epic meltdowns if he tries to put her to bed etc, she has spent the night at my moms on a few occasions without issue.

Now he’s considering moving further away to help take care of his ailing parents-She is obviously too young to travel alone, and it would be cost prohibitive for him to fly here monthly. At this point, I would not be comfortable with her traveling so far away with someone she doesn’t fully trust, or that I don’t trust to properly take care of her. I’m not sure that she would willingly go with him for more than a few hours. So, he is suggesting that I take time off from work and fly myself and our daughter to visit him and his parents as often as possible. He’s suggested that my mother (who also works full time) could also come to keep me company while our daughter spends the days with him and his family.  My daughter has met his family on 3 occasions. I refused because I think it’s a ridiculous request and is asking an awful
lot of me when I feel like I have been more than accommodating to ensure he has a relationship with our daughter.  He is now angry and calling me selfish and is accusing me of trying to keep daughter from him and his family.

I'm not allowed to attend and watch them actually get married, my immediate and extended family are all Mormon, so my little sister is getting married in a Mormon temple. As soon as I found out it was a Temple wedding I tried to renew my temple recommend (you need one to get into the temple), so I sat through an interview and lied about a lot of questions (I'd be considered ""unworthy"" if I told the truth), but then I was told I'd have to pay around 15,000 of back tithing because I haven't paid in 5 years. I obviously didn't do that.

I told my sister I couldn't get a recommend and she said ""that's fine you can watch all the kids outside of the temple"" and I didn't want to at first but I agreed since it would be her wedding day. I said ""lol ok but who's going to watch them at the ring exchange after the temple"" (mormons just recently allowed having another wedding ceremony before or after the temple without waiting a year) and she said they aren't doing one anymore because Joe said it would ""steal away from the sacredness of just being sealed"". Now I have to be a bride's maid for a temple marriage (even thought have a wedding line doesn't make sense with a temple marriage), not see my little sister get married, and play babysitter in a parking lot.

I reminded her that our mom wouldn't be able to see her get married now since she was excommunicated and that she'd be devastate. Emma said that was my mom's fault and if she were worthy she'd be able to come.

851,Not the A-hole," Backstory: I was a bit of a moron in college, have a lot of student related loans, some of them are very high interest. I have a good job now, but still pay 20% of my salary to debt.

My company has a great PSP, and it allows me to take a loan against it at a much lower interest rate. I recently hit the number needed to pay off the majority of my loans if I borrow against it. In a call, I offhand told my mother I planned to do this.

A week later, my mother called me, and told me that she didn't want me taking that loan because she thought ""The way it works is that they take all interest generated on your retirement fund until you pay back the loan."" I told her I didn't think it worked that way, but she launched into her ""offer"". She told me that she was willing to loan me the money herself, with similar interest rates, on the condition that my parents wanted to work with me to make sure I was budgeting correctly.

I was concerned about this--these sorts of financial issues can lead to lots of rancor, and I've been burned in the past by allowing them to much access and then being nagged about my failings--but in their defense, I had poor financial control and probably deserved it.

Regardless, I agreed to sit down with my mother and go through my budget for the last couple of months to see ""what I could afford"" to pay back every month. We did, I didn't hold anything back, and every time my mother saw something she didn't like she'd get a little testy and go ""That's too much on dumb video games"" or whatever. I said that I knew I wasn't perfect, and what I hoped to get out of this arraignment was someone to keep me accountable and cheerlead for me. I told them I'd make a budget on Google Sheets to track my progress.

She mentioned that ""Well, it's totally possible for you to just hide stuff from us."" I told her that if she didn't trust me to not do that, then she shouldn't offer this sort of thing in the first place. After we went through the debts I had and added them all up, it was about 10% higher than the figure I'd offhand quoted to her in our first conversation.

When I called her next morning, she launched into an immediate tirade about all the things I'd done wrong over the last year, and told me I could ""snowball"" the different loans and it'd all be paid off very quickly. She then told me I had failed at not adding more debt to my situation, and finally finished by saying she wasn't going to loan me any money at all, because the additional money was ""too much"" and they'd rather just not help at all if they couldn't pay everything off at once.

I told her that I wasn't super concerned about her not loaning me any money and she kept talking about all the ways I'd messed up over the last three months. Finally I sort of realized what was going on here, and told her that I thought she'd manipulated me into revealing all my issues with a false promise of trying to ""help me out"" when in reality they just wanted to pry, and hung up.

854,Everyone Sucks,"Honestly, after voting on threads for years I never nought I'd have reason to post here (under an alias no less) but alas, here I am. Here's what happened:

My wife and I were hanging out in our backyard around a bonfire at around 10:30 p.m., having a couple of cocktails, all was well. We had our two dogs in the backyard as well, as is often the case, and suddenly heard a rustling at the end of the lot. We live in the middle of our block, our backyard is rather large compared to most on the block and I've recently learned it's a popular path for people cutting from one side of the block to the other. For the record, I don't think this is necessary as the block is, overall, pretty small/standard and you're only saving about 2 minutes of time by cutting through my yard.

Anyway, my dog bolts for this guy. He's not a large dog but he's midsized and very, very loud, and I'm sure in the black of night this scared the fuck out of this guy. I run up behind and notice the guy is like crouched/prone in a pile of brush at the edge of my yard next to the chainlink fence I heard rattling earlier. 

Our exchange is as follows:

Me: ""You know I can see you""

Him: ""Good for you."" 

\*he hops the fence back to the other side and begins running\* 

Okay, end of story, or so I thought. 

I'm mowing the lawn today and walk back where this joker had jumped the fence and find both his sunglasses and his smartphone. 

My immediate thought was that I could easily return these to the person if I wanted. His email address was right on the notification screen and, even without unlocking the device, I quickly found him on Facebook. Returning the phone and glasses would be trivial if I wanted to do so. 

My second thought (prompted by my wife and others) was that he knowingly trespassed and it's not my fault that my dog scared the ever living fuck out of him. The phone and glasses either belong to me or belong in the trash. 

Would I be an asshole for destroying the property of this person, considering the circumstances? Part of me wants to say no, he jumped a fence, ran from me, clearly knowing he was doing something wrong, fuck him, right? The other half of me says hey, I ran through random people's backyards as a late teen, no harm no foul, right? Help me settle this internal conflict. <3",37,28,0.83

857,No A-holes here,"This is my first ever actual Reddit post, so please forgive any social faux pas ><

&#x200B;

Anyways, this is an old story, but something that's been bugging me for \*years\*

&#x200B;

Back in the late '90s, I moved down to Portland, Oregon for work.  When I first got down there, I was subletting a place from a friend of the family, let's call him ""E"".  E had been a friend of my dad's since elementary school, and they were still quite close.  He was also a man of vices - a recovering alcoholic, and a not-recovering chain pipe smoker.  Both of these things relate to the story to come.

&#x200B;

So about a year after i started renting from E, his cancer came out of remission, and it was BAD.  Like 6-9 months to live bad.  As I was the only one living with him (his nearest kids lived about an hour away), I did a lot to help him out for a while - at least until things got really bad, at which point I moved out, and one of his daughters moved in to help on the last few months of his life.  All of that was fine, and made sense.

&#x200B;

So here's the AITA.  I had conflicts with his kids a lot during the months I was still there -- things like them wanting me to lie about his prognosis, and me not wanting to do it, things like that (he appreciated the honesty).  The big thing was along a similar vein though -  Like I said, E was an ex-alcoholic.  His family had staged an intervention 5-10 years before, and he'd gone along with it but was never happy.  So one day, he basically says ""Listen, I'm going to die soon and I'd really like some single-malt scotch.  Here's some money, go down to the Liquor store and buy me some <brand x>"".

&#x200B;

I was happy to do it.  To me, this was a case of ""he's dying anyways, he's not going to risk his work, maybe this will help him suffering and he can die with the things he likes"".  So, I went down, bought the required booze, brought it back, and returned his change.  When his kids found out, they were livid, and in at least one case, they've still never forgiven me - it was the end of the relationship.

&#x200B;

To them, alcohol had been the ruination of their dad, and between that and the diagnosis thing, I'd betrayed him and them.  To me, I was just helping a dying man die as painlessly and happily as he could, they weren't there, and it's not like it was going to impact his career or anything.

&#x200B;

So lay it to me straight:  AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDITED TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS:

&#x200B;

First of all thanks for the advice on the cutesy emojis, noted!

\~\~\~

To comments on how drunk he was getting.  It's a little vague how many times I made purchases, but it was certainly paced so that he was not doing more than one drink a day.  The Drink was a medium cost single malt (don't remember the brand, but it was a really strong, smokey one.   Smoking a pipe for 40 years does... terrible things to your sense of taste).  He certainly wasn't using getting shitfaced every day.

&#x200B;

Related to that, the family, from what I could tell, didn't know until I moved out.  They weren't visiting, and while it's possible he was drunk dialing them, I know of no evidence that he was acting a bad drunk to them.

&#x200B;

About his sickness:  He had bone marrow cancer that started in his hip.  They thought they had it in remission at least, but it's a tough one to beat, and it came back with a vengeance.  The prognosis his children wanted me to hide was '6 months at most to live'

&#x200B;

And then a general comment, the interesting gap in the judgements so far is between children of addicts and everyone else.  It certainly reinforces to me about why the family would be so upset.",264,1116,0.96
858,No A-holes here,"When I was 20 and my girlfriend (now wife) was 19, she became pregnant. I was in nursing school, she was working odd jobs and it just didn't seem right to raise a child at the time. We decided to adopt him out rather than terminate the pregnancy. My wife didn't want it on her conscience to terminate and I, frankly, had no say, but was vehement in not being a father at 21. She had a healthy son.

Fast forward to my late 20s and we're married, we have a home, I work in a hospital and she's a daycare manager. Between us is zero debt, and while we don't do handsomely, we live frugal and put a lot into savings. We're expecting now.

Fast-forward to now, I'm 41. We have lots in savings and have an 11 year old daughter. We've somewhat reconnected with our son who is 20. We've only really ""known"" him for about a year, and he's doing well. He's in college now for computer science and started his own jerky business. He visits once every couple of months but otherwise has his own life. He doesn't consider us his parents.

We want to get started on wills and things and my wife suggested we leave it all to our daughter. I don't know what to feel, to be honest, but I kind of agree. We don't ""know"" our son, we don't refer to him as our son (other than in this post for clarity), and he has a family who I'm sure will leave him their estate as he's an only child. My wife argues it would be unfair to our daughter otherwise.

Would we be the assholes? Obviously our son isn't in the know, nor would he be. I don't think he thinks about it. There's been no sentiment between any party involved that he's rejoining our family, he has his own. My mother (who didn't want us to adopt him out to begin with) wants us to consider him and said we're being selfish.

Backstory- I’ve had my cat for five years, meaning I had her well before moving into this house and made sure everyone was ok with it before signing the lease. My roommate decided she wanted to foster a dog a few weeks ago. Seeing as fostering is usually temporary, I agreed because my cat gets along with my mom's dog therefore I didn't think it would be an issue. Turns out she is terrified of the dog and hides in my room 24/7. Long story short my roommate ended up adopting the dog and told us after it had already been done.

I got home yesterday, my roommate was gone but the dog was in the living room. I put him in her room so that my cat could go outside of my room if she wanted to. Her dog unfortunately ripped her carpet and two pairs of her shoes to shreds. Roommate wants me to pay for a portion of the cost of the carpet because this wouldn’t have happened if I had put him in the crate. In hindsight I agree it was a careless mistake to not put him in the crate, but it didn’t cross my mind because I've never even seen her put him in the crate. When she's home she has the dog in her room with her, and when she's gone she just lets him roam around the house. I didn't realize the dog would have a problem being confided in her room.  Under different circumstances I would be more willing to contribute some money, but I’m just pissed about this dog being here so I don’t want to. AITA

Edit/info: The crate is in her room because it was provided by the humane society as they are required to give all fosters one. She was supposed to return it after adopting the dog but hasn't, which is why its in there but we haven't ever seen it being used",63,70,0.95

My ex just found out about this and is mad that I didn’t tell her. She’s trying to put a clause in our custody arrangement that we have to offer the time to the other parent before hiring a baby sitter. This was in the current agreement, but the agreement is not yet finalized and official and thus I do not need to follow it. I’m thinking now that this would affect me a lot more because I get the kids on the weekends and her weekends are free. The only time she gets a baby sitter is after school when she’s working, but I’m working too.

Backstory first. I have a boyfriend and we have a pet cat named Ricky. We also have 3 roomates, 2 of which are dating. The couple also has 2 cats and a lizzard for pets.
Lizzard is name lizzie. This will be relevant. 

So this morning I woke up and went into the living room and saw the lizards cage dismantled but the lizard was in the empty tank. I asked my male roomate whats up, and he told me my cat got into the lizards cage and messed up the tank and stressed out the lizzard. Ricky has an obsession getting into this lizard tank. The tank is very large and has a cover/lid on it. But it also has a 4 inch hole in the corner that my cat can get into. So to stop him, we put a tea pot on top of the hole, my cat is not smart enough to knock it off.  They (2 roomates that are dating) recently cleaned the tank, but forgot to put the tea pot on the hole. So when my cat jumped on the tank saw the opening, and took advantage of the situation.

My male roomate was stressed but also chill, knowing it was an accident. I asked if Ricky and lizzie were fine, which they are. No one is hurt. I thought this was the end of it. This is not the first time ricky got into lizzie tank. He has never hurt her but I wouldn't trust him alone with her. Every time he got in is because they move the tea pot and not cover the hole back up. 

Turns out my female roomate is making passive aggressive post on Facebook, messaging mutual friends if me and my boyfriend can live with them, and had a huge fight with my boyfriend on our friend group chat.

when my brother was 10, he loved a football player, so my dad brought a football from a sports store and made it look like the player had it signed and everything. We then typed up a fake letter from the player to him so it looked like it was only for him

he was elastic about it, and took it everywhere he went. we all thought it was hilarious because he believed it was actually a thing, and hoped he would laugh at when he got older.

skip a bit later, he’s 28 now, and getting married, he asked my dad where the football and letter was, and my dad started laughing and told him that they were both made up

my brother got angry at us because we “made him think his idol recognized him for a long time” and “made him look like an idiot”

are we the assholes for this? or is he overreacting over a harmless joke?",64,125,0.9
868,Asshole,"In 2017 I moved in with 2 roommates from Craigslist in their mid-20’s, Heather & Jeff. I lived with them for a little under a year. Heather was on the shyer, more reserved side and not easy to talk to, but we got along well. I moved out just over a year ago about 20 miles away, and hadn’t seen her since, though we’re still friends on Facebook.

Recently, I joined a new gym, & my second time there I was surprised to see someone who instantly recognized as Heather behind the front desk! This was surprising as she lives 20 miles away; but I was absolutely certain it was her. I said, “Hey Heather! Good to see you again.” She gave me a really funny stare and told me she’s not Heather.

Her voice sounded just like Heather’s as well. She told me her name is Maddie, and it was clear she didn’t recognize me. I walked away feeling super embarrassed and puzzled. That girl looked, sounded and acted **so** identical to Heather in every way, shape and form; to a degree that is impossible to be a simple coincidence.

I pondered things in my mind, and on my way out approached Maddie. I asked her, “Sorry if this is too personal, but I’m wondering - are you adopted by any chance?” She responded that she is, but hasn’t made any effort to find her bio family. I told her that I strongly suspect that I know her identical twin sister, and explained things to her. 

I showed a picture of Heather on my phone to her, and to my surprise she didn’t act all that impressed, just giving me a simple, “Hmmmm. Okay.” I told her that I have Heather’s #, am friends with her on Facebook, have her address and would be happy to connect them, and she responded disinterestedly, “No thanks.”

I called Heather later & explained things to her, and **she too** seemed disinterested. I found Maddie’s profile on Facebook (by searching “people who work at \[name of my gym\]”) and texted Heather photos of her. But still, she acted disinterested. I’ve met Heather’s parents & they strongly resemble her, so what I suspect is that Heather’s mom had an extra baby (Maddie) that she gave up for adoption and never told her about.

I continued going to the gym, and almost every time I went Maddie would be there. Every time I saw Heather’s exact double, it would continue to bug me. I feel like I discovered something really amazing and groundbreaking, and it’s going unappreciated.

I added Maddie on Facebook and she accepted. Maybe she didn’t know it was me, since I have the mascot for a beloved baseball team of mine instead of a picture of myself as my profile picture. Having both girls as friends, I messaged both of them into a three-way Facebook chat, finally forcing them to interact with one another.

I was promptly blocked by both of them, and don’t know how things turned out. I’m now pretty nervous to go to the gym, and am considering looking for a new one. Was I the asshole to try and reunite these girls who I’m positive are twins?",811,4950,0.93

We simply do not have any money for anything that isn’t food and bills. Dipping into our minimal savings to carry us to the first paycheck in the new job. 

My fathers side of the family was having a small reunion, of which I was unaware of. A few weeks ago he called me to chat and offered to fly us out to surprise everyone, knowing our current financial situation. We were very apprehensive because this was a big expense for anyone and we never even asked, but he insisted it would be amazing to see us and surprise the rest of the family so we agreed.

We fly out and have a great time. We stay with my aunt who is an amazingly generous person and offered her home to us so we wouldn’t have to pay for a hotel.

My wife posts on facebook (which is the bane of our existence) thanking my aunt for housing us and her mother for watching our dog. She did not publicly thank my parents for paying for our tickets, one, because it’s embarrassing to us and makes us feel uncomfortable to put that information out that we couldn’t pay for our trip. And two, we both personally thanked them IN PERSON at the reunion several times and I did again on the way to the airport for their generosity and how appreciated it was.

My fiancée and I want a child-free wedding, with the exception of our flower girl and ring bearers. There’s a growing expectation that they would be bringing the baby with them to the wedding. I’ve been to weddings with small kids and more often than not, they’re a distraction from the ceremony.

Some of you are calling me a hypocrite for the flower girl/ring bearer. That, I can partially agree with you. The soon-to-be-wife won that debate. However, these children would be in the wedding and most likely leaving for the reception.

877,Asshole,"So my child just entered high-school, and now requires a PC for school work. I bought my child a fairly nice PC, so my child can continue using this PC even in university and ultimately saves money in the long run.

I'm fully aware that with the new access to computers/internet, there would be inevitable distractions like gaming etc, so I laid some ground rules.

1. My child may only play games 30 minutes everyday, weekends is 1 hour per day.
2. My child may only play games **after** my child has completed my child's daily tasks (incl doing homework etc).
3. In addition, my child have free time **after** my child has completed the daily tasks until my child sleeps. However, during this free time, my child may only play 30 minutes of videogames (refer back to rule 1), the rest of the free time my child must do something other than videogames.

I also told my child that, if my child breaks any of these rules, I may cut off my child's internet access or take away my child's PC, depending on the severity of the offence, and whether it is first-time or repeated offence.

Just to make it official, we even made a contract and signed it.

To no one's surprise, I caught my child playing videogames when my child was supposed to be doing homework. Punishment? No internet for a week. If my child requires internet for school, my child will need to use my computer, and under my supervision.

My wife told me that my punishment is too harsh, and ""children will be children"". She feel like since this is a first offence, only warning will be suffice. My argument is that, I had made it absolutely clear of the punishments etc when I first bought my child the PC. Also, one week no internet is hardly that bad.

AITA?

EDIT: After all the comments, I realized that I should not have to control my child (gender neutral, its funny how you guys assume I have a son). 

So instead, I'm replacing my child's PC with a cheap chromebook, enough for school. This way, my child can't play games anyways and I don't have to monitor my child, which is taking a toll on me as well.",565,330,0.74
878,No A-holes here," 

This is kind of light, but I am genuinely perplexed by the way this whole thing unfolded, and that kind of worries me. I'm really concerned at the possibility that if I'm this puzzled by these people's reactions, it could be reflective of some deeply ingrained assholery in my personality. This could be elevated stage assholism I'm dealing with here, and I need to know how to proceed.

Here's what happened:

LI beaches, like other crowded beaches, have an issue with theft. Not a terrible one, but the possibility is always there, and it would be foolish to ignore it. As I unpacked my stuff and prepared to hit the surf for an hour or so, I secreted my valuables into my sneakers and stashed them as best I could. I looked around at my now rapidly multiplying neighbors and felt a twinge of paranoia, which impelled me to turn to the people nearest me, a kindly looking couple in their 30's, and introduce myself.

""Hi, um, excuse me.""

The woman looked up.

""Do you guys think you could just, you know, keep an eye on my stuff while I go swimming? I won't be long, it's just that, uh, I'm here by myself and all...""

An uncomfortable moment of silence passed.

""It's not a lot of stuff, just my phone and keys and some other things.""

At this point the guy she was with grumbled something inaudible in her ear, and I was starting to feel like this wasn't going well. After a few more agonizing beats the woman still had not answered me.

I now wanted nothing more than to just get the fuck away from there, so I started making toward the water, but not before saying, ""Is that okay?""

Finally she responded, ""Yeah sure, will there be anything else?"" The notes of sarcasm were not lost on me.

Awkwardness achieved, I desperately wanted to break into a flat out sprint away from this exchange, but instead I just croaked out something like, ""YeahnothanksandI'llwatchyourstoobye."" And I sauntered off, another cringe inducing social situation under my belt.

Okay, looking back on it, what I probably *should* have said was, ""Hey guys, just letting you know that this is my stuff and if you see anyone else going through it they don't belong there."" Instead, I guess I kind of came off in a very forward and even unwelcome way, where I was essentially enlisting two strangers to do my bidding when all they wanted to do was just enjoy *their* time at the beach. But it's not like I was asking for an armed sentry post or anything, I figured it was just a common courtesy. But that's what bugs me, as I said before the fact that I feel like this was ""no big deal"" could be emblematic of me being an entitled asshole. And I never did ascertain what the guy grumbled into his ladyfriend's ear, but if it was in keeping with the tone of the rest of the conversation I think it's more than likely that *he* was being an asshole as well.

Whatever the case, I learned a lesson in tact that day, though there's still a pretty significant part of me that feels like I didn't really need one. So reddit, AITA?

881,Not the A-hole," 

Hi AITA.

tldr; My best friend(28M) and I (25F) have been online friends for roughly 5years. I would say he's one of my bestest guy friends. I have seen him struggle with his relationships, seen him go from job to job and saw him thrive in his current relationship now. Recently he had asked me if I would attend his wedding and I of course said I am going to decline out of respect for his fiance.

Here's some backstory:

He and I met on an online server. We've never actually met in person but we kicked it super well and have continuously stayed friends for 5 years now. When he first met his now fiance, I helped him plan his first date and even now every little detail of how he had custom made her wedding ring to where he had asked for her hand in marriage. I absolutely adore her, at one point we all were in a group chat together, I talked to her privately via text. I thought we were all pretty good friends until about a year ago when my bff told me that his fiance was actually pretty uncomfortable with me. He said every time he brought me up, she would get pretty moody. He would also say that she didn't like that we had so much inside jokes, also how he had a crush on me, just the whole idea of us being friends really made her uncomfortable. I eventually distanced myself so that they can cool off and he made the effort to tell his fiance that there was nothing more than a solid friendship.

We would text nonchalantly but never to the extent of how our friendship normally was. Recently this year we started talking normally again. I miss my best friend but I also told him that I understood boundaries and I never want to make his fiance feel like she is less than or feel like I am competing for his attention, or whatever she may feel. I've always tried to accommodate her feelings to make it known that I was only his friend and even waved my relationship around saying we should go on double dates if I ever decided to meet my bff and her in person to make sure that she knew I had my own relationship and never wanted to step in hers.

So a couple days ago, he had told me that they had a date for their wedding and asked if I would come. I had asked him about how his fiance felt and he stayed silent. I took the silence as she didn't really feel comfortable about me still, so I softly declined out of respect for his fiance because I never want to make her day be less special because of my presence. It sucks because he is my best friend and I would love to be there for him but I know the circumstances wouldn't be favorable.

Personally, I feel like an asshole whether I showed up or not. I know my best friend doesn't want to have to choose between his life partner and his best woman friend. I want to be there for him but I also don't want to make her uncomfortable on one of her biggest days of her life. If I showed up, I am an asshole to her and if I don't, I'm an asshole to my best friend.",27,57,0.88
882,Not the A-hole,"I'm at a summer program for the blind/visually impaired. It's there to teach us how to be more independent. It starts with basic living skills, then about work, and in the end, you get a paid internship. It really helps us out.

He will go to the store every week and buy $50+ of food. I don't mind that but he doesn't eat what he buys!

This dude has 2 full cabinets of food (some a month old) that he has never opened and his solution is to just buy more. He has food in and on top of the fridge, all over the counter as well as the cabinets and he keeps buying more that he won't eat. And he uses his card for all of it. 

The program also gives us a grocery list. We have to check off the items we want and on the next day, our food arrives. We have to get all 4 of us together and decide what we all want.

884,Asshole,"Last night, at around 2am, I received a frantic text from a female friend, asking to stay at my place due to her parents locking her out by accident. I quickly found out through mutual contacts that she was going to bring along someone she met at a bar recently. Knowing this, I set one rule, that she must notify me about anything going on at my place, including hooking up with this guy. 

My rationale for this was that since this is my apartment, I need to know what happens there, especially since its someone who I have no idea about, and the request for help being on such short notice. Especially since I will have to clean up after them.

I set them up in a spare bedroom and went soundly to bed. In the morning upon asking her if anything happened, I received a sound ""no"" and went about my day none the wiser. 

Later on I found out that they had indeed hooked up and decided to keep it quiet from me. I felt like my trust had been broken since, literally the only rule was that I know about anything that goes on.  Upon telling her that I no longer trust her, I received a barrage of texts from her and another friend, saying that I asked a question that was too private and invasive, and that I told her off for no reason. 

I feel like I may be making a mountain out of a molehill and thus being a verified asshole, but my judgement says that as adults, it's not out of the ordinary to at least tell a host about what goes on at their place of residence.

&#x200B;

Now, one of these males (real name used because it's a bird and he doesn't care) Coco, is my baby. He's started mimicking a lot of things I say to him. This includes things such as ""Coco, no!"" (Not in an aggressive way, similar to how you would tell off a baby trying to stick napkins in their mouth), ""Skrrt"" (yes, I'm proud of that one) and most of all, mouthpops. There are others, but the point is, he mimics me.

&#x200B;

I taught him to smack his face on his perch and dance when I tap a certain way on the wall. The other male started to copy.

&#x200B;

Now, the issue... They've started SHRIEKING if you don't dance with them. I don't know why, but they do it. They aren't quiet animals so if you don't dance with them, you have to listen to them scream for over an hour. If you dance with them at any point, they'll stop.

&#x200B;

AITA for literally forcing my family to dance with birds?

&#x200B;

I can't stop them from doing this. They have a mind of their own.

&#x200B;

And no, holding them won't make them stop screaming. They're the type of birds that once they start singing they won't stop, as well.

&#x200B;

Edit as I've seen some comments about it:

The tapping only occurs in very specific circumstances. It's not just any tapping sound, so the chances of them hearing it are slim, but it does happen, especially if the dogs are running around or someone is tapping on our kitchen counter (they are next to the kitchen - we don't use any pans with teflon and they're decently far away from any heat sources. We also love slow cooking food, so often times there isn't a lot of smoke. It's also a well-ventilated area.. don't come for me please) and just a couple of seconds of head bobbing will make them shut up.

Guys, don't be assholes towards my birds. Joking about cooking them is completely fine; I don't mind that. It's meant as a JOKE. But saying I'm a bad person for having pet birds or saying birds are shitty or just hating on birds, in general, isn't okay.

It's one thing to say they're assholes and a completely other thing to wish death on me and my beloved pets. Most of you, however, are incredibly funny and I wish you all the best.

She shoved me off her and calls me a creep saying that I didn’t ask her if I could do that. I said that I thought she would be okay with it considering we were making out already. 

She just scoffed and told me not to talk to her again and she walked out. I walked out after and I could tell that people knew something went wrong and I was super embarrassed so I just went home afterwards. 

I was talking to my older brother (he’s 24) and my sister (she’s 26) about this and he told me that as long as I wasn’t aggressive about it then she overreacted, while my sister told me that I should always ask before moving ahead in any kind of sexual situation and she hopes I learned my lesson. 

I’m so confused, should I have asked beforehand?

This happened two days ago and I’m still marinating in what happened. 

Went to Big Box Store for weekly groceries. I finished shopping, get to the cashier and set my groceries on the belt. I kept two cases of beer and the kitty litter in the cart because I generally don’t hurl heavy things onto the belt. I came around to the other side where the groceries are bagged, pointed to my cart and told the cashier, “I’ve got some beer and litter over here, too!” 

Well, she either forgot or didn’t care (possibly both) and never scanned the items. She gives me my total, I pay, and scamper away, knowing full well I didn’t pay for the beer and litter. I was *sweating bullets* the entire way to the front of the store as they usually check receipts. I guess I’m pretty unassuming looking because the door lady just told me to have a good day. So, off to home I go. 

My husband says I’m not TA, but I’m just racked with guilt because I knew she didn’t scan them. 

So, give it to me Reddit, AITA?

EDIT: okay, I’m the asshole. Not that it makes a difference, but I did spend over $200 this particular day so it’s not like they weren’t paid for everything else haha. Also, some of you are kind of dramatic. I didn’t walk in and start stabbing people. Jeez, relax.",214,285,0.89
893,Not the A-hole,"Yes, it’s as stupid as it sounds but she’s making a big deal out of it. 

I (21F) am an only child living with my Mom (46F). I work at a grocery store chain native to my state, and working there gets me a 10% off discount. This is linked to online to an account associated with my email. 

My Mom orders groceries through an online service my grocery chain offers and gets them delivered to our house. (note: they’re just for her. we buy our own things) She uses my account, which I let her, to order groceries and get the 10% discount. 

Since she uses my account I get all the emails for the orders. They’ll send three emails saying they received the order, they’re preparing the order, and then her receipt. I forward all of these to her, and I typically look at them since they’re going to MY email. 

I usually comment about things she gets, but in a joking way.  For example she ordered 3 boxes of cereal and I shot her a text saying “what was up with all the cereal? lol” and she went OFF on me about how messed up it is I was looking at her list because I have told her in the past not to look at my bank account because it’s private. 

I feel like a grocery list v. bank account are two separate things. When I say look at my account, I mean she will go through and look at every individual purchase and question me about them. I haven’t questioned anything on her list except make jokes, and I definitely never bring up the amount she spends. 

So, AITA here?

EDIT: I also want to clarify that although we live together, I pay for everything of mine. Including rent. Which is why I’ve told her not to look at my bank account",25,55,0.89

895,Not the A-hole,"I (23M) have a roommate (24F) that’s getting on my nerves. We moved in in June, and I had originally said that if necessary, I could cover the first month’s rent because she was going to be double paying for her old apartment and the new one that month. When it came time to put money down, she asked if I still was planning on doing that. I had forgotten about that offer, but said sure because she seemed hard up on money. Shortly afterwards, she said that it hurt to see her bank account “under $25,000 again.” I inquired and she said “yeah, I want to buy a house, remember?” I ended up paying the majority of the first month’s rent but not all of it - something like 85-15, a chalked it up to a learning experience. 

Before we moved in, she told a mutual friend of ours that she didn’t want to split any furniture, because then “who takes it when we move out?” She also had no desire to purchase any furniture herself, being completely fine with having no kitchen table, no couch, etc. That’s her choice, but I wanted basic furnishings in the house, so I bought a couch, brought my TV, and bought a kitchen table and chairs - the one thing she contributed to the first floor was an entertainment center that went under the TV. 

Shortly before we moved in, she came to me and asked if I would pay utilities for the first month, because “she wouldn’t be living there really” (her plan was to slowly move her belongings over the course of June, a weekend at a time). I said that seemed fair since she wouldn’t be using any of the utilities. Then, she fully moved in around June 10th or 14th. There was a bill from June 1-June 7, and I planned on splitting the following bill (June to July) since she moved in far earlier than planned. 

Before the next bill came in, I had a few instances where I found the AC turned off or up very high (almost 80 degrees). When the bill came in, I sent her a screenshot of it and she responded “I thought you were paying the first month?” I said I was paying the first bill before she moved in, to which she replied that was the first bill. I was exhausted after having worked 18hours the previous day, and left it at that. 

The following day, I came home and noticed she had moved the entertainment center with the sound bar for the TV, and put my end table underneath the TV, with the PS4, sound bar, and remotes on it, and the router on the floor next to it. I texted her and asked her where the entertainment center went, and she responded (five hours later) with “just saw this. It got moved.” That night, my girlfriend came over, and we wanted to watch a movie, but my roommate and a friend were on the couch watching TV. I then found the entertainment center sitting in our third (empty) bedroom against a wall, with nothing on it. Would I be the asshole for telling her that she can use the TV when I’m not, but otherwise I’ll use it when I want?",29,48,0.9

897,Not the A-hole,"Hey, I will try to keep this short.

I work as a freelance editor and copywriter. But in my spare time, I also paint. I have a friend I regularly speak to and we've been friends for over nine years. Two years ago, she commissioned me to paint her a 6ft by 5ft painting which I priced at $120. I enjoyed working on it but when it came time to pay, she said that she wanted it at a discounted price because all her money was going into her mother's hospital bills. Her mom has Lupus Disease and I know she has bad days and all, so I gave in and sold it to her for $50, not wanting to make things worse for her financially.

HAD I BUT KNOWN

She recently came up to me about a week ago wanting a document to be edited. It was 45000 words and I charge 10$ for 1000 words when editing. When I told her the sum, she said that she could not pay because her money was still going into her mother's bills.

I told her that this requires time and concentration. Her English is not so strong so I would have to read and re read everything she wrote.  I offered her a 70% payment instead but she still refused and insisted I go lower. She said that she can only pay me $20 and no more because she was so poor. Keep in mind her social media is filled with pictures of her eating out, partying and stuff. But I am not judging how she spends her money; until it comes to paying me - that's when I want a fair payment.

I said that I knew her mother was sick but I want the fair payment or I won't do her work. She called me selfish and greedy, but the thing is, I have bills to pay too! (I have a lot of pets). I ended up staying firm on my price and she got very angry and told me that I was awful for doing this to a friend. Now I am confused and I feel bad because her mom is sick.

898,Everyone Sucks,"On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I’ve put $7,500 into my wife’s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I’m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I’ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

Well yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I’m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying “instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt”.

I told her that I’d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she’s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

I told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn’t want to “miss out on the prestige” (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

She’s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it’s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

I told her that he’d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.

I thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to “persuade” me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I’m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

Now I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they’re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?

900,Not the A-hole,"Let me preface this by saying that I do not want this man fired. He said this is his full-time job and I'm not a revenge person.

&#x200B;

I (23F) live in a city where the mass transit is pretty good. Occasionally I get a Lyft if I am going somewhere unfamiliar or I need to get there fast.  I was planning on going on a date to a bar a few nights ago, but both of us got out of work late and were pretty tired.  Instead, we planned a spa-night at his place. I decided that since I didn't know how to get from his apartment to the subway, even though they're close, I would get a Lyft since it was getting late.

I got picked up at my house by a male driver who was maybe 30 and there were two other women in the car.  It was a fairly pleasant ride while the other two were there--lots of great conversation about where we were all from, what we all do, etc. I mentioned my date and how excited I was for it. About 5-10 minutes from my drop-off, the other two get out.

Immediately I could feel a massive change in tone and energy in the car. We stopped at a light and he started to turn around to look at me, saying how much he liked me, how great he thought I was, that he could use more people like me around. I mumbled a ""thanks"" and tried to change the subject. I really thought I had made it clear I was not interested, but uncomfortable.

I thought he past my drop-off and I texted my date saying he needed to wait for me in the lobby, then opened the app to make sure he was on track.  I'm not sure if he actually did take a longer route, but we were on track by the time I looked. I was ready to get out if we weren't.

He pulls up really slowly to the apartment building, asking if ""it was cool if we stay in contact"" and go out. I blurted out that my boyfriend wouldn't like this and ran to the building. He didn't pull away until my date opened the second door on the inside of the building for me.

I told him what happened in detail and he was LIVID. He said I should report this, that it was harassment and that this man was in a power position over me. He was easily twice my size and was driving me around a part of town I was unfamiliar with.  I kept saying no, I didn't want him to get in trouble and I would feel bad. He stood firm and said that if this man had done it before, he would definitely do it again.

It has been a few days and I still feel really icky about it. It put such a damper on my night. I know it is dramatic, but it took me awhile to come down from it and relax.  All I wanted was to have a nice night with this really great guy, and I was uncomfortable for like an hour before I could completely calm down and enjoy it. I'm not even comfortable enough to use Lyft anymore.

I really don't want to ruin this guys life. WIBTA if I reported this incident to Lyft?

EDIT: I should also say I'm scared to report this since he literally knows where I live now; I didn't say that it was my house, but thats certainly the vibe I would've gotten if I had been the driver.",1355,8576,0.92

I work in a smallish retail store that sells general merchandise, including various types of gift cards. I was working the register this day (we only have one open usually), and it had gotten very busy. I had a line wrapped around the front, and was checking people out in addition to answering questions from customers who were still shopping. 

During the rush, an elderly woman came in talking on her phone. It's important to note, i typically tune out customer conversations, as they are none of my business. I only heard parts of this convo because she had the person on speaker, and was standing right in front of me. She was purchasing $200 worth of google play cards, and the person on the phone seemed to be instructing her how to do this. 

I did not hear very much of her conversation with this person at all, but what i did hear sounded to me like one of those scams where they tell you something is wrong with your computer or phone, and convince you to send money or gift cards to ""fix"" it. 

So here's the part i feel like an asshole for: i made the sale and didn't say anything. If you've worked retail, you know how much trouble i could get into for butting into something like that. Honest to God it was not about the money. I couldn't care less about the company lining their pockets, and I'm not even sure we make much off those cards. It's just a line that any experienced cashier knows never to cross. I did not hear enough of what was going on to be remotely sure, and i was trying to keep the line moving, so i minded my own business. 

Still, i feel like an absolute turd for possibly being a part of scamming this woman. My ex husband works in computer repair, and deals with the aftermath of these scams all the time.

We have a FANTASTIC bagel place near my house, and we decided to get some bagels and go to my house. The line at the bagel place is always long, so they have a separate line for those who just want to purchase bagels (untoasted, with no butter or cream cheese).

We got a couple everything bagels, and then stopped at the store and I got dairy-free cream cheese and he got dairy butter. 

Long story short, we went to my house, ate our bagels, and then he asked me if I could simply keep the rest of the butter in my fridge for the next time he comes over.

I instantly refused by saying “I’m sorry but I’m not comfortable with that.” He called me overly sensitive and demanded that I keep the butter in my fridge, to which I said no. It goes without saying that he left my house pretty soon.

I've been dealing with thoughts of mortality and death recently and figured I should get a will drafted to ensure my children are secure. Even though they're still young, I think at this point how they act and behave resembles what they will as they're older. I think most people become themselves around these ages.

I want to split it 90/10 favoring my daughter. She's about to graduate university after an accelerated highschool program and my son wants to drop out the moment he can (here it's at 17). Here's a few things my son has done or has been a part of that cements my idea:

- got two girls pregnant, both were terminated
- has been expelled from one highschool and had to be put in another in a further district
- has already been involved with the police for driving without a license, driving inebriated, and felonious assault (knife)

As much as I love my son since a father's love is unconditional, I don't _like_ him if that makes sense. I believe he has no future and it's not a function of his upbringing, else my daughter wouldn't be at her point. He's just a bad seed, it can't be helped despite my attempts.

Two of us are gay, one is transgender and the rest are straight.  We talk about a range of things in life that we have an interest in and occasionally, we'd get out of hand with things taboo but the important thing is... we talk about the phone switching network. Because of that, we would get on Discord or dial a long distance number to a conference bridge to communicate.

You must realize that I'm fully open but I don't discuss about it that often because I feel that I don't need to, now that being gay is generally being accepted in the United States. Also, because I've some experience with the phone switching network in North America as an enthusiast, some people regard me as being as, for lack of a better word, a know-it-all and take my advice as to what to do.

However, the thing that irks me the most is that the transgender woman keeps promoting herself like, ""As a trans chick, I want X and X"" and posts racy things like (forgive me, direct quote), ""*faps to your video*"" in response to a video that I posted about the phone network. 

Just the other day, she started farting into the phone constantly and then laughing it off. Some of us on the conference bridge were shocked that she does that and once we've heard who it was by judging who made the sound after they've farted/pooped, we pretty much determined it was her but we didn't say anything because the admin of the group chat was on the phone as well.

I just want to distance myself from that because I feel as though my morals (I assure you, not my religious morals because I don't have any) are being violated and I understand that she has a right to do those things but they go a bit too far, in my opinion.

I quit my job a few months ago at my wife's insistence so that we could spend more time together and do some traveling, and we're currently being supported financially 100% by her parents. We've got a kid on the way, and I have an overwhelming urge to find a new job so that I can start supporting my wife and the baby. My wife and her parents think that this is ridiculous. The parents want to continue to support us, and want to train me on how to take over the family business. I've never showed them any interest in taking over, but now that our first born is on the way they've been more aggressive about it.

&#x200B;

I have two issues with this - a) I can't stand the line of work the business is in (finance/investments), and b), I can't help but want to find my own way to provide. I put myself through college before my wife and I met, and have a couple standing job offers in a field that I enjoy. AITA for not wanting to take this opportunity and let the family business change hands after the parents retire? Or am I justified in wanting to find my own way to provide?",41,29,0.86

932,Not the A-hole,"There is a chain of small stores that are basically on every corner. I live in a street that's not that big and there are three alone in this street, and another one on the corner of mine and another street, just to give you the idea of how many there are. 

Now, I smoke a brand of cigarettes that changed completely a couple months ago. Only one of the stores in my street has the old version, and I haven't found them anywhere else in the city either. The cashier that works there is incredibly rude to everyone who walks in. One time some random dude and I walked in some 30 minutes before the closing time and she yelled at us to hurry up while counting the money in the register in front us (<this is important). 

Now, the cost of the cigarettes is $2.6ish. We don't use dollars but it's more or less that much. The biggest bill there is in my country is worth $50 in our currency. Somehow, whenever I go there I happen to have a bill that's worth $20 and some change on the side. The woman refuses to sell the cigarettes to me and snaps at me whenever I try to pay with that bill. When I do have smaller bills I pay with them, but more often than not, I go to buy cigarettes as soon as I pick up some money. That particular time, I watched her count the money, saw how much she had in the register because she didn't bother to hide it, asked her if 10 or 60 cents (again, -ish) would help, and she still goes ""I don't have the change for that"" without even looking at me.

I know cigarettes aren't that important, but these particular ones only exist in that store that I know of, and this is seriously starting to piss me off. The same thing happened today, so I went to another, much smaller store that isn't a part of that chain and doesn't have that many customers in a day. They sold me the new version of cigarettes since it's the only one they have, and didn't make a big deal out of the bigger bill. 

So, WIBTA if I emailed them and let them know that their employee is refusing accept ""bigger"" bills?",23,79,0.95

934,Not the A-hole,"I live in a five floor apartment building that's connected directly to the tower next door, with shared trash and laundry in the basement of my tower. There are four washers and four dryers. This morning I went downstairs to do my laundry, and it was my first time doing it in this new place. At first when I went downstairs, I mistakenly put all of my laundry into one of the dryers, instead of the washers, because everything is front-loading, and at my old place the setup was opposite of this laundry room. Then a guy came in and started to move his laundry over, so I panicked, because I'm not very good under embarrassing situations, and I went back up to my apartment and came back down to pretend like I'd forgotten something.
 
 When I came back down there was another lady in the laundry room, who had two very small baskets of laundry. At this point, one of the one of the washers was in use, and she was just kind of standing there looking at all of her laundry. It was pretty mixed stuff, but nothing that struck me particularly as whites, or anything that would have to be washed on its own. I realized in that moment I would have to embarrassedly move my stuff from the dryer to the washer in front of somebody, so it may as well be this lady. I made the comment, ""Oh, haha, I accidentally put all my stuff in the dryer not even realizing it wasn't the washer.""

I started quickly moving my stuff from the dryer to the washer, and when I looked up it had quarters on it, which as you may know, means someone has reserved it. Fine, there's two other open washers. I ask, ""Oh, sorry, are you going to use this one?"" She responds, ""I actually need three of them."" My jaw dropped. ""You need THREE of them?"" I asked. She quietly said something along the lines of ""Yes because my laundry is all different."" 

I told her it was fine, I could do my laundry later, but that I would be back down in one hour to put my laundry in. 

I went back upstairs, cleaned my apartment for an hour and fifteen minutes, and then took my laundry back down. The one that had been in use before was running again (Someone must have come to switch their laundry) and all three of her washers were just sitting there with her laundry in them. So, as was the norm at my old building, I took her laundry out of the washer and set it on top so I could put my clothes in. 

While I was in the middle of doing this, she came down and freaked out at me for taking her laundry out. I very calmly told her that it had been far longer than an hour at this point, that these were shared facilities, and it's pretty inconsiderate to take up three of the four available washers in the first place. 

She freaked out, moved her laundry, and then stormed out saying she was going to call apartment management about me. I do feel kind of bad because I didn't want her laundry to get gross, but it's Sunday and we all have clothes to wash. AITA?",25,30,0.88

I originally went vegetarian after watching a video on KFC and their treatment of the chickens as well as my community involvement with animal shelters. 

Throughout the years I didn’t eat much meat, till over the last year or 2 my current husband wants meat every single meal. And I feel like complete shit mentally and physically from it. 

Well 2 weeks ago I told my husband I am going back vegetarian, he wasn’t happy at all he said that I am changing our lives and that’s not fair to him. To make him feel like I’m not changing everything I went out and bought him a meat pack when I bought everything I need for my meal.  He still says that I am being ridiculous that we as people are suppose to eat meat not just vegetables and beans. I had him watch the documentary that changed my views all those years ago and he played on his phone the whole time and asked well how did you expect them to kill and animal. 

My husband feels that I am changing so much and that he fell in love with who I was.

940,Asshole,"Okay so this is a bit of a long one, but I'm willing to accept my fate. 


Some backstory: boyfriend (28m) and I (28f) and our 2 year old daughter live with my boyfriend's parents. They do A TON for us, and I'm immensely grateful for it, but on the flip side they don't respect my boyfriend as an adult or father and it's a big source of contention for our relationship when he doesn't stand up for himself. 


Yesterday we were meant to go to a birthday party that started at 1, about an hour and a half from our house. Already knew we were going to be late because I didn't get off work until 12, but I was hoping not to be immensely late. Boyfriend and baby were both home ALL DAY (this is important later). When I got home boyfriend and his dad were outside messing around with his pull behind trailer. I went inside, got all of our stuff together, and we were walking out of the house when my boyfriend's father asks for his help again, changing a tire on the pull behind trailer. Boyfriend tells him we really need to leave now as we're already late, but he says he *doesn't care* and to help, it'll only take five minutes.


Now if the situation were reversed, I would've told my dad ""I'm sorry Dad, I would be happy to help you but unfortunately we need to leave. If you had discussed this earlier with me I could've made it work but unfortunately I can't""


Is that what my boyfriend did? No. He went out to change the tire. I told him that I was going to finish getting everything together (baby still needed her shoes on) but that if he wasn't done I was leaving without him because at this point the party had started an hour ago and we still had to travel another hour and a half to make it there. Went out about 5 minutes later and they hadn't even gotten the bad tire off yet. I waited another ten minutes, and then said okay we really need to leave. Boyfriend just continued to change the tire, so I left.


I know this seems petty and stupid, but I felt (and still feel) incredibly disrespected by his dad, and by my boyfriend who I feel should've stuck up for me/us/our plans. Especially because then his father LEFT THE TRAILER PARKED, AND IT'S STILL SITTING THERE RIGHT THIS SECOND. My boyfriend could've changed the tire at literally any other point when we got back, or even this morning (all this happened yesterday). And this is unfortunately not the first time in our 5 year relationship that he's been forced to choose between our plans or stuff his parents spring on him last second. He always chooses his parents even if it leaves me in the lurch or alone.


As a note, I did end up coming back to get my boyfriend (half an hour later when he was done), and he came to the party, but it caused a huge rift between us and he thinks I shouldn't have left without him, because how is he supposed to say no to his parents? (His words)


AITA?

Edit to add since a couple people have asked for clarification: we live with his parents because our daughter was a surprise, and instead of quitting school, they allowed us to move in until my boyfriend is done (he graduates after the fall semester) and then hopefully we will be financially able to leave.",76,61,0.9

944,Not the A-hole,"Resubmitting with mod approval. For context I'm a 23 year old female and this happened in southern California.


 Last night I was out drinking with some friends, and once the night was over I called an Uber to my apartment by myself. A few minutes later the guy pulls up in a sedan and I get in. When I got in I noticed that it slightly smelled like weed but didn't think anything of it and the first few minutes were normal with me on my phone. A couple minutes later I look up and notice my driver is hitting a dab pen while he's driving. Maybe if it was a hit or two it wouldn't have really bothered me but he was hitting it nonstop which would be bad enough by itself. Then out of nowhere he asks me if I wanted a hit, to which I respectfully said no.

 At this point I started to get uncomfortable, but I really didn't want to confront him or tell him to pull over because: 

a) I've had bad experiences confronting drivers in the past about things that bother me. I.e one time my Uber driver was going way too fast (50+ in a residential area) and got defensive and very loud when I asked if he could slow down

b) he was much bigger than me (not accusing him of anything, just saying that if something went wrong id have no way to defend myself) + ~15 more mins of driving At this point I was on the verge of a panic attack (I really hate being around weed and the guy offering me a hit reminded me of a really bad trip I had a few months earlier). 


He wasnt really driving erratically or anything but was definitely high since he was hitting his pen so much. I decided to call 911 since he was smoking and driving and I explained the situation and roughly where we were and where we were headed. I guess he didn't hear me because he didn't say anything while I was on the phone. Since people were asking, I only called since he had music playing and I was almost whispering and because I was almost sure that he wouldn't be able to hear me.  The operator was understanding and said I should expect an officer to pull him over very soon. 

Less than 5 mins later, I saw a cop follow behind us for a few hundred feet before turning on their lights less than a few blocks from my apartment. The officers had me step out of the car and talked to the driver for a bit. After a while a an officer came and told me that the driver was going to be arrested for a warrant that he had as well as the DUI obviously. At this point my driver who was in handcuffs started making some rude remarks toward my race (I'm white). His friend who pulled up to take his car also told me as they walked by that I was ""tripping"" and ""didn't like seeing a person of color on their grind"", which obviously isn't true because I have nothing against POC or any minority for that matter and the only reason I called the cops in the first place was because he was driving high. The officers asked me if I needed a ride home but I was okay since my place was just down the street. So I walked home with him and his friend still yelling slurs directed at me. 


After talking about it with my friend, she thought i overreacted and got him arrested unnecessarily. She said I should've asked him to stop smoking first before calling the cops and now he's probably lost his job over weed. So what do you guys think. AITA?",88,91,0.83
945,Asshole,"ill try to keep this short as possible. I matched with a girl on tinder earlier this week, we agreed to go out last night.

She was incredible, not only is she ""girl next door"" hot, she's wicked smart and was honestly one of the funniest and wittiest people I've ever met. I mean I had such an amazing time and we clicked so well that if she would have said ""let's run off to Vegas and get married"" part of my brain would been like ""maybe this can work..."" 

So we ended up back at my place and she said she wanted to be clear that she wasn't ready for sex yet. I told her that was totally fine and there was no pressure at all. We sort of went between making out, watching stranger things and joking/talking. When one episode ended she started kissing me again and went down and was sort of kissing my member on top of my pants. I decided it would be hilarious time to play ""bump and grind."" 

The mood instantly changed and she said ""wow you think I want to hear a kid toucher's awful music as I'm trying to decide if I like you enough to put your duck in my mouth?"" I told her it was honestly a joke and I've always thought R Kelly was stupid and it was more in line of how much I knew she loved Dave Chappelle show. She asked if I was planning on peeing on her next.  I said I was really sorry and it was honestly a joke. 

She said she wanted me to take her home so I did. When we got there she said somthing along the lines of ""look I really like you but I have a past where I can't laugh at certain things, give me some time and I'd like to see you again."" And she gave me a hug and left. 

So obviously I can assume what she means about her past and what I did was very stupid...but was I an asshole for it?

Edit: tinder girl just called me, she basically said she was sorry for leaving the way she did and reiterated that she had some stuff happen to her when she was younger than the R Kelly stuff isn't funny to her (she didn't expand beyond that and I didn't ask). But she said that her inappropriate sense of humor would have thought my joke was hilarious if things were different and that she has to respect a guy who was willing to risk a oral to make an awful joke.

946,Not the A-hole,"I'm 29, my sister is 27.

We're polar opposites. I've always worked hard and taken risks to succeed. My sister has always slacked off and never put any real effort in to succeed. She tried attending college but spent all her free time partying/smoking pot/sleeping around and ended up failing half her courses in her first year and dropped out. 

Recently she decided she wants to go back to university to become a nurse. She currently works as a cashier at a supermarket so it would be a big step up career wise. Problem is my parents have lost most of their savings due to some very poor choices and can't afford to support her while she studies and help pay her tuition.

On the other hand, I'm currently working as an actuary and have plenty of disposable income. Naturally, my parents think I should support her and pay her tuition while she studies. They say she'll continue working part time and will pay what she can, but I'm basically expected to support her and pay her tuition, or let her stay at my house so she doesn't have to pay rent.

I shut down the idea immediately. In my opinion, her current situation is entirely her own fault for not working hard when she was younger. My GF and I plan on getting married soon and I don't want to waste money on my sister's education.

Ted had always been passionate about becoming a digital illustrator and graphic designer. He worked hard for his dream and managed to become a part time freelancer doing commissions while working in a restaurant and continue his studies in the art and design field.


About half a year ago Ted came to me asking for a favor. He wanted to buy a laptop too expensive for him and wanted me to pay for it, promising to return the sum in full in 3 months. I was hesitant, as the laptop he wanted was very expensive, almost a third more than my own laptop. However I guess as a designer in training, he needed one of the best. So being kind of a sucker, I paid for it.


As you might have guessed now, not even a single dime was paid back. I offered to have him pay me a set amount for 24 months(now thinking back, he could have done the same and bought it himself), but he kept avoiding the subject, saying he was too busy working and studying. So one day, I figured I had enough.


To cut the story short, I ""stole"" the laptop from his home during a visit. The laptop was registered under my name during payment, so I doubt he could or afford to file any charges against me. I dropped him a message before I leave that if he want it back he had to pay me the laptop's full amount. 


He begged me to return the laptop to him, as he could not do commissions or study without it. He gave many apologies and all sorts of promise that he would pay back as soon as possible, and even brought up my previous idea of installment pay. I said no, it's either the full amount or no laptop, and I will be using it as my own and delete all his data if he cannot pay me back.


I do feel sorry for him as I know the importance of a laptop to him as a designer/illustrator. But I feel like I need to grow a backbone too and stop letting him push me around. AITA?


Update: I have yet to touch anything on the laptop, but Ted had really been begging me and even meltdown in tears. Wouldn't say that's how I hoped it would turned out(But what else could I expect? He loved his stuffs.)  I think we both kinda screwed up real bad.",495,2464,0.97

955,Not the A-hole,"Happened Dec. 2018, been thinking about the situation on-and-off since then.

I’m 23 (F) and my parents have me keep my phone’s location on at all times, even though I’m a graduate student and live away from home. 

I was with my boyfriend (23) for the day. My phone ended up at 5% before dinner, so I asked to charge it in his car. I knew that some cars can’t charge phones if the engine isn’t on, but bf said it’d work on his. I had also read online that putting your phone on airplane mode helps it to charge faster. It turned off my location, which I didn’t know about. I plugged my phone into the car charger, checked to see that it’s working, then went into the restaurant. I even used my bf’s phone to text my mom and let her know that my phone was charging in the car and that she could text my bf to contact me. I make it home by my curfew, and head to my room. A few minutes later, my mom immediately texts me, and the following conversation happens. I don’t remember the exact words, but here’s the general gist.

Mom: where were you?

Me: what do you mean?

Mom: your location was off. 

Me: I didn’t realize, I turned on airplane mode to charge my phone faster. 

Mom: you can’t charge your phone when the car isn’t on. 

Me: I thought that too, so I checked with [bf], it works on his car.

Mom: I’m going to try charging my iPad in the car without turning on the engine. 

Me: your car is a different model than his, it might not work.

Mom: it doesn’t work, I tried on all 3 cars

Me: like I said, his car is a different model

Mom: what car does he drive? 

Me: *gives make and model of car* why are you interrogating me?

Mom: maybe if you used some better excuse. 

At this point, I felt hurt. I said that there was no reason for her to be questioning me like this, especially after I had already explained to her what had happened. I said it was really hurtful that she would accuse me of lying or “making excuses” when I went out of my way to keep her updated. She ignored what I said and even went on to say “next time he’s here, I’m going to try charging my phone in his car when the engine is off, to show that you’re lying.” 

I was really upset my mom didn’t seem to trust me. I told her that until she was ready to apologize and treat me like an adult instead of a criminal, I didn’t want to talk to her. The next morning, when she tried talking to me, I ignored her. When my dad finally asked if we got into an argument, my mom said, “I don’t know what happened. She’s mental.” My frustration boiled over after hearing her dismiss my feelings in such a demeaning way. I ended up crying and tried to explain what had really happened to my dad. I barely got two sentences out when he cut me off and told me to apologize to my mom. When I refused, he said that I was ungrateful.

We get back to visit every 2 years or so. One evening, about 10ish days into the trip my brother, his gf and another friend of theirs came to my parent's house (where we were staying for the duration of the trip) for supper. My brother lives in the same small, rural town as my parents, about a 5 minute walk away. He never leaves this town, other than to go to work in a nearby, larger town. I cooked a meal and we all (me, my husband, my parents, my brother, his gf, and their friend) sat around eating and chatting. It was so lovely to have my family in one room as the relationship between my parents and brother had recently become difficult.

In the context of a discussion about gender fluidity, we began talking about the subject of raising children gender neutral. My brother was adamant that it was a bad way to raise children, whereas my husband and I put forward points that disagreed with him. The discussion wasn't passionate but robust. I argued that kids don't need gendered toys and that an absence of this might give kids more freedom to think of themselves in their own way. Neither my brother or I have children so the discussion was hypothetical. He argued that not gendering children might lead to an absence of workers in certain stereotypically ""macho"" fields, eg. deep sea welders (his example). While I argued that I didn't think this would happen because gender neutral doesn't mean boys can't do stereotypically boy things and girls, stereotypically girl things - it potentially offers children choice for girls to engage in ""boy"" things and boys, ""girl"" things.

I became frustrated that he wasn't picking that up and resorted to telling him that if he ever left the small town he lived in he might get a wider perspective on social issues. I knew it was a low blow but said it anyway. He left after supper, saying goodbye. The next day I received a Facebook message from him stating that he ""didn't want to know me anymore"" and that I shouldn't come back every 3 years and judge the way he lives. I didn't respond because I was hurt, shocked and didn't want to give oxygen to what I thought was an overreaction. He proceeded to cut off contact completely. I haven't spoken or had contact with him in a year now. I recently tagged him in a funny IG post that I knew he'd appreciate bc I wanted to try a softly softly approach to get in touch. He blocked me, and has completely cut me off.

I recognise that I shouldn't have had a cheap dig at him, but I'm really upset that a previously close relationship now no longer exists because of one comment I made. AITA here?

TL;DR: I told my brother maybe he'd get a better perspective on gender issues if he left his small town once in a while. AITA?",242,391,0.89

When I [26M] was at uni, I had a fling with one of my male professors. At the time I was 19 and he was 47. Clearly with hindsight this was definitely a case of him being creepy and predatory but at the time I felt really grown up and special. We cut it off at the end of that academic year because I went to do a year abroad and we weren't serious enough for long distance to work. We hooked up a couple more times when I was back, but that was it.

Fast forward to now. A new girl joined our team at work and she and I became quite friendly quite quickly, and we're now ""grab a couple of drinks after work"" type coworkers. We did this last night and we got onto the topic of old flames. I mentioned shagging my professor, and she asked which one. I told her and she got really quiet, and then left. She later texted me saying that he was her father and this was the first she'd heard of him being interest in men. It's worth noting, at the time I was seeing him, he was seperated from his wife and they were divorcing *because* he's gay. I suppose the kids weren't told for whatever reason and I've pretty well dropped him in it. He sent me an angry text telling me to leave the past in the past and she's not speaking to me.

962,Asshole,"English is not my first language so I apologize in advance.

My girlfriend has always been into drawing and painting. She would love to become a professional artist. She is very committed but also very hard on herself. This is (I think) made worse by me being a hobbyist as compares herself.

My job is unrelated to the arts but I make it for fun for my friends and family sometimes. I'm a more analytical person and good at finding strengths and weaknesses, also applies to my own work. I have a good sense of balance, colors and proportion but I can lack in anatomy and consistency. I am far from the best artist but compared to the average person I do pretty well. Sometimes people pay me for small things.

I also see the strengths and weaknesses in her work. She struggles with her creativity and coloring. Her ideas tend to be cliche, for example if she was asked to draw a picture of depression she may draw a girl crying with a broken heart in the background. Part of this is probably just lack of confidence.

She has been taking classes for a very long time however. Many teachers. But her work is not very good and looks like she just started. Her technique is not the issue for me (that is lacking too but not the issue), but that she has a lack of that innate thing. The way to match colors, the way to place things. Making ideas. Those areas I don’t see it.

It’s not the money at all. If I saw the talent I would love to encourage her. But I feel a little hollow trying to hype her up for something I don’t believe it. I’ve gently made suggestions like why don’t we try printmaking together, why don’t we try sculpture. But she is set on being a fine artist even though she often says that she notices other people are unimpressed. She wants to make comics even though she has never even made one for fun. And I’m lost.

My wife said no, and her friend is convinced this is a huge sad imbalance and is unfair to my daughter etc. She told my wife this, and my wife agrees now and thinks that I should get a tattoo of my stepdaughters name to be fair. 

I don’t want to do it at all, and I keep saying no, but my wife thinks a ‘real dad’ would get tattoos of both. I got a bit upset at that comment and told her I was a real bloody dad.

967,Not the A-hole,"This just happened 4 hours ago and I'm still angry about it.


My birthday was this week but due to logistics reason, I couldn't have a birthday party with my friends. So I organized one last night.


During the course of the party, one friend of mine was getting more and more drunk as well as more and more annoying.


It was only small things at first, that she found funny to do and that were not annoying at the beginning. Things like making small verbal attacks (like we all usually do between us normally), taking my lighter to hide it, taking my tobacco and such.


As the party progressed, and her drunkenness too, so did my sleepiness. It was now 1:00AM and I wanted one thing : end the party smoothly and go to bed.


That's when the first argument happened. She  and some other friends who were there decided that they wand to enjoy the swimming pool that was in the garden. I answered that I'd pass as I simply was too tired and wanted to go to sleep soon.She then started to argue with me, that I should force myself to stay awake and enjoy the party and join them. I was keeping to my decision, saying the simple truth : ""I'm tired, I won't join you and that's final.""


It went like that for a good five minutes, while the others were getting an uneasy feeling because I was basically starting to yell at her as she simply didn't want to listen to me. One of my other friends had to intervene to stop the argument.
A little while after that, she came to me to say sorry that she insisted but I felt that it was not sincere at all.


They then went to the swimming pool, I stayed for a bit, then at 01:30AM I decided to call it quits and went to my tent to sleep. But they were so noisy that I couldn't at first. After maybe 30 minutes or so, I was in a half asleep state and heard her say that the argument was basically my fault because I was camping on my position and refused to listen to ""simple facts that are the truth, because I know how it works"".


It kept me awake again but I managed to force myself to kind of go back to sleep. They then decided to put on some music on a Bluetooth speaker. That was not a problem for me, as I was simply too tired at that point. I went back to that half asleep state, and that's when they (I don't know who did yet. I have to go back there to pick up the stuff I left there) decided to throw the speaker into my tent, blasting music at full volume.


At that point I simply had enough. I put on my shoes, got to my car and left. Another friend tried to make me stay but I was so angry at that point that I simply couldn't stand her attitude anymore, as well as listening to their drunk rambling that made sense to no one but them.


So Reddit, AITA for leaving my own birthday party in a rush because I was angry ?


TLDR; Had to support the drunken shenanigans of a friend during the entire duration of my birthday party. It made me more and more angry as it went on. Someone pulled a nasty ""prank"" on me while I was trying to sleep. I left super angry because I couldn't take it anymore.",17,52,0.9

969,Not the A-hole,"Recently I had my whole property and land including the yards, curtilage etc, re-measured because I was sure the fence between my side yard and my neighbour's stood some feet away from where it's supposed to, even dangerously closer to my house. And I was right. 

The thing is my neighbour has grown his garden along the fence. Some bushes have even grown onto my yard (even before I moved the fence) and some of the ornamental trees' branches were hanging low over my yard.  So I told him about it. At first of course he refused to believe me but after he got someone to measure it for him he found out that I was right. I asked him to trim the overhanging branches and he said he needed a month to trim the trees and redo his whole garden but I told him I could only give him 3 weeks since I was getting a car and wanted to build a simple wooden garage in my side yard, the portion on which the fence stood included. To give you the idea, the size of his small elongated garden is approximately 23ft x 10ft (7m x 3m). And the length of our side yards is approximately 49ft (15m). 

The next week, I saw he still had done nothing in his garden so I rang him up to remind him again and he said he was still being preoccupied with an oncoming family gathering and would do it later soon. 
A week before my car was supposed to arrive though, he still had not redone his garden. I tried to ring him up but did not get through. And he was not home either. Away for the family gathering I reckon. So I decided to tear down the fence myself and rebuild it where it's supposed to be, and in the process trimming some of the overhanging branches and bushes as well, but leaving most of the garden itself intact. 

When he returned a few days later, he was beyond horrified to see what had become of his garden. He started yelling at me calling me names and we would have got into a fight if my wife hadn't stopped us and become the grown up. 
He has threatened to sue me but I stood my ground and told him to go ahead. I have reminded him many times of his garden growing onto my yard, which he failed to take seriously. So it's not my fault to  move the fence back to where it's supposed to be. My wife thought I should have been the bigger person and kept the car in my office parking lot for a while until he was done with the family gathering. But I think I have been pretty generous and patient enough given that I did give him enough time to redo his garden. Or maybe I have gone too far?

EDIT : A week before my car arrived was already 4 days past the 3 week I gave him. I DID follow my deadline. The reason why I gave him 3 weeks instead of 4, was because I needed the remaining week to build the garage before the car arrived. If only he had shown any effort to at least trim the bushes first (which would have only taken him minutes to do), maybe I would have kept the car in my office parking lot for a few days until he was done redoing his garden. I even offered him help to tear the fence first. 

I did NOT destroy his garden. I only trimmed the bushes that had grown onto my yard and branches that were hanging low over it. Like I said, I left most of the garden INTACT, working around and through it.",151,619,0.96
970,No A-holes here,"Long time reader, first time posting. I'm literally sick to my stomach right now and mad as hell. But I need to know, AITA? 

Little background: boyfriend and I have been living together for 2 years and been dating for 3.5 years. In general I have a sensitive stomach and easily throw up.

My (30f) boyfriend (28m) and I went out tonight, ate a bunch of shit food, had drinks and came back home by 11:30 pm. At midnight I'm calling it a night and he says he isn't feeling well and might stay up. I suggest he drink Pepto, he does, and we both go to bed. I even commented ""wow we both ate the same thing, I wonder what made your stomach upset and not mine?"" 

Boyfriend passes out and by 12:30 I'm in the bathroom violently throwing up and to add insult to injury... Got the poops. I'm trying to be quiet, don't want to wake him up, and eventually get back in bed. But I can't sleep. I clearly have food poisoning, and boyfriend finished the Pepto. I try sleeping. I try ignoring my stomach pain. By 1 am I'm back in the bathroom throwing up again. This isn't me just getting queasy, this is now ""I need to make this stop"" territory. 

After vomiting for the 4th time tonight, I finally decide to wake up my boyfriend. I gently nudge his arm, and say ""I have food poisoning, or something, because I keep throwing up."" He is sleepy as hell, and asks if there is anything he can do to help. I tell him, ""yes actually I need Pepto since he finished the bottle"". And he loses his shit. He doesn't want to get up, and when he does he is throwing his clothes around and making a big scene. I asked why is he so mad. And he says ""because you're always sick!"". To which I replied ""I've never once woken you up and asked you to go to the store."" Which is true. I do get upset stomaches easily. I've literally never even woken him up to simply say ""I don't feel well"". I've handled every upset stomach and painful period on my own. 

Before he leaves he tells me ""I don't feel well too."" When he gets back he tosses the bottle of Pepto to me, grabs his pillow and sleeps on the couch. Says nothing to me. Goes right to sleep.

I still feel like shit. I'm really mad because I didn't choose to get food poisoning. And it's now 2 am. 

Was it an asshole move to make him go to the store when he was tired and apparently also not feeling well? AITA here? I don't think I am, but his attitude makes me think I was supposed to go myself.

UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies! It was mostly nah/esh which helped me realize I'm probably just as cranky as he is. At 4 am I checked on him to make sure he wasn't feeling worse, he immediately asked if I was feeling better and said ""sorry for being a little bitch. I love you and I'm sorry you're not feeling well. That was mean of me earlier"". We hugged and I thanked him for his apology and going to the store, then tucked him back into bed. We good. 

Also thanks for the suggestions of what could be causing my stomach problems, I'm going to do some research and set up more appointments.",140,1011,0.94

973,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for good measure.

A good friend of mine called me telling me they had broken down and, as I am a mechanic, asked me to look at it. Long story short the thing needed alot of work and was 6 months past due on a service. He asked to borrow my car for the day to get to work which I was pretty uncomfortable with.

I said yes anyway considering it was just one day and sadly he managed to turn into directly into another car within the 8 hours he had it - he was at fault.

He has been genuinely apologetic and paid the excess on my insurance, about $500, to cover the damage to the other party and my repair bill.

My Insurance has now offered me a cash payout to the value of the damage, which is naturally my preference as I can put my time and effort into fixing it myself and have the car repaired for about half the cost they are offering to pay me.

He asked the other day how the insurance was going and I've given him the entire story including cash values, he hasn't said anything but I feel as though he may be jaded that I haven't offered to refund the excess he had to pay.

For reference the cash difference after cost of parts will probably be about $1500 so if I paid him back the excess I would still make $1000 difference. The car won't be back to 100% but would be in a condition good enough that I wouldnt be concerned.

I'm in a real moral quandry. On one hand he has damaged someone else's (my) property and the cost to get that repaired is the cost of the excess, how that money is spent is irrelevant. Additionally I am putting time and effort into sourcing parts and performing works which is not accounted for. On the other hand the cash difference is relatively substantial and I would not charge $1500 for my time and effort sourcing parts and completing repairs for a job like this. I'm sure he would be grateful for the money and I am in a relatively secure job with decent enough income for it not to be a problem.

My concern with giving him the cash is that if this affects the resale value of the car, the effect this has had on losing my no claims bonus and honestly I feel like he needs to pay the consequences of not taking more caution with my car.

So WIBTA if I keep all the insurance payout?",19,36,0.96

He doesn’t smoke weed very often (this time was the first time in about 6 months). He’s never said anything to me like this in the few times I’ve seen him high before, but it really upset me.

So, I get home around 10pm last night. He had a few friends over who were getting ready to leave as I was walking up, and I could tell immediately by the way he was sitting that he was either high or very drunk. 

His eyes showed he was high. They all left, we went inside, and both got changed into comfy clothes. He heated up some pizza and sat down on the couch, and I sat entirely on the opposite end of the couch away from him.

A few moments pass, before he bluntly says, “You can’t be in the same room as me right now.” Initially I thought he was joking and laughed and said no, but he kept insisting. Eventually he said, “I’m serious, I’m too high for this shit. I can’t be around you right now.” 

I was upset. I just said wow, and got up. He immediately got defensive that he didn’t mean it “like that” and “not to be a dick but...” so I just said what, is that supposed to make me feel good or something? And grabbed my shit and locked myself in the guest bedroom for the night.

He didn’t say anything else the rest of the night, and never once tried to apologize or get me to come to bed. 

So, today I’ll admit I’ve been pretty distant. It hurt my feelings quite a bit to have him look at me and tell me he can’t be around me, and that I need to go away when I was just sitting silently away from him on my phone and minding my own business in the first place. I haven’t ignored him, but I had been just avoiding everything honestly. 

He got really upset, and asked why I was being weird. When I told him I was still upset and angry about how he’d treated me the night before he got upset/defensive. “I was high, I didn’t mean it. It was just making me trip having you there. Let it go, I was high. I’m sorry but...” 

He can’t just say he’s sorry he hurt my feelings, no, I’m being unreasonable for being upset in the first place because “I was high!” 

So AITA for being angry/upset over what he said while he was high? 

TLDR: BF got high for the first time in 6 months, and bluntly told me he couldn’t be around me and I had to go away from him, despite me being across the couch on my phone. I’m upset still, and he says I should let it go because he was high.",78,54,0.87

The problem is I know they won't approve of it because they have already stated so, or at least my stepmom has, my dad hasn't said anything. And I don't want to just leave my dad without notice because he is a really great father imo, it's my stepmom that's the problem.

So my plan was to at some point wait for both my parents to be at work, call my grandma and just grab the stuff I want and need (laptop, money, ps4, etc.) and just go, leaving a note with a quick explanation.

Growing up, I often hear my mother comparing Abby to Cait, and that how quiet and well behaved Cait is compared to the loud and rebellious Abby. Sometimes Abby would get so tired it that she would start saying things like ""To hell with that bitch, shes a nerd!"" Which no best friends would want to hear. 


She also would punish or reward Abby's academic result compared to Cait.

&#x200B;

Everything was fine and I spent most of the week searching with my dad, until yesterday when my boyfriend made a comment that I mistook for a joke. He said something like ""Well, maybe I should start packing up my stuff too."" I laughed because I legitimately thought he was joking but I quickly realized that he was not. I told him that I didn't want him to move in with me, at least not now because I wanted to enjoy living somewhere alone for a while. 

&#x200B;

Things got a bit rocky after that and he left a few minutes later. I thought he was just feeling awkward about it but today a friend of ours texted me asking if something had happened because my boyfriend seemed weird. I explained what had happened and said friend told me that I had been rude and I should probably apologise.

He tolerated my husband, until a few weeks or so ago, when my dog snarled, charged and bit my husband, he had done the snarling before, but not biting.  We talked to trainers and behaviorists and nothing was found medically wrong, so we were trying some tips the trainers ect gave us.

Long story short, nothing was really working, and then, a few days ago, he did the same to my 11 year old son.  He didn't get skin in the bite,  but got his pant leg and scared my son quite a bit. I was there, and my son was doing nothing to my dog at all.

So.  I contacted a daschund rescue and he went to his foster home this afternoon.   He met some new doxie buddies and was having a great time there, and that's amazing, because doxies can be real assholes.  I sent him with all his clothes (he gets cold!), treats, toys, bed, blanket, food ect ect.

987,Not enough info,"When each of my children were born, I started an investment fund for them. I'd invest $300 a month into a portfolio of dividend-growth and tech stocks which as you can imagine has grown substantially over the years.

I started these funds with the intention of giving it to them when they settle down and want to buy a house, as it will give them an extremely large down payment. 

Anyway my daughter is my oldest (33) and I also have two sons (27 & 25). 

After completing college my daughter moved overseas and cut contact with me and her mother. For the record we were never abusive or anything, there's no reason for cutting contact, she just did it out of the blue. She still rarely spoke to her brothers, but didn't answer our calls and never reached out to us.

Recently her younger brother got married (she didn't attend wedding either) and he and his wife start looking to buy a house. We surprise our son with the $270,000 in his fund and they're over the moon. Really helped them get their dream home. 

Anyway a couple months later I guess this news reaches our absentee daughter who proceeds to - for the first time in a decade - reach out to us. Call starts off nice until she asks about her fund. It was painfully obvious this is the only reason she called us. 

Anyway I told her that since she had cut me out of her life, I decided to make her fund go towards my future sons' kids. She was extremely upset and thinks I'm being manipulative. Imo she gave up her fund + future inheritence when she cut her mother and I out of her life.

For the record her money is around $380,000 at the moment.",245,322,0.94
988,Not the A-hole,"I live in Canada and my boyfriend lives in Germany, which makes it quite hard for us to see each other often. I’m 18 and he is 19. Currently we are in Canada together on a 2 week trip (Toronto - Ottawa - Montréal).

He has a long-time commitment of playing Dungeons and Dragons online with his friends every Saturday, for which sessions can usually be very long. Today I let him play during our train ride to Ottawa, but the session ended up taking much longer than planned and I ended up going for a walk by myself after we reached our AirBnb while he continued to play. We then went out to dinner and he paused playing and told his friends he would be back in 30 minutes, but we ended up taking much longer as our plans changed and he apologised to them for that. I thought that would be the last I’d hear of it, but no.

I told him that tomorrow we could finally sleep in, to which he replied ‘No, we have to do something before noon’. I asked why, and he said it’s because he has to play tomorrow afternoon. I asked how long he has to play — he said 5 hours, and I was absolutely astounded.

I told him that this is *our* trip together and that I barely get to see him and want to spend time together. He told me that it’s rude to just cancel on his friends and put their game on pause for the 2 weeks of our trip (they can’t play without him but of course nobody is forcing him to), and said that it’s not fair to him that I can’t let him play at least a couple sessions. That being said, AITA for really not wanting to allow/deal with this?

Edit: I’m not the controlling type, so by ‘allow’ I don’t mean that I’d tell him that he absolutely can’t do it. I let him do what he wants. I don’t *want* to allow it, but I do.

Edit 2: I know that d&amp;d definitely isn’t a video game, though I wasn’t sure what else to call it in the title (because he plays it online, something called roll20) :P

Edit 3: Thank you everyone for your replies. I ended up talking to him about it, and he told his group that he won’t be playing for the rest of our trip. He did, however, admit to me that he never would have chosen to not play on his own.",311,1368,0.96

Now, not surprisingly, these kids are an absolute handful. The 10mo is teething and has been dealing with an upset tummy, the 3yo is your typical small child running on high energy 24/7. Even when my sister and BIL get home from work I still help out by changing diapers, cleaning up, and entertaining the kids while they are occupied with other important things.

They just moved into a new place, which is the main reason I’m even here, and are currently unpacking and getting all moved in. Today is Saturday and it’s the first day I’ve been here where I haven’t been “on the clock” and let me tell you, my week has been EXHAUSTING. So today while they were hard at work around the house, I spend my time on my phone, playing a game on my computer, and even taking a pretty long nap. Dinner time just rolled around and things were pretty quiet. Later my sister told me it was incredibly rude that I slept all day instead of helping them unpack, or even “do as little as keeping the kids out of the way.” Now it’s true, I didn’t help them at all or even offer to, but does that make me an asshole? I’m tired and I’ve been looking forward to this lazy day all week, but now they’ve got me feeling bad because I was letting them struggle with unpacking, organizing, doing appliance installations and holding two kids down without so much as lifting a finger. I felt entitled to a much needed break while they felt I was obligated to help them work because we’re family.

So give it to me straight, am I the asshole?

TL;DR: I’m working as a live-in nanny for my sister and BIL. This weekend instead of helping them move into their new place I took a nap. They think that was rude. AITA?

990,Not the A-hole,"So let's call this girl Jen. We were friends from elementary school on, we're in our twenties now. I kinda started drifting from her in high school after I came out to her and she accused me of being in love with her (I'm a bisexual woman and she's a lesbian). It was around this time she started talking online to kids about five or six years younger than her. I thought it was kind of weird but i brushed it off for a while.

It was also around this time she started to get paranoid-- she had been bullied pretty severely for years so it wasn't shocking for her to think others disliked her, but this was intense. She became convinced that the entire staff of the school was united against her and would frequently make long Facebook posts about it. I encouraged Jen to seek therapy. She stopped going after a few months because she said the therapist was against her as well. We grew apart even more as the years passed and by the time college was done, we were hanging out maybe twice a year tops and talking even less.

That takes us to the present. She's dropped most of her friends to talk to more children from ages 15-17. She calls herself their ""mommy"". She still makes long, convoluted posts about how the staff of our old high school (which she still regularly visits) are conspiring against her.  I'm a teacher and being associated with something that has even the appearance of being inappropriate could destroy my career. I also am in a very conservative area and work with Jen's mother. Anything she said to her mother would without a doubt be passed around to our coworkers, and that includes my sexuality.

I was worried she would out me to her mother if I confronted her, and that's why I ghosted. I blocked her on everything except text (I forgot) and she texted me a few weeks later asking what the hell happened. I told her that although I still cared about her, I believed our friendship was unhealthy and I wished her the best. She got very angry and I proceeded to block her there too.

My girlfriend never bothered deleting Jen off Facebook. So she saw her status a few weeks later about her ""ex best friend"" which contained details obviously specific to me, about how I ruined her life, am a lying whore, have no friends, etc. Jen's friends are texting me saying I'm an awful person and ruined her life.

I know her mental state is precarious at best, and that's why I feel like I may have done something wrong. I would never want to hurt someone who's clearly suffering so much, but her relationships with these children are so inappropriate. I would never ghost someone if the situation weren't so extreme.

I received a wedding invitation a few weeks ago addressed to “Mr. (boyfriend) and Ms. (me).” I’m a doctor, and consider it proper etiquette to have my title included on a formal invitation. The RSVP card space where we were expected to write our names read “M________”, so I crossed out the M and wrote “Dr. (my name) and Mr. (my boyfriend).” This isn’t a casual backyard wedding, it’s black-tie.

I was expressing my annoyance to our mutual male doctor friend, and found out that she addressed his invitation with the appropriate title.

He posts all the time on Facebook about how his ex is committing “parental alienation” by not answering his messages, blocking him on Facebook, and won’t let him come over to see his kids. He’s also quite vocal about these complaints at family gatherings and such when people ask where his kids are.

However, the reality of the situation is that his ex blocked him on Facebook because he tagged her in a meme that basically implied that he would laugh if she died. He got upset because he couldn’t send her Facebook messages and conveniently left out the part where he has an app that is court monitored and is available for him to reach out about the kids. On top of that, he only reaches out about seeing his kids when its convenient for him, which is usually after 7 or 8 pm when his kids are either sleeping or about to go to bed. 

I don’t know the exact circumstances around his ex getting full custody and him getting only visitation, but whenever someone suggests going to court for all of these complaints, he brushes it off saying he’s just trying to make money right now to give his kids a better future, in spite of the fact that he sees his kids so rarely that he posts about it every time he’s spending time with them, and that’s maybe once a month. I’ve talked to him about this is private but all he gives is excuses. He’s completely poisoned my family against the mother of his children, however, and that’s what really bothers me about the situation.

Here’s where I may have been the asshole: during a family dinner, he was ranting about his ex taking so much of his paycheck for child support.

I ask why he can’t use the custody app. He loses his shit and cusses me out, tells me I’m a shit person who doesn’t understand what he’s going through and he storms out.

1000,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

So basically, I have a friend that I met online that I've known for about 5 years now. Recently I got a new job and I make pretty decent money for once. Me and this friend has been wanting to meet up for quite some time, and I managed to find a good deal on a flight/hotels so I flew out to Texas from California yesterday morning. 

First day/night went good explored the city, got some food, had some drinks/sex. But, today is basically what's pissing me the hell off. Friend claims she'll be back because she needs to fill her gas tank, and she wants me to stay back and watch her dog. That's fine, gas station is nearby should take what 10-15 minutes tops? Thanks to Snapchat having that creepy feature where you can see on the map where your friends are (I recommend opting-out if you like privacy, or are going to lie to somebody about your whereabouts.) I pretty much got curious/concerned where she was at because 30 minutes passed, not answering calls or text. So looked her up on the map. Saw that she's basically is on the waaaaaay other side of the city at someone's apartment. 

I'm in a bit of a moral dilemma because, well I don't want to abandon her dog. But, I'm also just really debating on saying fuck this shit and just up and leave. It just rubs me the wrong way that I basically spent all this money to fly out to Texas to spend time with a friend, and get basically ditched on my last full day in the state. Especially because I've been sitting up in this hotel alone basically. Honestly, I could've stayed my ass in California and did that for way cheaper. 

Basically, the room isn't in my name and if I do leave the dog (which I don't want to do) she'll be financially responsible for any damage, or mess the dog makes.

Mum divorced dad when I was ~10, lost contact with my much older sister when I was ~12 and again with my slightly older sister when I was ~15. “It’s all their faults and they’re assholes”.

Mum doesn’t deal well with any of this, going out on weekends and coming home after midnight, locking herself in her room, bringing random guys home, crying a lot.

When I’m 20 I meet my (now) wife and have a baby with milk intolerance (followed by 2 other children within next 4 years). Mum reports me to social services for neglect (“not feeding first child properly”). They find no problems but we now have a red marker so my wife can no longer do teacher training or anything. All is forgiven after a few months as she apologised and says she won’t get involved. Admits at the time that she won’t get as attached to my younger 2 children because of the grief she suffered.

Children now 4, 6 and 8, I’m now 30. Mum still clearly favourites oldest child. She raged at me the other day for bullying my oldest child because she looks at me before answering questions such as can she have a second ice lolly at 9 in the morning because she knows she shouldn’t. Apparently she also seems “withdrawn” but no evidence of this except what mum says she sees. Child doing great at school socially and academically, enjoys after school clubs like dance and church club (like youth club at the church). Spoke to daughter privately and she says she thinks she’s my favourite (as do they all of course!).

I feel anxious every time I go round mums (twice a week) because I don’t want to upset her. She gets upset if I’m half an hour late or if I say they can’t have biscuits before lunch. I said to her at the start of her rage to drop it and not go there again. She just kept repeating I should be ashamed of myself and I’m a bully with no explanation. She says I’m “not worth the spit she could spit on me”.

She texts next day wanting to face time children and I say no. Would be going round tomorrow but clearly no intention to. She’s never supported me in any way only doubted me.

Difficult part for me is that she has nobody without my family and is now nearly 70 and has occasional vertigo (BPPV). Don’t want to leave her on her own. She’ll be depressed and possibly ill. Same time don’t want her in my life because constant judging, stress and anxiety.

I was at work during the day while she stayed at my house. She used uber to get around, go shopping and we would regroup back at my house go out for drinks, dinner etc.  

I assumed, She had been using the shower while at my house but that didn’t appear to be the case And it was very noticeable.

We have all smelled horrible B.O. so you know what I’m describing.  And this was my own family. I don’t see her too often and wondered if this was just her thing.  So now I’m thinking if I should say anything. She has a 4 hour flight going back to Florida.   I finally think it through and tell her that her body odor is pretty ripe and try to laugh it off thinking she might be embarrassed.  Maybe say thanks and take care of it. Nope. She got very defensive.   Said she uses deodorant etc.  

I tell her maybe she can’t smell it but trust me whoever she sits next to on the plane is not going to like it and may cause a scene

At this point her pride is wounded, but she does go and take a shower.  She cleans up and now I’m getting the silent treatment. We get In the car and head to airport. Won’t speak a word to me. 30 min ride of uncomfortable silence 

Drop her off at the curb. Takes her bags and heads in. No goodbye, no thanks for the hospitality, nothing.  I shrug and drive home.

Part of me wants to tell her she can come because it's his first birthday but the other part says fuck that. There is never any consequence to what she says or does when she's been drinking. She gets so drunk and forgets then expects us to go back to normal. She may forget but I still remember everything she says when she's drunk.

1018,Not the A-hole,"A little back story I have a twin sister, let’s call her Emily,  and we’re quite close, although we aren’t identical we look similar. My friend knows that she’s my sister. I was hanging out with her and a few of our mutual friends having lunch and my sister excused herself to use the restroom. One of my friends starts things like, “Emily is thicc af” and “sometimes I can’t help but stare”, I wish I could hit that”. I was already thinking wtf does this dumbass know she’s my sister. Then he confirms and says OP can you put in a good word for me. I got up and yelled what the actual f*ck dude that’s my sister you’re talking about, if you’re going to talk like that than leave. My sister returned a few minutes later and I got up and told her what he said and she said I shouldn’t have yelled but you could tell she was not very comfortable. Some of my friends later told me I shouldn’t have yelled at him and I should apologize, currently I’m not on speaking terms to the ones that think I’m in the wrong.

1020,Not the A-hole,"Hey all!

So my fiancé and I are getting married next year. Yay! This should be super fun and we are just kicking off the planning process.

It has been fun, my fiancé and I both agreed we want a small wedding since we have waaayyyy to many uncles and aunts and cousins. It would be massive if we invited everyone(250+). We decided early on that we’d invite immediate family and god parents and our close friends.

However, MIL wants aunts and uncles and cousins. She is giving us more if we invite aunts and uncles and less if we don’t invite her brothers sisters and their kids. The real catch is the money she’s putting up wouldn’t cover the increase in guests, not to mention we don’t want a massive wedding in the first place. She’s basically used the money to manipulate my fiancé and I into agreeing to inviting more guests. Now we are inviting my fiancé’s extended family and not mine, which cold certainly get weird. We don’t want a big expensive wedding, we don’t want to go into debt for one day of festivities.

She’s even doing it with my fiancé’s dress now. She says if my Fiancé gets the dress she wants, which MiL doesn’t like, fiancé has to pay for it. If she gets the one MIL likes, MIL helps pay.

I want to love my MIL as best I can but I kind of blew up about it to my fiancé, and my fiancé is upset from all angles because now I’m mad and she’s mad and her mom is mad that I’m not willing to invite people. MIL thinks we should be grateful that she’d be willing to pitch in more, but she also seems to think since we’re over thirty she shouldn’t have to do all that much, despite her knowing her daughter is in massive debt from masters degree college loans.

AITA for not being grateful for the fluctuating monetary gift to our wedding?",42,123,0.95

1024,Not the A-hole,"So, today I was asked to come to a restaurant by a recruiter after I applied to the job online.
As I am only 16 y/o, it’s difficult for me to find a job, so I was really excited. 
It was a 30 minute trip, and I had to give up babysitting in order for me to get to the meeting. Keep in mind that is like 30/40 bucks gone.
As I arrive at the restaurant, which by the way is very popular and well-known in my city, a staff member shows me this recruiter, and we start the meeting.
The meeting didn’t last very long, because the moment the guy saw I was 16y/o (I handed him my ID), he told me you had to be 17y/o to be even considered for the job. My resume has my birth date on it.
I was pissed, especially because he didn’t apologize once, and just told me I should return when I turn 17 (December).
I am back home now, and I am probably going to send him an angry message saying that he wasted my time, that he made me miss out on a lot of money and that his only job is to see if people check all the boxes for the job, which he clearly messed up.

I then remembered that at my orientation the manager asked me if I wanted to donate one dollar from every paycheck to a charity. I remember that I declined that. So either the manager made a mistake or did that without my consent. Yeah it's only a dollar but it adds up.,54,256,0.96
1026,Asshole,"I started dating my now wife when my stepdaughter (SD) was 13. She was an unruly child who constantly cried and whined and lashed out for attention. My wife couldn't take SD's crap anymore so she kicked her out when she was 14. SD moved in with her father, who's a jerk to me and my wife but he did a good job disciplining SD. He had turned her into a nice, quiet and obedient child.

SD continued to behave and treat us with respect until she moved to another city when she was 24. She stopped coming home for holidays. My wife was devastated, but she understood that SD needed to have a life of her own.

SD is 28 now, and the angry emails started coming 2 years ago. They're incoherent rant-filled emails with all kinds of outlandish accusations toward my wife. Lots of accusations of neglect and abuse being thrown around. More accusations of favoring her siblings over her. My wife tried to justify herself in the beginning but it only made SD angrier, so my wife decided to ignore these emails altogether. Every time my wife gets one of these nasty emails, she breaks down crying. She has had to call off work to recoup from the pain of reading these emails. I've spent countless hours comforting my wife and telling her that she was not the problem and SD just needed therapy to deal with her own issues instead of taking them out on my wife.

My wife has another daughter who's SD's younger sister. Honestly, she's much nicer and gets along with my wife. She goes to my wife every time she has a problem and my wife helps her out. She treats my wife with respect and there's nothing but love between the two of them. They have an excellent mother-daughter relationship. SD has always been very jealous of her sister, and she resents the wonderful relationship her mother and sister have.

Last November, SD's younger sister found out she was pregnant, and the baby's father skipped out on her. Of course, she came to my wife for comfort. We offered to let her move in with us until she got back on her feet. SD found out what happened and she flipped out. My wife got yet another angry email. SD accused her always making time for her younger sister and not her. My wife was stressed out about the pregnancy so she ignored SD's email. I read it and decided that enough was enough. I emailed SD. Told her to stop living in the past and if she treated her mother better, she'd have a relationship with her like her younger sister does.

Of course SD got pissed off. She sent everyone in the family a goodbye letter and cut all of us out of her life. My wife is devastated and they're all blaming me for driving her away. I thought that she was just bluffing for attention, but it's been 8 months and none of us have heard a peep from her. I still think I did the right thing by putting her in her place. She probably felt that no one would take her crap anymore so she fled. But I still feel bad for driving a bigger wedge between her and her mother. AITA?

**EDIT: RIP my inbox. I wanted to clarify something: I did NOT kick SD out. Her mother was the only one who did that. I wasn't even living there at that time. We got married when SD was 20. I have NO children with my wife. All of the children are hers with her ex. I have no biological children of my own. My wife made some mistakes with SD and she feels very terrible about it. My only issue with SD is the way she treats my wife. She needs to deal with her anger on her own. It's not my nor my wife's responsibility to placate her, and my wife does not need to deal with her abusive emails.**",964,3004,0.91

1029,Not the A-hole,"Background: I work in an office that is open Mon-Fri all year, with a skeleton crew who works Saturdays during our busy season. 

One of the other associates scheduled to work Saturday brought their grandkid to work (5 years old?) Maybe it was an emergency, I didn't ask because it's not my business. The entire 6 hours he was there he went from desk to desk talking to all the other employees.  He tried to get me to leave my desk to walk with him a number of times, was disturbeding everyone all day, answering our reception phones (receptionist was not working, throwimg someone chair yoga ball down isles, moving things from peoples desks who weren't scheduled, and overall just being a huge distraction.  His grandma (my associate) ignored him nearly the entire time. I even (loudly so she could hear me) told him I was busy and needed to get my work done more than once, which she also ignored. 

WIBTA for complaining to my manager? She is a really nice lady and I hate to cause a problem if it was an emergency situation, but really... I'm not a babysitter.

1030,Asshole,"I met a girl on Tinder last year and then we chatted for a while but I made it clear that I was only looking for a hook up, a one night stand. To make long story short, she agreed to invite me to her apartment, which was situated across the city. She was also only looking for sex so she said we should not give our numbers to each other.  She also asked me to grab some food and drinks at McDonald on my way to her place. 

When I got there, I sent here some messages which she failed to reply and I had to wait for almost an hour and then I found she had blocked me on Tinder and since she had told me earlier to meet her in the lobby first, I had no idea which apartment was hers. I went home that night feeling so fuckin upset, not only for being stood up, but also being lied to. I mean if she had changed her mind at least she could have told me. 

A few days ago, during lunch at work, my good friend invited me to a birthday party of this girl he's been seeing for weeks. He was so crazy about her and he seemed so happy believing she's the one. Yes and guess what? This girl was the same one who stood me up months ago. 

I still felt upset so I told him about her, at first he told me that I had probably mistaken her for another girl, so I showed him a screenshot of her Tinder profile. This is the part where I think I may be the asshole. I told him ""That girl stood me up, dude. She's a player. What if she fucked up with you too? You don't trust and take people like her seriously.""

Some of our female colleagues, think that it was inappropriate for me to tell him about what had happened between the girl and me, since she did not stand him up and it looks like a serious relationship. And now because of my act of assholery, he would probably change his mind about her since we're really good friends.  But I don't believe people can change overnight. Am I The Asshole here?

EDIT : Here's the lowdown on what really happened that night. I was a basketcase. Tired af after a rough day at work and had just gone through a nasty break up so All I really wanted was sex. I am not the type of guy who looks for sex at a brothel or such so I got on Tinder and we matched. I saw that she was also not looking for anything serious so I dropped her a message introduced myself etc etc. 

She asked me what I was looking for and I told her exactly what. I told her I was feeling tired and terrible and just wanted to hook up, and she said that's what she was looking for too. Fun sex between two people, no bullshit. I initiated having a drink or two perhaps first so we could decide if we still wanted to do it and she said no need to. She was horny af as well. She said she was having a problem at work and needed something to take her mind off it for a while. 

I asked for her Whatsapp number so she could send me her location but she said no. Because it was going to be a one night stand only, no need to share numbers. So she gave me her adress and the name of her apartment complex and I was like ""So we're going to have sex at your apartment now?"" and she said ""What? You're not sure about it?"" I said ""Well then I'm coming"" and then she asked me if it's possible to grab some food and drink at McDonald because she just got back from work and hadn't had dinner. I said ok. 

Then you know what happened later. To people who sent me those DMs accusing me of being a pervert or forcing myself on her or doing something creepy, if I had indeed been creepy, why would she have invited me over to her apartment then? If she was nervous and changed her mind, why didn't she at least tell me instead of having me wait for her in the lobby for almost an hour, giving no reply to my messages and then blocking me?
I had the screenshot of her profile and could have asked around to locate her apartment but that wpuld have only made me a creep so I decided to leave though I was really upset. 
Yes I came there for sex and only because she had invited me over. Not becauce I forced myself on her. She gave me her goddamn address.

And yes I was still a bit hurtful that she stood me up and a bit shocked that someone could be that immature. So the reason why I told my friend was more because in my head I had already seen her as a player, meaning she only gets on tinder to mess around with people just for fun. If she hadn't been really sure about me coming over to her place so we could fuck,  why did she ask me to get some food and drink on my way to her place then? 
And she could have blocked me earlier instead of having me wait for her for almost an hour. 
So yes. I figured she's one of those people who play around with you. And I did not like tell my friend to break up with her. I simply told him what happened that night. She invited me over to her  place, asked me to get her food and drink, stood me up, had me wait for an hour, only to block me.",186,306,0.92

1033,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. TLDR at Bottom.

I'm a chef in [LARGE CITY]. Moved here from [SMALLER TOWN] and this is my first work place since moving. I'm a chef with 10 years experience.

I've been working at this restaurant for 4 months. At first everything seemed great; it's one of the best teams I've ever worked with, everyone is an awesome person. The food is delicious, hours are good, and pay is not BAD for starting out with no ""big city"" experience.

Then I started to notice things. I'll list a few:

* Head chef didn't wear gloves, only lightly rinsed hands when going between meat and veg.
* Sometimes allergy requests (like no cheese) are ignored and/or mocked unless I make them.
* We have roaches. Bad. No exterminator; they've laid down powder once in 3 months. They are in fridges and sometimes on take-out containers.

All of those things I think I maybe could've possibly looked past as a shitty workplace and eventually moved onto greener pastures, but this last one tipped me over the edge.

Our hot water supply system broke. A month ago... and it's not fixed. The mechanic / tech has been in to see it, but even that was only two weeks ago. So for a month we've been a restaurant operating without any hot water. Thankfully the dish washer is self-heating, however there's no hot water for hand washing, and if we want hot water for cleaning floors / surfaces, sanitizing equipment, or using in the 3 sink system we need to boil it and most of the staff haven't been bothering. All of our laundry (like our coats and rags) are also being run on cold cycle even though I think it's supposed to be hot as well.

I was always drilled that a kitchen with not hot water was a closed kitchen, so I've been asking nearly every day when it'll be fixed (especially because everyone else doesn't seem to see a problem!). In the middle of last week my chef finally snapped at me and said ""It'll be fixed when it's fixed!"" and stomped away. I sat on that for a few days but really started to feel anxious about it. We served HUNDREDS of people a day, what if we kill someone because of this shit?

So I filed an anonymous online complaint with the local Health Department. I made it sound like it'd come from one of the customers. I know if a health inspector shows up this coming week we'll be shut down in an instant, and my co-workers have bills and kids... but I just couldn't stomach the thought of putting out food that might put someone in the hospital.

So, AITA for making the report? Should I have made a bigger stink at work instead? I just feel really guilty.

**TLDR: Chef working in a restaurant in a big city, very well trafficked. Multiple health violations happening, but the biggest being no hot water for almost a month. No one seems to care, worried about making someone sick, so I reporting us to the Health Department. I feel like I've jeopardized my co-workers lives though with a possible work shut down. AITA for making a report?**",53,102,0.97
1034,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway. My future husband and I are holding a small, elopement-style wedding this year with only immediate family members invited. Initially we wanted to elope without anyone invited, but since my fiancé's parents are traditional and this milestone is important to them, we want to incorporate them.

My fiancé's family is on the opposite coast, so needed to book travel to come to our city.

My future husband has two sisters, but he is not on speaking terms with his older sister. He has a very clear and understandable reason for this: when she was a teenager, and he was a young boy, she did something terrible to him that I can't repeat in this subreddit. His whole immediate family knows about this situation, and they also know his feelings about the sister he's estranged from. All of them are still very much connected to the older sister, who lives with their parents and is in treatment on and off for drug addiction.

I went to get a family head count from his younger sister (wedding planning, some of them are also staying with us) and she vaguely revealed that travel had also been booked for the older sister; they intended to bring her to our wedding. After hearing this information, I immediately connected with my fiancé, who expressed in no uncertain terms that he did not want his older sister at our wedding. Of course he doesn't - I wouldn't either if I were him. I asked if he would like backup support from me when speaking to his family about the issue, and he said yes.

We got on the phone with his younger sister. My fiancé expressed his feelings to her - albeit not perfectly, as he's very upset that they booked her travel without talking to him. I tried my best to acknowledge that though I understood his younger sister's attempt to bridge the family gap, that the older sister is also unwelcome by me at the wedding, and that I would prefer if she did not travel here at all because it would be difficult and awkward to coordinate family events without inviting her to them.

I don't use the word ""tantrum"" lightly, but I do believe his younger sister threw a bit of a tantrum. She started to cry, said that their father would never agree to come if the other sister was not welcome, and that the older sister's children will not understand why their mother is being excluded (they don't know). I stayed calm but very firm no matter what she brought up. Of course we want their father there, and I hoped he could bring himself to come, but there wasn't any wriggle room on whether older sister was invited.

Since our talk, younger sister hasn't replied to any emails or texts about trip coordination. I'm new to a family dynamic that I'm frankly unfamiliar with, so I worry that I've misstepped and put myself in bad favor with them. He cares about his family even though they're not being considerate when it comes to this issue. I want my fiancé to feel supported and affirmed, but should I have done that privately with him instead of vocally to his family? Am I the asshole for involving myself?",32,34,0.97
1035,Not the A-hole,"I work at a bar and there is a regular customer that comes who I think has ALS or something along those lines. Shes been coming for a while and all of the other regulars treat her really nicely. Some buy her food and drinks but she cant really pick things up so we put her beer in a cup with a straw and someone usually is there to hold the cup for her so she can drink or help her eat.

We'll call this girl Kelly for now. Yesterday Kelly went up to my boss and said something then my boss asked me to come help her. It wasnt till we rounded the corner to the bathrooms that I realized that Kelly needed to go to the bathroom. Since she cant really move around it's a whole 2 person process of picking her up to get her bottoms off then putting her on the toilet, wiping her, picking her up to pull her bottoms back on and getting her back into her chair. When we were done I asked why Kelly didnt just bring a caretaker with her when she came and my boss said she wanted to be independent and not have to be taken care of. 

My thing is is that she already is being taken care of,  just instead of it being a person who gets paid to, its random people at out bar who do it for her. I really dont ever want to help her go to the bathroom again because for me it's just really uncomfortable and also just not part of my job at all. But I seem to be the only one who has a problem with it everyone else seems more then willing to help her with whatever she needs. Which kinda makes me feel like maybe I'm just being an asshole about this whole thing. And if I am being an asshole I'm worried that telling my boss I don't want to help care for Kelly might put me in a bad light with co workers and regulars.

No one at the BBQ disciplined the kids and let them run wild. These were expensive floats as well. 

My father has a very nice hammock in the backyard. He told me to not let anyone on it. Two of the kids (who happen to be very over weight for their age) kept jumping on it.

When he came home he was pissed at my mother for letting the kids run wild. He said if anything happened we would be liable since it’s our pool and she needs to let people know they need to discipline their kids. He then said she was responsible for replacing and paying for the floats. My aunt chimed in and said that the kids were just having fun and that me and my father are both racist.

My husband’s sister got married Friday evening. There was a church ceremony and a evening reception. Leading up to the event, me and the other women in the family shared what we were wearing to make sure nothing overlapped or was too similar. It all worked out fine.

Then, at the evening reception, my BIL’s girlfriend showed up in this stunning red gown that was nearly identical to mine. Same off the shoulder neckline, same colour, same skirt, the only difference was the material. I was extremely pissed. I didn’t say anything to her during the reception, but a lot of people were complimenting her gown and saying she looked beautiful, gorgeous, etc.

She said she was sorry, but at the last minute she decided that she liked the red gown better and that she didn’t remember what mine looked like. She told me to “chill out” and “stop overreacting.”

I just feel like she’s trying to upstage me for some reason. Of course people were going to compare us since we were wearing basically the same thing and sitting at the same table.

I invited some friends from my hometown and booked the rooms, since I get a big hotel discount. I worked overtime for 2 weeks and used the extra money as a budget to set aside for my weekend in the city. While we were out, I got a massive bucket drink under the agreement that everyone would venmo me for part of the cost split up equally. My hometown friends were also in agreement that they would pay me back for the room. As the night went on, one friend refused to pay for cover or drinks, and kept trying to tell everyone where she wanted to go and refused to go on my birthday, so I got fed up and told her if she didn’t want to pay for anything and kept throwing a fit about going to where she wanted to go then she could go home, which she did. I paid for the rest of their covers because one of their cards wouldn’t work and the other had to pay a huge service fee for withdrawing, under the agreement I would be paid back with venmo. In total, they owe me about $150, which isn’t a lot to some, but it is to me as a broke grad student, and it blew my budget for going out. 

They refuse to pay me back- one of them agreed to venmo me and then when I mentioned it the next day, she smirked and said she never had venmo and would never download it. The other two are similar. I tried texting and calling them with no response, and when I sent a paragraph a week and a half later, one of them accused me of being heartless for asking her to pay me back while her dog was in the hospital (which she never mentioned to me at all), and then refused to pay me back, saying I would get the money whenever she felt like sending it. The other two want my exact banking info (routing and account number) to pay me back. When I refused and suggested paypal, venmo, or cashapp, they got angry at me and then stopped responding, leading me to think it’s a scam. When my dad passed and they came to my house for the first time, they kept making side comments on how “rich” I was, how big the house is, the cars in the driveway, etc even though financially, I’m on my own and have been since undergrad. 

I’ve been close friends with them for over a decade and am in shock they’d pull something like this. Everytime I ask them about paying me back, they get incredibly angry/offended that I’m asking them to pay me back. AITA for cutting them off over them owing me only 50 each?",41,86,0.94

1047,Not the A-hole,"I invited a friend to stay with me after she lost her job then her apartment. She'd spent some time with two different cousins and was now facing living in her car. For context, this friend's situation is entirely of her own making. Her mother died a couple years ago and left her a sizeable chunk of money which she completely blew through in less than 18 months. She did get a job but had her depression classified as a disability and was constantly taking days off due to mental exhaustion (she worked remotely). The company fired her for taking a week of with the flu (perfectly valid) then taking mental health days when it was time for her to come back. She missed two very important deadlines so they were within their rights for fire her for cause. When I asked her to stay I was going through a tough time - I'd just been forced to put my cat (and best friend) down and had suffered a miscarriage. 

This arrangement was supposed to be for two weeks while she got word on a job she'd interviewed for. She made some incredibly tone deaf demands of the company (High salary, insane signing bonus, etc.) and they declined to make her an offer. This happened maybe 3 times before I explained to her that at her age (45) and with her spotty at best work record, no company in their right mind would give her what she wants.

And now it's been 3 months. I am an introvert with anxiety and depression issues. She did finally get a job, but she tends to spend all her money within 3 days of payday and provides no help financially. She doesn't clean or cook. And I need my time alone to recharge after working all day. But it's difficult when she's here if she's not working. I'm over all of this. I keep hesitating because if I put her out I'm basically forcing her to live in her car. Before her mother died, she'd instructed their family not to take my friend in if she'd gotten in just this predicament. 

TLDR; AITA for putting out a friend who is homeless?",59,281,0.96
1048,Asshole,"Five months ago I asked my cousin if she could sit in the car while I run inside and get my PPD read for my physical for this brand new job, she said yes. Once I got off work, she said she was feeling too lazy. So I leave it at that, and go to my 'appointment'. I park in the bike lane, and run inside and write my name down. I come back outside 10 minutes later to move my car, and no bs, there's a ticket that was placed on my windshield LITERALLY 3 minutes after I went inside. 125$ for 3 minutes in the bike lane! I was furious.

I get home, and she's there. I completely ignore her, and just go lay down. I didn't want anything to do with her.

I haven't spoken to her since, rejected phone calls, ignored text messages. Just flat out ignore her. I avoid going to my grandmas house because I know she'd be there. Her daughter has come over sometimes to play on my switch, and just wait until her mom gets off work, but I barely pay any attention to her. (Mainly because she has said that I'm not family to her anymore)

Thing is, she used to live with me when I was unemployed, and during this time, I would bring her daughter to school and pick her up Monday - Friday, and I would take my cousin to work 20 minutes away on Mondays and pick her up on Fridays. (She worked as a in home nurse) Which even sometimes, the weekend nurse who relieved my cousin, would come late, or not show up at all, and I would wait outside for hours, waiting for my cousin to come out. Since I was unemployed at this time, she would give me some money, and pay for my meals.

I was never upset over the amount of the ticket, I'm just mad over the fact that I spent 2 to 4 months doing all this for her and her daughter, and she was too lazy to sit in the car for an hour.

AITA?

Edit: Absolutely love how every single comment was fixated on the parking, but not the actual dilemma here. Asking if I'm the asshole after being her 'chauffeur' for 3 months, and how she couldn't help me out by sitting in the car for an hour. Clearly I was the asshole for parking in the bike lane for 10 minutes, yikes, crucify me.",47,38,0.68

1050,Not the A-hole,"For context, my parents recently went away on a holiday leaving me (19) and my sister (17) to look after the dogs and watch the house. I have had to walk the dogs every morning due to circumstances around our neighborhood, and so woke up earlier then normal in order to beat the heat. Because of this I went to sleep at around 11, later then I usually would but I know my sister stays up late and was trying to avoid her waking me up.

&#x200B;

My sister smokes, and has chosen an area just below my window as her smoking area. I would like to say that, although I disapprove of smoking in general, I have never had a go at her for smoking. The issue arises when she decided that she was going to be on the phone to one of her friends. She is a loud person in general so I could hear her and her friend so I assume she had her phone on loud speaker.

&#x200B;

Every night for the past week she has woken me up with her talking, and every night I have asked her to either be quiet or move to the end of the garden where I shouldn't be able to hear her. Last night I had had enough when I texted her to be quiet and she replied with 'shame' So I got a bottle of water and dumped it on her from my window. It is warm in the UK recently and she came inside immediately.

Just a few more details and an update

The room window was closed - I very rarely have it open in the first place.

As I mentioned my parents were away, whilst out my mum was having surgery (nothing serious just having a gastric band put in) so I did not want to bother them with my pain of a sister.

She has done the same recently except in her own room which is next to mine and I can still hear her. My mum is recovering from her surgery so she isnt able to help, but I could hear she was on a group chat (11pm and I wake up at 6:45 for work) so I turned off the Wifi, which seems to work.

I would like to mention my main issue is that she has the option to either text or do this during the day, not at night whilst we are trying to sleep.",43,306,0.97
1051,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have been together for 3 years, for the first 2 years I tried my best to form a positive relationship with my mother-in-law who has a very difficult personality (passive aggressive, not warm or kind). 

In November 2017 she divorced my fiancé’s step dad (who raised my husband).They had planned to retire together in Georgia and she went down a couple months early to get things “ready.” She ended up filling for divorce and having the man who sold her the home move in with her during that time. She immediately asked if she could bring her new beau to our wedding, we told her no as the step dad was completely devastated by the divorce and apparent infidelity after over 20 years of marriage, and we didn’t want the man who raised my husband to be uncomfortable on such a memorable day. 

Long story short she didn’t end up coming to the wedding and did not return calls or texts that I left her in an attempt to mend the relationship leading up to the wedding. 

She had not spoken to us in 6 months and unfriended us on Facebook so we did not tell her when we found at we were pregnant. She found out we were pregnant from my husband’s step dad with whom we maintain a positive relationship. 

Fast forward to now. I’m almost 9 months pregnant and we have not spoken to her in nearly a year. Her first communication was to my husband asking if they could talk. I told my husband I support whatever he wants to do. Their first conversation was mostly small talk until the end when she said she would be coming for the birth to which he told her no given that this was literally the first interaction they had in nearly a year and she had still not spoken to me who is giving birth to the child. The conversation devolved from there. 

A few days later she sent him a message saying she was upset by missing the birth but would wait to come until 2 weeks later so we had adequate time to bond with the baby. My husband again told her no, that she still had not spoken to me and in his perspective lost her privilege of being involved in our lives because of her actions over the past year and her obvious disregard for me. 

She asked if this meant she is out of his and the baby’s life forever. My husband has not responded and frankly doesn’t want a relationship with her because all she brings is drama and negativity to our lives. 

Are we the assholes for not wanting her in our / our child’s lives?

1052,Asshole,"Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. In all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend!

1053,Asshole,"Alright a little background.

I’ve been close friends with this person (let’s call her T) and we are pretty open and straightforward with each other. We went to the same high school and are now going to the same college. 

At college, T becomes good friends with another girl (now referred to as L). T and L start hanging out with a new guy, and as I’m a mutual friend I meet him as well. When they are gone, he talks about how he is very interested he is in L. This surprises me because they’ve only met very recently. He says he thinks that it is God’s plan for him and L to get married. This unfortunately isn’t all that uncommon as I go to a religious college and people often use God to justify who they want to bone. He eventually confessed his feelings to L, but she turns him down.

Cut to a couple weeks later, and the guy and T have started dating. They are happy together, and T asks me what I think of him while we are talking over coffee. I say I’m skeptical about his interests because it wasn’t that long ago he thought it was divinely ordained for him to marry someone else, and it seems like he just settled for T after he couldn’t get with L. I can tell she’s very upset that I’d say that, but I was just trying to be real with her.

1054,Not the A-hole,"So I work in a deli, and the way our department works is there are 2 managers, one being head manager and the other being second in charge. 

Well, our second in charge manager is a total jerk. She's rude, condescending, and basically acts like a child all of the time. She will tell you you're doing a terrible job, you're too slow when you're moving as fast as you can (it's a busy deli), and worst of all, she never does anything at all to help. She never helps customers, never takes the time to cut any of our online orders - all she does is yell at everyone else to move faster. 

For whatever reason in particular, she targets me quite a bit. She tells me I'm way too slow when in reality I move faster than most of the other workers (I'm one of the youngest there), and always picks on me for everything. One example is I had a floral tank top under my work shirt, and you could see it sticking out of the bottom. She came up to me and said, ""that is the ugliest shirt I have ever seen"". Another example is when she messed up my schedule (I had class all day a few days a week and they scheduled me anyway) and when confronted, she denied it like a child: http://imgur.com/gallery/yJWNb4d

Well, she is now up for taking over as head manager, meaning she will now have full control over the deli. I honestly fear for the future of this deli (not that I particularly care about that, more about my coworkers). WIBTA if I reported her for this behavior? I have 2 co-workers that say they'll have my back because they feel the same way, but a few of my co-workers say to just let it be, she's trying her best and she deserves a chance to run the deli and prove herself.",46,164,0.96
1055,Not the A-hole,"Names changed for obvious reasons. Nick is what I’d call an acquaintance. Me, him, and 4 other people were all on the same track team in high school (we’re all 18-20), and have a GroupMe to keep in touch. I’m one of the three girls in the group. 

I didn’t used to Reddit, but nick would often send posts from subs like relationship advice or amitheasshole about crazy things that happened. Well I finally bit the bullet and made an account. He would still frequently send posts and we’d sometimes discuss in the group chat about what we thought about the situation. 

Well like 5 days ago, he sent a post about a kid cussing out a cashier for condoms or whatever. He said what he thought of it as I browsed the thread and by chance, I happened to find a guy who commented something very similar to what Nick was saying. 

I browsed the profile out of curiosity and two things are for sure; it’s 100% Nick (he posted on amiugly) and his post history is absolutely **DISGUSTING**. I knew from what he sent in the GroupMe that I didn’t agree a lot about what he said, but it turns out he said his most tame opinions; it turns out he posts to a LOT of subs like /r/braincels, /r/mensrights /r/MGTOW, just to name a few. He would comment words like “cuck” and would say he’s forever alone because the vast majority of women are shallow wh*res who just wants to fuck good-looking people (he’s not even a bad looking guy! Just a little short at 5’6)

Well I screenshotted some of the worst things he said and sent it to the group chat. I @‘d him and told him that the things he’d say are disgusting and I no longer will associate with him. I then said I was leaving the GroupMe but everyone was free to create a new one without him if they’d wish, and then I left. 

The girls in the group quickly made a new one but two of the guys group messaged told me what I did was a bitchy move and I shouldn’t have gone through his Reddit account. 

I told them I had no interest in not exposing disgusting human behavior and if they want to justify it, they can fuck off too.

1060,Asshole,"Mate and I (both 26 & 27M) flew from Madrid to Frankfurt for the wedding of our friend who lives there now and used seat selection to pick an aisle for him and a window for me in the same row hoping it would be empty and no one sat there.

A woman also in her 20s came and realised she was in the middle seat and that my mate and I knew each other. She asked if she could not in the middle of us.

We said ""should have seat selected then, no"".

She explained that this is her connecting flight via codeshare and she could only seat select on the main legs of her flight with the airline operating them, but not this ticket. (Frankfurt to Singapore and then Singapore to somewhere in Australia).

We told her ""too bad"".

We didn't want to move seats. We were disappointed someone was put in the middle but I wanted the window, mate wanted the aisle.

Instead of accepting this, she started typing something on her phone and flagged down a flight attendant and passed them the phone. I guess she complained in that way instead of having the guts to do it so we could hear.

Flight attendant then said we had to move so she was not sitting in the middle.

My mate is claustrophobic and really likes the aisle, I didn't want to move from window either because I like looking out during landing. They doubled down and said one of us has to move so I said ""fine, bitch can have the window"". She objected to the window because ""being between two large men who are strangers and a wall was ""triggering and uncomfortable"".

I rolled my eyes and she said ""i have been both assaultd and groped by men before, I'm not comfortable about it and this is triggering my anxiety"".

1062,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, though I may keep it because I like the name.

I want to start this off by saying that I don’t consider myself to be a shallow person. I don’t wear makeup, I got a haircut this week for the first time in two years, I get my clothes mainly from thrift stores. My mom is very image-conscious so I definitely grew up with that tension. (EDIT: I’m getting some very fair pushback about this. The wording here came directly from my husband accusing me of being “obsessed with every little thing about appearances” when we were arguing. I do not think that people who put effort into their appearance are automatically shallow—makeup is an art that I just don’t have enough interest in learning. I apologize for this poor attitude.)

My husband could really not care less about appearances, and for the most part I appreciate that. But like, he doesn’t care to the point that I have to go through his socks and T-shirts and jeans to throw away ones with holes in them because he’ll still wear them. The only time this really bothers me is in professional environments. This brings me to today.

I work weekends sometimes at my job. My husband will sometimes come in and hang out with me at work on the weekends. I work in an office environment where there aren’t a ton of people in on the weekends, but the ones that are in are often higher-ups. People dress casually on the weekends—jeans, nice T-shirts, etc., which is fine. When we went to leave the house this morning, I noticed that my husband was wearing a pair of jeans that was ripped from the hem to about halfway up his calf on one leg. The two sides of the rip would flap every time he took a step with that leg.

I asked him to change. I’ll admit I was a bit snippy about it. I should also mention that he’s having a gout flare-up in one ankle, so he’s in some pain. He argued that he feels like I’m always picking on him about his appearance (this week he had a big job interview and I was asking him a few times about what he was going to wear because I’ve seen him go to work in unironed dress pants with a hole in them before) and that clothes don’t matter. My argument is that clothes don’t matter to ME, but we’re going into my workplace where I’m hoping to advance in my career at some point and it makes me uncomfortable to have him wearing torn clothing. I feel bad about it now because I’m afraid I’m shallow and too harsh on him. AITA?

Edit: I do just want to emphasize that there aren’t many people in the office on the weekends and that there is no explicit dress code—people definitely dress casually. Just trying to be as fair as possible.

EDIT 2: as I responded to a comment below, my husband hangs out at my office doing work on his laptop sometimes on weekends. There aren’t a ton of people here, as I’ve said. I can’t drive (visual impairment) and I have a lengthy commute, so it’s just easier for him to stick around here. Other workers in the office do this with their spouses/kids sometimes, especially on weekends and holidays because we’re in an industry where people work 7 days a week. My boss was actually the one who suggested this to me. It wasn’t something I came up with on my own. That said, I’ll probably make my husband leave in the future as now I’m very self-conscious about it.",127,577,0.93

1066,Everyone Sucks,"So, some backstory, when we started dating my gf made a huge deal about me forgetting about stuff (plans we made, when her days off were etc. Small things) I was branded with the ""forgetful"" mark in the beginning of our relationship.

A few months later, she forgets her phone on the bus. She goes crazy, because she has her credit cards on the phone case. I go to great lengths to get it back as we had to speak with the bus driver of the bus arrange to meet him and we get it at the end. (That was at my mom's funeral!)

Two days earlier (as of today), she forgets her charger cable in a restaurant. I had to call the restaurant to make sure they keep it somewhere and let them know that we are going back the same night to get it.

Sometime after that, same scenario, she gets home and realises she dropped her credit card on the way home.

Cancels it, the realises her card was on the floor at home.

I start thinking, omg is she ever going to learn from all that.

Fast forward to today, me, my gf, her brother and her brother's gf are coming back from holiday.

It's 3 am, our plane landed at 1:30 am, me and my gf are working at 7:30 am and we have to get home from holiday. We have just gotten off of our bus, to get another bus to get home. The second bus is but 2 minutes away and my girlfriend says ""where's my phone?"" and she realizes she left it on the bus. AGAIN! I am really angry from the tiredness of the trip and the fact that she did it again, with her brand new phone this time.

I see the bus arriving and im thinking to myself, you know what fuck that, you deal with it, I can't keep helping you sort out your lost phone scenarios. You never learn. I was really mad but didn't show any of it.

So, I say ""hey our bus is almost here, I really need to get home and get some sleep, you need to sort this out yourself this time.""

Long story short, she and her brother go to the nearby bus garage, where the bus terminated to try and find it. They do and come home.

My gf is mad at me for not going with her to help her find her phone, and says even her brother was mad that I left her by herself.

So I tell her my side, that I was so mad that she did it again that I preferred to go home than to make a scene in front of her brother and his gf about it.

What do you guys think?

Edit: Many thanks guys for all the wonderful responses, thank you for the words of wisdom and advice. From looking at the comments, there's no clear indication as to which side got the more ""asshole points"". 

Now, after reading your arguments, I feel that me and my gf both were in the wrong, I chose a really bad moment to take a stand with my beliefs as I should have stayed with her and helped her, AND THEN explain my position and how bad that was to misplace her phone at that time.

Next time, I will make sure to help resolve the situation first (key words here, ""help resolve"" as I shouldn't rush in everytime to save the day) and then voice my concerns or comments.",185,932,0.95

1068,Not the A-hole,"A very close friend of mine recently recently moved out of town, about an hour away. On weekends a few us go into the city to eat and just chill. The drive into the city is about an hour. We usually start heading back around midnight. My mate moved around 4 months ago and he's been meeting us there and I drop him back which takes about 50 minutes from the city to his and then another 50 minutes from his place back to my town. 

Recently it's been getting harder as we've been leaving a little later and I'm getting tired after dropping him and then having to that extra 50 minutes back to mine. Ive been getting home around 3-4 am. I've suggested a few times for him to get the train back from the city but I felt bad and just dropped him off. 

So last night my cousins girlfriend was out with us and I suggested he get the train back which takes about 30 minutes. As he's looking up train times my cousins girl says ""That's a bit harsh making him get the train back isn't? Ah maybe we just have different standards."" It kinda hit me as she's a lovely person and I was quite surprised that she would say that. A few other words were exchanged after that and this made me feel kinda shitty so I offered to drop my mate home. 

AITA for getting annoyed and suggesting my mate gets the train back?

Just to be clear, my friend is well aware of how tired I am of dropping him back. I mentioned it before we met that evening as well that I'd prefer for him to get the train back as it was probably going to be a pretty long night out.",81,230,0.95

Like any Mexican 15 year-old I'm having what's called a quincenera. Basically a huge party for me celebrating me becoming a woman. There is a church part and a party part. 

with the party part it is no doubt that there will be many drunk people all around. This is where this argument fits in. 

To keep this short, my dad has been an alcoholic since before my sisters and I were ever born. Before my mom kicked him out, he was either working, sleeping, or drinking. I grew up knowing not to disturb him when he finally got a corona in his hands. 

A week ago when he came by to visit I asked him if he could not drink for my party. I said I knew I was asking a lot from him but I really wanted him not to get drunk at my party. 

He seemed angry at the thought of not being able to drink at my party. He even said that it was only going to be a few beers. I laughed silently at that comment because he has never just had a few beers. He kept going on and on about since he's buying the beers he should at least get to drink some. How everyone else will also be drinking. How he'll let me drink if he gets to drink.

I got extremely sad at all of this. I told him to give it some thought because I really wanted him to be sober since I'm basically his only daughter after the divorce.

1072,Asshole,"I hate texting. I hate how everyone seems to love texting. I've had friendships and relationships end because of this issue. It was a near-constant issue in the longest relationship I've been in, which lasted two years, and that ended partially because of it. I don't see a value in texting. It's not meaningful communication to me. It's not that I don't care how your day was, but texting ""How was your day?"" ""Good. Yours?"" just seems so trite and pointless to me. 

I recently set up Tinder and Bumble profiles and over the past month I matched with a few women and we would agree to go on a date, usually a few days later in the week. But then the next day, the texts would start. ""Morning"" at 7 am. ""How's your day going"" in the middle of the day while I'm at work. WTF! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because why on earth would I, or anyone, want to spend time staring at their phone texting small talk to someone they haven't even met yet? I get that you want to get to know a person at least a little bit before meeting, but it so often goes way beyond that to a degree that I feel is childish. 

How did any relationship ever last before cell phones? If a couple didn't see each other in person, they'd talk - as in real conversation - over the phone, or - god forbid - go a whole 24 hours without talking. I feel like so many people show real insecurity that I want no part of when they seem to need attention via texts every day.  

So I ignore the texts. I just don't respond. And then friends think I don't care. Women think I'm not interested. I think they're childish. But maybe ITA.",75,70,0.73

1074,Not the A-hole,"I (34f) am single, I run a business and I earn enough to have a some disposable income. So last year (when netflix was finally available in my country) I decided to subscribe. I picked up the HD plan which allows for 2 screens and 2 devices for downloads. 

I shared my subscription with my niece (15f) who lives in another country and she soon requested i share it with my brother and SIL (her parents). No problem, created profiles for both of them and she set it up on their respective phones/tablets.

Here is the problem. My brother (45m) keeps going into my profile to view his shows/movies messing up my recommendations, despite repeatedly telling him to go into his profile.  I am also a closeted bisexual, so i am worried if he ends of noticing a few queer centric movies or shows in my list i may be accidentally outed. He can be a bit homophobic. 

Another issue is that between the three of them they sometimes use up the two allotted screens and  used up the two devices to download for offline viewing. So if i travel i cant download anything.  Leaving me with no access. I have told them that there are times i cant use my own account, to which they told me to message them anytime i want to use netflix so one of them stops streaming. When i do, they either don't see the message nor pickup the phone. 

Last week I decided to lie to them and tell them that i am cancelling my netflix account because i am trying to cut down on expenses. My niece was very unhappy about it. She suggested to her parents that we split the cost of the account and her parents refused. Yesterday she told me that they were going to figure out getting their own account. Knowing them it will be another 6 months if at all before they get around to it. Till then she will be stuck with no netflx. I dont mind my niece using it but i feel like i am paying for something i am not getting a chance to use. 

I chose to lie rather than tell them that i am kicking them off just to keep the peace. I dont want to have this thing where I secretly let her use it while denying her parents.

1076,Not the A-hole,"So here’s the story. I’m (21F) getting married in September and my mother-in-law is making my life as difficult as possible when it comes to planning the food. My parents have paid for everything thus far, including the venue, the caterer, the alcohol, all the decorations,  my dress & alterations, a hotel room for us, etc. 

The only thing I have asked my in-laws to take care of is the dessert. We’re doing cupcakes (it’s a small wedding and the cost is under $200). My in-laws make considerably more than my parents and I know money isn’t an issue for them. 

The problem is that my MIL is notoriously selfish and has to make everything about her. When we decided on a pork dish for dinner, she threw a fit because she doesn’t like pork. So we added a beef option, literally only to please her. Keeping in mind that she isn’t even the one paying for it. 

Now, she’s complaining about how we aren’t catering to her fairweather gluten and dairy “intolerances”. It’s only an issue when she wants it to be, like my wedding, and when it’s not convenient for her, she has no problems eating it. She just ordered pizza hut the other night and had breadsticks and cheese pizza with zero complaints or issues. So she’s throwing a fit about the cupcakes because they aren’t gluten and dairy free. However, when we brought home leftovers from the tastings she ate them without issue and said they were delicious. 

Maybe this seems insensitive of me, but I’m a very picky eater and I have gone hungry at every single wedding I’ve been to. It doesn’t seem fair to have to change our entire menu to suit one person who doesn’t even have issues. I wouldn’t ask anyone to do that for me. 

My parent’s have offered to just order them and pay but honestly I don’t feel like it’s fair. My in-laws have contributed nothing to the wedding and I feel like they should at least help with something. I really want to talk to her and figure out why it’s such an issue (even her daughter has said it was a problem when she was planning her wedding last year). AITA for being angry with her? Should I talk to her or just let it go?",60,50,0.95

My wife and I went shopping at a mall today and decided to pick up some food at one of the restaurants attached to the mall (not food court, but sit down restaurant). It was around 5pm, so right at the start of dinner rush. Service was fine and our server was incredibly friendly.

Toward the end of our meal, a family (father, mother, and son probably around 8 years old) are seated in the booth behind us. By this time, it was getting a bit busier in the restaurant. It takes maybe 2-3 minutes before the server comes and takes their drink orders. She then went to tend to that and other tables. 

About 5 minutes pass and I hear the father start complaining. ""Why is everything taking so long?"" ""This server is lazy."" ""It's been five minutes, why hasn't she taken our order?"" ""The service here is terrible, they deserve a 4/10 rating."" ""Maybe I need to speak to the manager."" 

It was driving me crazy because it was fucking dinner time and they were busy. My wife and I finish our meal and pay.

1088,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I have a sister that is living with my parents along with her two children. One of the children was a result of a teen pregnancy and is 6 years old I’ll call him Gilbert, and the other child’s father is a married man, I’ll call him John and his father George. John is under 6 months old. 

My parents completely support my sister financially as well as her children. She gets child support for the eldest, but puts that money into her retirement fund. 

She has been sleeping with George on and off for a while. George is still actively married, but stays with my sister at my parents house when they are out of town or she stays with him at his grandparents house. When she goes to George’s grandparents house, she takes John with her and leaves Gilbert at home with my parents. She does not call Gilbert, or come to see him while she is staying with George. This leaves Gilbert very sad, he says he misses his brother, John, and he knows that it’s his fault his mom leaves him because he “can’t act right”.  Gilbert does act out when his mom is present. When he makes her angry or acts out she yells and screams at him. She gets easily annoyed and overwhelmed by him so she spends the majority of her time yelling at Gilbert when they are together. 

I also have two children and I try to take them to see my parents fairly often. If my sister happens to be there, she is very rude to me and my older child and she criticizes my parenting. My older child is 2, has speech problems, and is in speech therapy. She thinks it’s because of me that he is behind. 

A few days ago, I went to see my parents and brought my children. My sister was there with her children. While I was leaving, she kept interrupting my conversation with my mother. I told her firmly to stop interrupting, I was not going to fight with her. She kept going. I lost my cool completely. I basically told her to support herself financially like an adult and get out of my parents house. I said she needed to treat both of her children the same or leave Gilbert with my parents for good because everyone was happier when she was away not causing chaos. My sister did not really respond, just repeatedly said “okay” sarcastically. 

My mother has contacted me today to tell me that I need to ignore the behavior from my sister and “love her like Jesus”. She said that I have also made mistakes and I can’t judge my sister. My mother also said that me exploding has made her feel like she has to choose sides and she thinks I want her to turn on my sister. I do not agree with my sister having a relationship with George while he’s married, and I especially do not agree with causing irreversible damage to Gilbert to uphold this relationship with George. I cannot pretend that what she is doing isn’t taking a toll on me emotionally. For this reason I have cut contact with my sister at this time. I have not told my parents what to do, although I do think they are being taken advantage of.

1089,Not the A-hole,"So I (19) live in a fairly rural area where the fastest internet is 20mgbs down which is fine because it’s just mean and my grandmother, I usually pay for the WiFi bill with left over grant money I have from school, and my grandmother doesn’t really use the WiFi anyways other then when she’s on her phone. 

Anyway, I have two younger cousins (11 & 13) who come over literally every weekend and even more during the summer. They claim they come to spend time with my grandmother but in reality they come over and sit on their phones all day, actually all day not over exaggerating. They watch and rewatch greys anatomy and the walking dead on Hulu/Netflix over and over and it sucks the absolute life out of my WiFi streaming at 1080p . I use the Internet mainly for school and I take mostly online classes where I have to upload videos and a 5 minute video will take all night when no one on the WiFi. When I’m not doing work I play/download games on my pc and PlayStation which has never been an issue before but now has become one. 

I, for the first time since having WiFi here, have hit the data cap and dragged my already slow internet speeds to a sluggish, unusable speed. So, I kicked everyone off by changing the password and explain why afterwards. Told them why and that I won’t give anyone the password other than my grandmother.

This is an issue for them because they have iPhones without service so they can’t do much on them, now every time I see them they ask for the password and I tell them nope. They’ve told my grandmother and their parents and I explained to them both and though they understand I still get the vibe that they think I’m being an asshole so, am I?

Edit: so this has gained some traction since I went to bed last night and I wish I could say this made them spend more time with my grandmother (going outside isn’t an option it’s 113 degrees in AZ at the hottest and like 90 by 10am) they instead ask my grand mother for her phone since we have unlimited and she recently asked me why her phone was being slow and checked it out and she used up all her LTE and has to use 3G.

Son (B) had his first crush on a girl at school earlier this year. They know we don’t care who they fall in love w/ as long as they aren’t assholes. We’ve also been clear that they are too young (middle school) to be dating. After a few weeks, B says he doesn’t like her like that anymore.

Fast forward to the end of the school year. B tells me he has a crush on a boy in his class but asks me not to tell Dad as he wants to tell him. I ask if he was worried about how Hubs will react & he was. I remind him that we’ve always said and that he can tell his dad.

So I don’t tell Hubs. I figured B would tell him that night/in a couple days when he was ready. And then honestly I forgot about it. Now it’s been a couple weeks. SIL called to let us know B had told her about liking this boy after an argument w/ his cousin. Hubs says ‘well he’s not gay, he liked a girl earlier this year, he’s confused, etc.’ I said ‘when he told me, I reminded him...’

Hubs is extremely hurt that I knew & kept this from him. I said I was respecting B & then forgot about it. I also told him B was worried because of how he reacts to other less important stuff than hearing his son might be gay. He says ‘he’s not gay, stop putting ideas in his head, you’re gonna get him hurt’. I get super pissed and say Im glad B didn’t tell him if this was how he was going to react & to reflect on why our kids feel safer w/ me because of his own behavior.

We cooled off & came back to the discussion today. Hubs said of course he accepts B and the real issue is that he’s terrified about how kids/people in this town will treat B. We just moved from a big city to a small town last year. The town as a whole is split pretty evenly politically. You see rainbow flags and MAGA stickers in equal measure. I said all we can do is support him & how he wants to handle it, the way I did when I didn’t tell Hubs initially. 

He says IWTA for keeping something like that from him, he has a right to know what’s going on w/ his kids. And if B had been the one to tell him, he would’ve gotten Hubs initial reaction, so I was setting him up to fail & for B to get hurt since I’m fully aware that Hubs needs time to process things. I say NAH as long as he supports our son. I was respecting B’s wishes. I’m not going to break his trust just because Hubs expects me to. He is much better equipped to handle the conversation now but I’m resentful of being expected to know how a situation is going to play out just because he can’t handle his emotions in the moment as well as I can. And if B found out I told Hubs, I’m afraid he wouldn’t trust me anymore but I understand wanting to know what’s happening w/ your kids...AITA?",51,154,0.95

2 weeks ago my car broke down and I felt it was more costly to fix the car than it was worth, so I decided to go to my bank and secure an auto loan to get a new car. Problem is, my credit is considered subprime, so the loan was less than favorable in terms of APR. No big deal and I had expected it because when I divorced my exwife 7 years ago, in order for me to keep the house without a lengthy fight, I agreed to take on her debt as a way to persuade her to release interest in our house, and it worked.  My credit took a hit about a year later when the cost of a mortgage, normal bills, and her debt began to pile up.  I didn’t want to lose the house so one thing led to another and I didn’t pay the debt, it was sent to collections and wrecked my credit, but I eventually got all caught up and paid it off in full.  I’m now at a point in my life where I have a good job and my credit is slowly rebuilding back towards where it used to be. 

This is where my girlfriend comes in to play. She offered to co-sign on a loan with me if it gave me a better interest rate, and it did. Got the better loan, took ownership of my car, and all was going well up until she wanted to borrow my car. I told her no, that I was going to be using it, and that’s when she told me that it was our car because she was taking risk. I told her if this is how she felt I’d have just taken the shitty loan to avoid all of this hassle. I’m paying the loan, I’m providing the insurance on the car, my name is on the title, this is my car. If she felt this way we should have discussed this before she co-signed so I could have told her that I’d move forward on my own.   I never intended to share my car with her, I do not want to at all. I’m 100% uncomfortable with this.  She thinks I’m being unreasonable and childish, says if she wants to use the car she should be able to.  I wholly disagree. 

At the end of the day, this is my car, I’m paying for the loan and the insurance, maintenance, etc.   if I knew she was going to feel this way, I’d have not let her co-sign and taken the worse interest rate.

1097,Not the A-hole,"A friend of mine likes to store her things (debit card, phone, ID, etc) in my messenger bag when we go out.

Once or twice would be fine with me, but it's literally every time we go out.

She won't buy a purse, so if she doesn't store her things in my bag, she'll have to carry them.

We're in our 30s.

It's an inconvenience because sometimes I forget to return her things, and then I'll have to go meet her the next day to return them.

Also, I feel a bit like an accessory given how frequently this happens.

When I try to tell her it bothers me, or if I try to refuse, or encourage her to buy a purse, she gets upset with me and tells me I'm being unreasonable.

# A Song of Farts and Sphincters

Many moons ago, our dear leader and founder /u/flignir had hoped to settle a petty dispute over office air conditioning. He attempted to obtain guidance, and he prayed to the Old Gods and the New. Alas, he could not find his path forward. He was a lost soul, forever questioning his very sanity.
But /u/flignir was not weak. For you see, he held the Power of the Sphincter, a power so great that most cannot even understand. With a swift click, he created the community you see today. And he received his guidance.
Today, he uses that same power and shares it with the rest of us common folk. We all hold the Power of the Sphincter, and with it, **we shall judge**.

# Rule 1 is “Be Civil”, but what does that mean?

“Civility” can be difficult to define. We at /r/amitheasshole have a specific definition of civility that we apply to our moderating. We urge everyone to read up on these rules.

# Why are so many posts locked?

We know that  you hate seeing that little yellow lock on a post. We hate it, too. But locking posts is a necessary evil on a subreddit like this one. [/u/flignir provides a great explanation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bs9yau/hey_assholes_youre_doing_it_wrong/erok7lm/) of why we have to do this.

There are only <20 of us and 1 million of you, not counting those who wander in from /r/all. We do our best to remove toxic comments and respond to reports. Sometimes our best efforts to clean up a thread and prevent toxic comments are not enough and we simply have no choice but to close the discussion. Posts are never locked before an OP gets enough feedback.

# The Validation, Fake Posts, & Relationship Posts Crackdown

We often receive complaints  about “validation posts”, fake posts, and posts about relationships We want to assure you all that this team removes hundreds of threads like these every day, but there are a few things we’d like you to consider when you become frustrated by these threads.

**Validation Posts**:
> The mod team removes hundreds of posts every day for having very obvious answers. Sometimes, an answer may seem obvious to you,but it may not be obvious to everyone.  Sometimes a single thread will receive two separate reports; one that says ""obviously NTA"" and one that says ""obviously YTA."" To us, that sounds like a great thread, where opinions are divided. However, those of you  who have strong opinions would see a thread like this as having an obvious answer.. Please keep this in mind next time you complain about obvious validation posts.


**Fake Posts**:
> Sometimes, very real circumstances might seem absurd to you. When we judge whether or not a post is a creative writing exercise or a work of fiction, we don't ask ourselves ""is this likely to happen?"" We ask ourselves ""would Florida Man do it?"" Remember, people often post here on their worst day. If you have actual concrete evidence that post is fake, something like contradictory details in a post history for example, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole) and we’ll investigate and determine if the post needs to be removed.

> We do rely on your reports for fake posts, because among our other duties we don’t always have time to play detective.

**Relationship Posts**:
> Please keep posts about your significant other limited to conflicts outside of your relationship. We're not here to arbitrate your breakup or fight. A good fit test is to ask ""could this conflict exist in a platonic relationship?""

# New Feature: Community Awards

Reddit has implemented a new feature called [Community Awards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/). Instead of buying Silver, Gold, or Platinum, you can now award people with custom /r/AmItheAsshole awards!

**What are community awards?**

> Community awards AITA-specific awards that you can buy using Reddit Coins. The AITA mod team will receive 20% of the Reddit Coins you spend, and we can use those coins to award people within our community.

**What do they mean, and do I have to buy them?**

> Reddit added a new feature, and we love new features, so we participated. There is no obligation for you to buy them, just like Silver/Gold/Platinum (which you can still buy). They're just for fun. They mean whatever you want them to mean - just a fun new way to reward people for exceptional content.

**What will mods do with the 20% coins we receive?**

> Give it back to the community. We cannot use it outside of our sub, and we will not use it on ourselves. The mods will have a specialty ""mod-only"" award that we can give for special recognition. We may also use these points for special events or fun games.

**What awards are available?**

> [**We have several award options available. Click on this link to see**](https://i.imgur.com/ivBNsiQ.png). Community awards will be available to use immediately. Please note that this feature is still in beta testing, so you may experience minor bugs.

> Thoughts? Feedback? Please feel free to comment below. We wanted most things to be either cheaper or equal cost to Reddit Gold, but have one ""specialty"" award that's a bit more expensive. Keep in mind that 300 credits is the minimum that the admins allowed us to set, so we cannot make it 100 like silver (otherwise we would).

1099,Not the A-hole,"This requires a few small pieces of background: 

So I moved to a place far away from my family a few years with my fiancé and the couple of closer friends I made here recently just moved away. I have been feeling pretty lonely and had been telling my fiancé for the last couple months that I wanted to go camping soon, but we never had a free, clear weather weekend until recently. I also have a large, awesome tent that can fit 3 queen size air mattresses side by side + some and has 2 swinging doors on either side that we use to camp in.

Main event:

My parents had been scheduled to visit us this upcoming weekend for about 3 months and I specifically wrote it on the calendar and reminded him multiple times. I got home from work 2 weeks ago to him telling me he invited his long time best friend from grade school to visit this upcoming weekend. I reminded him my parents were coming that weekend and he said he forgot and that he planned for the 3 of us plus another one of his friends to go camping. 

We got into a huge fight because I was mad he didn’t even consult me to make sure that weekend was free for both of us before he made these plans with his friends, he encouraged his friend to purchase a flight right away, and he took off time with work. He refused to change his plans with the excuse that he couldn’t change the dates as he had already upset his boss by asking for the time off and he didn’t want to inconvenience his friend by asking him to change his flight date (still within the 24 hour window to do so).

I talked to my mom and told her he wasn’t going to be around while she was there. We ended up rescheduling her trip anyway to a later date due to her finding out she needed to go to an important appointment the day they were supposed to go back home. 

I let my fiancé know that I could go camping now and he then told me, “Well, no...” that he had invited another friend and that there now wouldn’t be room for me in the truck because it would be cramped with 3 guys in the back seat. I asked what tent he was planning on using since he certainly hadn’t asked if he and his friends could use mine.

WIBTA if I don’t let them use my tent? I have another much smaller and older 6 person tent that I could let them use.",97,148,0.98
1100,Not the A-hole,"I'll be as clear and concise as possible.

I (m/24) live in a flat with two other guys, Jack and Joe (both m/22, not their real names). We're pretty friendly with each other and get along well, but Jack and I have an issue that has gotten pretty heated over the past couple of weeks.

Jack is a 'player'. He regularly has girls over that he's met through Tinder. Since his room shares a (very thin) wall with mine, I can hear every detail when he's shagging and I don't enjoy it. This often ruins the few hours of free time I have on a weekday or prevents me from getting a full 8 hour sleep. I don't believe this is fair to me. I am entitled to enjoy my evenings just as much as he or anyone else is.

This wasn't an issue until a couple of months ago as I wasn't home during the evenings due to work, but now I'm home at normal hours. Since then I've asked him to keep the noise down multiple times and predictably my requests were met with jokes and accusations of jealousy. I'll admit to being a little jealous as I'm honestly shocked by the sheer quantity of women he's able to pull, but I still believe I'm in the right here regardless of that fact.

In an effort to reclaim my evenings, and since he refuses to take my requests seriously, I have begun jacking off to porn with the sound on during the evenings. Not every evening, just about as often as he has girls over. Hypocritically, Jack is furious about this. He says he doesn't want to think about me masturbating and that it ruins the mood if he has a girl over. **How exactly is it any more disgusting for him to have to listen to me watching porn than it is for me to have to listen to him shagging?** He doesn't have anything to say when I point this out to him other than more accusations of jealousy and cockblockery.

I don't know how long this is going to go on for but I'm not gonna stand down. I shouldn't have to evacuate my own home or wear headphones (which give me tension headaches) in order to enjoy my evenings just because Jack fancies a shag.

1101,Not the A-hole,"I’m on mobile so sorry. 

My SIL has always been a sore subject for basically everyone in my family. She rubs everyone the wrong way and because of this some people avoid her, and most are only nice when she’s around. Mostly because we want to have a relationship with our brother and our nieces and nephews when we actually see them. We’re all a little surprised they’re still married tbh. 

Since the beginning of the year all my family has known is that something is going on with my brother. When we ask her she says it’s “medication changes” or “he’s just having a hard time” and when we ask him he says he can’t tell us. They also have stopped coming to family events and she won’t allow my brother to be alone with/talk with any of us. Anytime we schedule something just him, she immediately tells us that he has to cancel because he forgot about something they were doing.

This past Tuesday she sends us this long message to me, and the other biological siblings, saying that my brother needs our love and support and to send a message saying we love him. We aren’t supposed to ask any questions, or expect a response back. Also if we show up to the house, which she highly encouraged we do, we’re supposed to leave a note and to not expect anyone to answer the door or invite us in. Also, we aren’t allowed to call or try to contact my brother in any way besides text or leaving a note on their doorstep. Weird, but okay. 

I texted my brother:
“Hey, hope everything is okay. Love you big bro. ❤️”

She immediately texts me saying that she got that I was trying to help but I shouldn’t have texted that. She then immediately texts the group again saying to please only express love. 
Quote: “Any concern is not helpful. [...] I said no questions and [...] the first thing that happened was someone texting him and asking him if [he’s] okay [and that] is the exact opposite of what I asked for.” She then told us all exactly what we need to say to him since she had specific guidelines. 

WIBTA if I told her she needs to let everyone know what’s going on?

EDIT: Hey everyone, I originally posted an update in the comments but it seemed that it got buried. I had to delete a chunk of the post to make sure I say under the 3000 character limit. Sorry if that’s not okay. 
We got ahold of my brother, he is safe and alive. A lot of the weekend was filled with dealing with stuff behind the scenes, that I can’t go into at this time. But everything is now being handled by the proper people/channels. The important part is that my brother is safe, and accounted for. Thanks for everyone who took their time to read and reply, I truly did not expect this to get the attention that it did.",501,2984,0.98

1104,Not the A-hole,"Basically I work in a retail style store but for betting. Due to the nature of the store people often come and stay throughout the day and due to this we get to know our regular customers on a decent personal level. 

We have a customer Gary. Gary’s incredibly sweet to us and other customers. He comes in a lot and often stays all night. One night Gary was here as I started cleaning and wanted to help. He took paper off the walls and in return I gave him a chocolate bar and joked it was his wages.

That became a long running joke where he’d take paper off the wall and get given a chocolate bar. He was always stoked with the chocolate and happy to help. I told my coworkers that jokingly I’d get him to do the vacuuming next. We only have 3 people working at this store including me so it’s tight knit. We all work very closely with long hours together. 

My coworker who I’ll call Jill took this joke between Gary and I and ran with it. She will ask him to empty bins, wipe tables all sorts. At first I turned a blind eye because hey, if Gary’s ok with it and he gets his chocolate bar no biggie. But last week when I came in for a shift, I noticed she was getting him to do tasks he shouldn’t be. It was no longer him volunteering, but her TELLING him to go replace hand towels in the bathroom, to take bins out to the street etc. I’m now quite uncomfortable with this whole thing. These are jobs we should be doing. I started jumping in and saying I’ll do that job, or that Gary shouldn’t have to do that etc, but she still keeps telling him to do chores for us like he’s an employee. 

While Gary doesn’t seem uncomfortable all it will take is another customer saying something, or Gary getting ‘over’ this joke and complaining and then all 3 of us are on the hook. I want to say something to my boss before this happens, (Jill won’t get fired or written up, probably just told to cut it out) but due to the fact there’s only three of us and Gary’s ok with it, she’ll figure out it was me complaining even if I kept it anon. This would affect our cohesion as a team, and right now we have a really good situation and I don’t want to be the one who rocks the boat. 

However because I started the joke, should someone else or Gary complain, I’ll go down just as hard as Jill. And honestly Jill is just feeding off the energy I started with this joke, taking it too far or not. 

So WIBTA if I report Jill before this kicks back on me and the rest of the team? Or should I leave it for the sake of us all getting along?",11,28,0.98
1105,Not the A-hole,"A year ago, I invited my family from another state to visit for my bridal shower. I wanted them to have plenty of time to plan for a trip if they wanted to come.

My mom invited several other family members and then asked if they could all stay in my apartment. I wasn't happy about that but agreed.

They said they were leaving at 7 a.m., which meant they should be here around 7 p.m., and that includes time for stops. 

It is now past 11 and they are still about an hour away because they have continued to take long stops along the way.

I get up at 4:30 for work and go to bed at 8 most days. I knew I'd likely have to stay up later, but I'm dead tired at this point. 

I told my family they were going to have to figure out another place to stay for the night and obviously they are upset. But am I the asshole?",26,35,0.93
1106,Not the A-hole,"Me (f17) and my brother (m19) live with our parents in the same house. We just moved and I was busy organizing my room, putting furniture together and doing important stuff. Then my brother excitedly bursts into my room and says ""Leave the house"". I ask ""why?"" And he says ""cause I'm trying to fuck"" while his gf stood behind her. I said ""you guys can fuck"" and put on my headphones and went back to work. Later when she left, turns out they didn't fuck, and my brother opens the door to my room and says ""you're a dick"" and promptly leaves.
Should I have left the house or stayed inside? Thanks!",54,165,0.95
1107,Not the A-hole,"So I've been playing Pokemon Pearl for a few days right now, and since that last time I saved the data I beat a few gyms in the game and caught+evolved quite a few pokemon. I hadn't saved the data and I put my DS in my backpack so I could keep playing it throughout the day. I sat down in an area with a couple of my friends and started playing pokemon, and after a bit I put it back in my bag but left the pocket open, and started talking with some of them. A few friends left and a few more showed up, but one of the new people saw my DS in my bag and removed the cartridge to see what I was playing. For those who don't know this deleted all of my progress since my last save, a couple of gyms ago. I confronted him and told him that if he wanted to know what game I was playing he could have opened the DS or just asked me what I was playing instead of deleting the save data, and he told me that it's my fault for not saving, to which I responded by telling him that he should know not to do that since he is also an avid nintendo fan and knows that games from 2009 don't automatically save. Am I the asshole for getting pissed at him?",34,38,0.86
1108,Not the A-hole,"Whenever we watch movies or TV shows together, my boyfriend does this annoying thing where he will try to predict what will happen. He does this continuously throughout the show, at least once ever 5 minutes, and often will interrupt intense moments with his predictions which I find ruins the experience for me. Like, in very suspenseful scenes where a character is obviously in danger, he will say something along the lines of “he’s going to die”. I also will add that his predictions are wrong more often than not.

I have talked to him many times and told him that it annoys me and ruins the mood but his behaviour has not changed. I’ve also tried my best to compromise and suggest that we discuss after we finish an episode what we think might happen next or he does it less often and not during important scenes but have not had any success with that. 

This has made me not want to watch any shows or movies with him so I now mainly watch Netflix alone. One show we do still watch together though is Stranger Things. When season 3 came out and I realised that I wasn’t even excited to watch it because I knew he would ruin it for me, I decided to take a stand. 

Basically, I binge watched most of the episodes in blissful silence before he came over and we started watching it together. Every time he would make a prediction, if it was right, I would agree with him and, if he was wrong, I would give my own “prediction” based on what actually happens. It took him a while to catch on but as the show progressed I got more and more specific with my “predictions” until it became obvious that I had already seen it. 

When he realised what was going on, he was really angry at me for giving him spoilers. I tried explaining to him that while his predictions don’t actually give the plot away, they still spoil the show for me and I wanted him to know how it felt. He then complained that I was being petty and taking revenge for something that isn’t even that bad. However, I believe I was justified as I had tried talking to him and offering compromises but he was unwilling to see things from my perspective or make any effort to change his behaviour. 

I guess I’m wondering if what I did was over the top or if I’m being irrational for even finding his habit as annoying as I do. Is making constant predictions a normal thing to do while watching shows? Some insight would be greatly appreciated.",154,586,0.95

1110,Not the A-hole,"This friend of mine's fifth wedding anniversary is coming up. His wife, who's already thrown two surprise parties for ""Glen"", has been reaching out to his friends regarding a surprise anniversary party she wants to throw for him. Her planned party falls on the same day as my birthday, my 40th birthday. When she reached out to my best friend (mutual friends with Glen) he said ""whoa, whoa, that's ----'s birthday and we kinda figured we'd do something with him that day"".

&#x200B;

So she sent me a private FB message and asked me if I wouldn't mind ""bumping"" my birthday to the following weekend, as she already reserved a place for this party she wants to throw. I replied ""no, and thanks for ensuring that our mutual friends will be tied up at another surprise party for your husband on my 40th birthday"". She replied that I was being ""petty"" and that if I ""really wanted to"" they could ""observe"" my birthday in some way during his party. I said ""no thanks"" and she predictably called me a ""childish asshole"".

1112,Asshole,"I feel like I'm being a little melodramatic here and I hope people are honest with me as I'm really upsetting a lot of people but I feel my fears are legit and at least should be taken seriously. 

I have a great family with great inlaws. They have always been super nice to me and essentially treat me like I'm a third daughter. My nieces and nephews are my kid's best friends and we all work for my husband's parent's company. I mean we are as tight as tight can be. 

My MIL's birthday is December 21st and it's been her dream to take all of her kids and grandkids on a Disney cruise for her birthday. I mean she is paying for everything from the airfare to the cruise to the excursions to the uber rides to the airport (as an aside, I've done the basic math in my head and it makes me dizzy how much she wants to spend). It's a super sweet gesture and I feel so guilty for what I'm about to say. 

I am fucking terrified of being on a ship. Like I don't think I can physically make myself walk over that plank from the shore to the ship. My knees will shake and I will turn around and run away. The idea that there will be nothing under me besides angry fucking sharks and crabs that want to bite my toes is almost making me want to puke now. My uncle tried to take me on a sail boat when I was little and I cried so hard that my uncle thought he was going to have to take me to ER. A much lesser concern is that the rooms appear to be tiny and I already feel claustrophobic and like I'd be in a tiny prison with nothing under me but angry sharks and crabs that want to bite my toes. 

My MIL and SILs have all sent me very polite emails that are somewhere between asking and begging me to reconsider my decision in not allowing my family to go (I mean they are made of shark food just like I am and have toes as well) but there is a definite undercurrent of ""hey crazy lady, get your fucking shit together, this is important to us.""

1115,Not the A-hole,"My friend is a single mother. We shall call her Gina. She has two kids 7 ( female) and 4 (male).  We used to be incredibly close until her divorce from the kids father. She became the kind of friend that only contacts you when she has drama or needs a favor. About two years ago she asked me to babysit overnight and be paid . Her daughter has been kicked out of numerous dAycares for biting, kicking etc. her son is an angel.

I come from a family of nine nieces and nephews. One has special needs so I thought I could handle anything. The little girl kicked her brother, spit, refused to put pajamas on. The little boy was an angel and cooperative for dinner, playing, bed time. I told the older one it was time to go to bed and she went wild like a banshee. She would climb on the kitchen table. I would lift her off the table and bring her back to bed. Several times. She would hide under the table. I put her back in bed several times, for her to get out. I called her mother at work and she told her child to listen. Nothing helped. The final straw was the kid picking up a piece of wood and trying to hit me with it. I told her to knock it off and she was to stay in bed. I sat outside the door while this kid screamed bloody murder in her bed sobbing like I was abusing her. She eventually fell asleep after 20 minutes of carrying on. My friend failed to say she couldn’t pay me that day. I let it go with the promise to be paid next week which never happened.

This was by far one of the worst babysitting jobs I ever had. I was 26 at the time. My friends going through a rough time and I said is there anything I can do to help. She asked me to babysit and I said no. She’s very upset I won’t help her out so she can work a few extra shifts. I don’t want to risk being hit by a demon kid and loose my crap.

1116,Everyone Sucks,"I work, my wife is a stay at home mom to our boys. I have the upmost love and respect for her doing so. The money I make has always been “our money”, as I feel it should be. She does her part at home, while I do mine at work. I have never said this once in the 5 years she’s been a stay at home mom until today, I swear.

Around Christmas, my wife wanted to get both the boys (them 17 months and 4), iPads. I suggested that we just get a tablet for the oldest as I didn’t think our youngest needed one quite yet and to go with a cheaper, child friendly model with more parental control and a built in case. I also said since it was a big purchase we should discuss it more. I come home the next night from work...and she’s purchased two iPads for the kids. I calmly asked her about it and she said she thought it’d be a good idea, plus our youngest would grow into his. It was the holidays. I didn’t want to fight, so I didn’t. Even when she continued to go above the budget that we had agreed on and hell, that was her idea. We weren’t going destitute over it and the boys were happy...so fine. I’m not going to be the grinch.

7 months later and we now only have one of the iPads. Our youngest smashed his in a tantrum while we were on vacation. And because my wife got these used, there was no insurance. I can’t say he even misses it. 

However, his second birthday is coming up. My wife wants to get him an iPod. I said that after the iPad, I think that’s a terrible idea. She said he loves music and I suggested she just play him some on hers or I’ll use mine. Or as a compromise, we’ll get him a CD player that we have to control that way he doesn’t have a chance of smashing it. She was pushing this iPod Touch.

Eventually, I put my foot down and told her no, that he’s 2 and he doesn’t need another electronic device that he’s just going to break in 2 months. And I told her if she went out and bought one, I’d return it. She got mad and I finally said that I made the money, so I wasn’t going to let her waste it on crap that a 2 year old couldn’t reasonably be expected to take care of. (And yes, I’d keep it out of reach or put the case on it, but she’d take it off or give it back as soon as he got upset that it was bothering him.)

She got mad and we aren’t speaking. I just feel like this is becoming an issue with every birthday. Like she wanted to get our oldest a laptop for his 5th and I asked why he needed one, though she let go of that when she couldn’t explain why a kid going into kindy needed both a tablet and a computer when his parents also had computers.

1118,Not the A-hole,"I've been working at a heath goods store for about a month now, in a location that's owned by a woman who owns several other locations as well. Sometimes one of the other stores will send a new employee to one of the other locations to train before they go back to their store. We're doing this now. Helen is about 50 and she's never worked before this job, but apparently her husband took sick and they have bills.

&#x200B;

Helen is a really bad worker. She's lazy, she's got a bad attitude. She questions everything, even when we're following store procedure. She's rude to me, rude to our customers. The store's goal is to sell products that promote a healthy lifestyle and create a healthy body (as long as you're eating right and getting exercise). We just want happy and healthy customers. I love this job. Helen has alienated several first-time customers looking to start losing weight and getting healthy by making disparaging remarks about their bodies. And she's bigoted to boot and refused to serve POC customers.

&#x200B;

Helen as introduced to me as Helen and every time she's mentioned or spoken to/about, she's been called Helen. Refers to herself as Helen. So I call her Helen.

&#x200B;

The other day she took me aside after closing and called me rude for not referring to her as Ms. Helen, or Mrs. Lastname. I don't even know her last name. I'm a professional adult in my mid-20s, not some kid. I don't really see the point in referring to her by anything other than Helen. If she had been introduced to me as Ms. Helen, I'd call her that, but she wasn't. Basically she told me I had obviously not been brought up right and that it's a poor reflection on me as a person. She told me she's was going to complain to the manager and then she left. She left early, I might add, without permission and without finishing her tasks.

&#x200B;

My manager told me to ignore her and she'd be gone soon. I've continued referring to her as Helen and nothing more. I told my mom about this during our weekly lunch and she told me I was being rude. We're in the South so a lot of emphasis is placed on respecting elders.

1120,Not the A-hole,"Parent of a 16 month old boy. Lately I have been wondering if I’m being the asshole in raising my child. He has shown a few signs of what could be considered signs of autism (ie staring at ceiling fans, an obsession with wheels, only says a few words). My husband I brought this up to our pediatrician when we first noticed them and she didn’t seem overly concerned and pointed out several reasons she didn’t believe he did have autism. All seemed fine until grandparents started stating their own concerns because they read an online article about autism. 

Now it seems like every time they babysit him they bring it up. They even went as far to send a list of concerns. Some of them were valid but others weren’t. I am a stay at home mom and spend majority of my time with him so I feel like I know him best and what he can and can’t do.  My husband casually brought his concerns up to a child behavior specialist he works with and she was unconcerned. She said IF he does have any form of autism it would be extremely low. 

On his next pediatrician visit we once again brought up the grandparents concerns and the pediatrician was not concerned about autism. We told the grandparents this and they weren’t satisfied with that answer and want us to send him to a specialist for further evaluation. They say “early intervention is the key”. I want to do the very best for my kid obviously and keep addressing the subject with the pediatrician but am I the asshole for not wanting to pursue it further when I, the pediatrician, and child behavior specialist all don’t think he has autism?

Edit to clarify: Some people seem to think we are refusing to have our child tested for autism and that is absolutely not the case. We insisted on having him screened at the pediatrician office at all his appointments and so far none of them have come back as having any concerns for further evaluation at this time. The next step will be a vision and hearing test to rule out any of those concerns and THEN to see a specialist if any of those tests come back concerning. The issue is the grandparents are wanting us to ignore/skip all of those tests and jump straight into therapy BEFORE he has had a diagnosis because they have google diagnosed him. So to clarify we ARE following the steps of autism testing we just have not received recommendations by a trained clinical person yet to further send him for a diagnosis.",140,69,0.9

We showed up at the dinner and as far as I could tell all was good. 

The next day, I got a message from one of my friends saying he was annoyed I would bring my son without consulting anyone. That having a young adult there who has nothing in common with the rest of the party changed the dynamic and the topics we could discuss. He said others were upset as well.

The problem comes along when my wife gives her the traditional frou frou poodle haircut and makes her look ridiculous. It’s not my wife’s skill level-she does a good job at it, but the poodle look is just ridiculous (IMO.) She has her face and body shaved like all the way down and she has all this long hair on top and and long ear hair and a round ball on the end of her tail. When I walk her, I feel ridiculous. Like, it’s seriously emasculating-and I’m not one to ever feel emasculated either. I feel like the neighbors are all laughing at me. I told my wife today after she shaved the dog again that I’m not going to take her outside until her hair grows out again. I’m not going to tell her not to cut the dogs hair-because it is apparently a LOT of work brushing out a long-haired poodle every day, (and I don’t have time for that either) but I feel like I shouldn’t have to be embarrassed by her dog’s ridiculous hair cut. It would be different if this dog was a little poodle, I think. But she’s a 90+ pound dog and her haircut look stupid. So, AITA for not sucking it up and walking the dog?

Note: google standard poodle and the ones you see without the leg poofies and the chest poofy is what she looks like. And it should also be noted that I don’t usually take the dog outside anyways. Only on occasion will my wife ask me to. I work, she’s a stay at home mom-if that’s relevant.

1133,Not the A-hole,"A few details to set the stage: To get into my place of work, one needs to walk  from the parking lot down a sidewalk that is along the side of the building. The other side of the sidewalk is semi-wooded with low growing evergreen shrubs. This sidewalk is about 100ft long, and has a trash can at either end.  Also, in the last month, there have been a ton of flies buzzing around this area, so much so that the building manager called an exterminator.

This morning, I (\~30s F) witnessed an intern (20s F) for one of the companies in our building walking into work eating a banana.  About 3/4 of the way down the sidewalk, with a trashcan not even 25 feet away, she tossed the banana peel into the bushes.   It landed on top of the bush and she just kept walking.  I wasn't sufficiently caffeinated to be polite, so I blurted out ""What the hell? There's a trash can right in front of you!"" complete with the WTF hand gesture; pointing to the trash can.

She ripped into me, claiming it's organic and feeds the animals.  She was half yelling / half crying.  

I pointed at the peel sitting on top of the bush and told her to ""pick up your (her) damn banana peel.""

Instead she cried loudly saying something unintelligible, got her peel, and put it in the trash. 

I'm thinking, great, this is over.   Maybe she won't toss her banana debris into the bushes and we will have less flies.   I'm sure I could have been more nice about it / sworn less, but I was just so shocked to see someone litter like that.  I badged in to the building and she walked in behind me. At some point, she must have cried to her boss about it, because her boss found me today and asked if I confronted her intern.  I said I had, then explained, as I have done here, about the banana peel. I guess she spent all morning crying about how ""mean"" I was and couldn't do any work.

I have refused to cancel on my best friend as I've made the commitment but she feels I should be making a priority call and putting her first, regardless of her changing her plans.

So all 6 of us get to the restaurant and start looking over the menus. We all order different drinks as well as food and the waiter comes back shortly after to tell me that they were out of the beer I wanted. I look over the menu again and pick another beer. At this restaurant they have electronic devices to place orders and the other beer wasn't on it. She tells me they might still have it, but asks me to pick up a back up beer in case they didn't so I pick one.

Last night we went out to eat for my dad's 60 birthday. There were 6 of us and we went to one of those Japanese steakhouses with the hibachi table. Those tables seat 8 people, and it was pretty busy so we assumed another couple would be joining us. We end up at a table with a seemingly nice older couple. We make some small talk and all order our food.

When the chef comes out and starts to cook, my dad notices the chef is cutting the fat off of the steak and throwing it away. My dad nicely asked if he could just cook up the fat for him instead of throwing it away. (My dad LOVES the fat more than the steak itself). The chef cheerfully agrees and starts gathering the fat from all of the steaks to cook in a separate pile for him.

The women sitting at our table told the chef ""I don't want him to have the fat from my steak!"".

The chef was apologetic and said he didn't know she wanted the fat too and he will split it between them. The women assured him she didn't want any of the fat, she just didn't want him to have something that was hers.

This is when I spoke up and asked her why this was an issue. She replied saying that it was her fat and she could do what she pleased with it.

I told her it was pretty selfish to throw it away just so someone else couldn't have it. She furthered her argument by saying that she didn't want his hands all over her food, which made even less sense because it wouldn't be touching her plate at all.

We went back and forth a little bit before I gave up and told the chef to throw her portion away and just give my dad the rest, not before I called her out again for being selfish though.

This all ruined the entire evening for my family and for theirs. My wife is blaming me because I shouldn't have tried to take another person's food. Which I understand, to an extent. But she was just wasting it for the sake of not letting my dad have it. So, AITA for calling this woman out and wanting her to give my dad the fat from her steak?

I (21M) am the single father of a beautiful three year old girl. She's a great kid and honestly super easy for a toddler. I love her with all my heart. 

Last year, however, was the worst year of my life. To start, I lost my job at the start of the year when the company I worked for went bust. I found another job but it was hard work and long hours and not in the field I wanted to be in. Then, two months later, my daughter's mother was killed in an accident. I found myself very stuck emotionally and financially. My older sister and her husband stepped in and offered to help me with childcare. They'd take my daughter while I worked - sometimes 12 hour days - and insisted on doing it for free as I was broke. I offered repeatedly to pay what I could and they refused. 

This year couldn't be more different. I found a job in my field which pays far better wages, and I'm dipping my toes back into dating again. Things are on the up. Now, this job also has much shorter hours, so I don't need quite so much help with childcare, but I do still need someone to watch my girl about eight hours a day. I originally intended to get her into a daycare now I could afford to pay for one, but both kiddo and my sister said they preferred the current arrangement so I began paying my sister instead. If anyone is interested I pay her £15/hr, plus I pay for any daytrips and stuff they take. This was all fine until last week. 

My sister and BIL have asked me for backpayment for the year that they took care of my daughter for free, at the same rate I'm currently paying. I was pretty shocked by this because 1). They refused payment when I offered it, 2). It came totally out of the blue and 3). I can't afford to make that as one lump sum payment (~£9000 if I've done my maths right), like they want. I said all this to them, and they said I'm being unreasonable and they deserve to be compensated for their time. It's causing a lot of tension because I'm yet to pay and they're yet to drop it. Am I being a dick by not paying or should I continue to refuse?",274,1359,0.97
1151,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I were dog sitting for one of her old neighbors. When we took the dogs outside we found a stray starving skin and bones cat meowing loud in the back yard. We brought it some food and water and it ate and drank it up and was very friendly with us. We called SPCA and animal rescue but unfortunately neither were accepting cats at this time.

We took it inside and made an appointment with a nearby emergency animal hospital to find out if it was sick with anything serious or had a chance at survival. The vet told us that it had neurological deficiencies, kidney failure, polyps in both its ears and was in extreme stages of dehydration and starvation. She offered multiple times to euthanize the cat for us but we couldn't bring ourselves to do it because she said it wasnt in pain from it's current injuries. 

We brought it home that night and after we got a call from the vet saying it passed all the necessary blood tests, we went out and bought it all new stuff. Wet and dry food, food bowls, kitty litter and box, and some other new stuff. It ate and drank all night and snuggled with me and my girlfriend. 

The next day we house sat again and talked to a neighbor who informed us that the cat was a different neighbors that leaves it outside.

What do we do? The vet said the cat would've died if it was outside any longer and were having a moral dilemma on keeping it in a safe home where it will be loved and cared for or giving it back to its rightful owners who let it almost die outside.

WIBTA if I kept it?

Update: We are definitely going to keep the little guy. Thank you all for the kind words. Here is for the current cat tax. Will post more in around a month to show progress.

1152,Not the A-hole,"Full disclosure: I'm a European living in the US, tipping culture is still insane to me but I always tip because I understand the reasoning behind it and don't want waiters to be impoverished.

I work next to a mall where there's a restaurant thing (just a booth in the wall with a kitchen behind, you have to take the food at the counter and eat it in the public area of the mall) where I go sometimes. The food is great but it's expensive (I paid $12.40 before tip today), so I keep it as a rare treat. It's always the same girl, late teens or early 20s, manning the booth; during small talk, last time I was there, I asked her if she had the job to pay for college. She answered she isn't going to college because she's the owners' daughter and her parents will pass the business down to her very soon.

To be clear, she isn't a traditional waitress. In that restaurant, you order and pay electronically, she just stands there, gives you a receipt to sign and hand you your food from the kitchen literally 3ft behind her. I always tipped at that place because I imagined she was a young person paid under minimum wage, but when I realized that she is actually taking all of the business' profit home, I didn't want to give her even more.

Today, I went there again and just entered a 0% tip on the iPad and I figured that would be it. But she immediately reacted and said ""Oh, there was a problem, your tip wasn't registered."" Then she offered to redo the transaction ""to make sure the tip goes through."" When I politely declined, she started babbling about the other options to tip her, she told me about the tip jar, and if I didn't have cash there was an ATM down the hall, and that they could put the amount on a tab for me to pay next time, etc etc.

At that point, I lost my cool and said ""I am not giving you a tip, please stop,"" maybe a bit forcefully/angrily. I thought it wasn't a big deal, but she looked like I'd slapped her, and all the other clients in queue and around us gave me the stink eye. You'd believe I publicly confessed to being a serial killer, given people's reactions. I booked it out of there as soon as I got my food, and I am still feeling humiliated and upset. I'm never going there again.

That girl didn't do any actual waiting work and she isn't underpaid at all, she is probably wealthier than I am (I earn about $23k), so I don't think it's that big a deal if I don't give her an additional $2 for... for what?

Do you think he will find this offensive though? Any father’s or mothers here how would you feel about this?

I feel like if she came to the wedding she would actively try and ruin it, and I feel like I should be able to enjoy my wedding day, of course if my fiancé says he wants her there there’s nothing I can do, but am I really the asshole for just suggesting it to him and getting his opinion?",2051,7247,0.88

So this just happened last night. I came home from walking back from work when I get a notification that I've had my first pay and I was chuffed. I spent the rest of the night relaxing wondering whether I should splash out on seeing a movie. That's when my mum came and said they're taking rent from me, £50 a week plus £2 for the compulsory car ride to work because they don't think I can can defend myself despite being capable.

I told her that it was unfair as I got the job independently and that I disagreed. She then told me how she needed the money so she could go out with her friends in spoons because she is. 'skint'. I told her to take money from our savings pot and that if she was skint she'll be good when she gets child benefits since I'm still in education.

She then said that she didn't care about what I had to say and that she was transferring the fifty quid to her account. 

I got this job all on my own, I work my butt off for this money to spend and save and she treats it like a piggy bank.

1157,Not the A-hole,"This happened a long time ago, but it’s been bugging me for a while.  

My (25F) friend, let’s call her Kate (23F), and I had been really good friends for a while. She had just gone through a really bad breakup. She met a guy (let’s call him Brad) at an event, and they really hit it off. They ended up going back to his hotel room and making out a bit/doing stuff but didn’t have sex. After the event, she friends him on FB and finds out that Brad has got a girlfriend. Kate was devastated, and I comforted her and thought the issue was over. 

Fast forward a few months. Kate is super excited because she’s going to another event, and Brad is going to be there. Brad wants to split a hotel room with her. I told her that’s a terrible idea, that I can’t believe she’s still talking to this guy, and basically that’s still cheating on his gf. I find some other friends of ours going to the event, ask if they have room for her in their hotel room (they do), and suggest she stays with them. She says no, she’s going to stay with Brad and that nothing will happen between them so it won’t be cheating. 

I talked to her multiple times about how this was a bad idea, how this guy had purposefully led her on even though he had a gf, how they were likely to do something if they shared a hotel, how it’s still bad even if they don’t because he’s still lying to his gf and they have this history etc. Kate refuses to listen and tells me she’s done discussing it with me and that she’s going to do what she wants.

Here’s where I feel a little bad about what I did... I went on Facebook, looked up the guy’s girlfriend, and I messaged her about the situation. I told her about the previous cheating and about how they were planning on getting a hotel room together, but that Kate claimed she didn’t intend for anything to happen. The gf saw my message and didn’t respond but she must have talked to Brad pretty quickly because Kate messaged me almost immediately about how dare I interfere in her life etc and how I was ruining Brads relationship and her friendship with Brad and with me, and then she blocked me and cut off all contact. 

A few months ago (2 years later from original issue) Brads gf messaged me thanking me for telling her and that I’d helped her get out of a bad relationship. Kate and I are no longer friends. 

I feel like there was no good way to handle this situation. When I was cheated on tons of people knew about it, and no one told me. I really wished that someone had done so for me, so I did what I thought was right.

No one really gets a long with her, she’s a bit of a drama queen, selfish, hates that our family is so close and despite our attempts at becoming closer with her, she just isn’t having it. However, I still try with her, a lot.

We ended up getting pregnant within months of each other. My third, her first. I offered to throw her a shower when the time came as I wouldn’t be having one since it’s my third kid. She gratefully agreed. We actually became a lot closer because of our pregnancies. She was still a bit of a bitch, but I could tell she was trying, especially with the baby.

I ended up having what would legally be considered a still birth at 20 weeks. It was traumatic for myself and my husband. My sister-in-law was really great, she and my brother took the boys for us during this time.

Fast forward a few months and I’m still struggling. The baby shower for my sister in law is coming up and I don’t even feel like going much less throwing it. I asked a different SIL if she could host, which she agreed. I explained to sister in law the change of venue and said I probably couldn’t come, explaining that these days are hard and I just couldn’t handle a party dedicate towards babies.

1162,No A-holes here,"I found a hairstylist who I really want to try because she had good reviews. I booked this appt in April and went last night, her first availability for new clients. This was a specialty appt and it took 3 hours. She told me the cost was $300, but when it was time time to pay, she swiped my card and left the screen on the tip icon. I was surprised and fumbled a little bit then said I'm sorry, I didn't leave a tip when I signed.  She said, don't worry, you're not obligated. She didn't seem bothered by it and I was happy with the cut, so did plan to go back except now I'm doubting myself and may be too embarrassed to return.

I didn't think I needed to tip. My reasoning was that she rents a salon suite. She works for herself and presuming she then doesn't have to pay a salon a percentage of her sales, I'm not obligated to tip. A 20% tip would be $60 extra for work she's already supposed to do...nobody tips me for my job! And she is charging a good amount for a cut, NO color.
It really surprised me that she had left it on the tip screen anyway, but my husband thinks I should have given a tip and was laughing at me. Am I the asshole?


Edit: 
1. To clarify, this was a specialty cut for curly hair. Only. No color, no chemical treatment. She cut, washed, styled and diffused. There was no assistant, no front desk, no other people.
She has an Instagram account where she says she is the owner. She has a little salon room with 1 chair and her sink, dryer and products. The building is a commercial building with lots of little rooms where specialty services rent out their own space-hair, waxing, nails, etc (on a side note, I've gone to a girl who waxes at a different, but similar location and doesn't charge me tip, doesn't leave the section of the charge open for it to even be an issue, so my experience here is mixed).
2. The stylist just sent me a text with pictures she took of my hair before/after and said she was happy to meet & hopes I enjoy my curls, so I'm guessing she WILL continue to accept me as a client.

1164,Asshole,"A couple of months ago, my wife and I planned a trip to Mexico for our family. Each of us was extremely excited about the trip (in August). We have never been outside of the country, and my kids (one son, one daughter) really wanted to see the temples / animals. It was particularly exciting to my son, who is even learning Spanish in school. We had planned to buy the plane tickets about one month before, so we could scan for the best airfare and go for it when the price was right.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, my son (11) has a habit of tracking dirt inside the house with his boots / shoes when he comes back from the park with his friends. I've told him probably 20 times to leave his shoes at the door, but it's very annoying because then his mother has to rewash the floor over and over. I tried taking away his desert or banning him from playing video games, but nothing seemed to work.

&#x200B;

Finally I've had enough, so I told him he can't come on the trip, and he's going to have to stay with his grandfather. We bought the other 3 tickets, and my son basically won't speak to me. My wife and friends think I over-reacted here.  I could still buy his ticket if I need to, assuming something is available on that flight.

I'm a high school student in a residential suburb of a large city. I've also been seeing my current boyfriend for several months now.

I've been babysitting for this family for about 4 weeks now. The child is 9, and I usually watch him about 3 days a week. Usually, he is very calm and reserved. Never had any issues with him. Today though, my boyfriend called me because he had to tell me something. I told him I was babysitting and couldn't talk at the moment.

Once I hang up, the kid asks me who I was talking to. This is the conversation that transpired. I am M, and the kid is K.

&nbsp;

K: Who was that?

M: My boyfriend. His name is [his name].

He continued to ask innocent questions that I answered, since I saw no harm in my answers. Until he asked me this:

K: So do you wear the condom, or does [boyfriend's name]? (We are a gay couple).

M: I don't think that's something you should be asking me.

K: Come on. Don't be lame. I'm cool enough to handle it.

M: What [boyfriend's name] and I do in private is none of your business, and that's the end of this conversation.

&nbsp;

Or so I thought. When his parents get home, he runs to them crying and says I was being mean to him (he excluded that it was because I wouldn't answer his question). His parents, obviously pissed, demand I explain myself, so I tell them what I explained above.

The mom takes me outside and begins SCREAMING at me, telling me I ruined this kid's innocence, and that I shouldn't have my phone with me at all when I'm working. I tell her it's a safety issue, and she completely ignores me. Mom is A.

&nbsp;

A: THERE IS NO WAY [kid's name] WOULD EVER ASK YOU THAT, YOU PERVERT.

M: I promise you that I'm being 100% honest. I have no reason to lie about this.

A: I'M NOT PAYING YOU FOR TODAY. DON'T EVER COME NEAR MY HOUSE OR MY FAMILY AGAIN.

Keep in mind, I was watching this kid for 5 hours today. Of course I was pissed she wouldn't pay me.

M: FINE BY ME. HOPEFULLY I WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOU EVER AGAIN.

1168,Not the A-hole,"I've worked at my office for 8 years. I'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

Five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. I'm not his supervisor, but I'm definitely a senior employee. I'll call the guy Ted Faro, because he's a dick.

​

Supervisor was going around introducing Ted to people, and when he got to me said ""This is John"" and described my job.

​

Ted: ""Hi, Jack.""

Me: ""It's John.""

​
Ted: ""What?""
​

Me: ""My name's John, not Jack.""

Ted: ""It's close enough for me.""

Supervisor: ""His name's John, not Jack. Let's move on.""

​

This continued for a few months. Despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when I wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name Jack. I finally told him ""You either use my name, or I ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

His response was ""Sure thing, Jackie boy.""

​

Since I don't work directly with him, I figured ""screw it"" and that I'd ignore him.

​

Recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. I work late some nights, and Ted came to me and says ""Hey, Jack, I'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when I get back. See you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

As promised, I ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and I get a call. I recognize his number, so I ignored it. He called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

The first one was along the lines of ""Jack I'm at Enterprise. Come pick me up.""

E-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as Jack, Jack-o, Jackie, and Jackie-boy. The emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

I signed out and went home. It was raining hard.

Next morning, I saw that Ted had sent a few more e-mails. I printed them off. At 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""Where the [f-bomb] were you? I told you when to pick me up! I HAD TO TAKE A CAB! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT COST ME?!"" He goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

Supervisor: ""Ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. He was caught out in the rain.""

​

I relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. I'd highlighted the threats.

Supervisor: ""I can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. But it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. That's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""With the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. Just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

A few people at the office have commented that I'm the jerk for ignoring Ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

So I'll try and keep this brief. My mom died when I was young, around seven years old, and a year later my dad was remarried. His new wife and I never got along, to the point that our relationship has been downright hostile at points. They've been married for fifteen years now and I still very rarely go home since I've moved out (and six hours away) because of how hostile our relationship can be. Most of the time when we're not in the same room we can play nice. I get her mother's day gifts and say ""love you"" before I hang up the phone even though I don't, just so I don't cause any arguments, because they always always escalate. She acts in similar ways, sending texts checking up sometimes or cards for holidays.

And I admit that some of the arguments are my fault and I sometimes lean more into them than I should. Our personalities just completely clash, and on top of that there's over a decade of hurt feelings and unhappiness on both sides. My dad refused to ever get involved or take sides because he consistently says that if we actually cared about him, we'd just suck it up and get along. We've tried family counseling, but it never worked out in the time I lived with my parents.

I have a step-sister through this marriage, and we're not the closest siblings but we do love each other. She's seven years older than me and is married with two kids. Recently during a family holiday, after things blew up between my step mom and I again, she decided to talk to me about what would happen when my dad eventually passed away. I was honest with her and told her that I don't plan on keeping in contact with my step mother in any way once my dad is no longer around to force us to be around each other.

My step sister got really upset at me and said that it was an asshole move. She claims that my step mom really does love me, which I don't believe. She and my step mom also have a tough relationship, sometimes, but it's nothing like the one I have with her, and I think my step sister sees the relationship between us through her own experiences. She went on to say that if I did eventually cut contact with my step mom, she would keep me away from my niece and nephew because I would be choosing to ""end my relationship with the family and those are the consequences.""

I genuinely thought my step mom and I not being forced to be around each other would be better for everyone and would make both of us less unhappy, but now I'm questioning if my sister is right and it would just make me an asshole to stop trying. It would clearly be going against the wishes of my dad and my sister. So, would I be the asshole?",23,48,0.91

1174,Everyone Sucks,"So two, maybe three? years ago my brother (ftm) went through a lot of changes really quickly. He and his then wife moved to a big city a day's drive from home, and things fell apart. They both got into other relationships before getting a divorce, and he moved in with with his new partner in a town even further away. During the move he came home to visit and told me and my mom he was genderfluid. Mom was upset, but we talked her down and I reminded her that I hadn't identified as female since I was 3 so this should be no big deal.

A week later my mom starts posting on Facebook about the difficulties of having a trans child and I text her ""hey that's not the right word, he's genderfluid"" and mom corrects me that actually he's fully transitioning and will be starting hormones in a few weeks. I'm stunned. But I start using his preferred pronouns and try to show as much support as I can, because that's what I would want if I started presenting as male.

I felt like I was lying to him about being supportive though, so one day I call him up and (after making some anxious small talk) ask when he knew, why he never talked to me about it when he knew I felt like that too, etc. He tells me he would've gotten in trouble with our conservative parents, but I say that doesn't make sense because I used to talk to him about my stuff. I say I just wish he'd thought about it a bit longer than that because it feels like he's rushing things, and I wish he'd moved back home instead of further away. Then he gets quiet. I say I love him and hope I can see him soon. We hang up.

A month or two later I haven't heard from him but that's not a huge deal, we didn't text regularly to begin with. Then my mom starts getting cagey on why she won't come visit me one weekend (we usually grabbed a coffee every Saturday) when it hits me. It's because he's visiting and doesn't want to see me. I check Facebook--he blocked me. Same with my phone and Twitter. Mom confirms that he's visiting and didn't want her to leave to go see me. I...kind of lose my shit.

I ask my mom if she's abandoning me too, since she doesn't want to see me. I say it wouldn't surprise me if he changes his mind a year from now and detransitions. I find a group chat I haven't been blocked from where he calls me a transphobic neo-conservative who's trying to be ""a good trans"" by not transitioning. I draft a letter that starts off coherent but ends up saying ""fuck you for thinking I hate you for transitioning.""

It's been years since we've talked. I saw him briefly when he, his partner, and our mom came to my job on a day my mom though I had off and I tried to ask how he'd been, but he said he wouldn't talk to me and locked himself in the car before his partner came over and cussed me out.

1175,Update,"[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bsnoo6/wibta_for_graverobbing_our_family_pet/)

I wanted to make an update on my AITA post.

I couldn't keep it a secret for very long and told my wife. She was livid but it blew over the next day. She said she doesn't want it in the house or anything else for that matter. She said she wanted it in the ground with our dog but didn't want me to go through that again, so we keep it in my safe for the time being. It's never to be brought out, especially shown to our daughter who is not going to be made aware.

I decided to seek some professional help as per the suggestion of one poster and I've been told I have (diagnosed?) depression. They asked me 20 some odd questions and the only ones I didn't answer ""yes"" to was things like harm. My doctor advised me to hold off getting another pet until I can fully grieve.

It's hard because my last dog was bought by my parents and lived with the family until I moved out and brought it with me. This one that just passed I did all the work. I drove to get her, I paid for her, I did everything. There's recurring feelings of guilt that I didn't do as good as I could have and I nitpick on things I've done wrong in the past regarding the dog. It's not healthy for me to have another one, at least for now. It's probably the hardest situation I've been in my whole life and it was playing with my head so much I did what did.

I'm considering a penguin tattoo as memorial likewise as someone suggested.",139,2181,0.98
1176,Not the A-hole,"I am using a throwaway account for this for anonymity from mutual friends and whatnot.

**Background info:**My best friend of 20+ years has 7 children from 6 months - 10 years old (2 sets of twins, and 3 singles) She also works a TON.  We don't get to hang out as much as we used to because of the work / kids / life obligations.  We talk every day, but the rare times (once every 2 months maybe) that we get to do something she always has to bring at LEAST 3-4 of her kids.  It makes doing anything a hassle.  Lugging them around, dealing with diaper changes, someone always starts having a screaming tantrum.  5 minutes in someone will start whining that they are bored / tired / hungry / etc.   I never complain because I LOVE my friend and miss her and I am willing to work with her situation so that we can go out.  However, she has a husband.  He gets to go out all the time and leaves her home with all the kids.

I do visit her at home, but we barely get to even talk because basically my presence is just an extra pair of hands for getting juice, breaking up fights, and changing diapers while they screech and scream that high pitched toddler scream until you're ready to dig your own brain out with a spoon.  If her husband is there, the minute I walk in he disappears upstairs, to the garage, or straight up leaves.

**So, here is the AITA question:**My birthday is coming up in August.  I asked her if for my birthday we could do a day of shopping, lunch, and maybe a movie and NOT bring any kids.  She got really upset and gave me 100 reasons why she had to bring at least this one, and that one.  I kept giving her solutions to the problems (Give the baby pumped milk for the day and we can take a pump break whenever you need.  I will help pay for a babysitter.  etc. etc.) and she just got more and more agitated with the back and forth about it until she got stern, completely brushed off my suggestions, and said it wasn't going to happen - end of story - we can do something with the kids or hang out at her house.  So I told her fine and dropped the subject.

I made plans with another friend to go out for my bday.  We bought tickets to see a show and plan to go to dinner.  The friend posted about it on facebook and BFF saw it and called me.  She was really super hurt and told me I was being completely insensitive and dismissive of her children.  She says I really hurt her by completely ditching her to hang out with someone else.  That if I were a true friend and not being selfish I would be happy to just hang out with her and not demand a fancy day out while dismissing her kids.   I'm torn.  I don't know if I'm being a jerk.  I feel like I should be able to go out with another friend if I want to. But at the same time ***I AM*** ditching my best friend for someone else after I already asked her to hang out on my bday (edit: to clarify, we did NOT make set plans.  I just asked **her** to make plans **first**.  When she didn't agree to what I wanted to do, I then made plans with someone else.  I did not cancel plans with her.  I just chose to make them with another person and she feels betrayed) AITA?",334,1428,0.97
1177,Not the A-hole,"I feel deceived and sad.

I've(27F) been with my fiance(31M) for 5 years. We didn't go on any sort of trip during all those years - mainly because I've been stuck at university the first few years we've been together and then when I started working I didn't get any holiday or vacation leave simply because I needed money, I've been saving money to buy a flat. Fast forward few years, I have a flat, I have a car and we're living very comfortably. It's also the first time I got my vacation leave at work so we planned on going somewhere abroad. 

And there's the problem - we're not going anywhere. 

He has a younger sister, she's 28 and totally incapable of taking care of herself. She didn't go to university, doesn't want to work, she's still supported by their mother. Mind you, she lives a very prestigious lifestyle so often it comes to a situation when she doesn't have money for essential things like rent or bills. When she doesn't have money and her mother can't give her more, she asks my fiance. We argued a lot about it, because often he'll give her money and then he can't buy something for himself. After our last argument he agreed to stop all financial support until she gives back the money she already owes. It is about 2000$ at this moment, it may be more maybe I wasn't informed. 

He lied. He gave her money again and only admitted it after I confronted him about her recent calls. I knew it would happen, we talked about it a lot before - she's going to Brazil and has a hard time financing it, her mother wouldn't give her the whole sum. And she asked him again, lying she needs money for rent. Long story short we argued a lot about it, I was really angry he lied to me. When I cooled down after a week or so, the topic of our trip came up... And well, then it hit him that he can't afford it anymore because of current expenses. Basically he gave her money that he saved for holiday.

Am I really in the wrong here though? I just wanted to have something nice after years of working my ass off. Is it really this much, going somewhere nice for once? I feel like it is, now he makes me feel bad and says I'm spoiled because I've been pampered my whole life. I'm angry, sad and dissapointed, I started to question if I should be with him.",35,74,0.93

1179,Not the A-hole,"Because according to my boyfriend & his best friend/our now ex-roommate, this is the most disrespectful thing I could have said. 

Let’s back up a step. 

My partner & I rent a very cute little home, his childhood best friend who is in-and-out of trouble needed a fresh start. Obviously all the usual red flags, I didn’t protest exactly but I made my fears known: this can easily go south in the best of circumstances! It’s been three months of this 30 yr old man child leaving beard hair all over my bathroom sink 2x a week, leaving trash all over the house, I’ve found my good glassware tipped over/dropped and left on the front porch, garbage scattered outside from his hood rat friends drinking on my porch for the neighborhood to see despite repeatedly being asked to TAKE IT TO THE NICE FIREPIT WE HAVE IN OUR BEAUTIFUL AND PRIVATE BACKYARD, etc etc. 

I’ve been feeling like a housemaid for three months now because I refuse to live like this. I’ve also talked to my partner about this because he doesn’t like it either, but babies the shit out of this friend because of “how hard his life was growing up.” Now, his life has been hard, I’m not denying that, but he’s 30 years old and in-and-out of jail for violent charges for his dumb ass decisions. He’s clearly an irresponsible idiot, but I’m the bad guy for having cleanliness expectations. 

This past week is a great example of the norm: I cook a large dinner for all of us 2-3x a week. He makes a huge mess gathering his meal, then throws everything in the sink for me to wash up & goes upstairs to smoke/drink. If I don’t cook for him that night, He’ll heat up ramen or other simple things, make a sink full of dishes, and leave the house. This whole incident sparked bc of day three of me trying to wash my dishes around his shit. I’m typing this on day 5 & they are still there, btw. 

Background bitching aside, this all comes to a head when my partner is upset at me for voicing complaints on housemaiding, abdicates responsibility for his friend & tells me to say something, I say the afore-mentioned line, & he storms out & has a BREAK DOWN to my bf about it later that night. I’m “disrespectful” & “judgemental” & he’s moving out in anger, they are speaking on the front porch bc he’s refusing to come inside the house again. 

My bf wakes me up with “well, I hope you’re happy now that you got what you wanted.” Don’t worry, we’ve obviously discussed how fucking unfair that was to say. 

My point to this long ass post is this: Am I the asshole in all this? I feel like I got thrown into a no-win by two boys who I repeatedly told “no” to. My bf is furious with me bc I no longer feel comfortable in my home (he and friend have not talked in two days but he still has a key and I’m home alone with my pets today). 

This is stupid.

BTW, this sub is a giant PITA to post on 🖕🏾

*edit: everything about starting over, doing things right, learning how to adult with us at this house ALL OF THIS was discussed waaaayyyyy before he moved in, all agreement to this “fresh start” that went right out the window 🙃",118,441,0.92

1181,Asshole,"Throwaway in case she finds this, because I have stuff on my regular account I don’t need her associating with me.

I’m 25 and my sister is 28. My sister is visiting our hometown (she lives across the country), and I’m seriously pissed at her over something that happened last night.

We went out to get drinks, and she started prying into my personal life. I recently had an engagement end, but we decided to keep living together (both on the lease and it’s a 2br) and just see other people. She was asking how it worked, if we were still dating and it was an “open thing”, etc. And I got really sick of how prying and digging she was, because she was only asking so she could judge, and told her she had no business trying to give me advice because her relationship isn’t perfect either (they’re in counseling and don’t even live together). Plus her boyfriend before this one hit her so it’s not like she can really give advice about healthy relationships (I didn’t say this obvs). 

She always asks me about shit like relationships or career but I think she does just to “compete” with me. We used to do Fitbit challenges across the country which I should’ve won because I walk more in a day but she started walking to and from places instead of driving *just* to win. She’s *always* been like this. I go to culinary school, she gets a “professional degree”, then she asks me about work. Income came up in conversation once and she was like “I didn’t know chefs made that much, that’s a lot for *hometown*” (the place she lives has a notoriously high cost of living. 

So I snapped at her and she went all quiet and passive aggressive pouty. So we leave and she grabs the check because she likes to use money to show she’s better than me, and I’ve had a few so outside I sort of explain to her that I’m sick of her digging into my life just to make herself feel better. So she starts crying because she has a victim complex and always cries when someone is mad at her because she knows it gets her out of trouble. 

She didn’t say anything to our family or anything, but I told my friend about it and he said I was being too hard on her. So, AITA?",448,542,0.86
1182,Everyone Sucks,"Basically, I despise seafood and I am sick of people trying to get me to try it, over and over again. I don’t understand it, people don’t do this with other foods, but apparently seafood is so magical and great that I should try it and eat it. I’ve never liked any form of seafood I’ve tried and I refuse it every time. It’s so infuriating and frustrating.

My in-laws don’t let up every time there’s seafood in the house. Once, when I was pregnant, my mother-in-law told me to “try this” and fed me lobster ravioli. This was extra frustrating because I’m fairly certain pregnant people are supposed to stay away from seafood (or at least tuna lol).

I’m just worried about being sensitive to people with allergies, because I know it can be a frustrating and potentially deadly thing. It sounds silly, but I’m just so tired of people telling me to try it. Of course my in-laws know I’m not allergic. Also I would be afraid of someone I’m with “spilling the beans” if the topic came up, and then of course there’s potential for someone to laugh it off and press harder.

This is so silly but it’s truly maddening. Would I be the asshole???

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, everyone. You all had good reasons that I hadn’t thought of here (totally forgot that there are asshole people who will try to sneak it in to “prove” an allergy). I’ll continue to try and remain firm, people think it’s dumb if I get angry over it but maybe if I say things or do things like “wow you haven’t tried the chicken??? It’s great!!” “Wow, you won’t ever eat fast food??? Well you should! Seriously! Let’s go to McDonald’s right now!!!” People May start to see how frustrating this is to me. :)",58,74,0.83

A few days ago, I was at home and I saw this woman with my own eyes doing the same thing, so I immediately went outside and started to shout in a loud and annoyed voice ""Excuse me?"", while walking towards her. I continued ""My front yard is not an outlet for dogs!"".

She immediately returned fire in an annoyed voice: ""Calm down, I'm cleaning up the dog poop afterwards so there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing!"".

I continued: ""Whether you are cleaning it up or not does not make it any better. It is my front yard, and I don't want dogs to poop there.""

She responded: ""Well, that's your problem. And I will continue to let my dogs poop there.""

Some yelling continued between me and her, and eventually I went back inside, looking for legal ways to deal with the problem.

I fully understand that yelling is not the correct way to handle this, but I was angry and I got even angrier by her arrogance.

*On a side note: My front yard is currently nothing more than some piles of dirt, because I am currently flattening the ground to create a grass field and plant a tree. This might caused her to more easily let her dogs poop there.*

1186,Asshole,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. 

So I told my fiance on the way to work this morning that I paid my buddy to build me a new PC. I originally gave it to him to repair, which he could've done for about 200 bucks. But he told me that he could build a new, much better one for 500. So, using a credit card I have no balance on, I gave him the 500. 

She's concerned because we have a baby on the way, due in October. She's worried about her maternity leave getting cut short, and having to adjust our budget with the new addition (child care, diapers, etc.).

We are better off financially than we have ever been, and I don't think the expense is a big deal, I will have it paid off before the baby even comes. She won't say it, but I can tell she's angry. AITA for spending the money without checking with her or something?

Edit: I will concede that IATA for not talking to her about it first, but it seems the general vide here is that I put us in a bad position financially. This is not the case.

Two final year girls were late from the lunch break and when they ran by, one asked me if I knew where their examination group was relocated. Note: the teachers had to change classrooms literally last minute because of broken A/C, I know since I was chatting with my friend from final year when that happened.

The other girl of those two annoys me to no end, she bullied one of my friends for a whole year and convinced her classmates to call her a lesbian when passing by. I don't know much about the one that stopped me, though, except that the two of them are friends.

So I gave them the wrong classroom number, mostly to get back at the other girl. My final year friend said the teachers wouldn't let them in after arriving late, because you were supposed to be in front of the designated classroom 15-20 minutes before the next part of the exam anyway.

1190,Not the A-hole,"About two years ago, one of my best friends had weight loss surgery. She worked her ass off and lost a ton of weight, changed her whole life, and now when I look at her I can see the confidence in her eyes. I’m so, so happy for her! Truly, I am. She completely changed her eating habits and is much healthier...but I can’t deal with her constant talk about dieting anymore. 

Every single time I see her, or god forbid go out to eat with her, all she talks about is restricting foods. She complains when she gains two pounds, and I always try to deflect it with “the average person fluctuates in weight every single day,” but all she can focus on is that two pound weight gain. I’m not worried she has an eating disorder, because she still eats pretty well, but her constant talk about food guilt is super triggering for me. Like, she’ll eat one cookie and talk for ten minutes about how much she’s going to have to work it off at the gym the next day. It makes me feel like garbage about myself and I’m a pretty small person. 

I feel like an asshole for thinking this way and for finding her annoying, because I truly love her as a friend and I want to see her happy.

I do not have an eating disorder diagnosis, but I also don’t have a  healthy relationship with food and have gone through several periods of having a hatred for my body.

She said to me if I could run it through my leg (I have hairy legs) and not make a sound she would give me 50$. We laughed about it and I didn’t think she was serious.

When we got back to the house after a while she remembered her razor and said that if I didn’t make a noise or any facial expression she’d give me 50$. I quickly accepted because I didn’t think she was serious the first time and now that she was adding conditions she must be confident in the razors abilities. 

I let her roll it up my leg and to be fair to her it was excruciating pain having my hairs being ripped out.

I did not flinch and I did not make a sound, and when I asked for the 50$ she said “you didn’t think I was serious did you?” “We didn’t shake on it” etc.

I put up a half hearted argument and gave up. A week or so later she reminded me about 150$ I owe her for her help in a laptop I bought. I remembered the bet and told her I owe her 100$.

1194,Asshole,"A few months ago, I went on school camp with the rest of my year level (approximately 70 people). This scenario occurred after we had finished the 4-day hiking camp and were waiting the bus to pick us up and take us home. We were located in this small park which included some picnic tables, a playground, and an oval, and basically had free reign of the area until it was time to leave. 

Nutella is banned in my household due to it being unhealthy, which is a shame because I've always loved it. This means that whenever I have the opportunity to eat it outside of the house, I do. This camp was one such opportunity, and I had eagerly bought myself a small jar to have with some bread, before realising that a classmate in my camping group was severely allergic to nuts. Nuts and nut products are 100% allowed in my school, and there are no restrictions whatsoever, as you're supposed to be responsible enough in High School to be able to monitor what you eat. That said, I decided to ask this classmate if I could bring the nutella anyway, just to be safe. I told them I would not eat it around them, and that I would wash my hands after touching it, but the classmate still said that they would prefer it if I didn't. I was upset, but fair enough. I kept the nutella at the bottom of my bag and didn't touch it. 

Now, when we got to this park after the camp had finished, and I saw that we had a good hour ahead of us in which we could all spread out and relax, I decided I wanted to have the nutella. I knew that the classmate hadn't wanted me to have it while we were hiking, but this was different, and we were all much more spread out now. I asked them if I could go over to a spot two hundred meters away from the picnic tables (were they were situated) and eat the nutella there, but they said they would still not feel comfortable if I did, and this made me pretty annoyed. 

I could understand not wanting me to have it while we were 'living' together whilst hiking, but this was a good two hundred meters away! And people have nutella (and other nut products and nuts) at school all the time, in the same area as this classmate. Literally every day. So I didn't see why it was such a problem. I went to the spot, ate the nutella, and then washed my hands. To my knowledge, the classmate never realised I had done so. 

So, was I the asshole for eating the nutella when a severely allergic person had asked me not to, even though I did so two hundred metres away and even though nut products are eaten all the time at school?",244,397,0.9
1195,Asshole,"Alright, before I'm being accused of slut shaming, I too hooked up with a woman on this trip. Over the weekend and on a Friday night.

My close friend though, very smart and very sexy girl, I think went over board.

We were there for 2 weeks at a training seminar. Firstly, she's dating a guy back at our office for months casually but their 'exclusivity' isn't my business. But I highly doubt he'd accept this behaviour.

My issue was her going out drinking with guys in class, getting wasted and spending the night at their place. Then helping her drunk ass get dressed for training and having to lie to the trainer's saying she's sick (super hung over) twice!

She did this 3 times over 2 weeks with only 1 time being on a Friday night (same night I hooked up) so that one didn't affect our training.

I'm annoyed at her too because I can tell she saw those two weeks like some paid vacation rather than a chance to learn. I know my boss pushed hard for us to get this certification.

We're back a week now and I'm seeing how little she absorbed in that class. 

I want to tell HR or my boss about her behaviour, I probably won't mention her sleeping with guys (not my business and if she didn't drunk tell me, I'd be non the wiser). I'm not doing this to punish her, after the first time she was drunk in class, I told her she can't do this again and that today was actually a pretty difficult important task. She begged me to teach her when I got back and I said only if I had the time.

We're still friends, but I do feel she should feel some consequences for this and have a reality check. She gets by in our office too much on her looks. We work in engineering and guys constantly treat her special and are easy on her.

Edit: I might be the asshole but maybe I should explain more.

It's 100% not a sexist or jealous thing. She's my best friend in the company and yes we've hooked up a few times before. We don't get jealous of others, I show her guys she might like and she does the same for me (with girls). She was very hard working initially but now she's getting complacent and getting by because all the guys here are nice to her. I don't care if she's cheating on Ramon, he's a good guy but they've only dating 3 or 4 months.

The training in Jamaica is very important, it's only been hosted in Jamaica because a lot of the students were from the Caribbean or LA and many didn't have US visas. It's on using a new tool that we're expected to be the go to guys for it. 

Her drinking didn't affect just two days, she was effectively lost totally in class the days after and only sort of caught up at the end as it was something new entirely. But I'd say she effectively missed the entire thing. 

I'm upset with her for being irresponsible knowing this responsibility is going to fall on us. And if I foresee things accurately I'm going to have to cover her load for a while until she catches up. 

That's the reason I want to tell my manager. I'm not going to mention her sleeping around. I'm not a fucking child, I mentioned it because that's what she was out doing after getting drunk. But that's not my or our company's business. 

I want to tell him so that he understands that my temporary workload will increase when we start using this new software. If she really tries she can learn and catch up in a month or so. We both have other duties and I shouldn't have to assigned more work due to her unprofessionalism.

That's all I want. I want her to buck up and at least understand she should take this stuff seriously especially since we're sharing this workload.

He had liked some pages, such as the EDL and EDL Armed Forces Division pages (he's ex-Navy), and had shared some articles in support of Tommy Robinson (he's in the news right now facing some legal trouble).

&#x200B;

Sarah asks me if Mark has ever made any unsavoury comments and treated me unfairly. It should be noted that Mark and Sarah are white (Sarah prides herself on being 1/8th Afro-Caribbean), I am subcontinental Asian. We get to chatting and I gather that Sarah will be reporting Mark to HR, not for anything he's said or done at work, but because of his personal interests. I tell her that Mark is a top guy. She calls me a sellout and a coconut. I tell her to stop being a busybody and keep her fucking beak out of business that doesn't concern her.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks later Mark goes missing on unscheduled leave. I pull another of the managers aside and find out that Mark is being investigated by HR and will be sacked. I am beyond pissed, so I do what any Britisher would do, I write a letter to HR. I throw glowing praise on Mark. I outright make shit up to make him look good. I also include that Sarah had approached me, and used derogatory language (calling me a coconut and sellout) and make a report against her.

&#x200B;

Long story short she went on ""gardening leave"" and it just came out this week that she has been let go because of this (not her first instance). Her girlfriend, who works in the same company as us but different team, cornered me in hysterics, bawling her eyes out and calling me an asshole. I tell her to get a fucking grip. The vice-chair of the LGBT society caught wind and made a snarky comment at the photocopier - I laughed in his face and walked away. One of my black colleagues (good friend) has straight up called me an uncle Tom and asshole for defending Mark whilst enjoying our ciggies .

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here? Yes, Mark is a racist, but he never ever let it interfere with his job.

Edit: to clarify - Mark was also sacked.",1082,1793,0.92

My dad has promised that I could pick if I wanted to go with him, and if I didn't want to go, then I could tell him, and he would be fine with it. But my mom is adamant that I don't know what I want, and she keeps telling my dad that I do want to go.

She also attempted to guilt trip me into going willingly, by saying things like ""Come on. You're making your dad sad by saying that you dont want to go.""

&#x200B;

All of the frustration from having to go every year kept building up, and then it all blew up last night. I ended up getting in a big argument with my mom. She kept saying that ""You're a CHILD! You don't get to choose if you can go or not"" (I'm 15). I was even showing her proof that my dad said it was my decision to go. She said I ""could've photoshopped it"" (???) I ended up blowing up on her, with tons of colorful language on both ends. It was not pretty. I regret it now.  I don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep going to saudi arabia anymore.

1201,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway bc I'm pretty sure the other person involved knows/stalks my main. 

This is pretty much what the title says. I [20M] am a bisexual guy. I've been quite involved with my unis LGBT+ society and it's mostly been great. However, there is one girl [19F] (let's call her Kate) who I have issues with. 

Kate is trans and a lesbian. She refers to herself as ""queer"". That's all fine and dandy, if that's the label that feels comfortable for her then power to her. However, she also uses the word to refer to other people, and basically uses it interchangeably with ""LGBT+"". I'm uncomfortable with this word being used to describe me. I was called it my whole life by my shitbag stepfather and childhood bullies, and it's associated with a lot of traumatic memories for me. 

Kate is aware of this. She still refers to me as queer. It ranges from directly asking my opinion ""as a queer person"" to sending society emails saying things like ""myself and (my name) are queer students at (our university)"". Every time I tell her I'm not queer, I'm bisexual, she tells me that it falls under the queer umbrella. When I tell her I don't like the word, she lectures me on reclaiming slurs to empower yourself and how I need to let go of the past and stop policing her language. I know I'm getting nowhere with her, but I'm wondering if maybe she's right and I am being a stubborn dickbag by refusing to accept this label that so many LGBT+ people have reclaimed???",472,1587,0.95

1203,Not the A-hole,"I dated my ex for 10 years and we went through a horrible breakup that left us both extremely mentally unstable for about two years afterward. We decided that because of how close we had been (dating from high school to mid twenties), the only way to get back to functioning humans would be to try to salvage a platonic friendship together. One of my best friends witnessed this breakup, and was there for me for the two years post breakup where I struggled with extremely self destructive behaviors: anorexia and alcohol and drug dependency. These destructive behaviors led to several trips to the ER from alcoholic ketoacidosis. (I’m much better now. No hospital trips for about two-ish years now) My ex and I have been on relatively good terms for the past few years, and then the two of them just hit me with that bomber. I know my friend has been delving into cocaine pretty hard, and my ex has been clean for the past few months. I feel guilty because I know he’s going to start using again and lose it, and she doesn’t understand his addiction or self destructive tendencies. I’ve also moved on and am super happy with my current boyfriend... the situation just bugs me for a few reasons. Reason number 1- trust. I don’t want to be friends with someone who would date an ex of mine. If my current boyfriend and I had to break up, but I still had feelings for him, what would stop her from trying to date him?
Reason number 2- she’s going to put my ex in danger of relapse... which at this point, I guess why should I care if he does or not? He clearly doesn’t care about straining friendships I have...

Am I an asshole for just cutting them both out of my life? I feel like they are the ones making the shitty moves. I’m just trying to decide if it’s worth it to deal with them anymore. Do they need help? Is it my job to give a shit if they do? I can’t decide who is the bigger dickhead in this situation.... me, him, or her? Anyone who can help me see an outside perspective on this... I’d appreciate it a lot.

1204,Not the A-hole,"I saw a similar post here a while ago and I feel like sharing mine too, though I think it's not that much of a deal.


I have recently moved in to an apartment with my boyfriend and my 2 year old black cat, Lucifer. Despite naming him Lucifer we also call him Lucy and Lulu. Some of the friendly neighbors visited our place with gifts as a welcome gesture and it did not take long for us to know that one of their 7 year old daugher's name is Lucy. 


The mother(who did not visit our place before and probably heard from the other neighbors) had been knocking our door asking us to change the name of our cat because

1. They are christians, and linking my cat name ""Lucifer"", which we also nickname ""Lucy"" to their daughter ""Lucy"" is offensive.

2. The cat is black, the little girl is black too, thus racist.


I declined her request as my cat was named even before we moved in, so it was just a coincidence that their names were similar. Whats more, my cat is a strictly indoor cat and nobody would probably hear me calling him ""Lucy"" or ""Lucifer"" outside our apartment, in fact nobody would have known that we owned a cat.


The neighbor is getting rather upset over this and even my boyfriend said that changing Lucifer's name is not a big deal, we could even lie to her that we have already changed his name. I said no, why should I change my cat's name or lie about him changing name when it is really none of her business? I don't want to give in to her over such silly reasons. AITA?


Update: Lol did not expect so many comments and upvotes. Actually this is jus 1 of the small incidents we have encountered after moving in, I wouldn't have posted here if I didn't see something similar earlier(the Sadie post). I do hope that the lady has given up as her last visit was more than a week ago, we never talked since.

We can't keep the cat due to allergies and we feel bad that this cat is suffering outside in the middle of winter (southern hemisphere)

Three years ago he decided to start his own business which I helped with by giving him a small loan and co-signing his lease. Like any startup, things have been difficult financially and the bills have fallen solely on me for the last 3 years. 

He says that things with the business are getting better, but not financially stable enough to contribute on a regular basis. I have understood and have been supportive but here’s the kicker, when he wants something he finds a way to pay for it. If he wants new parts for his truck, or to go out for drinks with the guys he finds a way to pay for it. 

I kind of snapped, telling him that I’m doing everything in the house (chores etc) and paying for all bills because he “can’t” but he finds money for the stuff he wants. 

His side is that he works hard, he works a lot and when he has an opportunity to treat himself he’s going to take it. I told him I was tired of being the sole provider of the house and for the last 3 months have only contributed enough money for pay for 50% of the bills.

1211,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I just bought an RV and took it out for the first time. She talks to everyone and everyone loves her and I do love that about her. However... 

She ended up talking to another family near us at the campground. It was an adult man, his parents, and his young cousin. So my wife does her thing and talks to these people for a bit and then they go do their thing and I didn't think much of it. The next day the young man came and asked me if he could borrow some tin foil and I said sure and then he talked my ear off  about nothing in particular. The next thing I know is that his parents are sitting outside our camper telling us their life story and their son's life story. 

Apparently he smoked crack and drank heavily and then found Jesus in prison and now he doesn't drink, do drugs, swear, etc. I have a brother that was in NA and AA and prison and that didn't work for him, my wife has a sister that was in NA and that did work for her. So whatever worked for this guy, cool.

We all had lunch together and then somehow we got talked into going out for fancy coffee with these people and we are sitting around at the coffee shop bullshitting and this guy started talking about how open he is that he's in recovery and about his religion and whatever and I asked him what the most difficult part of that all was for him and he gave me some weird answer about ""sins of the flesh."" - Which is a term that he used a few times and he basically said he's celibate and not interested in dating he just wants to find a person to marry. This was one of the first red flags for me. 

Then he started telling me about his church. I'm not irreligious myself and I'm not against anyone else's. There are some things that make me personally uncomfortable and when he started talking about his church having a shared bank account and such that ticked a couple more red flag boxes for me. Another one was when I bought some stuff to go from this coffee shop. He said something about making sure you have enough money to tip and if you want to go out and get drunk make sure you have enough money for that too which I thought was a weird comment coming from someone in AA. 

ANYWAY we get back to our RV and my wife tells me that they invited us to some concert half a country away with really expensive tickets in a genre we don't like. She also gave them our phone numbers and we have a group text going. 

I told her that I had zero interest in going to this concert, much less spending $100 a ticket and traveling so far for the privilege, and that our new ""friends"" made me uncomfortable. The adult son creeped me out a bit and I have some concerns about his sobriety and his motivations. His parents were great.

1213,Not enough info,"1 (39m) met my wife (38f) when she was in her mid twenties. Her daughter, ""C"", was almost six when we began dating. C had never known her father, who was abusive to my wife. She left him while she was still pregnant, so C had never had a male authority figure in her life. As we got more serious I easily took up the role of father-I was falling for this girl, and I believed if we were going to have a future than I had to become part of her family. How well I did is debatable, as any parenting method is, but at the least I did what I believed was best. I worked long days, and still managed to be present for C-I met all her friends and their parents, called her every day I was on a business trip, I'd stay up for 24 hours straight so I could go to concerts to celebrate birthdays with her. I was a father.

That's how I've always viewed myself and how she always viewed me. All her friends called me her dad, and she never once referred to me as anything different. Last year when she was eighteen we found her doing illegal drugs in our house, and we kicked her out because of it. We didn't cut contact, though at times she has verbally attacked us and purposely avoided contacting us to make us worry. But whenever she shows up we give her food and let her stay with us if she wants-we want to help her, but until she stops doing drugs we don't want her living with us. She has to go to rehab or make some effort at recovery.

This week she called me from a low-rate motel asking me to bring her some groceries because she's out of money and starving and her boyfriend is blowing their money...Idk, the idea of my kid starving deeply unsettles me so I went. When I got there, she had several people in her room hanging out. She introduced me, and this is a quote, ""Guys, this is (name), my step-father"" and took the groceries and said goodbye.

I'm not upset about the short visit, because that's just par for the course by now. But in her whole life this girl has never called me her step-father before. I'm just upset that she feels so distant from me that she doesn't even consider me her father anymore, especially when I consider her my daughter and I'm doing all I can to help her. It just hurt is all, but when I told my wife she told me I shouldn't expect more out of a drug addict, and I shouldn't try to dictate what labels C uses. She told me I am technically C's step-father and I need to let her set the definitions of our relationship. I'm kind of pissed that not only does my daughter not want to be my daughter anymore, but on top of it my wife doesn't have any sympathy for it.

AITA for feeling upset? Should I just get over myself?

Edit: Lotta replies on this, I'm almost surprised how this has blown up. I'd like to clarify a few things that I should have made clear in the first place. When I say we kicked our daughter out, it was more of an explosive fight that had been building between her and her mother for months. They're both very hot-headed individuals that fight a lot when they're around each other. My wife decided to impose the law that after her children graduate from high school they have the summer to get a job or enroll in college, with us paying for the classes, or they can no longer live with us. I personally have a bit more leeway given-C's never had a job before, so I think if she can't find one on her own over the summer then I could always help her. But I backed up my wife and instead I tried to help her over the summer, but she wasn't very interested. She let me help her make a resume, and then said she was just going to pound pavement and apply at any business.

She didn't end up with a job, she had never checked into enrolling in college, and most days she was avoiding responsibilities to go over to her boyfriend's apartment and, we now know, do drugs. When I say ""avoiding responsibilities"", she would leave her eight year old and ten year old sister and brother alone in the apartment when she said she would watch them, she wouldn't do any chores around the house, which all our children do because they live in the house so they need to help keep it clean, and we wouldn't know any of this until we got home from work and saw it. The drugs-which were not pot, not a joint, we're talking drugs you cook on a spoon and use a needle for-were kind of the last straw. Right then we told her this wasn't working, and I said she could either let us take her to rehab or leave. She said she'd rather live with her boyfriend than tyrants like us, we're terrible people that never loved her, she hates us, the whole shebang. I let her pack her stuff, and I tried to tell her that if she changes her mind or needs help she can call us-her mom would have been there saying the same thing, but both of them were still in a fighting mood so they didn't want it said or heard. She left.

For people saying kicking her out isn't the right option-well, in an ideal world, yeah. But she's an adult. I can't force her into rehab, I can't force her into my house, and until she's ready to give up drugs I can't force her to stop doing them. I'll admit I don't know what the right thing is, I'm just as lost here as anybody would be, but I can't risk the safety of two young children so she can feel enabled in her drug use. I'll give her food, and I'll offer rehab and recovery methods and anything else she's willing to take from me, but drugs don't come under my roof and she's decided that means neither will she. I don't know what the better way to handle this is, but I'm trying to help everyone involved.",318,691,0.95
1214,Asshole,"Okay hear me out.

So today I took my baby over to my parents’ house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she’s home with the kid all day while I’m at work and needed a break—so I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It’s a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, ‘disobey a sign’ is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know…).

Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We’re home now and she’s asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid’s RESP (university fund).

‘My wife was absolutely furious when she found out’ is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

1215,Asshole,"To give a little background, my husband and I just had our first child a couple months ago. Before our child was born, my sister-in-law had set a date in which she wanted the entire family to attend a party to celebrate the union of her and her husband in Ireland. My sister-in-law's husband is from Ireland and they had to do a courthouse wedding for immigration purposes. No one was invited to that ceremony and no one in the family was invited for the after party except for her close friends. Fine, no big deal.

However for YEARS they had been talking about doing a big wedding in Ireland. We kept waiting for information, but none came about. Fast forward to now, they've decided to not do a wedding but hold a party so that her side of the family could finally meet his side of the family. That's great, except the date of this party actually falls on our child's first birthday. We don't have a lot of money to send all of us and to be honest the stress of travelling with an infant overseas is not something I want to deal with.

I've been to Ireland, but my husband hasn't so I do want him to go and experience it. To add to the complication, the majority of my husband's family doesn't seem keen on the idea of travelling to Ireland (including his parents) so I'm sure my husband feels an even bigger obligation to go. At the same time, I don't want my husband to miss our child's first birthday. Would I be the asshole if I didn't want my husband to go to Ireland to his sister's celebration?

EDIT: Thank you all for your feedback! I just wanted to clarify a few things. I have nothing against my SIL, I would never try to purposely hurt her. In her defense, My sister-in-law set the date about a week before my child was born. I would never ask her to change the date either. You all are absolutely right about celebrating before or after my husband gets back. I think I was attaching my own feelings to the issue (my father wasn't around a lot, especially not birthdays). After all, it would be for us. Our child wouldn't remember it. As far as the rest of the family goes, I'm not really sure if they're going to attend. That said, if no one else is going I think it would be important for my husband to show up as an act of good will as one poster said. I really thought about it and honestly, I wouldn't want my husband to miss out on an opportunity to go to Ireland. I appreciate your honesty, truly.",90,281,0.95

1220,Not the A-hole,"I work for a large, well-known software company in California as a software engineer. Around 4 months ago my coworker told our team that she is pregnant. I work quite closely with that coworker on a core part of the product that my team develops for the company. It's just us two working on that part of the product right now. The rest of the team works on other parts of the product.

Ever since our coworker (let's call her Susan) told us she is pregnant her performance has dramatically dropped. She is working from home most days of the week which I can understand since she is pregnant, but I feel like there isn't really a good excuse for getting very little work done. This means my work has dramatically increased. I've went from working mostly 6.5-7 hour days to working 10-11 hour days 5 days per week just to get all of our work done. Every other week I have a one-on-one (1:1) meeting with my boss and I have told him pretty much every time that she is doing very little work. It has gotten to the point where most of the time she just pretends to be busy. I'll give her a call sometimes to ask about something in the codebase and her answers just point to the fact that she hasn't really been focusing on anything happening at all recently.

Anyway, my boss assured me the last couple of 1:1 meetings that since she is getting close to delivering her child there will be someone else from our team to take her place while she is gone for 6 months for her parental leave. However, I just found out last Friday that she was fired. My boss told me that a senior member of my team that I have worked with before will be taking on her duties.

I can't help but feel that it's partially my fault that a pregnant woman was fired, but at the same time I feel like if she was feeling sick due to the pregnancy and unable to work she should have just taken some leave from the company to recover and return at 100%. We have fantastic health insurance including short and long term disability insurance and I find it strange that she didn't explore those options instead of choosing to work full-time and do very little...

AITA that my pregnant coworker was fired? I asked my family and some friends and most of them seemed to agree that I should have cut a pregnant woman some slack and just worked extra for a few months while she delivered the baby and someone else replaced her while she was gone. However I feel like I didn't really do anything wrong. I shouldn't be exhausted all day and night due to the extra work because of someone else's matters.

1222,Not the A-hole,"Me, my best friend Jon and a group of friends are all military and have been close for years. Even though I am female Jon and I have always been platonic.

Jon's gf is the worst. Shes a gold digger, super rude and toxic. Me and Jon went out for his birthday last year, she wouldnt stop calling him (even though we invited her multiple times) burst in two hours later and cussed him out in front of everyone. That's how awful she is.

Her and I recently got into a spat while ago. I was TA in the fight and refuse to apologize. I want nothing to do with her.

Me, Jon and our regular group of friends are planning a trip to Mexico in the spring. She doesn't have the money to go but if Jon wants to pay for both of them it's not really my place to stop that, and if I am any more of an asshole to his girlfriend it might ruin the friendship. 

Would it be awful if I asked the main organizer to give me a heads up if she puts the money down so I can bow out? Another friend said not to do that, but I cant listen to her complain as usual day in and day out for a trip like that. My friend said I could try and avoid her, but Jon usually hangs out and drinks with me when given a choice, so shell be there third wheeling it and complaining even more.

1224,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I planned a beach trip to Destin, FL with our 6 month old daughter. Her parents invited themselves on the trip, insisted that we all stay in a single beach house, and picked out a rather large and expensive place with a terrible cancellation policy. Wanting to keep peace, I said fine and we booked the beach house with our own $ with the mutual understanding that our in-laws would pay us back (which they never did).

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months, and our in-laws have started seeing articles about some rare, flesh eating bacteria in their Facebook feed. Her mom forwards every piece of information she sees about this bacteria to my wife and insists we cancel. My wife is put in a terrible position between wanting to make me happy by not cancelling (I truly believe the bacteria is rare enough to not worry too much about, especially if we take the proper precautions and not enter the water with open wounds) and pleasing her mother (who lives in a bubble, never travels anywhere, and whose feed is full of sensational news articles about every scary thing that happens in the world). I don't want my wife to be in this position, and I know it was stressing her out to unhealthy levels, so I said screw it, just cancel if you want to.

My wife cancels, and we're out $1,200 because of the terrible cancellation policy on the house my in-laws picked out but never paid for. Her mom, in particular, is super happy. Now, we're looking at other places to spend our vacation, and my wife still wants to bring the in-laws along to whatever replacement trip we cobble together last minute. I told her I don't want them to come along since having them on their trip will just remind me of the other trip we cancelled, the money we lost, and the naivety of her parents. I believe their concern was coming from a good place but the whole situation infuriates me.

1225,Not the A-hole,"OK, so this is something I've been thinking over for a while now - really not sure what the right thing to do is and feeling bad about the whole thing. 

The basic situation is that I have a summer job as a waitress that I mostly like a lot... but there's this one regular who comes in that I really don't like to deal with. He's perfectly nice, best friends with the owner and everyone seems to like him. But whenever I'm his waitress he gives me kind of a bad feeling - he compliments me a lot, makes weird comments about my appearance, and asks sort of personal questions I don't want to answer. And it's tough because he's probably harmless, but again I'm just super uncomfortable serving him, and he always requests me as his waitress. 

So what I've been doing the last few times he's come in is either take my break or more often just pretend to be busy and ask one of the guy-waiters to take him instead. That also makes me feel bad, because it gives them more work when I should be the one doing it. I'm also afraid that I'm going to get fired because of it, and I guess I'd deserve it (again, really hesitant to complain to my boss about his like best customer and friend).

1227,No A-holes here,"My wife has a skin disorder called hidradenitis supurativia. I think I spelled that right. One of the caveats of this condition is she can't really wear deodorant as it exacerbates the symptoms. She bathes multiple times a day but if I can be candid, it's not always enough.

We got coupons for free massages on Christmas and decided to use them the other day. Mine went pretty well, although I doubt the merit of massages as I feel the same before as I did after, but that's besides the point. My wife, when hers was done, left the parlor without saying a word and waiting in the car while I settled tips.

Apparently her masseuse said ""you probably have diabetes because of your smell"" which killed the mood for my wife. She doesn't have diabetes, it's because of her condition. I'm paraphrasing the exact comment because my wife won't repeat it, but she felt dirty and vulnerable the whole massage because of it.

I phoned the parlor today and told them my concerns and that it's not right for a masseuse to make these kind of comments. The masseuse isn't a medical professional, how can she make that kind of remark when she doesn't know my wife's medical history or situation? They said they'd handle it and were as shocked as us.

So recently my girlfriends sister (we’ll call Maria) was caught cheating on her boyfriend (we’ll call Juan). This came as a shock because while they argued every now and then on the surface it seemed like a good relationship. They’re both kind and fun people. 

Well recently it came out she was caught cheating with one of Juans other friend. It was a shock to me like I said but I tried to stay out of it until she showed up at my apartment, I wasn’t about to shut the door in her face so I let her in. Immediately she went to my girlfriend crying uncontrollably telling her what happened, apparently Juan had tossed her out of his place along with anything she had there and my girlfriend had to told her to come to her at my apartment. 

I was annoyed because I didn’t want to be dragged in to this. I’m getting us all drinks while listening to her say it was a one time mistake, she wasn’t thinking straight and how Juan is being horrible for not wanting to work through it. Her and my girlfriend are as close as sisters can get so it didn’t totally surprise me when she agreed. I don’t say anything until my girlfriend asked me to basically agree Juan is being unreasonable. That actually surprised me because she knows my stance on cheating having been the recipient of that before. 

I tried to avoid but they both began to persist and so I told her the truth. Juan is hurt right now, you hurt him and maybe it was a one time mistake but that one time destroyed the trust in the relationship, he can’t trust you and so he doesn’t want to be with you. She immediately began to cry hysterically and my girlfriend began to scream at me because I’m “being ignorant”. She kept yelling saying that things happen and Juan needs to be a man about it and talk things out. I told her Juan doesn’t really owe her anything and that she needs to own up to what she did. 

This set her off because she perceived it like I didn’t care about her sister which isn’t true I just don’t want to be involved in such a hard situation. She began to curse at me and that was when I had enough, I got up and opened the door. I told her we’re not having a screaming match just so you can get nasty and to please leave. They both left and I got some rude text messages from her saying how horrible I am. Maybe I was a bit hasty in throwing them out but I could tell the conversation was going to get worse and worse the moment she began cursing and yelling. AITA?",93,241,0.97

I told her that it was a great deal because she already knows how to drive that car and it costs much less than buying a used one from somewhere else. 

Well, I got in an accident with that car two weeks ago, and while it wasn’t totaled and is still drivable we had to get the light fixed. I agreed to pay for the cost of the repairs since I was the one who was driving when the accident happened. However, my daughter insists that I lower the price on the car when I sell it to her since a car that’s been in an accident is worth less than one that has been in one and that this is the third time I’ve had an accident in that car. I think that it’s ridiculous that I would have to lower the price, especially since a car that’s been in three accidents isn’t that different from a car that’s been in two. And I told her exactly that. 

She’s still bugging me that I should lower the price, even telling me that her friend’s mom bought her daughter a car because she had good grades and the least I could do was lower the price to $8,000 or even $7,000.

1241,Asshole,"Hi all! 

I'm recently 21 and I'm not sure how to navigate drinking when around my parents. My father has struggled with alcohol addiction his entire life, although his last relapse (to my knowledge) was 5 years ago, which I believe may be the longest he's gone dry for.

I already follow the unspoken rule about never bringing alcohol into the house, I would never do that. However, I don't go out to eat often and when I do I'm now curious about trying small portions of different types of alcohol. For example, we're going to a ramen restaurant and I've always wanted to try sake.

I don't want to be TA to my dad, though. 

Drinking isn't something I can talk with about my parents, my mother does occasionally drink when away from my dad but never with him. She emphatically refused to get my first drink with me on my birthday, which I found a bit disappointing because that was something I wanted to do with her, as a rite of passage almost. I'm not talking about a bar or anything, just a small glass of wine with dinner. Anyways, that's off topic a bit. So, Reddit, I ask you. 

WIBTA for ordering a drink while out with my parents?

EDIT: I know not a lot of people have replied compared to a lot of threads but those who have have confirmed what I thought: I WBTA if I did this. I don't want to trigger my dad, I've experienced addiction too (not to alcohol or drugs) and it sucks. I don't need to be impatient, which is all this is, I have the rest of my life to drink away from my parents.

Thank you guys for the input, I really appreciate it. And thank you for the concern about my own weakness to alcoholism. I'm very, very careful around alcohol and will continue to be so for the rest of my life.",30,49,0.98
1242,Not the A-hole,"Background on this. My grandmother is in her early 90s and has moderate dementia. She has always been a difficult, angry woman long before this, but the dementia makes it worse. She screams at people, curses them out, and constantly demands to speak to peoples bosses (yeah she's a Karen). She lives at a senior facility (she lived with my mother for 2 years until she screamed that she didn't want to live with her anymore). 

My mother visits my grandmother 3 days a week and pays someone to visit her 2 days a week. My mother is retired. She lives within 5 minutes of my grandmother, I'm within 30 minutes. 

I went to visit my mother earlier this afternoon and my mom said that if there's a way on Saturdays I can take her day because 3 days a week is too much with my grandmother. I told her that I can do most Saturdays, however I cannot commit to every single one. I work 4-5 days a week (For the most part I work 4 days, but maybe 1-2x a month I work Fridays as well), and I often have plans on Saturdays and travel for the weekend. 

She was angry at me saying that it wouldn't work and that I would need to do every Saturday. I explained that again I could do most but that it's easier on me to just something flexible like Satudays or 1 week day. She got more angry, rolled her eyes and said something like ""Okkkkkkkkkkkay.

1243,Asshole,"My parents hire a group of three cleaning ladies to clean our house bi-monthly. For a while now, my mom has been complaining about how the quality has gone down. Basically, she said they did well at first, but since my parents have been hiring them for 3 years, the quality has slipped. My mom also says our family is overpaying (a few other families in the neighborhood hire the same cleaning ladies, and we're paying more than they are).

The thing is, my mom's a very timid person. She always tells the ladies to clean well and points out specific things they could be doing better, but they basically ignore her. For example, she wants them to clean up the sinks and all that well, but they don't. And my mom is too shy to tell them again or be authoritative, so she doesn't reprimand them or anything for ignoring her.

However, my mom also has a habit of occasionally getting angry and giving lectutes.

So, yesterday, the cleaning ladies came, and as usual, a lot of stuff wasn't done that well. My mom had finally 'had it', so to speak, so she pointed out all the stuff that wasnt cleaned properly and demanded it be cleaned. They insisted it had already been cleaned properly and that she shouldn't 'talk to them that way', and this devolved into a shouting match which ended in them quitting and telling her not to call them again.

I found the whole thing very funny, if only for the absurdity of the situation. For one thing, it's really funny how my mom has been timid and has let them do whatever they wanted for 3 years, and suddenly blowing up at them, as opposed to establishing authority from the beginning. 

My parents are both mad at me for finding it funny. My dad, on one hand, says yelling at someone you hired is no laughing matter, and my mom should apologize. My mom says I should've supported her more, because they weren't doing well.

I disagree with both. My mom has the right to tell them that they're not doing well if they aren't. But she also made the wrong move in letting them ignore her orders for 3 years and now suddenly insisting they do things properly. That's just not how it works: if you don't act authoritatively, people will slack off.

For some background, we have been married for 6 years and have a six month old baby. We have a great marriage but my wife is particular when it comes to cleanliness to say the least (she cleans the tracks on the sliding glass door with a vinegar soaked qtip once a month as an example). To me: eh, the dishes will done, wearing underwear twice and clothes a few times is not a big deal and maybe those beer bottles will throw themselves away (I'm kidding but I've heard ""Aaron those beer bottles aren't going to walk themselves to the recycling bin!""  many times). 

She made plans to take our son to visit her family over 4th of July and the about a week before and after. I couldn't get off work (cop) so I decided to stay here. It took me about less than 6 hours to ""trash"" the house. Or at least what my wife would consider trashed but it really was just fast food wrappers and beer bottles. But of course over the weeks it got worse and worse because laundry and more trash  and dog hair got added to the pile. I didn't mind it one bit but I did make a plan to make sure the day before she came home I would basically get out the push broom and snow shovel and throw everything away. 

Well she decided to come home a day early to surprise me while I was on shift. I have never, ever seen her this mad at me. She is beyond furious and I've heard asshole among many other things.  It truly didn't help that one of the dogs brought a scorpion in clinging to his fur so my wife is blaming that on the mess too.

So the title makes me sound like TA already, but please hear me out.

Also a throw away because lots of my co-workers are on here.

I started my job early December and had been planning a trip to Germany with my boyfriend to visit his family who lives out there. I told the team (there were 4 of us) that I would need these two specific weeks off so we could travel to see our family. Everyone I worked with was fine and I made a calendar reminder for everyone on our outlook and my boss approved the time off.

In March, one of my team members had been replaced by Janice (name changed). Janice worked in another department, but once we started training her over here I told her right off the bat that I will be gone 2 weeks in October. We explained that our boss only likes 1 of us out at a time, so we have to make sure everyone knows when one of us is gone so that we don't request the same time off. She said that was fine and then we never talked about it again.

Fast forward to today and I had told my boss, ""Hey, we bought our tickets to this day (3 days later) and will be coming back this day instead"" blah blah blah. Yesterday was our other co-workers last day and they aren't replacing her, so now it's just my boss, me, and Janice. My boss walks away and Janice asks, ""When is your trip again?"" I tell her when it is and she starts to FREAK out. She says her daughter is due with her first baby during one of those weeks I am gone. I told her she should tell our boss so that he can make arrangements during that time.

So Janice tells our boss and he explains, ""There can't be only one of us here. So and so's trip is a for sure thing and your daughter might be early or late. I'm sorry."" Janice tells him how she won't miss it and my boss goes off to their meeting.

So she looks and me and asks if I can move my trip back so she can be there. I told her no, we already got the tickets and we've had these plans for a long time and cannot move them. She starts huffing and puffing saying how she won't miss her daughters birth. I told her I get that, but we are going to see the BF's family and we have it planned around their kids time off. I apologized, but affirmed I really can't move the trip.

1247,Asshole,"Dear Reddit. In the past, I've camped in my sedan car by leaning the front seat back and using a sleeping bag.  With my gf of over a year now joining me on adventures, this is no longer a good solution if we are together and she has suggested / gotten excited about a crossover we could sleep in the trunk of. We've also been limited by what trailheads we can access and at what time of year due to not having high clearance, and we adventure together almost every weekend, weather permitting. I feel the optimal crossover is a 2019 Rav4 Hybrid for reasons, but she doesn't want to contribute financially to the upgrade whatsoever, so I'm not going to buy it. She doesn't sleep well/at all when we try sleeping in my sedan but she can't afford to buy a crossover for herself on her own. I make 3x her income but think she should at least pay for half the depreciation of my new car since I could just make do with my old sedan without her. 

In her words, she is upset that I ""have the attitude that she should have to pay for any benefit she gets out of our relationship"", but this is what seems fair to me, because I shouldn't be the only one paying for a benefit we both get just because I make more. She should instead be incentivized to make more.

Edit: Yes, the car would be 100% legally owned by me. I'm only asking her to pay 50% of the monthly  *depreciation* of the car, not 50% the total car value.

1248,Asshole,"This didn't happen recently but it came to my mind after reading about the steak post and I always was curious to see other people's thoughts on the matter. 

  
First, a bit of background: 

Basically what had happened was that we had spent the entire day together going out and exploring the city. It was late at night and we were both hungry so a lot of things were closed. We finally found a restaurant and we sat down and ordered our stuff. 

&#x200B;

Now, I didn't have headphones at the time and I wanted to see some video, can't remember what, so I asked her if I could borrow hers. She wasn't using them at the time and she declined. I could tell she was visibly annoyed, so I asked her what was up and she commented that we're at the restaurant together and we should speak to each other instead of being on our phones. 

&#x200B;

Which, don't get me wrong, normally I do agree with, if this was just a run of the mill date and our first time hanging out together I'd spend that time with her.

&#x200B;

However, I told her that we'd literally just spent the entire day together, our meals weren't even here yet, and I wanted to relax by watching a few videos / browsing my phone before the meal came because as much as I love her even I have a hard time speaking for an entire day on end and I just wanted a 10 or so minute downtime.

&#x200B;

Anyways, we argued about it and it soured the mood the entire day as we spent the entire meal not speaking to each other. Pretty shitty way to end off the day given how great it was before.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Me and my GF spent the entire day together and during the time the meal was being prepared at the restaurant I spent it on my phone watching YT and we got into a huge fight about it.

1251,Not the A-hole,"okay, so I am from England, and I'm 34 Male, and I just Moved to Texas from New York (where I'd lived for 4 years) and now I have more space and a yard, I decided to buy a flagpole and fly the St Georges Cross (the flag of England) and because my Wife is American we flew the american flag Underneath it, and we also have a Union Flag that is in the window of the spare bedroom, I like flags and I like having a connection with home. My wife has no problem with the situation.

&#x200B;

However my new neighbour across the street does infact have an issue, He visited me recently and told me on no uncertain terms that I have to either ""Take down the red cross flag, or put the american flag on top, you're in the USA now buddy"" I told him that I absolutely wouldn't be doing that, that this is private property and I can fly whatever the hell I want"" and then he just went on a rant about flag code and other such nonsense, He honestly stood at my door for 10 minutes while I tried to calm him down but eventually after he called me a ""Pathetic little Limey traitor"" I lost my temper and yelled ""get the fuck off my property, if any flag comes down It'll be the american flag, lowered right into a fucking bonfire, now piss off"" and then I slammed the door

since then I've gotten nothing but glares from him and his family and also my other neighbours who live next door to him, I've asked my neighbours to the left and right of me if they have an issue and they said they didnt care, and one of my neighbours even invited me and my wife round for a bbq and a few beers to celebrate us moving in.

1253,Not the A-hole,"EDIT: I made it quite clear to 'Karen' that as long as her work is being done, 'I see nothing, hear nothing' when she confronted me about my supposed snooping. I am highlighting the relevant portion from my original post since people either seem to not see it, or misunderstand it.

EDIT 2: I am absolutely **horrified** that so many people in this subreddit think that I, the supervisor, can **explicitly** tell my employees that they can just mess around on the internet while at work. **What country do you live in that allows this to be spelled out by management?** It's all nods and winks because I can't just tell people they can come to work and goof off.

I'm a supervisor and I'm pretty laid back. For my department, if you don't notice anything's wrong, then we're doing our job right. There's quite a bit of downtime and I don't mind my people going on social media, Reddit, YouTube (wearing headphones), or even planning their vacations on work computers **as long as their work is getting done.**

Enter: Karen. New hire, late-20s, is new to the job but learns fast and seems to know what she's doing. The older employees know I don't care if I'm walking by and I see someone surfing the web or watching videos. Karen's new so she automatically 'Windows Key'+M (shortcut to minimize all active windows) everytime I walk by and I chuckle but otherwise say nothing else. Since her desk is near the center of the office, I walk by quite frequently. After several times being 'caught' browsing sites, she minimizes everything and turns to me and asks if everything is alright. I say 'Yeah' and Karen's co-worker giggles.

**She takes it the wrong way and says she doesn't enjoy being spied on and that if I had a problem I should just say it. I'm stunned speechless for a few seconds and then I tell her that as long as her work is being done, I see nothing, hear nothing.**

Over the next few weeks, since walking around her area is unavoidable, I end up reinforcing the impression that I'm still 'snooping' on her. She gets so upset that she takes it up with HR. I get dragged in and when they ask me if I 'snoop' on her I say I'm not snooping on anyone at all. Karen says I'm lying since I'm always 'trying to catch her in the act' while leaving everyone else alone. To stop her from throwing everyone else under the bus, **I straight-up lie and say nobody is doing anything inappropriate.** HR wanted proof, I refused to spy on my employees for this purpose, and since Karen had nothing concrete, HR closed the meeting to 'deliberate further'.

After the meeting was over, word gets out (not from me) that Karen tried to screw everyone over and the entire department becomes a hostile workplace, with people being paranoid now of being watched. Karen goes around trying to catch people surfing non-work-related sites which just further fuels the paranoia. So now I'm angry at her for disturbing the peace so I actually 'snoop' on her to catch her in the act, documenting each time she was doing inappropriate browsing, which is the height of hypocrisy given what she accuses other people of doing. **I don't do this to anyone else, hence the 'double-standards'.**

When HR contacts me later for more details, I happily give them what I documented on Karen and tell them of her inappropriate use of workplace resources. I tell them I haven't documented anyone else doing anything inappropriate (partially true). **This is the 'trying to get her fired' part.** Everyone hates her and it's making it very hard for her to do her job so now she's basically dead weight.",464,1968,0.96
1254,Not the A-hole,"I work in an office with only 8 other employees and my boss. there is a huge cafeteria in the center of the building which has microwavable meals and various types of soda, everyone sits in the cafeteria during our Hour and 15 Minute lunch break, except me. and while they're in there they will generally play cards, eat lunch and just talk.

I sit alone at my desk, watch netflix, eat my lunch that I prepare at home every night and generally just chill out and relax, and sometimes take a nap in my chair.

&#x200B;

one coworker (we'll call her Annie) has always complained about this in a joking manner, such as saying ""here he is alone again"" before giggling, or stuff such as ""nice of you to join us stranger"" whenever I'd enter the cafeteria to grab a drink or go to my storage unit, and when I'd walk out again afterwards I'd get a ""come visit again soon loner""

&#x200B;

well Today I learned that she has reported me to HR (which is just 1 person called Alex to be fair) and told them that me being unsocial is not a nice atmosphere and that I'm actually going against ""the corporate family feel"" by intentionally distancing myself, Alex told me this and we laughed it off as we've always known she was a bit nutty. However my Boss has agreed with Annie and he came over to my desk to have a talk and said that ""It would really be better if you sat with us and got involved, I don't think its appropriate to sit alone it comes across as hostile, you're going to come sit with us tomorrow""

1256,Asshole,"Throwaway account, wife knows my main and I'm sure reading this would just piss her off more.

Last Saturday my wife's work had some event on. My wife asked me a few days before if I'd come and I told her no way, I hate her co-workers and I've been to one of these events before, they're dull as hell. She begged me to come, wouldn't stop asking, told me she really needed me there. Eventually I gave in as long as she promised we could leave at 10pm. (Started at 7)

Well Saturday comes and it's every bit as boring as I knew it would be. I mostly stick to the buffet and get my fill of free food as try to avoid annoying co-workers. Finally 10pm rolls around and I go find my wife, she's gossipping away to some woman, I listen for a few minutes then politely ask her for a word. We step away from the other woman and I tell her it's 10, time to go. She says just give me 20 more minutes, I'm having an important conversation with my supervisor. I call bullshit, tell get I was listening and it was just gossip. She says just 20 minutes she needs a good relationship with this woman. I tell her she has til the cab arrives then she can make her own way home. 

She comes out just under 10 minutes later, just before the cab gets there, some guy asks where she's going and she makes up an excuse about the babysitter.

We argue on the ride home and she says I ruined her evening, embarrassed her and forced her to lie to save face, I remind her I didn't want to go in the first place but I was still on my best behaviour, I just wanted to leave when she promised we would. 

When we get home she tells me she's sleeping on the couch tonight. I told her unless she wants to sleep next to me watching TV for an hour or 2 no she's not. She says fine then you stay here. Nope, it's my bed too and I'll sleep in it if I want to. So she grabs a bag and says she's heading to her mother's (where the kids are). I say cool see you tomorrow then. She tells me no I won't unless I'm ready to apologize and slams the door.

I really don't think I'm the one who needs to apologize here
1) her reactions were way outta line: dictating where I sleep, slamming doors, leaving the house
2) she nagged me into going to something I hated then broke her promise about leaving
I don't see how I'm in the wrong?
She came home the next day but has been frosty with me all week and keeps saying I need to apologize. I'm getting sick of it and think she should apologize now honestly.

So aita? Did I ruin her night? Or is she ta for her reaction?

Edit: damn autocorrect and not being able to edit the title

UPDATE: Alright y'all looks like the general consensus is ita, I'd just like to shout out to all those who noted that my wife wasn't an angel in the scenario either, even if you did get down voted to hell, there were enough of you that I decided to stand my ground on a few things.

So I talked to my wife, I told her I was sorry for escalating the argument and not just sleeping on the couch and making her feel like she needed to leave, that was uncool, I was pissed about the evening and let things get out of hand. 

However I'm standing firm that she shouldn't have pushed me on going to this, she knows how much I hate these things and that if I say I'm not comfortable doing something it's not ok for her to wear me down into going through constant pressure and guilt tripping. I never push her on things she's not comfortable with and I think I deserve the same in return.

Honestly I think I was never going to have a good time and it was doomed to end in an argument not just because I hate these things and didn't want to go but because I felt forced and that she didn't care how going made me feel.

She accepted my apology and also agreed that in future if I keep saying no she won't keep trying to force the answer she wants. 

So thanks I guess Reddit. Peace out ✌️",606,1241,0.86

She has a very slim frame and I figured someone else is better suited for this task. I didn't want any chances for accidental Hazmat spillage, and I dont want the other 3 people to pick up the slack.

She got pissed off and said I dont treat her fairly compared to the males, and said I didn't think she was fit for the task just because she was female.

Well that IS true in some sense, but I do think its justified because men ARE physically stronger than women. And they are better suited for this specific task.

This kid (14 M now) I used to teach occasionally (likely had some form of learning disability) got my phone number from the other staff constantly pressuring me to give it to him and me not wanting to lose face.

I've made it clear I don't want any more texts/calls from him (sometimes he calls me 4 times in a row on a single day). I had his first phone number blocked but the calls still showed up on my call log, just as auto-rejected so I know he keeps calling me. Once he got a new phone he called me again, and I hung up as soon as I knew it was him. I blocked that number as well and told him not to text/call me again, but he still hasn't gotten the message (no pun intended).

None of these messages are threatening, so a restraining/no contact order seems excessive, especially against a 14 year old (messages are along the lines of those from an obsessed ex who wants to get back in your life). However, he doesn't seem to get the point and I know he has been repeatedly told by myself and the other staff to stop calling people excessively.

I’ve met her friend a few times but since she lives on the west coast, I haven’t really gotten to know her all that well.

School is something I’ve always taken very seriously and I am very much looking forward to getting my degree. I thought long and hard, and I told my girlfriend that I didn’t think I’d be able to go, since I’ll need to prepare for the week and I could very well have a final the day after the wedding.

1271,Asshole,"My friend just got engaged, so my boyfriend and I have been discussing weddings and engagements and rings and stuff. We have been together for three years, but do not plan on getting married any time soon. In fact, I don't even care about getting married, I don't think it makes any difference to the relationship and I think it's a pretty pointless and expensive thing to just sign a piece of paper which legally binds us.

I think that would look bad and would make me feel weird that it wasn't symmetrical. I don't care that he has more friends, or that he would have more people, I just don't want it to be asymmetrical.

1273,Not the A-hole,"Me(32M) Husband(32M) SIL(38F) and her husband (40m) Twins (~8M) Daughter (~6f) 

 background, my husband and I always said we never wanted children, we've been together for a long time and have both always been very sure about that.

We both, though me more then him, find children to be very annoying to deal with and make efforts to avoid them as much as possible, a few years ago a friend asked me to be a godparent to their child and I declined.

I keep minimal interactions with my friends kids, didn't hold them as babies, or avoided it as much as possible, we have always lived far away from my SIL, so we were there for baptism and maybe a few times a year

My SIL's kids are all very badly behaved, one is diagnosed on the spectrum and the other 2 probably are also in there, the one with higher needs is pretty high function, a few years less developed as far as school goes and they to their best but he often acts up a lot and all 3 are very difficult to control. 

They have all had delayed development with some skills (that's from professionals not me being mean). In short for someone that dislikes children these 3 are a nightmare and if I would describe the type of kids that put me off having kids myself I would be describing these 3 before they were even born.

My husband has bonded with them and loves them, but I have not. 

As an example of bad behavior ;every Christmas they break each other's and their own toys, there's usually at least one thing gone before we even call them, there is general destructive behavior and constantly ignoring quite fair things from their parents and not responding to authority. my friends with children all have much better behaved kids from much younger.

I'm just picking a few examples but I just personally can't deal with these 3, I can deal with my friend's kids for a bit because they are better behaved.


SIL has a degenerative disease, prognosis was originally not good when this occurred. 

She was writing their Will up a few years ago and asked my husband about us being named to take their kids if anything happened, there is other family but at the time they weren't talking.

Husband asked me, he wanted to say yes but I said no. I argued that we didn't want children and that while yes, they were family the change in our lifestyle would be too great for me to deal with and I would just end up resenting them. He told her no (as far as I know)

My main argument is that it's better for those kids to go to someone who might love them, even if it meant into the care system, than someone who would be guaranteed to hate them.



Also I have my own brother, who's gf and him have decided they don't want kids, but if they did, I would say the same to them.

We had a whirlwind romance until I told my mother, expecting her to be happy for me because it was my first relationship where I felt more than just fondness towards my partner. However, my parents are a little on the conservative side and as soon as my mom learned about the age difference and his various tattoos, she was livid.



My parents gave me an ultimatum: either leave Joe or they would kick me out and stop paying for my education. I nearly chose the latter until Joe told me that my education was more important. He said we could always get together after I'd had my degree and despite hating it, I agreed with him. We broke up but kept in touch over the next year. He graduated and moved to a city a few hours away where my sister Allie was at school. I got my degree and moved to a city nearby, earning my first taste of freedom.


Almost two years after our breakup, my sister Allie told me she'd been seeing someone for seven months and sent me a picture of her with him. It was Joe. I could not believe my eyes. I texted him, asking if it were true and got no reply. I called my mother, who told me that it wasn't a big deal and that they're letting Allie have her ""rebellious phase,"" which is something I was never allowed to have but I digress. I threw myself into work, managing to avoid my family during every holiday and thinking maybe this would help me forget. I found out they got engaged through our mother and later received a wedding invitation, I RSVP'd yes.


Now, the wedding is less than a month away and I am clearly not over him. I tear up at the thought of watching him say ""I do"" to my younger sister. I don't think I can attend their wedding and I'm thinking about using work as an excuse again. My best friend says I'm being an asshole and I have to grin and bear it while other friends are saying that I should prioritize my health. I'm not sure what the right answer is and I thought I ought to ask an unbiased audience.



**UPDATE:** I called Allie earlier and to say I'm an idiot is an understatement. She knew who Joe was before they'd even been formally introduced. Our mom told her about him when we were still dating. She said that she never brought it up because it never seemed important to her and that since he ""chose"" her, there was nothing to talk about. 


She still expects me to attend her wedding because we're family. I know this is terrible but I didn't tell her I'm not over him. I suspect she would just laugh.

I am just tired of people being passive aggressive towards me. Am I just wasting my time and I being a jerk if i choose to be vocal indiscriminately?",17,49,0.91
1277,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the long title, I wasn’t sure how else to word it.

I am a 19 y/o female and am blessed to be living with my parents rent free while going to a college close to home for a computer science degree. I have two younger brothers who are in high school, and I work a part time job at a grocery store.

Right after I graduated high school my family talked me out of going away to college to save money and agreed to buy a new car for my siblings and I to use while we go to college and I agreed simply because I had no money and it seemed like a good idea at the time. I should mention that my parents and I have a strained relationship because I am openly bisexual which is something they do not agree with.

I am very grateful for the fact that they bought my brothers and I a new car (only two of us have  a license) to use but every time my parents get upset with me or my siblings they take the keys away and claim that ‘it’s still our car, so our rules.’. Which is somewhat frustrating. It’s also difficult to manage who gets the car when with my brother since we both work jobs. 

Fast forward to now, I just finished up my first year at college and am on summer break, so I’ve been working my ass off at my job. My parents have questioned why I’m working so hard but I haven’t told them anything until two days ago. I sat them down and told them I had finally saved up enough money for my own used car. 

My parents flipped their shit, calling me ungrateful and a horrible child for trying to buy a car when they “worked their asses off to purchase us a vehicle for college.” 

I never asked for this car, they insisted on me staying home for college and using that car because they don’t trust used cars and wanted me driving something new.

I feel guilty for trying to buy a new car when I have one at home, but it’s not even mine and is taken away at any time they see fit. I didn’t buy the used car but my parents are still upset with me and have taken the car they bought away. AITA here ??",32,49,0.9
1278,Not the A-hole,"**UPDATED 7:50 PM:** Holy crap! Thank you for the outpour of support, everyone. I never thought posting this in an online community was going to reach the right eyes so quickly! I had written this on my lunch break and was completely blown away and brought to tears when I checked back in after work. Several people reached out with helpful resources, including a litigator on Reddit who put me in contact with a colleague who practices in my state. Apparently there is precedent and people have won against the state although it did take several years.

&#x200B;

My intent was to answer more questions since I wasn't able to do that while at work. I was also going to post the website as that has been a popular request, however I've been told not to continue further discussions beyond what I have already posted if I wish to pursue a civil suit.

&#x200B;

Just a couple things I want to address in my update here. Some people are saying I'm leaving out details. My original post was much longer but there's a 3000 character limit imposed. I had to delete a lot of things from my initial draft so I apologize if it looks like details have been left out. I did try to make sure everything that was relevant was kept. Lastly, my son is now back with me. There was a lot of paperwork and even a court hearing, but we're together now and that's what counts.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if I didn't respond to your comment or private message. I'm still going through my unread messages and still have quite a lot left to read. Truly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, words of encouragement, and advice that you sent my way. I can't even begin to put into words how grateful I am. Again, thank you so much to all the kind strangers who went out of their way to help.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

1279,Asshole,"I was in prospect park, in brooklyn, and I was walking our dog near my sister in laws house. I sat on a bench, and I noticed a large group of young people sitting down the road in the grass, maybe 15-20 of them, ages 17-21, drinking beer and they were playing music. This was right in public, right near the road. I am well aware that drinking in public is illegal, and in general its just not a good thing to do, having drunk kids in public at only 5pm. Then,  I smelled weed, and I saw that they were the source of it. I also saw them smoke cigarettes which I believe is illegal in the park. If this were my own neighborhood I would have called the cops right away, their parents would not want them in that kind of situation. But I hesitated until I saw a group of older people in their 60s walk by with their teen son and I just felt I had to call the cops after that. It was such a bad sight to see, especially if you're a young person walking by that cloud of smoke and teens drinking beer. Also they were playing music in public! Who wants to hear that. So I just called the police and told them what was happening, and I got up and left. 

&#x200B;

My husband has been freaking out at me over this, saying that its a bad thing to just call the cops on young people like that unless they are actively endangering others. He said that people don't do that in new york (hes from nyc, we are visiting for the week). I feel bad to an extent, but I also still feel what I did is justified. They were causing a nuisance in the neighborhood, in a nice park of all places, and more importantly they were breaking multiple laws! I mean, my husband is upset at me for reporting people breaking laws? I can tell my sister in law was also upset with me, but she wouldn't say it.",263,360,0.82

1281,Not the A-hole,"Hi there (22f). I live in a condo in Virginia Beach walking distance to A LOT of bars and restaurants. I would say it’s predominantly renters that are all pretty young. I happen to own mine so I plan on living here for awhile.

Recently a single woman maybe in her 40s moved directly below me. She’s the only unit I share a wall (the floor) with and I also have hardwood floors for reference. Alright so some background about me, I work full time Monday through Friday 9-5. And I work my ass off, so on the weekends I like to go out to EDM shows in my area. I usually go to these shows between 10pm to 11 pm on the weekend and have a few friends over before hand, but an absolute max of 8 people including myself. I have one Bluetooth speaker for music and it’s literally like maybe 8 inches long so it’s really not too loud. Like I said, we’re all on the way to the show by 10:30 pm usually and only on weekends. 

On multiple occasions she’s banged a broom on my floor/her ceiling in protest of the noise. She’s also come to my front door to complain before at around 10pm on a Friday. I just apologized and we left shortly after on both occasions. 

WELL fast forward to a month ago. At 7:30pm on a weeknight I was playing music at like 60% volume while cleaning my house. I start to hear banging and think okay maybe she’s hanging up shelves or something but no, she’s bitching about the noise and banging as hard as she can. It takes me awhile to realize what’s happening so the music is still on and she starts screaming “ SHUT THE FUCK UP BITCH” at me... at this point Im thinking this is ridiculous? I’ll turn it down but not off. She then walks into our shared hallway and starts repeatedly SLAMMING her front door over and over as loud as possible again in protest. Then she walks into the hallway and pretends to call the police. I hear her loudly say “hello I would like to report a disturbance at (my address) and possible domestic violence...” I’m also home alone. This pissed me off a lot because I worked very hard to be able to purchase this condo and I want to enjoy it and believe I’ve been doing so respectfully. By the way this lady has a dog which isn’t allowed by the condo association at all. The next day I left a note on her door with a bag of ear plugs taped to it that said if she ever has an outburst like that again I’m telling the condo association about her dog. I would never actually do that btw I just wanted her to leave me alone. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: this happened a month or so ago and I haven’t heard a word from her since",208,680,0.94
1282,Not the A-hole,"My friend loaned me his car to get groceries during the school year. While on this trip, I crashed his car and caused about $4,000 in damages. Unfortunately, because we are college students his parents refused to put it through insurance because it would cause their insurance price to spike past what they could afford. This left me with the responsibility of paying for the damages.

&#x200B;

Finding an internship for my career path (venture capital) is very difficult. I finally got an internship at the end of the school year, but the position is unpaid. This position will give me the opportunity to grow my network and succeed in venture down the road, but I have to sacrifice a wage for this summer. I work on the weekends and after work to try to make money to pay him back, but it will not be enough to get there within the year. He texted me the other day asking for the money and I sent him a fraction of it. He then proceeded to tell me that I should have never taken my internship but rather a paid job so I could pay him back.

&#x200B;

EDIT bc people want more information: On the day the car crashed it was snowing and it skidded down a hill as we go to school in upstate New York. There was nothing I could do to avoid the accident. On the part time job front, I work a second job every night after work and on the weekends.

&#x200B;

AITA for taking an unpaid internship?

TL;DR I owe my friend money for his crashed car and I took an unpaid internship so I could succeed in the future rather than a job that would allow me to pay him back in time.",68,41,0.89
1283,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway and details changed because I don't want people who witnessed this finding my account. 

So this happened about a month ago, but I've been wondering about it and want to hear what you guys think. For context, I have experience as a teacher and have worked in special education. (I have no degrees associated with it, so I'm not an expert.) I also had a serious learning disability as a child that initially made people think I was a nonverbal child with autism, but luckily for me, the learning disability was not as serious as that and some very skilled teachers were able to teach me how to cope with it. At this point in my life, most people never notice I have a learning disability unless I tell them. 

So, to the incident. I work as a host for birthday parties in an educational child-oriented space. Think a Chuck-E Cheese or an educational arcade. I had a party who signed up for our treasure hunt package, which basically means we rope off a few areas of the building from the public for about ten minutes so kids can hunt for things. I was watching these kids hunting for treasure when I saw that a kid who I didn't remember from the party go in and join them. These kids who were hunting were about six to nine, but the kid who joined them looked like he was twelve. I was told he didn't belong in the party, so when the kids moved on to the next area to hunt, I told him politely that the space was closed only to the birthday party. 

The kid clearly had some kind of learning or developmental disability. He wasn't able to articulate a verbal response to me, but he clearly understood what I was saying, as he didn't try to force his way in and instead lingered outside of the space, watching the party from afar. As soon as the kids left, he sneaked into the crowd and followed them back to the party room, where my colleague radioed for help because she tried to get him to leave and he brushed her off. I marched to the party room, found him in the crowd, and I used my 'teacher voice' (which I admit can be very fierce) to say, ""You know what 'no' means. You've been told three times that you can't be here. You need to leave now."" The kid hurried to do as he was told, and another colleague (not the one who radioed) tried to tell me that I should remember he is disabled, and I told her, ""He's used to people cutting him a lot of slack just like I was. He was taking advantage of it, just like I used to. He knows what 'no' means."" 

My colleague didn't make a fuss about it after that and the party went smoothly without any further incident, but I'm still wondering, was ITA?

EDITED TO ADD: I honestly do not know where the kid's parents were. The spaces we were moving between were two floors apart, and he was lingering for about fifteen to twenty minutes all told. I was told that he was a regular to the space, so maybe his parents were comfortable leaving him unsupervised there for an extended period of time.",46,67,0.92

1285,Asshole,"I was addicted from when I was 20-24. I’m now 26 and my sister is just now welcoming me back into her home. 

Early into my addiction, back when I was somewhat still hiding it, I would still go over to my older sister’s house every now and again. 

Back then, I would hide drugs in her house as a “safe place” for me to keep them. I hid some in the garage. I did most of this when I was high, which explains the somewhat shitty hiding spots. 

I went over to her house the for the first time in a while this past weekend for my nephew’s birthday. When I pulled in I didn’t even think, I just went over and grabbed the syringe and dope I had stashed behind one of the tables. 

Except right at that moment my sister walked into the garage and saw me grab the stuff from behind the table. She accused me of using again and started crying and screaming about how dare I hide that shit in her house and what if Sam, my nephew, had found it. 

I tried to explain to her that it was old and I didn’t want to worry her by telling her that it was still in the house and I promised that I was going to get rid of it. 

She just screamed at me to get out of her house. 

I really was planning on just getting rid of it. I didn’t want to upset her and I thought it would’ve been pointless to tell her about it. 

I know have my family texting me telling me how disappointed they are in me and I’m pretty sure I can expect an intervention soon. 

I don’t think I was entirely out of line. My sister wouldn’t even listen to me and if she hadn’t walked out none of this would’ve happened.

1290,Asshole,"I feel as if the title points me as the asshole but here me out.

I am a father (44) of three children, two boys and one girl. the eldest is 19 and the one I am talking about in this post. 

About two years ago I noticed a few hickeys on my daughters neck and confronted her about it and she confessed that she had been seeing a girl for about 7 months behind my wife and I’s back and said she was a lesbian. We were shocked to say the least and punished her (no phone/car and made her cut contact with this girl) for lying and told her while we loved her we didn’t condone this lifestyle she was planning for herself. 

It was rough and we eventually got through it, but there’s still a part of me that doesn’t completely trust her. 

Fast forward to now. My daughter stays at home and goes to community college in a car we bought for her. Things are good. However last night I was walking by my daughters room and saw her lying in her bed with a girl I did not know. I immediately swung the door open and she freaks out and the girl immediately leaves out the house. 

I sit my daughter down and explain that any girl she brings home has to be within my sight because I am unsure of who she is dating and don’t condone sex in my house or with women. My daughter begins to cry and says I’m being unfair and non accepting. I tell her that it is the same for her siblings and that if my sons brought a girl home the same rules would apply. 

I do not condone same sex relationships/sex and told my daughter she’s free to do as she pleases once she moves out, but while she is here and using a car I paid for, it’s my house and my rules. My wife feels the same way. 

My daughter and my sister think I’m being unfair since not every girl she brings home is in a relationship with her but I am honestly unsure, especially since she lied about a whole relationship to us. My daughter refuses to speak to me and goes out for long periods of time now and I’m assuming it’s to see the girl that was in her room.  AITA here ??






UPDATE: I kept this up even with the death threats and name calling because I wanted to see a wide perspective. I did not expect this to get so out of hand. Regardless of what you all say, I do love my daughter and that will never change. I have been raised to think of gays as wrong and sinful since I can remember and that simply is my opinion. Thank you to the people who actually answered my original question instead of calling me a homophobe. 

I am new to Reddit and didn’t realize it was so liberal, I will not make that mistake again when posting other things. If my daughter were to bring a woman home as her fiancé i would support her even if I don’t necessarily agree with it. I firmly believe that I can still be a part of my daughters life and not agree with everything she does. 
 
Today I sat my daughter down and apologized for my comment and we came to an agreement on bringing girls to her room as long as the door
Is open. We hugged it out and she is now upstairs with a girl from her class. Thank you.",1261,1243,0.77
1291,Asshole,"Using a throwaway since money is involved here. Basically my mom passed away in May after a long, long illness (we miss her but she’s not suffering anymore). My mom was at best a difficult person to get along with but I did the best at getting along with her as such I’m the executor or her estate. Mom was married 4 times and managed to essentially hoard these men’s money and died with a net worth of about 3 millions dollars after all the medical stuff will be settled. It’s supposed to be divided between me, my brother and his kids and my step sister. At least according to my moms will. 

Edit: I have two half siblings who spent a lot time with my mom when sick who were specifically excluded from my moms estate. 

I can’t stand my step sister, she was a horrible bully growing up, she was mean to my mom and was just a “prissy judgmental brat.” But my mom loved her (step sister’s dad was my moms true love husband) and would often talk about being reunited and referred to my step sisters kids as her “favorite grandkids” even though they’d never met (much to the chagrin of my brother and his wife). However my step sister did not even call or much less visit when my mom was sick and we are pretty sure she knew. My mom always held out hope that she’d get to see step sister one more time but it never happened. 

Well it’s time to execute the will. It stipulates that I have to put I a “good faith” effort to find my step sister and give her her share. And that if she can’t be located in a year, her share is to be split between my brother and I. But after explaining the situation, the estate lawyer says that “good faith” is up to wide interpretation. I looked up my sister on Facebook and didn’t find her and basically he said if I do that once a month or so for the next year, I’ve done my part. 

The issue I’m seeing is this is life changing money for my sister (just under $1mil) and she is supposed to get it according to my moms will. However her share means I can buy up an entire condo complex and essentially be an absentee Airbnb landlord and just have that as my job. My sister also made no effort to track down my mom or visit when she was sick. I’m also going with lawyers advice here...but am I an asshole?",259,227,0.89

Although ultimately he said he was going to take responsibility for the camera, I am getting different viewpoints on how this situation should be handled.  Any insight will be appreciated.

Friend swears he took it to the gate where it must have gotten swiped. My other friend watched our bags while we went to get a coffee and says he was watching our bags like a hawk. That friend and I think he left it at TSA when he got pulled aside

I feel bad for putting my friend in this situation but if the tables were turned I know I would accept responsibility for the camera and pay for it since it was under my care ate the moment

Update: 
First of all I want to clarify that I never forced my friend to pay for it. He volunteered.  Ultimately it was my fault for putting him in that situation and his fault for losing it.  We have decided to split the cost for the replacement 50/50

I have run into some problems where my mother feels I have to do certain things in order for her to be happy.

For background I chose my close friends daughters as my flower girls, they were very excited. They maintain a close relationship with me even when my work schedule intervenes, and I am very close with his daughters.
My mother on hearing this insisted I invite my cousins daughters to be flower girls as well, telling me it would hurt my cousins and her daughters feelings, as well as deeply upset my mother. My mother spent days crying and insisting I don't care about my family at all. Sadly I see my cousin and her daughters only a couple of times a year despite an effort to keep in touch. I have little relations with my cousins or her daughters at best. My mother insisted and ultimately I Felt guilty and gave in and asked them.

This 2nd cousin has also never been a part of my family life and I have met only a couple of times. My mother has told me she's so upset that I should just remove all her friends because I ""Don't care about her anyway""

Because we are having a small wedding our seating capacity is limited and myself and my fiance feel those 2 spots would be better utilized by people whom we care about and want to attend.

1300,No A-holes here,"I'll start off by saying that I don't think that there is anything inherantly wrong with Gospel music or religious practice in the workplace, although I, myself, have zero interest in either and actually find Gospel music in general to be the single worst genre of music ever conceived. That being said, I'm pretty open minded. I try to have that attitude that most of the time, people enjoy or like certain things more than I dislike those said things, so they should be able to engage with those specific things because their enjoyment of it trumps my dislike. 
So here's my dilemma. I work with a super religious guy who tries to invite me and other colleagues to religious functions, which we all politely decline. That's fine. He has a habit of listening to very strange Gospel music (Sometimes in his native language. He is from the Phillepenes. Not that any of that is really all that important but more of a side note) at theater volume in our shop, all day long, 12 hours a day. At first it wasn't so bad because I figured ""Fuck it, the dude likes Gospel more than I hate it so he should be able to listen to it"". After about 7 months of the same 5 songs everyday (another small note, he just listens to the SAME 5 songs everyday, multiple times a day) it is starting to destroy me mentally and to be perfectly honest I have no single idea how to approach this because he is literally the nicest guy ever, and I would hate to hurt his feelings or something by saying something. It's something I have admitted to myself I have no clue how to deal with. Am I letting my own dislike and disgust for this type of music overshadow something that isn't a big deal? AITA here?

1304,Not the A-hole,"Please read before commenting there's quite a bit to unpack here.

Years ago, in my late 20s, I decided I wanted to have a kid. Problem is my relationships never lasted long for a variety of reasons. I had honestly given up on the traditional ""nuclear family"" dream and decided to try co-parenting with a like-minded single woman. 

So I did just that, and eventually got in touch with a woman called Jessica (name changed) after finding each other online. We set out some ground rules about how we would co-parent, met a few times in person, etc and eventually decided to go ahead with it. After two attempts of using a home donor-kit we were successful and she was pregnant.

At this point I'm over the moon and already planning the future in my mind. About a month in she called me and told me she'd had a miscarriage. Made me feel like absolute shit, because in my mind I'd already bonded with my would-be child, but I moved on with my life. Never spoke with Jessica again after that call. I knew her family would be comforting her, and even though I wanted to try again eventually, I thought it would be deeply inappropriate to ask her. So I decided to let her reach out to me if she wished. She didn't.

About a year later I try again, this time with a pleasant lesbian couple that also agreed with me as far as co-parenting and so on. We had twin boys and they're the light of my life - just turned 8 years old. 

So I hadn't spoken too Jessica for roughly 10 years at this point until I run into her at the supermarket with a young girl that's presumably her daughter. I immediately recognize she looks a bit older than my twin boys and alarm bells start going off in my head. Jessica didn't have a daughter when I knew her so, if she is older than my boys, she's probably mine.

I calmly confronted her when the girl was out of earshot and she admits she's my daughter. She didn't want to co-parent and lied about having a miscarriage, she wanted to be a single mother, etc. She starts begging me not to say anything to her daughter and I agree, provided she adds me on facebook (then and there) so I could at least see pictures of my daughter.

Well, that's what I said anyway, I actually wanted to have her add me on Facebook so I had her current contact details and she couldn't ghost me.

So with all that unpacked, WIBTA if I tried to reach out to my daughter against her mother's wishes? The reason I think I might be the asshole is it would probably be very disruptive to her family life. Maybe it's better for my daughter that I just stay out?

I only saw her for a few brief moments, but she seems so sweet. Genuinely breaks my heart not being there to watch her grow up.",502,2364,0.97
1305,Not the A-hole,"So my daughters 6 months old, she has this toy thats her favourite. She sleeps with it, holds it constantly, plays with it and it goes everywhere with her. If she’s screaming and crying, the moment she gets that toy she stops. Every time she is with someone else i always say do not loose that toy, i say it every time even if I’ve told them before. This toy is a homemade knitted bear/comforter made by a family friend who passed away 2 months after my daughter was born and cannot be replaced by a replica. 

Well, she stayed at my in laws a few days ago and when she came back the next morning she had a different toy, in replace of her favourite toy. It looked nothing like her old toy, it was just a store bought teddy bear with a pink body warmer on it. She wasn’t interested in this new toy, she wanted her old one. I didn’t realise it was missing until after they left and my daughter started to cry so i rang and asked where it was and my MIL told me that they got her a toy like the old one but better so she can play with that instead. I asked her who gave her permission to throw out my daughters favourite toy and just replace it with one shes not even interested in, she said i was being disrespectful and rude and i told her the only one being rude is her and its quite cheeky to do that because she knows how much my daughter loves that toy. I told her to bring it back and she said they threw it out, my exact words were “well i suggest you get digging through the bin because you had no right to do that and now *daughters name* is crying for it”. She hung up on me and later that day, dropped the toy of and left without saying a word. 

I told my husband when he got home from work and he said he agrees with me but i shouldn’t of made her dig through the bin as its unsanitary, i said i wasn’t bothered how unsanitary it was for her but obviously i washed it before i gave it back to my daughter.

1306,Not the A-hole,"My (f24) boyfriend(m29), let’s call him Trey, is upset that he isn’t invited to hangout with my friend and I on our weekly regular “girls night”. It’s just her and I and sometimes one or two other girls. Their boyfriends/husbands don’t come. We are usually out from 6-10pm on Wednesday or Thursday depending on work. It’s our time once a week to spend time together because we see each other any other time. 
Trey says he feels like he’s not included/being left out and makes passive aggressive comments about it all the time. In the past, (we’ve been together for 2.5 years) he’s taken the same issue with this when a different group of girls and I had our semi regular weekly girls night. 

I feel like I should say, friend time is important to me. I make time for my friends regardless of if I have a boyfriend or not. 

What triggered the argument this morning was about a birthday party Friday night. It’s basically a girls night but with more of us. We didn’t go this Wednesday because we are hanging out Friday for her birthday. No boyfriends/husbands are coming to my knowledge. She didn’t extend the invitation to any of them via the Facebook message. Some even mentioned getting their husbands to watch the kids. When I remind him about it, Trey says, “I guess I’m not invited?” To which I awkwardly say, “I can ask... but from what I understand it’s just girls that are going.” He gets more and more upset and says, “I don’t know if Friend has a problem with me or something but I’m never invited. You’re always invited to hangout with me and my friends. Even if I don’t really want you to come. ” And leaves for work before I could say anything.

About 5 and a half months ago I lent someone £1000 cash, so he could get his car fixed and through the MOT. Clutch, flywheel and windscreen. He was really in a sticky place and was gushing with gratitude.

I had the following conditions, that he agreed to before taking the money.

&#x200B;

1. Cash out= cash in.
2. No interest or fees.
3. No repayment for 6 months.
4. He was to make a reasonable repayment proposal within 2 months, what he could afford.

&#x200B;

Less than a month later he is winding up the small catering business he has and secured employment as head chef at a local 200 room hotel.

He proposed me taking some of the catering equipment in part-payment of the debt. 

I agreed in principle but stipulated that he needed to propose a value for the items, that we would discuss/negotiate very soon. He agreed to this and I helped him deliver the equipment to my workshop. 

For the next 4 months or so he has evaded every attempt I have made to sit down and discuss some figures. He has agreed repeatedly that it needs to happen but can never be pinned down.

Ten days ago, after I had told him a number of times that he was not respecting our agreement, I contacted him and said I was no longer willing to abide by taking equipment in lieu, because of his refusal to discuss the matter. I told him he needed to make arrangements, collect his stuff and sort out paying me in cash.

Yesterday he finally came and collected his stuff, but is now being evasive and argumentative. He is selling the stuff bit by bit, but refuses to say when he will pay me, or even bring me any money, saying he will only do bank transfer. He tells me I am just being awkward.

I have lost what respect I had for him, I’m not really bothered about the end of this “friendship” as it was evidently a poor excuse of one.

I will not give him my bank details because frankly I don’t trust him. He knows quite a bit about me, I am wary of fraud.

AITA for wanting him to pay me back as we originally agreed?

Last weekend, my mom asked if I would take her to her favorite cheese store for her birthday (I know how weird it sounds) - it’s about a 1.5hr drive out of state, but she likes to go early, so we’re normally home by around noon. 

My gf has worked for this non-profit for a few years. Every summer, they have a large community outreach event and she asks me to volunteer my time to help their staff set up/tear down, run activities, etc. 

A few months ago, she asks me if I would volunteer again. They don’t have a date set in stone yet, but I agree. Last night, she tells me the date of the event.

I explain to my gf that I’m still willing to help them at least tear down and run activities and may be late, but will not be able to help them set up. 

She’s not having it. She asks if I can take my mom to the store the day after her birthday so I can be available for the event because I “took her out of state last year for her birthday!” I apologize and again tell her I will not abandon my mom on her birthday.

1310,Not the A-hole,"Earlier this week I went over to see my parents and my grandma was there. She turned 90 this year and at first I was happy to see her and catch up. 

Unfortunately, like many people of her generation, she I known to have some very racist views, often repeating the same horrible things over and over and saying them unprovoked. Normally, out of respect for all that she has done for me over the years and to avoid any awkwardness, I’m able to hold my tongue and let her say what she wants to say without reacting. 

However, this time I had enough, and I snapped at her, telling her what she was saying was racist and that I had not come home from a long day at work to have a race debate and I stormed out of the room before I said more. I came back in a few minutes later and, rather than read the situation, she carried on. I just kept quiet at this point but I was fuming.

After my grandma left, my mum said I was out of line because my grandma (who is her mother-in-law) is from a different generation and she is set in her way with her views, that I should remember that she loves me and she doesn’t understand what she is saying is wrong, and that my overreaction have offended her.

My outburst came from many years of hearing her say these things (I’m 28yo). Deep down I do love her, which makes it even harder to work out how I should react. This is the only time I have ever snapped like this and I intend to avoid doing it in future.

What might be an important thing to note in this is that I am gay, but I have not come out to the wider family because of things older family members say, which probably built up some tension. I am constantly policing myself when around them, even to the extent to what I’m able to post on social media, which used to be more of a private space for me (I’ve tried blocking them, but they notice straight away).

Thank you in advance for your judgements.

P.s. ~~I won’t post what my grandma said here to avoid offending anyone but if people feel it’s important to make a ruling, I’ll edit the post to put them at the bottom with a trigger warning.~~ 

As some people have asked what was said, a brief summary below. 

I should clarify I don’t agree with any of this. also, trigger warning for those who may be offended by racist sentiments.

1) She started off talking about Serena Williams (context, I went to Wimbledon last week) and how it was unfair she was playing in the women’s draw because she was so big.
2) She then went on to praise that she had her hair in a bun that day rather than having all her “Afro hair” flying about all the time
3) She moved on to a BBC drama on at the moment, and she was getting annoyed that there always needs to be a “token black man” in the show, taking jobs away from white actors, and that it was unrealistic to have a black person there all the time. She’s said this about a number of shows over the last year. I countered that to have no black characters in a show set in London would actually be weirder due to the large black population there.
4) She then mentioned a time she went to see a show where a black actress was playing the lead, and it ruined her enjoyment of the show because a black woman would not have had such a role in “those days”
5) What brought me to the edge is when she heavily implied that the world was better in those days because black people couldnt be in those positions aka it was better when black people were slaves / second-class citizens 
6) And finally she began to criticise Meghan Markle who she, of course, hates. She does not agree that a “half-chat” should be allowed to marry a member of the royal family because it wouldn’t have been accepted back in her day, and it’s not tradition, and, in the latest chapter of Meghan can do no right, that it is an outrage she did not let her babies christening be photographed by the press (aka Hello magazine). Ofc, Kate does everything perfectly.

1311,No A-holes here,"  During a conversation with my friends they started talking about having kids, they have been married for a while now and they believe it should be their next step. I knew what was coming because they had asked our other friends the same thing before coming to me. Their question was that if I believed they would be good parents because they had a feeling about it and they were confident that this was the right moment.

The possible asshole moment happened when I told them that I don't think they would. I said this because they have an unhealthy relationship with money and I believe kids require some sort of stability. They have terrible spending habits and I know that touching on the subject of finances isn’t very tasteful, but it’s kinda hard when it’s very public knowledge at this point. They have a lot of debt because they tend to live way above their own means and they have a history of taking out loans with some sketchy people frequently. The most notable thing is that they have been kicked out of 4 places by now because they failed to pay rent and it’s always because they want to go on some trip and not paying rent is what they consider cutting costs.

They obviously did not like that but I stood by my opinion. This has reached our other friends and while they agree on what I said, they still thought I could have worded it better because they could still learn something and change in the future.",112,855,0.97

My son has been dating 'Vanessa' for nearly 3 years now, last weekend they annouced they were enagaged. I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.

I also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.

My son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. 

At this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. My son got angry and told me that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. I said he was going to end up blowing all HIS savings and there was no way she'd be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things she'll be focusing on during planning so he'll end up paying for those too and they'll start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.

He then accused me of never supporting his relationship and told me if I wouldn't support his wedding then I might as well not come. I told him I might take him up on that as I don't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it.

(also why she's staying with us). I told her she's always welcome here and that we'd do anything we could to make her comfortable being here and also said in the past that my fiance is very firm on not liking her boyfriend based on what she's told us, what our mom has said about him, and first hand experience. I told her when he was in my apartment that he made me feel uncomfortable and he's not allowed anywhere near us. I felt like everything was great until today. she needed to use my phone because she wanted to message her boyfriend and make amends so that they could live together again. I said it wasn't a good idea and not safe for her or the kids but didn't press any further because I wanted her to feel safe with me.

I know she still talks to them but I've long gone NC) I feel like it was just an unhealthy need to see what my family was talking about. Surprise, they were talking about me. I kind of expected it.

Called us disgusting and then proceeded to tell not only my family but her friends about how she wasnt going to do anything for us because of what I said about her boyfriend being ""off"" and my fiance saying he hated him. She said that her boyfriend has done tons of things for us. (Like how he drove me once to a doctors appointment. Thats it.) Then she said ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"". My other family proceeded to say things about me saying how I have no one and that I'll learn soon enough. I had a complete mental break down. It felt like nothing will ever be enough for anyone.

Basically, my 65 year old father is having a Spinal fusion, and specially requested that I, his 16 year old daughter, be at his beck and call whenever he needs assistance until my summer break ends. The surgery he’s having won’t allow him to lift anything, bend forward or backward, or twist his body at all. I upright refused as I felt he was asking WAY too much of me. 

My dad has had a multitude of health issues in my lifetime alone including: 
• a major TBI (put him in a wheelchair)
•type 2 diabetes
•chronic COPD
•multiple heart attacks

Plus an incredible amount more. I’m almost positive there’ll be some sort of complication with the procedure.

Additionally, I’m not his only option. If he doesn’t end up being hospitalized or put into a transitional care unit, my mom explicitly explained to the both of us that she would care for him for the next 3 months (despite essentially being estranged).

To preface, we share a (small) room. 

My roommate and I do not speak. We got paired randomly and I tried to be friendly when she moved in but it was like talking to a fucking brick wall and she never reciprocated my efforts to be friendly, so I gave up. At first it was fine because I was barely there since I stayed at my bfs place every night, but now I’m single and I’m in the apartment a lot more. The most we communicate is a “sorry” if we bump into each other in the sink area outside the bathroom. 

About 4 months ago I’d come home at night to some random guy sleeping in my room. I didn’t say anything at first because I’m not a confrontational person. He’d come over maybe once every 2 weeks and I thought he was just a friend of hers. They’d whisper at night and he got up super early and they *barely* made an effort to stay quiet. He also constantly farted in the room and laughed like a fucking child. I never spoke a word to either of them. 

After the 3rd time I texted her if her friend could sleep on the couch because I wasn’t comfortable with a random dude in my room while I sleep. I didn’t tell her this specifically but he seems like a total bum/gives me loser creep vibes. Anyway the TLDR of her response was that he was couch surfing so when he’s here it’s the only time he sleeps in a bed and they’re dating so she “felt weird asking him to sleep on the couch.” Really? I feel weird sleeping with a guy I don’t know 5 feet away from me and I’m the one who pays rent. She also said she wants to continue having him over more often. 

She was honestly nice about it and offered to hang out with all of us so we could get to know each other. I said maybe to that but said I *needed* notice of when he was coming, like a day minimum. She said okay and it was fine for a while. I was invited out 2x with them but I have no interest in getting to know either of them. She gave me a days notice the next 3 times. Then a few hours notice. Then tonight, no notice. I got back before they did and woke up when they came in at 1:30 am, then couldn’t fall back asleep because of their whispers and kissing.  I got so grossed out that I stormed out and am now sleeping on the couch in my own fucking apartment. That’s how I’ve woken up every morning too, to the sound of them fucking kissing and rubbing each other. It’s nasty. 

I wanna flip out and tell her he cannot stay here anymore. I mean, I never invited my ex over *ever* because we share a room so it’s fucking weird. I told my group chat and they were all like “chill he’s homeless and he’s only there once a week or so, just be cool we’re in college that’s what happens with roommates.” And they said I can’t force her to do anything, they’re not wrong there.

1324,Asshole,"I’m a pretty small person. I’m 4’11 and weigh under 100lbs.  

Sometimes when I’m out shopping or waiting in a line, ill notice someone standing less than 1 foot away from me. 9/10 times it’s a man, so I’ll call them out. I’ll try to be polite and take a few steps away when we I think someone is too close. Only If they get close to me again, I call them out. If I’m frustrated enough to call them out, I’ll end up saying stuff like “dude, can you fucking step back??”  Or “hey, you know about personal space?” 

Only 1 person has ever apologized to me when I’ve called them out. 

He was a super big and tall guy waiting behind me at the polling place. I was standing in the same spot for a while, the line wasn’t moving. I felt this guy bump into my back. 

I turned around told him calmly“hey, can you not stand so close to me?” He scoffed at me and said “we’re in a line” I almost caused a scene and pointed out to him  “dude, you just moved like, /inches/ behind me, I’m a small woman I notice!! ” he took a step back and apologized to me. 

Every other person I’ve called out for standing too close to me will give me a stank face and continue standing close until I leave the store or area. Sometimes I feel like I embarrass people for calling them out, but at the same time, they deserve to be embarrassed for being a total weirdo.


EDIT: 
I didn’t mean that I’m cursing out everyone who’s standing a foot behind me in grocery store lines. It was an example of the only person who’s apologized. I meant when people are standing a few inches behind me in uncrowded places like Walmart or Target, but thank you for making me rethink my approach.",53,92,0.85

1328,No A-holes here,"I booked a July flight to Hawaii from NJ in April 2018 and it had one stop. I get to the that stop and it was going to be an 11+ hour flight and I made sure to get the seat with extra space and near a window because I have bad anxiety and it would be easier for me to sleep against the wall and i paid an extra $36 for that seat.

I sat down and got comfortable at my seat and a man sat next to me. Then a women came up to me and and asked to switch seats because according to her the airline switched their seats (they were husband and wife). I got flustered and you could tell on my face but before I could say anything she cut me off and said ""Never mind, it's fine I'll sit here"" it was the isle seat next to her husband. 

I did feel bad but I did pay extra for that seat and I wouldn't be able to handle an aisle seat for 11+. If she would've let me speak i would've asked if she could pay me the $36 for that seat. But of course I let it go because I was afraid I would get kicked off the flight.

1330,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the long post, I think a lot of context is needed. 

I’m what most people would call a trust fund baby. I’ve never financially struggled and if I needed money it would magically appear in my bank account. My parents worked hard for their fortune, all for the sake of making sure my brother and I had comfortable lives. Still, I wouldn’t consider myself spoiled, as I don’t ask my parents for things I don’t need and I don’t feel entitled to their money. 

But I’ve gone to private schools since I was four years old. I wasn’t given a choice (see: I was FOUR) and sometimes wonder if I would’ve preferred public school, where kids wouldn’t be as spoiled and stuck-up. I think that a lot of my social anxiety and awkwardness stemmed from living in an extremely sheltered school environment my entire life. If I were given the choice now, I think I would have gone to public school, as it would have made me a much better-developed person in the long run. 

I’m nearly 20 now. My parents have paid tuition for 16 years of my life, and I’m grateful that they continue to support me. However, when they jokingly calculate how much “debt” I’ve accumulated since I was a child, (around $700k just from tuition... yeah...) I get kind of upset. I didn’t ask to go to private school at age 4, nor did I want to go to a private prep high school. Those things were essentially forced upon me due to my parents’ high expectations, when in hindsight I would have been perfectly fine going to any old public school.

When I hear my friends talking about them wanting to pay their parents back for tuition one day, I agree with them, but I don’t know how much I’m willing to pay back. College for sure, but AITA for not wanting to pay them for private schooling before college that I never wanted to receive in the first place?",22,27,0.85
1331,Not the A-hole,"My brother killed himself a week before what would have been his graduation from high school last month. I'm in my twenties and in college, but I grew up in the same house with the same parents in the same town. I went to the same school. And I can't help but feel that some people-my mother especially-are getting too much out of this tragedy.

My mother contacted the town newspaper to get a column put in about him, and she's been on FB for a month posting about it. I realize it doesn't sound over the top, but if you saw what she's posting...It's not memorial things like ""Remember how much he loved writing?"" it's more like ""Woe is me, I'm in utter turmoil now"" and in the last week it's taken on a certain ""Remember my son died? I'm the woman with the dead son, isn't that sad?"" quality that I find despicable.

And I know this house. My dad has a toxic, '50s-era take on masculinity and my mom is all the way back in the '20s. She's the nuclear family kind of woman who would rather pretend things are fine then deal with them, but behind your back she'll milk it for all the sympathy she can. The way she views femininity is at least partially why I suffered an ED in high school-she'd always say something like ""how are you going to get a good man when you look like that?"" even when I wasn't eating and dropping pounds by the week. And my dad always told my brother, when I was in the house, to ""man up"" whenever he'd cry or get beaten up or *anything.*

I got sick of it after a month, so I replied on one of her posts that she should be more concerned about what drove him to this end instead of herself. I pointed out that he clearly had anger issues and depression and instead of helping him we left him to suffer-all of us. My dad disapproved of it, my mom ignored it, and I moved out and left him there instead of helping. I ended with ""B is the one who was hurt, and the one we should be remembering. Not how he affected you.""

My mom replied that I have a toxic attitude, she doesn't need that, and I will never understand until I lose a child. Then she blocked me. Community members and my mom's friends have been saying I should be ashamed for ""assigning blame"" and this is no one's fault.

Edit: I just wanted to post an edit to let everyone know-your words are coming through, and it's helping me get a clearer view of my life right now. First, thank you for your condolences. It's wonderful to see kind words like that from strangers on the internet-everyone can use support and kindness, and it's great you guys give it out freely.

Second, I'm reflecting on my position from all the YTA people out there. I think I hadn't given my mother much sympathy because I've always had the same sense I imagine my brother felt: that no one cares about either of us or would miss us when we're gone. I've never felt my parents loved or even liked us at times, and so the idea that she is genuinely in grief didn't occur to me. And that's not fair. I don't know what's going through her mind, and I regret assuming the worst.

Finally, I think my attitude on this was poisonous. I feel very guilty about my brother's death because I *know* I could have helped him and instead I chose to help myself. And no one else seems to have that view, and I can't understand their version of grief. It feels like I'm the only one who feels responsible, which makes me feel like I am the only one responsible. As one person pointed out, that's making this about me instead of my brother, which is terrible.

Thank you for helping me see this clearer. To those of you telling me to reach out to my mom, I'm not sure if I will do so. While everything I've done sure reads terrible, I'm still hesitant to get involved with my parents. They may be grieving now, but I wholly believe they are toxic people I shouldn't have in my life. Still, I owe my mother an apology. I don't know what I'll do, but at least now I can admit what I'm doing is wrong instead of assigning blame to others.

To which she replied, “ew I wouldn’t want to hook up with him. I just wanted him to buy my drinks tonight”

1336,Asshole,"My first reddit post ever, please be gentle. Thank you.

Background INFO: I work in a small office/warehouse with 2 male coworkers, I am female. One guy does sales the other warehouse and I am customer service. So the sales guy is organizing a client event where a box lunch is provided to those who attend, and me and warehouse guy are helping with preparations. Warehouse guy will be on vacation when the event takes place. The zone VP and various managers will be in attendance and they are all from out of town.

Incident: About a week before the event, the three of us in the office have a meeting to review where we are with preparations. I ask the sales guy organizing the event if I need to watch the presentation because I would rather focus on my workload if possible. He says not a problem, you can close the door to your office and work away but I might need your help with the drinks. Let's be clear drinks are cans of soda and bottles of water. 

Pretty sure my facial reaction said it all but still I replied, ""I'm sure you ""guys"" can handle the drinks...."" He rolled his eyes and said, ""That is not what I meant! Like I might need your help with the food...."" I swear in his eyes there was a flash of panic before he tried to recover ""... in case I have to go out or something."" I told him I'm not a waitress and even if he didn't mean it that is what he said and I'm allowed to have my reaction (which was pretty sharp), plain and simple. That was that.

I've known the sales guy personally for 20 years and consider him part of my chosen family. We have worked together on many projects, personal and work related. He is a great guy, generous and a hard worker, and bottom line is I will always help or support him. But his lack of awareness shocked me. 

About a week ago he brought up the Incident and said he was surprised by my reaction to him asking for help if needed. I told him he knows I would help him in any way always, with or without being asked, because we are a team. But do not cast me the only female in the office, one of three females at the event, in the role of waitress/hostess. Be more aware of what you saying and to whom. 

So... AITA for how I reacted? Especially because we are friends as well as coworkers? This was a month ago and I'm wondering if I reacted too strongly or was too harsh? But enough already with the boys club crap.

Added tidbit: The event sponsor emailed the sales guy the day of the event wondering if there was a ""office lady"" who could pick-up the lunch so he wouldn't have to. Sales guy showed this to me hoping it would make laugh and not want to punch people lol. Effectively it did both!",46,49,0.87
1337,Asshole,"My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

1340,Asshole,"My adopted daughter had her first child about six months ago and very shortly after entered a major depressive episode. She's struggled with depression all her life and at this point in time it's gotten near impossible to function. I've been helping her out immensely-she moved back in, I pay for her living, and she's working on taking care of herself and working to a place where she can handle things like other people and a job again, while getting on medication for her depression. It's going well, she's working hard to get more stable, and it feels like starting over again as a mother-I've always loved the baby stage best.

Since this my biological daughter has become bitchy and unpleasant. When I asked what was wrong, she told me she thought it was ""fucked up"" that I opted out of parenting both my children, sort of blaming me for their mental health, and then I play mother of the year for a baby that isn't mine. I let it go because to an extent I see her point. I was a young, single, working mother, so I didn't spend much time with either of my children. I wasn't the most mature or best equipped to handle them like I am now. I figured she would get over it if I let her vent.

She didn't get any happier or nicer, so I asked again. And again. And she kept complaining about her *terrible* childhood and how awful I was. Eventually I got sick of it and told her the reality-she was a problem child and I was in over my head trying to do my best. I had to handle her underage drinking, drug use, frequent arrests, and an expulsion and she never made it easy. She said that she hoped her sister got her act together before my grandchild gets old enough that I lose interest. That was my last straw and I told her to stop talking to me until she can be respectful and polite.

My husband (her step-father) has refused to take my side, going so far as to say I'm being disrespectful and I have to acknowledge I was a bad mom once. I feel like everyone is ganging up on me, and the only people who aren't mad at me are my adopted daughter and grandson.

And recently, my aunt had a baby. I told her I’m not babysitting at all, under any circumstances. I have a 6 year old brother and I only babysit him if I need to.

1342,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I recently went on a week long vacation with our two young kids including our 7 month old. During that time we had contractors come to our home to do some extensive work water-proofing our basement.  They were set to arrive the same morning we were departing.  

Before leaving and a couple hours before they arrived that morning, I emailed some instructions to them, including that they should not unplug the chest freezer we had in the basement.  I also labeled it with a clear sign saying “Do not unplug”.  

Sure enough when we get back a week later we find that they had indeed unplugged the freezer and moved it to another outlet on the other side of the basement.  This would have been fine however it was not a working outlet. 

Inside the freezer was 800oz of breastmilk that my wife had spent many hours pumping each day for the last 7 months since my son was born.  The purpose was so that when she went back to work we would be able to give it to him.  If possible we would prefer to avoid needing to use formula.  It was all melted.  Once it melts you have to feed it to the baby right away otherwise it goes bad.  You also cannot re-freeze it, so was a total loss.  The monetary value of the milk was roughly $1,600.

I messaged the contractor to explain everything that happened and added that they should have been able to work around it (it was connected by a very long cord) and at a minimum they should have double checked to make sure the freezer was working again once they had plugged it back in.  I asked that we come to an agreement to be compensated.  

To the contractor’s credit he called me the next day to apologize and offered to pay us the full amount.  I was a bit surprised he didn’t try to negotiate.  He also mentioned that he fired the foreman that was in charge.  I feel like it was right for me to bring it up with the contractor, but I cannot help to feel guilty for costing someone his job (I had not asked for this), especially since perhaps I could have communicated better about it in advance so maybe there was blame to go around.  To be honest I had not thought to let them know about the freezer until the morning of our trip because it was such chaos getting ready to go.

1344,Not the A-hole,"My mum passed away suddenly a month ago after two strokes - the second, catastrophic (the result of an asymptomatic blood / bone cancer). She was 69, but VIBRANT, funny, young at heart - full of life, silly, ridiculous sense of humour, strong, inspirational - not a candidate for any age-related illness, let alone the kind of torturous illness she suffered with this past few months, prior to dying.

Mum & dad separated when I was 10: Mum sat my sister & I on the sofa and gently let us know that dad had moved to his own place, that it was a mutual decision, that they’d discussed and decided this was the best decision for all of our happiness as a family.

It was only until 3 or 4 years ago (in my early 30s), that (over a few drinks) Mum told me that in fact she’d come home from work that day & found a note on the kitchen table from Dad, saying ‘I’m leaving you - don’t try and take the money’. She'd picked us up from the bus stop 10 minutes later, and had to deal with the shitshow my dad had landed her with. The story we’d lived with the last 20+ years was a distorted version of the truth mum had created solely to protect us & to ensure we didn’t view my dad in a negative light.

Turns out that day dad froze the bank accounts. Paying bills, buying food, paying for school trips, bus journeys, exercise books, haircuts... Really hard for my mum.

For 7 or 8 years, my sister & I would go for dinner once every couple of weeks at a nice restaurant with dad. He'd point out how difficult it had been for him - & even prior to knowing the ‘truth’, it was awful to think either of my parents were hurting.

My relationship with my dad over the past 20+ years has been perfunctory - I’ve felt awkward on every occasion we’ve spent time together. Mum has always been a quiet inspiration - encouraging my sister and I to consider every angle & perspective before judging, ensuring that we don’t fall for the dangerous ‘single story’ - making sure to listen, treat people with parity, kindness, and respect... Honestly, I’ve never lost anyone who meant as much to me. We finished each other’s sentences, laughed HARD together, wanted similar things from life.

My dad's now insistent upon coming to see me. I’m finding it so hard and have avoided meeting with him blaming it on work (we live 400 miles apart), but now I’ve run out of excuses. I get that his behaviour was a result of his own upbringing; that said, I'm finding it very difficult to interact with my dad. 

I want to tell him how much he fucked us over, but what use is that, beyond getting it off my chest & hurting my dad in the process? He made mistakes but he's not bulletproof.

My entire life, my parents haven’t been.. the best. Even when I was little, my mom would be physically abusive. Nowadays, instead of that, I’m ridiculed, insulted, and threatened every chance my parents get to talk to me. The most recent time this has happened was 3 days ago—while I was in the car, I expressed confusion that we weren’t going out to lunch in a nice restaurant like we had been planning for a couple days. My father immediately blew up, telling me that I’m ungrateful, threatening to kick me out, and calling me a bitch.

Events like that happen almost daily, and are triggered by the smallest, insignificant things—even when I say I don’t like the smell of cigarettes or leave a spoon in the sink. Naturally, this drives me away. I don’t want to socialize with people who antagonize me every moment they can, but my staying out of their way (i.e., in my bedroom) just makes them angrier. 

Since I generally am stuck hiding in my room, I wait until they go into the garage (which they do every day—they like to smoke) so I can go down for food and water and, every couple of days, to work out. Today, they caught me coming downstairs. Immediately they looked shocked and proclaimed, “Oh! You’re still alive! We *do* have a daughter!”

She’ll discuss our daughter’s (age 5) tantrums, posting pictures of them. I’ve said she really shouldn’t do that, because one day she might not one those linked back to her. My wife just shrugs me off and says it’s not a big deal, “everyone does it”. Rarely everyone overshares as much as her. The one thing I’ve gotten her to do is not overshare about myself. She used to post about our disagreements, my personal work struggles, etc.

We have had fertility issues. Our daughter took three years to conceive. We became pregnant two years ago after trying for a year. Despite me asking that we not tell anyone for a while because of how precious the situation was, she posted it the day after we found out. I was very upset with her and she said that it wasn’t a big deal, they were going to find out anyway.

We miscarried two weeks later and she posted it all over Facebook. I know it was her loss too and that this kind of loss is important to discussed, so I didn’t blame her there.

It took us awhile to decide to try again. We recently found out we were pregnant again. I begged her, please don’t put this on Facebook yet, we’re not even ready to tell our families. She agreed with me. I thank her and head off to work. Halfway through the day, I’m getting texts congratulating me about my wife’s pregnancy. I check Facebook and yup…there’s a picture of our daughter holding the sonogram with a message that our “rainbow baby” is coming in 2020, with a long message about our previous loss and how excited we are.

1348,No A-holes here,"My wife (F 27) and I (M 29) have been married for two years now. When we first met I knew she worked long hours as a tech at a medical facility. I knew she would be tired when she gets home and all that but for the first year that we dated she took a bath or shower every single night after work and sometimes took showers before work in the mornings (she goes in around 3am). After that first year she started just coming home and getting in bed. I’m the type of person that HAS to take a shower before bed or I won’t be able to sleep, plus I just like being clean when in bed. 
Some people may be under the impression that women don’t sweat or stink, folks... this is not true. I’ve brought it up to her multiple times trying to be as nice as possible about it (I’d want some to tell me I smell bad if I smell bad) and she’s flipped out on me every time. I’ve asked her why she doesn’t shower after working all day and she usually just says “I don’t feel like it” we aren’t dirty people, we keep a clean house and have three kids that shower or bathe every single night. It’s starting to get to me because she’s mentioned that I’ve been getting more distant especially at night, that I never want to snuggle. I mentioned the shower thing when she brought this up because I thought she wanted to actually talk and work out why this was happening, she got upset again. So, AITA?

TLDR: My wife refuses to take a shower or bath before bed and is upset because I won’t snuggle

Edit: I do a lot of the main duties around the house, I do everything in the morning because she’s gone so early and I usually get all the kids from daycare in the evening and make sure they all get dinner and a bath since she goes to bed pretty early. I try to make it as easy on her as possible because I’m blessed with a job that is 8 to 5 and a boss that is extremely understanding as long as my billed hours get submitted each week I can come and go as I please.

Edit 2: She works in dialysis so HIV is always a concern for all the techs and other patients. I’m not retarded though so no I don’t think I’ll get HIV from cuddles. For those thinking I’m a jerk for mentioning lower income people, those are facts and also her words. I don’t work there and have absolutely no opinion on any of the patients. I’m not some dick who frowns on poor people.",274,300,0.88

1351,Asshole,"I’m 25. From 19-23 I was a pretty serious junkie. I was homeless from this time and squatted in a bunch of different abandoned buildings. 

It always seems to surprise people that I went through that because I seem now at least to have the appearance of being clean cut and with a decent job and in shape. 

I’m also a pretty religious NA attendee. I don’t like to share very often and I almost never stay behind to talk to the other attendees afterwards. I just find it helpful and healing to hear other stories.

As I was on my way out I grabbed a coffee as it was late and I had a bit of a drive to do. As I’m getting it I hear someone say my name. I’m surprised as I don’t even think I’ve said my name to more than two people there. 

When I turn around it’s my old dealer, a guy I used to get high with all the time. He holds out his hand to shake mine and I’m too in a daze to do anything but shake it back. He asks me if I remember him and I told him that I do and I’m sorry but I don’t want anything to do with him and I don’t care to hear his sob story about how he got clean because I remember when we were using together and how shitty of a person he was back then. 

I then just walked away and he was left with his mouth open. 

When I went back to the next NA meeting I was pulled aside by the coordinator of the meeting and told that there was a complaint about my behaviour and that I need to be more careful about what I say because if it happens again I will be asked to go to a different meeting location. 

He was honestly one of the biggest manipulators I knew and he had no problem taking advantage of a lot of people, not just us, for money to fuel his own habits.

1352,Everyone Sucks,"For context, I work at a small bakery chain that’s inside of a supermarket chain. 

Today a probably 8-9 year old girl comes up with her mom and asked me for one of our chocolate chip cookies, which are $2.50 a piece. The mom tells her daughter she wasn’t going to pay $5 for 2 cookies, so she could only have 1. About 10 minutes pass, and the little girl comes near our area to throw something out in our trash can. I see her, and bag up a cookie and hand it to her and tell her “here ya go, its on the house”. She looked up at me and said “thank you thank you thank you!!!”, and ran off. Probably 5 minutes after, the mom comes up to the counter furious, and makes a big scene about how unacceptable it was that I gave her child a cookie without her permission, to the point where the grocery store manager was called over, and I was forced to apologize for being “disrespectful to not only her parenting, but as a woman.” So, AITA ?",35,58,0.86
1353,Not the A-hole,"To give a bit of background, I’m atheist. I’m also black and live in a southern state. My entire family except for one other person (and my family is stupid huge) identifies as either Christian, Muslim, or simply spiritual. I only really mention this so you can understand how I’m already the black sheep. My grandma died recently from old age. We buried her this past Sunday. She truly was the matriarch of the family. Almost every single person in the church, my grandma helped raise in some way. She’s was/is a very special person and she was/is very much loved. During her memorial service, the reverend was giving her eulogy. It’s going about as well as you can expect a eulogy to go, but all of the sudden he starts bringing politics into it. Specifically, going on a tangent about our current president. Some people started getting into it but most everyone was just crying and sitting silently. I was completely caught off guard by this and I started getting really mad. It’s a funeral! My grandma’s funeral! She’s laying in her casket right fucking there and he’s bringing politics up! She wouldn’t want this. So when he finally stops to take a breath, I speak up in a loud voice and say “We are at my grandmother funeral. This is not a political rally. Respect my grandmother and her family and give a EULOGY.” The whole church fell silent and everyone just looked at me. My mom whispered in my ear to just go wait outside. So I did. I was so pissed off and angry and sad all at once. After the burial and all of us were heading to our cars my mom stopped me. She said that I was completely out of line and I needed to respect the reverend and apologize to him. I told her that no apology will be given to that man as it was completely inappropriate to bring stupid shit up that didn’t even fucking matter. I apologized for upsetting her and the rest of the family. But I will not apologize to the reverend under any circumstances. My mom told me it would be best if I didn’t come to the church dinner afterwards and I agreed, so I went home. I haven’t spoken to her or my sisters since, and we’re usually on a every day talking basis. I’m starting to wonder if I really did fuck up here. I understand everyone is still upset over the loss of grandma, but she was my grandma too. I just wanted the last words for her not to be about politics. AITA?

1354,Not the A-hole,"So my now fiancée and I lived with her parents and adult siblings for many years  whilst I attended school. I contributed to their mortgage and the groceries and utilities while I was in school and now that I make an incredibly good living, I have paid off their home, my fathers home, and have bought my soon-to-be wife and I our dream home.            
           
My father, who contributed financially to my schooling and helped me immensely throughout my many years of intense study and 50 hour work weeks, is my hero. Without his help I wouldn’t have been able to do the years of schooling that I did and therefore wouldn’t be in this position. I decided to get him a luxury car (won’t name make and model as it will make this too specific). His reaction was so worth it.       
        
But my soon to be father in law is pissed. He wants to know why I didn’t buy him a car too. I was incredibly offended and was shocked to find that my fiancée felt the same way. She says that her father contributed to my success as well and should also get a car (note he has even more vehicles than my father so this isn’t an issue of him not having transportation).         
          
I told my fiancée that she and her family are acting like brats for confronting me over a vehicle when I paid off her father’s 6 bedroom home. While he did help me by allowing me to stay at his home, I also had the option to live with my family rent free, but wanted to be with my SO (we could no longer afford our apartment with my schooling which is why we moved in with her family).            
         
I also got upset because my fiancée makes a very substantial living herself and has the means to purchase a car for her father on her own. I don’t see how getting her father, whom dislikes me more than his other children’s SOs because they are heterosexual, a luxury car is my responsibility. I told my fiancée I am reconsidering this relationship because if she and her family are acting this entitled now, I don’t see how it would ever improve. They’re calling me selfish and saying I have bitten the hand that fed me.

1357,Not the A-hole,"I joined Reddit earlier this year (another account, this one is kind of a throwaway) and started farming for karma. I knew  nobody knew me here so I posted stuff,  sensitive stuff, which I'd not normally tell any of my friends/family.
You know, it's Reddit and everyone has posted something once which they would feel embarrassed about if someone they knew recognized 'em. 

So anyway, my best friend knew I was on Reddit and was obsessed with finding me here, and he did. But, instead of keeping it a secret, he created a group chat with all of my other friends and sent them everything I was posting (since I was just mining karma, I posted embarrassing  stuff which was out of character for me, I just wanted the upvotes) here. They all had a good laugh for a week or so before he decided to tell me. I was mortified and even deleted all social media apps from my phone for a whole week out of embarrassment, anger and shock.

1359,Everyone Sucks,"I went on a lunch date with a guy I met online.  He weighed at least 80 pounds more than his pictures and his personality didn’t make up for it in the least.  His eating habits also disgusted me.  I was friendly, so I guess he thought I liked him, but I just didn’t want to hurt his feelings and embarrass him in public by leaving the date early .  We had talked about a certain book before the date and he brought his copy to loan to me.  I turned him down, knowing I didn’t want to see him again, but he kept insisting - was quite pushy about it actually - so I took the book.  

Later, I sent him a gentle ‘I’m not interested’ text and he flipped out, calling me superficial, entitle bitch, etc.  He also demanded I meet up with him to give him his book back. This did not sound pleasant.  I did want him to get his book back, but did NOT want to be around him again, especially now that this giant man was angry with me.  I was running errands and he kept texting me.  The book was in my car, and we were in the same general area, which happened to be near a Whole Foods.  I decided to turn his book in to WF customer service.  I told the lady I found it in the store, and she took it without question.  I left and sent a text to they guy telling him where he could pick up his book.  At this, he really flipped his shit, and according to him, I am the worlds biggest asshole.  I had remained civil throughout our communications, but I had enough and my last text advised him to pick up some healthy groceries and stop drowning himself in mayonnaise.  So, AITA?


Edited to add - one commenter said my asshole status regarding the mayonnaise insult depends on its relevance to the date.  The eating habits I was disgusted by: he ate more mayonnaise than I have ever seen a human consume. Ordered extra sides of mayo, twice.  Easily ingested a full cup, not including the ounce or so he coughed onto his plate when his mouth was full.  He kept eating off said plate.",61,60,0.88
1360,Not the A-hole,"So a friend of mine, we'll call him ""Tim"" wants to be addressed by  the name ""Thor"". Ok, so let me start off with a little context, Tim and I have been friends for about 10 years, I met him first year of high school and we've been good friends since. The best way i could describe him in one sentence is that hes a hot-headed short fuse kinda guy, so being his friend was a tad difficult.

After high school we started to hang out less due to college/work etc, but we still keep in touch here and there. We were both born and raised in Canada. Tim is Icelandic, Thor is his Icelandic name, apparently Icelandic people have an Icelandic name in addition to their Canadian birth name. In the past he didn't mind people calling him Tim, but always preferred Thor. I recently heard from my circle of friends that he is now demanding people call him Thor, if people don't then he is cutting ties with them as friends. (He doesn't put enough value in long term friendships imo) I haven't spoken to him about this yet but we have a get-together in a few weeks so i will see him then. 

Just to be clear I WILL eventually be addressing him by Thor once I get used to it. My issue is that I've been calling him Tim for 10 years, and I'm just not used to calling him Thor yet. Whats most likely going to happen is something like this: ""Hey Tim! err.. I mean Thor."" Knowing his short fuse he wont like this. Am i the asshole here?",38,51,0.88
1361,Not the A-hole,"Today, my husband's friend got fired immediately after coming onto a female co-worker so strongly at an afterparty that she had to call for help. Literally happened last night, he's gone this morning. 

The same boss who just fired that guy asked every coworker IN A GROUP if they like to fuck with a finger up the ass. Male and female coworkers were asked to respond 'honestly.' Today. After he fired that guy. 

I told my husband it's sexual harassment and I don't see how it can be tolerated. Now he's mad at me and doesn't understand my reasoning. 

I'm actually so pissed that my husband doesn't get how this is wrong. AITA for thinking he's just as bad as his boss at this point?

Update- he says that being friends trumps the coworker/boss relationship. No it doesn't.

Edit - okay so, I dont necessarily want my husband to handle the situation. It could be dangerous for him to do so. All I care about is that he recognizes that this is wrong. He doesn't think theres anything wrong with this after multiple explanations and that's the part that upsets me.

Double update - so here's the thing. My husband isn't a bad guy. In fact, he's the most compassionate and open minded person I know. In terms of social issues such as these, he has come such a long way in the 8 years that we've known each other. I'm very proud of him. He will speak with anyone very rationally and without judgement even if he strongly disagrees with them just so they feel heard. But sometimes he just can't wrap his mind around something like this and I start to wonder if it's just me who is in the wrong.

1362,Not the A-hole,"I’m in a load of shit right now. I’m a 25 year old dude. Yesterday, I went to a friend’s house for a chill night. He also invited some friends I didn’t know. We were all in the living room, and my friend the host showed me some girl’s Instagram profile on his phone. He asked me what I thought about her. The girl in the photos was spray tanned, had heavy makeup and just overall not attractive to me, although I could see why other men would like her. I said “Too fake and basic. Seems like an attention seeker.”

There was this very awkward silence in the room. It turns out the same girl was sitting right across from me and heard the whole exchange. I just didn’t recognize her because she wasn’t wearing makeup and didn’t have filters on. She went out of the room very upset with her friend.

Apparently she is my friends coworker and she wanted him to set me up with her. I guess he was trying to elicit a few compliments after showing her my profile. Then he would have introduced me to her sitting across from me. 

I felt very bad about the whole situation and I even went to apologize to her. She said “whatever”. Her friend called me a dick. I tried to defend myself, saying I didn’t know she was in the room and I judt answered my friend’s question honestly.

I have since moved on and have been living with someone for over a year now. Our relationship is very serious with talks of marriage and children. I have the children 95% of the time, their dad maybe has them one night every other week at a push. 

Obviously my partner sees the children a lot. He is great with them. He has formed amazing bonds with them both. He helps with the school run, home work etc. The children know he isn't a replacement dad - he is a bonus parent. Someone extra to love them like me and their dad.

We had a conversation with her and agreed she can call him whatever she feels comfortable with but that although my partner loves them like they are his own - he isn't their dad.

I also told her that the same applies to her dad's girlfriend and they can call her what they are comfortable with.

1365,Everyone Sucks,"A couple weeks ago, my two children and I (Edit: thanks, u/dogsfuckingsuck for so graciously correcting my grammatical error) were visiting my sister who lives about 4 hours away. One day on our trip she says, ""I wanna bring the kids to the park today! It's really cool!"" That sounds like a great idea to me, so we go. When we arrive, we find there is some sort of fair thing going on. I say something along the lines of, ""Woah! What's all this?"". She says, ""Oh it's the [I forget] festival! They do it every year. I thought the kids would love it!""

When we get to the admission booth, she buys her one ticket and heads in. At this point I was a little confused. She invited us, didn't tell us it wasn't free, then didn't pay for it? But she was already inside, so I went ahead on in. 

When I met back up with her, I said, ""I wish you had told me there was a fee. We could have done something else."" 

She replied, ""It's only $12! You never let them have any fun!"" She somehow forgot that I have 3 people. 

I half-jokingly said, ""Well maybe you should have taken one of the kids for me!"" 

She got furious. She starting going on about how I don't support her childfree lifestyle and I wanted them so bad I should be willing to pay for them and how can I be so cheap  and when she has kids (? She had just told me she was childfree?) she won't be such a money grubber. I was pretty mad at this point to, but I held my tongue because she was our ride home. The rest of the visit was awkward and she would make a show anytime she spent money.

Edit to answer some questions:

Why didn't I leave? She was our ride home, so I didn't have many options

Why do I care so much about such a small amount? Honestly, it's not so much that it's impossible for me to swing that, I can. But it's still money that could have been used for a lot of other things and, given the option, I would have rather used it for something other than that festival. 

And finally, why didn't I say anything about the cost at the gate? This is the real kicker and, in hindsight I really should have. If anyone calls me TA in this situation, I can definitely see this being the reason why. I didn't say anything because I was acting under the assumption that she was paying for all of us. I'm pretty sure she knew about the festival based on how she acted when we got there (I think she wanted it to be a fun surprise). The phrase ""bring you"" has more connotations for me than I guess it does for others. I was a couple steps behind her at the gate because I was pushing the stroller and was trying not to get in anyone's way. When I saw her at the booth, I thought she was getting our tickets and figured I would avoid fighting that crowd for a second. When she scooted inside without meeting back up with us, I realized I was wrong. Granted, I absolutely could have husssled up there and chatted before she bought them, but I made an assumption. That's where I was wrong and maybe a bit the asshole.",77,115,0.93

1368,Asshole,"So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she’s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I’m hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter “where’s the rest of my steak?” and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I’m complaining to my girlfriend and she’s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I’m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that’s where we’re different, I don’t let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don’t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald’s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place.

Due to work I can only attend a day where only immediate family is all together. (my dad's sibling's family).

Now special consideration is that my dad died last month and was the head of making these reunions happen. 

Coincidentally, I came out as gay at Christmas to my siblings (parents knew over a year). 

The issue:

When I brought up the subject previously about bringing my BF of a year (soon to be fiancee), I was told we had to pretend to be best friends and show no affection to one another around any kids. (my family is UBER Mormon). 

We accepted on the condition that all other couple follow whatever restrictions they deem fit for us. This was soundly rejected and I've been told to be accepting of religious scruples and patient for my family to come around. 

I wouldn't dishonor my BF by asking him to stuff himself in the closet. But I also feel like a dick for missing out on the event my dad was so passionate and put so much effort into. 

My dad had accepted me and my choices prior to his death and we ended on the best of terms. My mom is accepting but is trying to please everyone so not much help coming there I think.

I'm just adding this to say that these are not family friends or anything, outside of babysitting I don't really know these families.

The other day I was babysitting a girl (9) and a boy (7). After playing for a bit we decided to put on a movie. However, I couldn't get the tv to work, and the kids couldn't do it either. We tried for a bit, but when we couldn't get it to work I told the kids that we would just play another game instead. They didn't like this much, and the girl says that I should call her mother to ask how to turn on the tv. I tell her no. I don't want to disturb their mother for something so small that's not even a real problem. I feel like it's my job as a babysitter to take care of the kids and give the mom a night off from the kids, and that means not calling her with every little thing (I didn't tell the children this last part obviously). The girl insists though, she tells me multiple times more to call her mother and ask, and I keep refusing. In the end, we play a game instead.

Some comments on a reddit thread I read made me realize that it might have been an asshole move of me to deny a child contact with their mom, no matter the reason for it. Thinking about it, it makes sense that parents would want their children to be able to call them if they feel the need to, and I might have been out of line to prevent that, especially as I'm nearly a stranger to these people. What do you guys think? Am I the asshole for not calling or letting the kids call? I'm especially interested in parents' opinions.

For what it's worth, I did end up calling the mom later in the evening after her daughter couldn't sleep and complained of a tummy ache. She didn't seem surprised by my call or the tummy ache.",21,34,0.88

my brother (15M), has been begging me every time we go to a family social gathering for some alcohol, he begs and begs and begs. I always say no because hes underage.

He doesnt like talking with the kids at the fam meet ups, so hes either begging my mom to leave, or interrupts my conversations that im having

I was in the middle of an intense convo with my aunt about her recently deceased husband. My brother then rudely interrupts and is tugging on my shirt, “yo dude gimme some of that, yo yo yo dude” in the most annoying trying-to-look-cool way.

He went on and on nagging me, and i got so mad i took him aside and gave him the whiskey which was about 1/3 a glass full and told him to have it

He drank a sip and handed it back but i pushed it back towards him and told him to finish it

I made him drink the whole thing and his face was all red and he had to sit down. 

He ended up crying and we went home, everyone at the party who heard about it said i was an asshole, so did my parents.. idk he does this every fucking time at a party and it seems like this will definitely be the last time he asks me for alcohol, AITA?",24,33,0.88
1375,Not the A-hole,"We've been married 15 years when we got married anxiety wasn't an issue, it's really only been the last two years that it has started to be crippling for him. 

He loves to swim but he is too anxious to swim in the pool where we have a membership (too peopley I guess?), fine I take the kids to the pool by myself even though it would be a lot easier to have two people watching them. 

Most activities outside the house either I have to forfeit going, go alone or deal with someone completely ruining the vibe the whole time. 

Any time we do something as a family it is pulling teeth because he is just completely positive that the kids are going to get in trouble even though none of them have done anything really troublesome in years. 

We have a beautiful dog who is dying to spend time with other dogs to the point that any opportunity she will run off and not come back until she is tired. All five of the rest of the family think that we should get a second dog so that our dog will have a pack mate. It took time but I was finally able to extract from the husband that he doesn't want another dog because when the dog gets out he is anxious that she will get hit by a car and hurt the driver or passengers of the car. 

My opinion is that his anxiety is affecting the family in a negative way and he should go to the doctor and try to deal with it. He thinks we should all respect him and not do things that make him anxious. I feel like an asshole but I don't think that is fair.

1376,Not the A-hole,"To preface, I plan on breaking things off with my emotionally abusive girlfriend today and it’s a relieving feeling to see things clearly without doubting myself anymore. She has mentally exhausted me to the point of dark depression and a new-found lack of confidence. It’s time for a new chapter.

My girlfriend works for a payday loan company and recently revealed to me that she frequently shorts customers up to $100 at a time just to pocket the money herself. By the sounds of things, she’s been doing this for a long time and flies completely under the radar. Before telling me this, she expressed that she hoped it wouldn’t change my outlook on her but it inevitably did. She seemed completely remorseless of her thievery even after me explaining to her why it’s wrong. She claims that these people have it coming if they’re ‘too stupid to check’ that they received the correct amount. I explained to her that some of these people - especially in the area - are fighting poverty and that $100 could mean the difference between food on the table or not.  Not to mention, you’re a business and any business with its employees should operate with integrity.

She has zero compassion for anyone but herself and her lack of remorse worries me. She destroyed me and the last thing I want is for her to get away with her despicable actions.

1377,No A-holes here,"I just moved into a newish neighborhood where the homes on the south side of the street have been built for about three years and the homes on the north side are just being built now. The HOA has painted the curbs on the south side red to help alleviate parking concerns as there are loads of townhomes on the next street over with limited parking. We just built a house on the north side of the street.

My neighbor (let's call him Kevin) across the street (south side) has been parking on the curb where my new house is (north side) ever since he moved in three years ago. I'm not quite sure why. He has a two car garage and a driveway (meaning he could potentially park four cars on his property). He only has two cars. 

Anyway, the first week we moved in he continued to park right in front of our house, which we thought a bit odd. He has four parking spots on his property and two cars. To me it seems a bit rude to park in front of someone else's house when you are perfectly capable of parking on your own property. So finally the other night I had enough and went and knocked on his door. I asked him if he could stop parking his car in front of my house and he asked why. I said something to the effect of, ""I just built a brand new house and I'm not that stoked about having someone else's car parked in front of my house every single night, if I'm being as candid as I can be"". He went on and on about how everyone in the neighborhood has to deal with cars in front of their house and that my request is unreasonable (to which I responded by looking up and down our street where his car was the only car parked on the street). He seemed pretty incredulous about my request and even asked, ""so what am i supposed to do?"". Before I could respond ""well, you have a driveway"", he said he would move his car and ""figure out what he was gonna do"".

Ever since then he's been parking in front of my next door neighbor's house (still being built), making a point to keep his car as close to my property line as possible. Am I the asshole here? I'm not asking him to never park in front of my house. Obviously that's unreasonable as he or his guests can't park alongside his curb (due to it being painted red) if he's having a party or for other extenuating circumstances. But I fail to understand why he feels like he needs to park somewhere other than his own house every single night? Help me out Reddit.",159,81,0.9

1379,No A-holes here,"So my younger sister is getting married towards the end of this year. Family is all excited. As her oldest brother, my duties are pretty much just shut up and be helpful when asked. 


Last weekend, my sister, my mom, her future mother-in-law and her bride's maids went dress shopping. My mom group texted the rest of the family a picture of the dress she chose. It is not flattering at all, and makes my typically very fashionable sister look like a frilly white ghost.

Now, I can barely dress myself, and pretty much wear jeans and a hoodie every day, but even I can see this dress is not a good dress. My other sister was the first to bring it up in the group text, saying the dress looked ""kinda dumpy"" and my mom was trying to do that mom-thing by dampening how bad it really was by saying ""oh it makes your sister happy, she really loves it."" but she too was not a fan.



Pretty much the last few days have been my family trying to be positive about this dress, but all fighting internally to like it for my sister's sake. Untill this morning.

My sister called me to see if I still was in contact with a friend that owns a brewery to see about discounts on beer for the wedding. Now I love my sister, and I would want to know in her situation, so when the talk moved to her dress, I said ""you know... People aren't a big fan of your dress.""


She pressed me on more and I spilled the beans on how we don't think it's flattering and maybe she rushed the choice. My sister curtly thanked me for telling her and apparently made immediate calls to my mom, her bride's maids and our other sister. 


My phone has been on fire for the last few hours with angry people (including a pissed off grandpa voice mail I couldn't bring myself to listen fully to). The person least upset with me seems to be the bride to be. The rest of my family is beyond angry. I however feel I did the right thing by being honest when everyone else wasn't. I know it's her day and her dress, and I want her to be happy and confident but I'd hate to have my sister's wedding be talked about after like ""man, did you see that dress?! Horrible"".

1381,Not the A-hole,"First time poster here, don’t go easy on me. 

I’m sure you all are familiar with Doughnuts With Dads. If you’re not, it’s a program that goes on in elementary schools where you go with your child early that morning and you sit with them, usually in the auditorium, have a doughnut (or 3) and listen to an administrator show you love, or if you’re me, just hang out w your kid before school starts...

...only it doesn’t happen. 

My daughter is heading to the 3rd grade. Meaning I’ve been to these things twice (skipped last year, she was sick). Each time we’ve gone (me, my munchkin and her bio dad), we’ve had to sit through an hour and a half of the administrators explain to us “how to be better parents to our children”. Last time we were given a sheet of paper that had the “5 T’s”, Talk, Time, some other nonsense, you get it. The time before that, we were lectured on how there should be more men in the seats than there were, like we could control that. That very same year, a mother was in the stands (hats off to you ma’am) and was singled out by the principal and told us that she is setting an example for us. Like wtf?


And what makes matters worse, I tell my wife and she’s shocked. Tells me that’s ridiculous and that never happens at Muffins for Moms (same thing but for mothers). She explains to me that they get a potted plant and the school damn near bows down to them. There was even an instance where the vice principal was preaching (as in “can I get an amen” preaching) going on about how moms “are the first ones to wake up and the last ones to go to bed” and the “last ones to eat at night” and my wife blatantly said she did none of those things, her husband does (my wife is the shit, y’all don’t even know). 


This ain’t an anti mom post cuz my wife is an AMAZING mother, I’m a mamas boy, and I’m all about the women/mama movement, y’all amaze me every day. But I feel like it can be a little (for lack of a better word) dangerous for the kids to see mama handed a flower pot and for dad to be read the riot act. It’s already bad in entertainment, tv shows, etc. where dad as the aloof, derpy, Patrick Star-type of adult. 


But anyway, on to my question. WIBTA by emailing the principal and suggesting to change up the way they do things when it comes to DfD? Not just for the sake of my own (admittedly) selfishness but so my daughter won’t keep being told that “Dad(s) have to do better”?",442,4170,0.96
1382,Not the A-hole,"So i have a baby on the way who is due to arrive any day now. The topic of piercing her ears has came up a couple times but this last conversation i really put my foot down. My girlfriend wants to pierce my newborns ears but i refuse to allow her to do it. I feel like it is a completely unneccessary thing to do. The only reason ANYONE i have asked can give me, is because it ""looks pretty""  No. My daughter is not an accessory for you to decorate. Why put her through that pain with no say whatsoever, my girlfriend is trying to say it only hurts for a second but i dont believe that. There has to be soreness after that the baby is just incapable of communicating. I just dont feel comfortable with stabbing a needle through my child's ears for ""beauty"". She tries to argue that women go through pain all the time for beauty, but that is by choice and is exactly what is wrong with the beauty industry in my opinion. It got to the point where i said absolutley not and she is threatening to do it behind my back. I said that if she does so, then we will have serious relationship issues to deal with. Am i over reacting?

**UPDATE 
I thought i would answer some common questions coming in. 

1) yes my s/o is hispanic, but i know for a fact it is just a beauty thing and not a cultural one. Not saying she is ashamed of her culture, but she has never been overly proud or traditional..if that makes sense.

2) yes we have discussed circumcision and both agreed it was an outdated, horrible practice and would not do it if we had a son. Though she states it is vastly different than piercing ears.

3) no our relationship is not shit lol. We have been having an amazing time planning and setting up our nursery. We are both as excited as can be and as happy as ever. 

4) i would not call this an arguement, more so a debate in which i strongly stated my stance and refuse to budge. But at the end of the day i understand that she is the mother and is going to have the final say on 95 percent of these issues, having said that, i am going to stand my ground on this specific issue. 

5) i have had my own ears pierced in the past but it was with a gauged needle so the pain factor is really incomparable. Mine obviously being very much more painful. I do remember the soreness lasting quite some time though.

6) also to clarify, i stated our relationship would have issues if she deliberately went behind my back amd pierced her ears, it would make me feel as if i had no say in our child's life.

1384,Asshole,"Girlfriend (26) and I (25) have been dating for about 4 moths and it has been fantastic. She's very free-spirited , social, and up for adventures. This is so opposite from other girls I have dated in the past and part of why I like her so much. However, part of that personality and her is that she has a couple small and fairly inconspicuous tattoos.

&#x200B;

Now I know it is 2019 and I am in the minority here, but I just don't really like tattoos in general.  So for the first couple months I sort of avoided mentioning them, but they came up in conversation recently because she was asking my opinion on getting another one.

&#x200B;

I told her, look there is nothing wrong with the tattoos you have specifically, but I am just not very comfortable with them in general. But, it is your body and completely your decision if you want to get more. I knew about your tattoos before we started dating, they are a part of you, so I am in no right to tell you not to get more. But honestly, I don't love the ones you already have and it would be my preference if you didn't get anymore.

&#x200B;

Lastly, and here's probably where I fucked up, I made a joke that for each tattoo she gets she loses a .1 on the hot scale, so I joked that she's currently a 9.7. I should explain that our relationship is full of similar banter, and I have always told her to let me know if I go to far. And this was the first time that she said she didn't like that joke, and now she says she feels self conscious.

&#x200B;

So, I apologized and said I won't make more tattoo jokes. But I stand by my previous statements. It's just my honest opinion and in no way a deal-breaker or anything if she gets more, but its how I feel.

&#x200B;

1386,Asshole,"My wife and I divorced three years ago, I wanted to work on things but she did not. Obviously I wanted to do what was best with the kids, so I agreed to share custody and buy her out of the kids family home so it wouldn’t have to be sold to strangers. I didn’t want to rip the kids away from their established schedules (due to her working less than I, she was the primary parent in many respects), so I took one for the team and just asked for the “standard dad schedule” of every other weekend, and ensured they knew they could always reach out even if it wasn’t “my time” with them.

My eldest (13 at the time) refused to come for my weekends, and I wanted to do the right thing so I didn’t force the issue (I did ask my lawyer about parental alienation, but because of the way my daughter discovered the root cause of the divorce, he felt that I’d have a difficult time making my case there with a judge). Since then, my other kids (now 14 and 10) have over time dropped off of the fixed schedule, and prefer to meet up once a month or so for dinner. I want the kids to know that I trust them to make their own decisions (obviously “eat your vegetables” isn’t their choice, but I want them to have autonomy), and I trust that when they’re a bit older and able to fully grasp the situation, they will understand that I’ve done all the right things here and our relationship will go back to the way it was.

For the record, this was the same approach my own father took with us kids when my mother left him, and as adults we all became much closer to him than our mother, precisely because he chose to trust us and treat us like adults in situations like this.

However, I have been getting some flak for this that I don’t 100% understand. My family agrees I am taking the right approach, but I had two otherwise very nice girlfriends in a row dump me for “being a terrible father”. The opinion of both of them was that a good dad would fight for 50/50 and force his children to spend more time with him against their wills. I do not believe that that is how love works, but my most recent ex went on such an intense screed about my behavior that I’m now pushed to be more open to outside opinions.

1388,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if I’m all over the place, I’m terrible at telling stories. I will start from the beginning 

My sister Started dating this guy we’ll call Adam. Me, sister and Adam would always go out together, sometimes my bf would come along.
My sister travels back and forth to another country because she is on a visa, so they are long distance. When she isnt here, my mom would still invite him to family cookouts/holidays since he was pretty much family. 
So this was 2 years in and it was New Years, my sister was in her home country at the time. So my mom Invited him to the house to celebrate since he doesn’t have much family. My other older sister “Kathy”, me and him decided to go out to celebrate at a bar since the house was boring. Keep in mind Kathy doesn’t ever drink, but he somehow pushed her all night over and over again to take shots, she would say “no” only for him to order more so she felt she had to. It got to the point that she was blacked out and couldn’t walk so we decided to go home. I told him 3 times that I wanted kathy in the front with me since I was driving. He kept saying no and sat in the back with her. I felt this fear for my sister, her skirt was all the way up, she wasn’t coherent, and he was holding her so tightly the whole 40 minutes home. I knew something wasn’t right, I kept looking back because my instincts told me to. 

Fast forward to a year, and he needed my help to do something, my mom convinced me to go with him. It was around my birthday and 7:30 when we were done and he wanted to thank me by taking me out to eat. He ordered margaritas even though I didnt agree beforehand. Im not a confrontational person so I drank it, then he ordered me 2 more. I was tipsy but not drunk at that point. I told him no more because my mom would notice. We got in the car and he put my seatbelt on for me, that’s when I started tensing up. On the way to my house he pulled over on a dark dirt road and stopped the car. I was so scared, all I said was “my mom is waiting on me” and he started the car and took me home. I only told Kathy about this incident.


Fast forward to today and my sister(his fiancé) was telling me someone told her a rumor about him dating another girl while they were dating. I told her I absolutely believed it and told her everything. Now she’s crying and breaking up with him 3 months before their wedding. 


Oh and by the way, he told her that the reason he stopped was because I said my mom couldn’t see me this way. That makes no sense to me because If that was the case why would he not stop at a gas station? Were we supposed to sit in the woods for one hour?!

1391,Not the A-hole,"I am generally all about sticking to your word, but this one has me in a corner. Early on in our relationship, my boyfriend and I agreed that since we wanted to spend holidays together, we’d alternate each year between his parents and my parents for Thanksgiving. Both of our sets of parents live within 30 min of us. The first couple years, it went well. Then, out of the blue, his parents told us one year that we would be going to have dinner with their extended family. Cool. Except his extended family lives a 5 hour drive away and they want us all to drive up there and back together. And we would be staying all weekend, Thurs-Sun.

It was a lot, but it was his year so I agreed. It was mostly great, but his extended family lives in the boonies with no internet access or cell reception. I got back Sunday night to a bunch of angry emails from my boss. I work in a demanding field where the expectation is you pretty much be available 24/7 unless you tell people (and even then it’s frowned upon). I explained that I hadn’t realized I wouldn’t have any access, accepted the reprimand, and moved on.

The problem is, for some reason, his parents now insist on doing this every year. According to my boyfriend they have always hosted thanksgiving at their house, but now they’ve decided his extended family will host every year.   So every other year, I am expected to take the car ride over with the family and spend the whole weekend there. I’ve done it twice and it’s always pretty inconvenient.

It’s his year again, but I’ve found out that I have been invited to go to a work conference shortly after thanksgiving this year. Because of prep, timing, and travel arrangements, I’ll need to fly out the night after thanksgiving. I told my boyfriend and offered to still come up there, but leave early by myself. He got upset. Apparently his family will find this incredibly rude.

This led to a fight where I finally said that I don’t want to go to his extended family every other year. He argued that I’d agreed to it and it was only fair, but I feel that this is way more than I agreed to and is unreasonable. We spend half a day with my family on my years and only have to travel an hour round trip. We spend 4 days with his family and travel 10 hours round trip to somewhere that’s so isolated, I can’t even respond to a work emergency, which makes me look bad.

I told him I wasn’t willing to do it anymore if his parents insist on going to extended family’s. At most, I’d be willing to do it every third year, and do the other two years with my family. He thinks this is incredibly unfair, since I previously agreed to split evenly and since it means his parents have to either choose to host every other year (and not go see extended family) or only see him on Thanksgiving every third year.

My friend and I work at a cell phone store which I manage. Every month we have to do physical inventory of the store to make sure everything is okay. Yesterday also happens to be a day that the regional manager and owner of the company came by to have a meeting. My friend starts the count as he always does and in the meeting brings to my attention that there is a huge variance in the count. It leads to me noticing a missing phone. The night prior my other employee told me he left a customers trade in the top left safe. I assumed that was the phone and called him to ask. He swears he did not touch it and so does my friend. RM and Boss go looking for the phone in the safe as well. Some time passes and they get fed up and basically say to my friend he was the only other person to touch it. He denies it and we have to search the cameras. We see other employee put the phone in the safe. The two higher ups say find the phone or get fired basically. Friend says he will find the phone, he may have moved it while doing count. Two higher ups leave and I tell him we will figure this out and look when I get back from getting us coffee. Friend bought a new car last night and was going to let me drive it to get coffee just to see the new car. He tells me he needs to go to his car first to grab something before I leave. I followed him outside and saw him shuffling in the back and put something in his pants pocket. At that time my other employee calls me to follow up to see what is happening and I walked back inside to talk for a few minutes. While on the phone my friend hands me the missing phone in a box not designed for phone. I confronted him and he admitted he took it. He basically said there is 2 options I can either tell the owner and get him fired or I can lie for him and he keeps his job. I fired him.

1395,Not the A-hole,"This is basically exactly what the title says. My friends and I have weekly movie nights, which are usually hosted at my place because I have a pretty sick set up if I do say so myself. There's a girl who is relatively new to our friendship group who began joining us for movie nights about six months ago. 

Here's the thing. I cannot *bare* watching movies with this chick. She always manages to talk through important scenes and she overreacts to *everything*. Emotional/sad scene? She gets genuinely hysterical, to the point we usually have to pause the movie until she calms down. Jumpscare? She screams at the top of her lungs and then ""hyperventilates"" loudly for about a minute afterwards. Funny moment? She screeches with laughter well after the joke is over and will periodically do so at various points throughout the rest of the film because she remembered the joke. She does this with both movies she's never seen and ones she's watched a million times before. Also a note, this isn't unusual for her as she is very prone to attention seeking behaviours, e.g. she's lied about having various food allergies, only to go on and eat those foods and claim she never said it, and she's confessed to acting drunker than she is on nights out because she likes everyone to think she's a fun party girl (she actually comes off very obnoxious). 

Because of this, I've basically said I don't want her to come to movie night any more if it's at my place.

The second year was still okay, because while my son was in kindergarten, he didn’t care about sharing the party with his sister and my daughter was too young to have a preference about the party place.

Now fast forward to this year. My daughter does dance and her studio does parties, she wants to have it there. My son wants to have a party at this trampoline park with a few of his friends. I think it’d be best to just split the parties. To me, I always knew the joint parties would only last so long, especially with them being so far apart in age and not being the same gender.

My wife, however, is against it. She thinks that we should just throw one big party at this other nutural venue, rather than letting them think that they can decide this. The price difference is the same (we aren't spending any more on the two parties than we would on the one) and it is their birthday. Will it be a bit tiring to do two weekends in a row, but it’s worth it for the kids.

Now, she feels that I’m working against her. I didn’t tell my kids they could have they when they asked me at separate times, just that I had to talk to their mom. I told my wife that while we shouldn’t go crazy for their birthdays, we should do stuff to make them happy and they're only gonna be little once. Finally, she got exasperated and agreed with me, but now she’s saying that I spoil the kids and that this is too stressful. I’ve offered to do all the work for the parties and all she’ll have to do is show up, but she’s still mad at me.

AITA here?

ETA: Many have asked, who normally does a lot of the work for the parties or some have assumed I don’t do anything (thanks media for the bumbling dad trope). We always share responsibilities, evenly. Not just with the party, but with the kids too. She’s not acting like this because she thinks she’s doing this alone. I’m not *that* husband.

ETA 2: So the wife and I sat down to talk, her idea. She apologized for snapping. She wasn’t sure why she got so heated herself and found out this afternoon, we’re expecting #3. Exciting news! Probably just hormones that made her upset, combined with our older ones growing up.

Me being me, I joked “you know we can’t combine it’s birthday?” And got an eye roll, but all is well. Parties will be booked tomorrow.",460,2271,0.97
1398,Everyone Sucks,"So last week was my wife's birthday, and we had a whole day to ourselves as her brother said he would watch our kid while we go out. We haven't smoked in years and she brought up the idea for us to get some weed from her step sister, let's call her Judy, and grab an Uber to the movies and a dinner after smoking. It sounded like a lot of fun, so I suggested a couple of our friends come along as well. In total there were four of us, and all of us are super lightweights since none of us had really smoked since we became adults. We asked Judy if we could buy some weed off her, about 20 dollars worth. Instead of selling us some, she decided to invite herself to smoke and rolled a big ole blunt of what she called ""some of the best shit she's ever had"". She then told us not to worry about the money and to consider it a gift. 

So later that night, we are all taking hits and passing, with myself and my wife getting baked after 2 hits, one friend of mine taking one hit and bailing and the other friend taking 3 hits. During this time, Judy decided she would take a hit in between each person's turn because she, in her words, ""didn't want to waste good weed."" We were all baked and happy and went on our way to have a great time at the movies and dinner.

The next morning, Judy shows up at the door and asks if we have the money for the weed. When my wife politely asked about her saying it was supposed to be a gift, Judy said ""I was baked out of my mind I can't afford to spot 20$ worth of weed. Plus the stuff we smoked last night was worth way more."" My wife, not wanted to start any conflict, went to her purse and grabbed a 20$. This was when I told Judy that we will not be paying her back and that she shouldn't have offered if she wasn't going to stay true to her word. She got upset and stormed off, calling me all sorts of mean things. My wife then yelled at me for being an asshole, when really I don't feel like I did anything wrong. I understand it wasn't my gift so I suppose I didn't really have a say in the matter, but it really just seemed rude and disrespectful to my wife in my eyes. AITA?",210,431,0.95

1405,No A-holes here,"Uh, considering English is my second language and I'm not the best post writer, I'll try to make this as correct and understandable as possible.

My first cousin is 14m and I'm 19f. Our families live in the same neighborhood and our parents are close friends. The two of us used to play together as kids.

Last month was the first time I saw Grindr on my cousin's phone. That's a hookup app like Tinder, but for gay guys. My college friend told me the app is 18+ only, he knows because he once got reported for using it as a 17yo.

I noticed the app when I was over at my aunt and uncle's place, and my cousin wanted to show me his score on a piano game we both play. Then when he opened the app folder I recognized the icon.

He was embarrassed, tried to hide it, said he only installed it as a joke when I asked. I ordered him to delete it because he could get in serious trouble for sexting and sending nudes. I also threatened to tell his parents. That scared him enough to get rid of the app.

Just for the record, I also told him it's completely okay to be gay or bisexual, but that he's waaaay too young for hookup apps. He denied being into boys, instead insisted that was just an inside joke with his friends.

Yesterday my cousin was trying to send me a screenshot of a text from his mom/my aunt (related to a conversation we were having) and he accidentally forwarded a clumsily taken shot showing his notification panel, and there was a push message from Grindr there.

I questioned him about that, he begged me not to tell his parents and that he was just chatting, looking for friends, he'll delete it immediately. He even sent me screenshots with the app deleted. Honestly though, I don't trust him after the last time he promised the same thing.

In your opinion WIBTA if I told his parents about this?

I'm scared my cousin could get into actual trouble if he meets an adult who might manipulate him. There's so many things that could go wrong, he's only 14yo and not even out to anyone as far as I know. His parents definitely don't know. Which is another issue because then, they'd find out he was on a gay dating app specifically.

I don't think of my aunt and uncle as homophobic people but maybe it's not my place to be revealing that regardless. I'm kind of torn.",99,230,0.95

I'll try to keep this short. 


I love my girlfriend and I love going on holiday with her. HOWEVER I've recently been asked by a friend if I want to go travelling with them for a few months. My girlfriend isn't happy because in the past she has suggested this and I haven't been keen.

The reason I'm not keen to travel with my SO is because I see travelling as more dangerous than a normal holiday, the idea is to go outside of your comfort zone and expand your experiences and I feel like if I was with my GF then I would be in a constant state of worry. I don't care for my own safety anywhere near as much as I care about hers and if anything happened to her while travelling I know I would never forgive myself, even if it wasn't directly my fault or I couldn't have prevented it.

I'm usually the one who remains calm and composed in unusual or frightening situations and TBH I like that role (it makes me feel valued) but while travelling around areas that I feel I would already be slightly anxious I think it might ruin it if I had to feel anxious for both me and her. Therefor the idea of going with a friend is more appealing.

1412,Asshole,"So my girlfriend is pissed at me and has a cooking ""strike"" because, and I quote,""if you are so much better than me at cooking you can do it yourself"".

We moved in together 6 months ago (been together for 2 before it) and we came to an agreement that she will do the cooking since she comes 2h earlier from work and I was all on board for having a hot meal ready when I come home.

The thing is she is not exactly good at it. She isnt terrible, everything she makes is edible but is far off from the standard I was used to. So, I started to give her pointers. After all she cant get better if she doesnt know that something is off. I would tell her whenever she used too little salt or too much spice, if something was a little burnt or undercooked, told her when I knew how to make the dish better next time etc. I would always eat all of it and say thank you so it was not like I was being rude about it.

The thing is that she ""snapped"" when my mother came to visit and I casually said that she could give my girlfriend some cooking advice. My girlfriend nodded and smiled and generally seemed fine in the moment but as soon as the doors closed behind my mother my girlfriend went ballistic, accused me of humiliating her and her cooking in front of my family and stormed off. Since then I apologised saying that I am sorry for giving her constructive criticism in front of my mom but it didnt calm her much and she still refuses to make anything food-related at home for me. I think she is overreacting, I never complained about her cooking or throw it out. I was just being helpful. I miss her cooking, not gonna lie, so I might as well ask here if I stepped over the line somewhere. AITA or is my girlfriend crazy?",279,638,0.91

1417,Not the A-hole,"I like to think I’m a good dad; my daughter, Manon (6 yo) seems to think so too. Earlier this year, I defeated her in a game of Mario Kart, which coincidentally happened not long after she tripped and fell in the yard, which resulted in a small bruise. I didn’t think anything of it until the director of Manon’s school summoned me for an “urgent” meeting the very next day.

In my language, the word for beating someone in a video game is the same one as beating someone up physically. As it turns out, a teacher apparently heard that I “beat” Manon, saw the bruise and assumed I hit her. When I arrived to the meeting, the director, all of Manon’s teachers, the school nurse and a social worker were there. They were like a tribunal, except they had already decided I was guilty.

The whole exchange was extremely painful for me, because they would just repeatedly say “We know you hurt Manon, confess it and we can help you,” and when I tried to clear up the situation, they’d not listen and just repeat “You have to admit you have a problem with violence.” When I suggested we just ask Manon to clear things up, they refused because “We don’t want her to relive her trauma.” I recorded part of the exchange because I was so insanely angry (the fact I was out of my mind with anger probably didn’t help my case).

Well, the police was called, I went through several interrogations by policemen and a social worker, and so did Manon. It was a whole ordeal - I wasn’t ever in danger as I was innocent, but it was a source of a lot of anxiety and it took a lot of time. Every step of the way, I tried to shield Manon from what was going on and she was just confused by the attitude of her teachers and why people asked her weird questions about her dad sometimes.

I used to be super involved with the school events, and I stopped doing that after the accusation. Even when picking up Manon after school, teachers would sometimes refuse to let her go with me and demand that her mom come instead (my wife usually works at that time and can’t pick her up). When they accepted to let Manon come home with me, I still felt judged, like teachers were convinced they were sending an innocent victim in the clutches of her abuser. That kept going even after I was completely cleared.

Well, I documented every step of the process, and at the end I submitted it all to the regional educational authority (not sure if there’s even a word for it in english) which oversees all schools in the area. I don’t know what came of it as the school year is over, but I assume I was taken at least somewhat seriously. The director tried to contact me; he sent me a couple mails asking to meet to “clear up a misunderstanding” and I have several missed calls from the school. It took all my willpower to not reply to him with “You have to admit you have a problem with wrongfully accusing innocents” - but I still wholeheartedly hope this guy will get fired. AITA for that?

Edit: Wow, this blew up. I can't reply to all these messages, so I will just address a few key things I noticed in numerous comments:

- I am NOT American. Sorry, people who keep talking about CPS and American laws, I am actually French.

- I was (still am) very emotional about the whole thing, but many comments make a good point; it is true that the school did what would have been the right thing if there had been real abuse. I am glad to know the staff cares about the kids' safety, although it really fucked me over.

- The school didn't let me take Manon home directly after the meeting, I had to talk to policemen first. They were thankfully much more willing to listen to me and things smoothed out afterward. I am mostly pissed off about the meeting itself and how I was treated/how nobody listened to me.

- The teacher didn't ""kidnap"" Manon. That's something I didn't expect to see but many comments say it. Sorry, that part was definitely exaggerated. It wasn't like the teachers completely refused to let Manon come home with me and wanted to keep her at school forever. Instead, it was a lot of suspicious looks, snide comments or just pronouncing my name with disdain, asking me several times if my wife is available to pick up Manon, and when told no, that I should *really* ask my wife to be the one to come next time. The worst instances were soon after the meeting, and it happened only a few times. The teachers would ask me to wait next to the director's office while they went inside, talked some, then came back out to ask me if I was *absolutely certain* my wife couldn't free herself to pick up Manon instead, then back in the director's office to talk some more before finally letting Manon come with me.

- After seeing so many different opinions on the matter, I think I see things more clearly, so thank you very much! I will discuss things with my wife, Manon, my local community, then I will ask for a meeting with the school again. I think I will ask for an apology letter and that the director makes it very clear to all his staff that I am innocent. I will keep you posted, Reddit! Thanks again.",445,3876,0.96

1419,Not the A-hole,"About a month prior I receive a text from my close friend inviting me to her baby shower. I pay all my own bills, work full time while being full time in college so money and time is tight but I knew this was important so I went ahead and told her I would request off work and definitely be there. A week later I went out and splurged and bought bottles, pacifiers, baby shampoo Etc. as a gift to give her at the baby shower. Anyways, about a week before the baby shower I get a text from her saying this party would actually be a gender reveal party and they were having a separate baby shower 3 weeks later that she wanted me to come to as well. Okay... I was slightly annoyed because I knew I was going to have to request off work again and buy another gift. I told her I would try my best to be there but I couldn’t make any promises. Two days before the now “gender reveal” party she texts me in a group message of people and says there’s an entry fee of $20 to the party! I was seriously blown away. I understand it takes planning and money to put together a party but it was her choice to have one. I texted her privately outside the group message and told her I didn’t have $20 extra to bring to the party, since I already got her a gift and had other bills to pay. She replied saying “Sorry girl, I can’t make just an exception for you. You promised you would be there!” I didn’t reply, and didn’t show up. She texted me a few days later informing me I was disinvited to the future baby shower and how she was appalled I couldn’t even send a message to let her know I wasn’t coming after I said I would be there.
Reddit, I understand maybe I should’ve clarified I wasn’t coming at the point. Although, she knows my situation and that I live paycheck to paycheck. I have now lost a close friend and I seriously can’t decide.. AITA?

EDIT: Wow! Just got back on Reddit and I feel so much better knowing I’m NTA. I always let people walk all over me and I felt extremely guilty considering maybe she had got goodie bags or something for me and I didn’t technically tell her I wasn’t attending.

Unfortunately I don’t have the receipt for the gifts I bought & don’t know anyone else with newborn kids,  but if anyone is in need and felt comfortable giving me there address or a PO box I would love to ship to them to you!

I have been best friends with Alyssa since college. She was there for me through a lot of my downs, including the worst breakup I have ever had. She literally cooked for me, copied class notes for me, and comforted me while I cried for almost a month. She never asked for anything in return.  

Alyssa knows my sister Dana and her boyfriend Troy. Dana is only two years older than me and we have always been very close. I have never approved of her relationship with Troy because he is a douche. A good looking douche but a douche nonetheless.

Apparently last weekend when Dana and I visited our grandparents out of state, Alyssa and Troy bumped into each other at a party. According to Alyssa she went to smoke outside and Troy followed her. They talked for a bit and he mentioned that he and Dana have broken up. They went back to the party, drank some more, and ended up kissing. One of Dana's friends saw them and confronted them. Alyssa was shocked and angry when she learned that Dana and Troy were not broken up at all. She left the party and called me to tell me what happened. 

Dana is pissed at both Troy and Alyssa. Troy for cheating on her, and Alyssa for not even confirming if what Troy said about them being broken up was true before kissing him. Dana said that just means that Alyssa has had the hots for Troy for some time. She wants me to cut Alyssa off my life because I don't need a 'friend' who goes for men who are in a relationship.

1425,Not the A-hole,"So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 5 years. Me and her family are not super close, but this is a serious relationship so sometimes I get invited to family events or I eat dinner with them (at their house or at restaurants) in which they pay. 

Now, I just graduated and started working a 4 month intern job making $20/hr (I’m 21 turning 22). Increasingly, her parents tell her that I should at least go through the gesture of offering to pay for dinner for them. They don’t expect me to pay, but they say it is impolite and they are offended that I don’t say that I am going to pay. I haven’t payed for dinner before, but I also wasn’t expected to pay before because I was a student still in university. Part of the reason I find this unreasonable is that her parents are pretty rich and own several houses, and they are always bragging and flaunting their wealth and power. On the other hand, I come from a lower middle class family and I’m working a low paying temp job. 

Now for the specific event, last weekend I was invited to have dinner with her family including her mom, dad, aunt, sister, sister’s boyfriend, and her. It was an expensive Japanese all you can eat buffet and the bill would’ve came to $250+. Am I the asshole for not offering to pay?

EDIT: They wanted me to pick up the entire tab, or at least offer to.

Double EDIT: I did not pay for my own bill. Also, this was for my girlfriend’s birthday dinner. And, they told my girlfriend this in private later, which she relayed to me...I could tell that they were unhappy about something by the end of the dinner though.

One topic in particular we talk about is bedsheets. I have told her in the past that I really like the feel of bamboo sheets and hear that they help your skin or something. They however are a bit pricy ($60-100 for a queen set) and we have perfectly good sheets at home. We have talked about this and decided that we dont have the money for them and that our current sheets (good quality silk sheets we recieved as a gift from my grandmothet) are fine. 

Well yesterday she “surprised me” with a full set of bamboo sheets that came in around $150. She decided to get a completely different colour of sheets and i really dont like them. They are bamboo so she claims they are for me, but i feel like it was just an excuse to get the colour she wants. 

I have told her that she should return them as they are expensive and we should save for the time being. She is now mad at me that i am too controlling. AITA?

I've put months into organizing this and believe me - it's gonna be a HUGE thing. Think a meadow, open bar, huge cannopy, street food trucks etc. My bf joked the party is almost like a wedding where I'm marrying myself. My only excuse is that I've never celebrated my birthday before and I'm going all out. I've also worked as a wedding planner before and know some people, so I get a few discounts ;)

Anyway: my goddaughter is usually a lovely girl. She's the daughter of a friend I've known since birth ( who is also coming to the party) and we've been very close over the years. She graduated from university a few years back and moved pretty far away for work but we've stayed in contact as best as we could.

I have always supported her, both emotionally and  financially. A few years ago we made the deal that we would try to meet up once every three to four months - sometimes we'd go explore a new city, sometimes we'd go to a spa, things like that.

Well, a year ago my goddaughter started skipping out on me. She was still asking me for money every now and then and I gladly gave it to her but I was really hoping to spend some time with her to catch up. Hopes she dashed time and time again my cancelling on me (sometimes last minute). I did my best trying to compromise, offered to drive to her city to just have a nice day in town or to even just go for lunch (which I was willing to drive almost eight hours for btw): she declined. Twice she cancelled on me just for me to find out through SM that she was ""spontaneously"" going on trips with friends. The hurtful thing about this is that we would always find dates for our meetings months in advance and if she couldn't make it, I had no problem with rescheduling. She never did that, she just cancelled.

Over the months I tried to rationalize that she was a young woman just getting started with her life and maybe just wanted to spend her time differently - but she never talked to me or her mum about it, just kept taking my money and pretended to be excited to see me, only to then cancel on me.

Last weekend was the last straw - we planned for her to drive to my town so we could go to a concert together, which she had gifted me as a christmas present last year. She never showed. Instead I heard from her mother that GD had apparently lost her wallet. GD never explained anything to me, never rescheduled.

After considering all this, I decided to shoot her a text and uninvited her from my birthday. Guess what? She immediately called me back, acting completely surprised and hurt. I told her my reasoning and she became enraged, telling me I was TA for uninviting me just because life had gotten in the way a few times. Her mother is not currently speaking to me even though she knows the entire story.

Could I have misread the situation?

&#x200B;

Edit: to make this clear! I did not uninvite her because I thought she wasn't going to show. She's been very excited to come to my party since I invited her. I uninvited her because I don't think she deserves to come to my party if she can't even give me a call to reschedule our meetings.",72,221,0.96

1430,Not the A-hole,"This is literally happening right now and I'm not sure how I feel or if I'm being an arsehole here, I'm feeling many emotions right now...

For some context, I had a university deadline last Friday, and another university application deadline this Friday.

When I moved out a few years ago my parents insisted on keeping all my college and university so they could keep it safe, I thought fair enough, they have a much bigger house and the space available to keep everything in one place and safe. Since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.

Fast forward to last month and I let my mum know that I would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. I keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. This Sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. 


Last night they let me know that they can't find anything. They've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...


Long story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks I've given them a hard time

Am I the asshole?


Edit 1: Thankyou to everyone who had commented, I will include a bit more info below as I've seen a few re-occuring comments.

1. I don't live at home, and I contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until I could get home. 

2. When at home I had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. My work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. 

3. Im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). 

4. My parents have not apologised or spoken to me since Wednesday and my deadline is today. 

5. My portfolio was planned out way before the deadline, i had the sheets on photoshop set up with all the titles and annotations, all i needed was my sketchbooks, models and larger drawings to take to a plotter (i had an appointment booked) to scan and import.",1387,13895,0.79

1433,Asshole,"My mother has tonight begun binging the third season of Stranger Things. She started at 5:30pm, the same time when I arrived home from my part time job. I was ravenously hungry and eager to make myself some dinner. 

I like Stranger Things, and I have been slowly making my way through Season 2. I asked my mum to pause the show for half an hour while I made dinner to avoid spoliers. 

I was going to make some frozen Pelmeni, essentially dumpling pasta that you boil for 10 mins, add some pasta sauce out of a jar and hey presto you've got a delicious albeit not exactly nutritious meal. 

Stranger Things was playing in the kitchen, as our living room and kitchen are all basically in one big room. Having already made her dinner and with wine glass in hand my mother refused, saying this was HER time that she's been working all day for and it takes precedent. I said I couldn't make my dinner in there avoiding spoliers, especially as the meal requires you to just wait by it, stirring occaisionally as it boils, not really a task that would consume all your concentration. 

Additionally our TV is really big and turned up really loud. I couldn't even look the opposite way from it as there are several large windows on the opposite side to the TV which clearly reflect the screen. 

I really hate spoilers, even seeing an image or a snatch of dialogue can reveal major plot points, for example the scene that was playing as we argued were of two characters in a relationship that hadn't existed in the parts of Season 2 I'd watched, now all that development is wasted for me. My mum and brother don't sympathise.  

I couldn't make dinner so now I'm just sitting here typing this out angry, resentful and hungry.

1434,Everyone Sucks,"I work at a mom and pop restaurant during my summer breaks (i’m in high school). I’ve worked there for 3 summers now, so I know the owners pretty well but we still aren’t really close. 

The owners of the restaurant went on vacation for 10 days and asked me to house sit for them. While they were gone, the restaurant was also closed since there was nobody there to run it. 

I agreed to house sit for them and the general list of things they asked me to do was:
- feed their two dogs twice a day
- feed their cat twice a day
- bring the dogs on at least one 1 hour walk each day
- give the dogs at least 2 hours of “playtime” in the gated backyard
- play with the cat for at least 30 minutes each day
- feed their bird w bird food every day, and fruit every other day
- clean up after the dogs outside
- clean the cats litter box at least every other day
- mow the front and back lawn at least once 
- water the plants inside and outside each day
- put chemicals into their pool (which I have no idea if I did correctly)
-clean the pool from leaves/sticks at least 3 times over the course of 10 days
- collect the mail
- dust the house at least twice

I did everything they asked me to do for the 10 days, even waking up at 5 am so I could drive over there every morning to feed the animals and give them “play time”before I went to my other job at 7.

They got back two days ago, and I met with them. They did a pretty thorough check (which I thought was a little rude) to see if I had actually cleaned up after the dog and cat, and cleaned the pool and house. 

They then thanked me and said they’d see me at work. I was honestly very surprised that they didn’t pay me at all. To be fair, they never explicitly told me that I’d be paid, but I just assumed that I would be paid something, maybe even just like 50-75 bucks. 

I’m sorta torn on what to do about this. I thought I was justifiably upset, but my uncle said I seemed like an ass for expecting to get paid for being a “good neighbor”. But I have never been close with the owners so I felt like it was different than if you were housesitting for a friend or neighbor. 

Now I’m not sure if I’m justified in wanting to be paid or if I’m just being entitled. So. WIBTA if I asked my bosses to be paid for housesitting while they were on vacation?",22,43,0.94

1441,Not the A-hole,"So my grandma (82F) has never been ashamed of her body I guess. At least in the home. However I (18F) can’t stand seeing naked relatives. This wouldn’t be a problem if she kept it to herself, but she’s staying with us this summer and she’s occupying my bedroom because that’s what guests use when they come over.

Obviously, since she’s in my room, I have to go in there to get my clothes, since my wardrobe is in there.  And I always knock. The thing is, even if she’s stark naked she will still say “come in”, so I will, thinking she’s decent, and I have to be subjected to that sight. It makes me so uncomfortable, and it’s almost like she enjoys it, since when I try to leave and say I’ll come back later, she keeps insisting I stay. I hate it, but I’ve only ever expressed this sentiment to my little sister, who agrees. 

The issue came to a head this morning when she left the bathroom door ajar, and thinking it was empty, went in to get my phone that I’d left in there. She was standing in there completely naked brushing her teeth, and I yelped. AGAIN I tried to leave, but she actually followed me out insisting I come and take whatever I’m looking for.

I lost my temper and told her she should shut the bathroom door, when she’s in there. All she had to say for herself was that I was “raising an alarm” and that “we’re all women”. My mum agreed, saying that I was making a big deal out of nothing, and that yelling makes her think there’s something wrong. Obviously, I disagree.

So, am I the asshole?

In particular, their chocolate truffles are apparently really famous so she wanted me to bring back a bunch. Despite this bakery being a 1hr 30 minute commute each way from where I'm staying, ofcourse I oblige to make my wife happy.

Unfortunately when I arrive they're sold out of said truffles, but still have a wide variety of chocolate goodies to choose from. Not wanting to disappoint my wife, I buy a bunch of said chocolate to bring home, way more than the truffles she originally asked for.

When I get home and explain the truffle situation, she isn't appreciative of what I brought. She says she doesn't want the chocolate and questioned whether I went to the right place, if I looked hard enough, etc etc. Honestly felt a bit fed up since I really went out of my way to get her this and she doesn't even say thanks.

Anyway to cut a long story short, since she said she didn't want the chocolate I went to my neighbors and gave it all to their daughters (9 and 11). They were really happy and it made me feel a bit better. When my wife finds out I gave away *her* chocolate she blows her lid and demands I get her some more to make it up to her.

1445,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so I own food trucks in NYC, and I rent a house in a neighborhood in Queens where I lived with my managers and I cover the rent and all the bills.

So one of my managers is from Morocco and I live with him and his wife. We’ve been through a lot together, and they’ve really become like family to me. But this has caused a bunch of tension between us and I would like to know the general consensus on the situation.

So my managers all make good money, but it’s kinda predicated on them helping keeping the ship afloat in the winter because it’s slow. 

Food trucking in NYC in the winter is tough. It gets really cold and the numbers slow down pretty significantly. However the show must go on to cover the costs of where we park/live etc.

Last December my one worker from Morocco just straight up tells me he’s leaving December 3 about a week before that. And leaves us to essentially operate at 2/3 capacity for the entire winter.

Well we didn’t hear from him for a while, so we did rebnovarions on the upstairs apartment to make it look nicer, painted, our I. New floors, and so we put a lot of stuff in the Moroccan manager’s apartment. February 14th rolls around and I get a message from the Moroccan Manager saying he was here. 

I was pretty annoyed that he didn’t communicate any of this with me. As I didn’t want his apartment to be trashed when he got back, but it was. And I wasn’t really able to plan to have all theee trucks out, so I kinda just kept the other two managers working and really didn’t hours to the Moroccan manager until I was ready.

From his perspective I am the asshole for not welcoming him with open arms and making him feel like there are stipulations with his living arrangement. From my perspective he basically dipped out on us, left us to survive the winter without his help, and then shows up without any communication and it’s a pretty huge dick move.

1448,Asshole,"Being European the whole “when and how much to tip” is a little alien to me.  One experience still plays on my mind and I’d appreciate your view.

We went into a Texan BBQ place just off Times Sq for lunch: me, my wife and young daughter. Ordered drinks, starter and main course (or whatever these are called in the US). Starter was a LARGE portion of chicken wings which we got stuck into as soon as they arrived.

When we were barely half way through the wings the waiter brought out the main course and started moving plates around on the table to find room to place it. I explained (politely) we were still eating starters and didn’t want the next course yet, would he take it away and bring it back when we’d done with the wings.  Waiter said (politely) it was ready now and he was serving it now.   I told him no, it’s going to get cold, take it away and bring it back when we’d finished the starter.

There was some to’ing and fro’ing but eventually he put it back on his tray and took it away. Few minutes later the Manager comes over to ask what our problem was. Having explained, the Manager told us that we should have said if we wanted next course delayed (which I thought was ridiculous - nobody expects the second course when you’re only half way through the first) that the kitchen had cooked it and if we wanted them to delay serving it, this food would go to waste and we’d have to wait for them to cook the food again. I said we’d wait if we had to but we’d rather have it hot when we wanted it rather than cold when they wanted to bring it out.  Manager was unhappy but walked away doing what I’d asked.

I’m a fairly low key kind of guy but my wife is much more fiery, and I could see she was about to kick off.  She was insistent we not leave a tip as this was ridiculous and we were effectively arguing with the staff when we should have been enjoying our meal.

Fast forward to our paying and leaving the restaurant (rest of the meal passed without incident). The waiter having realised I’d left no tip, had a right go at me about how he works only for tips, it’s disgusting we’re not tipping at all, it’s not his fault there were problems etc.  The guy is literally walking alongside me, talking at me with raised voice, having a go, all the way to the exit.

This has bothered me since (as have a couple of other occasions when I opted not to tip) I don’t think we were in the wrong. I realise it wasn’t the actual waiter’s fault but we didn’t get the service we expected. I realise there are some cultural expectations/norms to observe but in these circumstances WITA?

TLDR: Restaurant  policy  sucked, we were unhappy, didn’t tip the waiter - great offence was caused.

Update: Thanks, I appreciate your responses. My view was that the tip reflected the experience rather than the service - having read the various posts I realise this was a mis-step.  I also hadn’t realised the concept of “courses” to a meal is unusual in the USA (at least in a more casual eatery) and that it was the norm to bring out food according to a schedule/when it’s cooked.

1452,Asshole,"I'm a single father of a wonderful little girl & one of my nicknames for her is ""idiot"", basically when I see her I'll say ""How's my little idiot doing?"" & she'll usually respond ""I'm fine, you big dummy"". It's one of many of my cute little nicknames for her & since she takes after her father so much, it's a fitting nickname.

But recently that nickname has gotten me in hot water with her teacher, what happened was - I went to pick her up when her teacher asked to speak with me. I didn't think much of it until she told me that she heard something ""distressing"" about my girl & I was worried something was wrong or she said something wrong.

But apparently what she was upset about was that she learned that I called my daughter ""My little Idiot"", apparently in class they asked all the students ""What are your parents nicknames for you?"" & when my daughter answered the teacher didn't like it. She started lecturing me about ""uplifting my daughter"" & to ""not bring her down"" & that the lack of a mother figure might be tough on her & that I should consider that.

I was so goddamn mad that she pretty much told that I was a terrible parent & I told her that she has no business telling me how to parent my child because she doesn't know our relationship, I never had a father growing up so I try to give my daughter everything I never had & try my hardest to be the best goddamn dad I can be & to have this teacher tell me to stop bringing my daughter down both hurt & angered me.

After I calmed down me & my daughter left, when we got in the car I asked her if my nickname upset her in anyway & she told me that she loved it & thought it was funny so I felt a little better about it but still needed to calm down so we went to the movies together to see Spider-Man: FFH for the 3rd time & had fun so all good with my daughter.

But I can't help but think maybe I was in the wrong here, I'm still conflicted about what I did & need some other peoples views about this whole situation. It also has me thinking that maybe she does need a mother figure in her life.

AITA & Thank you.

**EDIT:** I wanted to thank everyone for giving your opinions on this, even if I don't agree with most of what you're saying - I still appreciate it.

Also wanted to clear some stuff up that have people confused.

**1.** My daughter wasn't in the room when I talked with the teacher so she didn't see me angry & when I said I needed to calm down just meant I was shaking a little bit. So my daughter wasn't afraid of saying 'no' to me. Also she wanted to see Spider-Man for the 3rd time.

**2.** 'Little Idiot' isn't my only nickname for her & I don't call her that ""constantly"" like some people believe, my 'main' nickname for her is **""My Little Rock""** I only call her 'little idiot' maybe once a week but she likes the name (she laughs when I call her that)

**3.** I know she's my daughter & not my buddy, I don't treat her like that - I try my best to instill good morals & that she can't call other people ""big dummies"" even though she has never tried to. I love spending time with her so I can teach her things & I go on a lot of little dates with her so we can spend time together, we play videos games & watch movies all the time, I love taking her quading so we aren't just spending all our time together inside.

**4.** **""I can't take criticism without freaking out""** that may be true but it is tough to have to hear people telling you what you're doing wrong & that they know better, especially as a single father - the amount of times people have asked me **""Is that your kid?""** or asking my daughter **""do you know this man?""** I had the police called on me when she was much younger cause apparently a single father can't take his daughter to the park without someone thinking I kidnapped her.

**5. Her mother died not too long after giving birth & the reason I love my 'little idiot' nickname for her is that her mother would always call me her big idiot when I was being silly & the reason my girl is my little rock is because without her I wouldn't be here - her mothers death took a huge toll on me (still does) I cry a lot knowing that she never got to see her daughter walk her first step or hear her first words, she'll never get to see daughter grow into the wonderful young woman I know she will be, she reminds me so much of her mom it hurts me (same hair color, same eyes & same cute nose)**

**And to all the people thinking/messaged me that I'm a bad father or an abusive dad. You don't know our relationship, you don't know how much time we spend together, a little dumb nickname isn't going to hurt my little girl. She's stronger than that - I know she is because her mother was the strongest woman I ever knew & there is no way that wasn't passed on to her.**

So I (19m) live with my SO at a 3 bedroom house. I pay for everything and I make enough to afford a few luxuries. My dad called and asked if he and my mom with my 2 sisters could stay at my place since he was laid off. 

I agreed and since then I’ve laid down house rules. Keep the house clean (dishes rooms and overall keep a good appearance) and my older sisters boyfriend can’t come over under any circumstances. 

The problem is my older sister (16) she’s so rude to my SO and doesn’t help out at all. So tonight I got everyone dinner and whatknot and told my sister to do the dishes. She scoffs and said why can’t your SO do the dishes. I replied that I told her to do it and SO does her fair share around the house. 

Anyway I come back after half and hour and the dishes aren’t done and she’s instead playin on her phone. I shut off her connection to the WiFi and tell her she can’t use it for a week and to do the dishes. 

She shouts at me you aren’t my dad. I completely lost it with her that she doesn’t pay bills and I’m the only reason why she’s staying afloat. My dad is like chill out so I cool it and demand an apology to me and my SO for her behavior.

1457,Everyone Sucks,"The situation all started when my sister wanted to go to Europe once she graduated college. She calls me in October to see if I would be down and of course without thinking I responded with an emphatic “fuck yaaaa” not expecting a shit storm to ensue with my GF. We initially planned to go in May but we ended up leaving on December 31st on New Years(which happens to be my gfs favorite holiday). My best friend ended up just tagging along which pissed her off even more. 

I initially invited my girlfriend to come along too but she had to work and didn’t want to use all her paid time off. At first she wasn’t mad but as the trip grew closer she became angry and resentful I was spending all this cash on a trip without her. For two weeks I heard “ I can’t believe you are going on the most romantic trip of all time with your sister and friend, your sick” or “ you’re an asshole”. So to avoid her wrath I told her I was not going anymore which was a complete lie and in hind sight a mistake. 

The day of New Years she suggests we go out to dinner and I drop the bomb that I actually am going to Europe and I explained that I lied to her because I did t want to hear her complain about something she initially said was ok. Lying was wrong but I seriously couldn’t handle the bullshit anymore. 

The trip was amazing and fun, and my girlfriend hates my friend and sister because of the trip. But am I truly the asshole for wanting to go to Europe?

TDLR: I went to Europe without my girlfriend. She got mad so I told her I wasn’t going but in actuality had fully planned on going which I did and had a ducking blast. 

Edit: I broke up with her shortly after due to the strain the trip had on her with my sister. My sister is dope and had no part in my decision to lie.",41,77,0.94

1459,Asshole,"I always prefer the innermost cubicle at the corner whenever I use public toilet, as it is usually the least used and cleanest. So there was a day I was doing my business in the cubicle when someone banged on the door.

It was a little girl, probably 5 of 6, calling me to get out as she wanted to use the smallest cubicle. I ignored her and continued my business, the toilet was not crowded and she could very well used any other cubicle.

The girl started poking a small pink umbrella(one that cannot fold) from under the door while she continued to call me to get out. She also tried to crouch down and peep under the door, which is really annoying and rude. Give a person some privacy!

I snatched her umbrella from under the door when she tried to poke again and threw it overhead to cubicle next to me. The girl then started screaming and crying. I exited the toilet just as another woman, who seemed to be her mother, rushed in, probably hearing the commotion. The girl was still crying inside as I grabbed my husband and walked off.

1464,Not the A-hole,"I went on a date recently with a guy, we'll call him Jeff. He's likeable enough, but I know I'm not going to pursue a relationship with him--especially after this date in particular. 

So we planned on going to the movies, but we had some time to kill before the show actually started so I suggested going for Starbucks. I order the same thing I always get. Jeff says he doesn't want anything. Cool. There's a lot of people ahead of me waiting for their orders so it takes about 15 mins before I get mine. The minute I collect my drink, Jeff goes ""oh actually I think I want something"". Now I'm not one to anger easily, but that shit is a serious pet peeve. We then had to go to the end of the line to wait another 10-15 mins just for Jeff to place his order, then wait another 15 mins for him to collect it. It wasn't a huge deal then since we had time to spare, but I'd wanted to do some quick shopping (the cinema is inside of a mall) before the show started. 

Anyway, we get our drinks and just talk shit for whatever time we've got left before the movie. We go in a little early to get food and some good seats, and Jeff does the same BS from before when we get to the concession stand too. Okay fine, I tell him he can wait in line and order his stuff for himself but I want to go and at least get us good seats. He whines about needing help holding his food when he gets it (mind you, I'm already wrangling my own tray of food as well as my bag and sweater) so I stay for about 2 mins and then leave to go to the bathroom. He's whining the entire time when I get back about how long I made him wait. We finally get inside the cinema--thank god we were some of the first people in there. He tells me to pick seats (this is important), so I choose ones in the center, not too close to the screen but not all the way in the back either. Jeff bitches for 5 mins straight about how he wanted to sit in the back or off to the side instead. Then he gets all pouty and keeps sighing loudly every 2 seconds. And then he starts bitching about the people talking behind us (the movie hasn't even started yet at this point btw).

What really annoyed me though was halfway through the movie, he starts taking off his hoodie. I figure he's prob feeling warm, because I was definitely a bit warm myself. All of a sudden he practically grabs me and tries wrapping his hoodie around me. I flip. I push him away--hard--and say very loudly ""don't touch me, I'm not cold"". It wouldn't have been a big deal if he'd asked beforehand; I don't like people touching me and I've told Jeff this numerous times before. I don't care if he thought it was a ""romantic"" gesture, it annoyed the hell out of me.

Fast forward a couple hours and Jeff texts me asking why I ""acted selfishly"" the entire day and telling me how I ""ruined"" our date. I told him he was being annoying and that I was irritated, not ""selfish"". He said I needed to learn tolerance and that he was just trying to make sure we both had a good time. I left his text on read. AITA here?


EDIT: Thank god I'm not the only one who thinks Jeff is an ass! Also sorry for not replying to your comments guys, I pretty much went to bed after I posted this.

Also, it's not that Jeff didn't wanna pay for my stuff. We each bought our own thing at Starbucks but for the movie we agreed that Jeff would buy the tickets and I would buy the food.

1467,Not the A-hole,"I live with a guy I have known for several years. He is currently unemployed and doing some charity work, while I work night shift in an office.

About a month ago he came to me saying he'd been offered to look after a dog for a week and he's getting paid for it, he asked if that would be OK with me because of my working hours. My friend has been struggling since he lost his job, and I've been worried about his mental state due to this. So while it was sort of an inconvenience to me (dog woke me up a few times) I said I was fine with that, because I knew he loved dogs and I thought it would be good for him. I made it clear that it would be him looking after the dog himself though because I wasn't interested.

The dog is nice enough, and other than the few occasions of him waking me up on a morning, it didn't really cause many issues. It needs some training but he is friendly. 

So after 2 weeks I realised the dog hadn't gone home, and I asked my roommate why the dog was still here. He told me that the owner no longer wanted him because of his behavior and had offered him to keep it otherwise she was giving the dog away. I told him if he wanted to keep the dog that's his choice, I wouldn't mind. I'd also been speaking to a neighbour of ours who told me how much happier he'd been since he got the dog, which was what I expected, so I never even considered saying no.

With the fact that I'm working and he's unemployed, the last few months I've been paying most of the bills and utilities. For someone with a full time job the money I have left after paying bills is not that much in all honesty. 

Today, before I went to work he came and asked me when I would be contributing towards the dog because I haven't paid a penny for him yet. I told him that I never wanted a dog, he wanted a dog and I wasn't going to say no to that. I also told him that since he got the dog, I have never once been left alone with him because it's not my dog. I reminded I told him originally that the dog would be his responsibility, not mine. He threw a fit saying he would never gotten the dog if he knew that because he couldn't afford it. I told him I would be happy to borrow him some money for the dog, but since the dog his, not mine, I'd fully expect it back.

He stormed out with the dog, I went to work. Next thing I know I'm getting messages from my friends saying how much of an asshole I'm being by agreeing to take a dog in then not wanting to contribute towards it. I tried to explain, but god knows what he has told them.

1469,No A-holes here,"I had a Bumble date Saturday, we met up and went dancing and  had some drinks and she invited me back to her place.

We go back and start making out and that’s when I realize I may be in for a bad time. It’s the worst kissing I’ve ever encountered and she is 100% aggressive tongue, it’s like she’s trying to constantly reach my uvula. It’s so bad I start kissing down her neck to get a break. Now I’m an idiot/asshole here for not just calling it a night, but I wasn’t thinking with the right head. And we wound up going to third base. When it was my turn to receive it was the easily worst bj I’ve ever received, all I’ll say is the worst kind of teeth scraping I’ve ever encountered over and over. It was so uncomfortable I wound up just getting a hand job because she just would not listen to my encouragement to use less teeth, etc.

The next morning I texted her and told her I appreciated going out with her, but I just don’t think we are compatible and I hope her the best finding a good match. She said ok and I thought that was it.

Well today she texted me again asking why I thought we aren’t compatible. The main reason for me is she was just bad at everything physical and it wasn’t that enjoyable for me.

WIBTA if I tell her honestly that the physical stuff was terrible, instead of making up bs about “we want different things” or some other vague lie?

Edit: If I told her I definitely wouldn’t use the word terrible, more along the lines of “maybe take it easy with the tongue, try different things while kissing and slow down a bit” and encourage her to listen when she is causing pain to penises with her teeth.",50,115,0.94
1470,Asshole,"This is a two-parter, so it might get a little long. I (35M) broke up with my girlfriend ""Beth"" (30F) of a year and a half about a month ago. We lived together in a tight-knit community house before we started dating and we're continuing to live together (separate bedrooms) for the foreseeable future. Our relationship was kind and loving until the end and I care about her deeply, but I don't think we're right for each other for two reasons.

1. She doesn't fit in with my family - my parents are very strict and conservative. If I came home with a rainbow-haired atheist vegetarian social worker like Beth, they would disown me, so I never introduced her to them. My mom has been the cause of multiple breakups in my life and I didn't want to put Beth through that. Beth didn't push it, but she asked enough that I know it bothered her.
2. Sexual incompatibility - she's a lot kinkier than me and has a higher sex drive. I went through something traumatic that left me wary of any sort of sex that could be misconstrued. I'm not even comfortable spanking girls in bed. I told her I would try, but in the moment I just couldn't.

I agreed to go to an event that involved her kinks, but a couple weeks beforehand my parents insisted that I go to my second cousin's high school graduation party that same weekend and I obviously couldn't bring Beth. She told me she was upset that I canceled something important to her because of my parents, but I think family comes first. It turned into our first real fight, and I broke up with her. This situation just perfectly highlighted our issues and I didn't think it was fair to her.

I think I did what's best. I'm not the right person for her and it's better that we face that now. She said that I'm breaking up with her because I'm a coward who'd rather run away than go to therapy to deal with my ""issues.""

She was pissed for a couple days, but came around pretty quick. We were having normal conversations again within the week. Our house is very tight-knit and affectionate, so it wasn't long before I was treating her like all of the other roommates. We cuddled at a party, held hands occasionally, fell asleep in the same bed on movie night with our roommates. Again, this is totally normal in our house and done platonically with other roommates all the time. She told me today that we need to set serious boundaries because I was being ""unfair"" to her by treating her like everyone else and I don't have the right to express genuine affection for her anymore. My best friend (who lives with us and is close with Beth) said that this whole situation has made her think a lot less of me. I think Beth has been badmouthing me to her because, yeah breakups suck and I hate that I hurt her, but I really don't think I did anything that bad.

So am I the asshole for breaking up with her the way I did? Or for treating her like normal?",20,34,0.82
1471,Not the A-hole,"I am an overweight mid-30s woman.  I enjoy being nude outside, not for sexual reasons, but like an old hippie. I live in a city apartment so cannot go nude outside. I go home to my parent's lake house 2-3 times a year, and if my family and their direct neighbors are not home, I will usually go outside naked starting around dusk, having a nice naked bonfire or sitting on the dock in the dark.  My parents are aware that I do this and have no issue with it - and I warn them if the deer-sighting camera goes off unexpectedly so they can delete the evidence.

Today, however, it was just a beautiful day out and I wanted to do some sunbathing.  I'm usually home in the cooler months so can't partake in this.  I brought a chair and a book out to the firepit, lit a fire, and reclined in the sun.  The house is on a semi-private lake (public boat access, no public beaches, no-wake rule so only fishing boats really) and is located in a small bay.  There are 4 houses in the bay; ours is the third one in.  There are only two spots in the yard you can really see the lake right now because of the trees - directly off the dock, and a clearing about 6 feet wide that points out to the main lake.  The bay is shallow and full of weeds; in 10 years, I've only ever seen one person fishing in it.  The area across from the houses is marshy and uninhabited.  The clearing is small enough and the bay is remote enough that I assumed people wouldn't see me - you're usually not looking onto the shore when you're fishing.  

I guess I was wrong though!  When I went to set up my fire, I noticed I could see a fishing boat through the clearing, and I know the ""if you can see them, they can see you"" line of thought, so I got my fire and everything ready with my towel still on, and didn't remove it until I was reclined in the chair, with my back directly towards the clearing so minimal visual access.  At that time the boat was no longer there.  About 20 minutes later, I heard a motor and looked, and the same boat was back in the clearing - far enough out that I couldn't see faces but close enough that I could tell there were 2 middle-age men in the boat.  I drifted back to sleep.  A short time later, I heard the 'klunk' of something hitting my dock, so I sat up confused and grabbed my towel.  

It was the same fishing boat, who had motored over to yell at me.  They said it was illegal for me to be naked outside; I said no, I'm on my own private property, and our state doesn't have rules against it anyway.  They said they found it distracting while they were fishing, I said sorry but that's not my fault, and they said they were going to report me to the DNR for interfering with their fishing.  I shrugged and said sorry, hope you have a better day, and out of politeness gathered my things and went inside.  They boated away and I haven't seen them on the lake since.

I don't feel I did anything wrong, and I tried to be respectful (covered when walking around, faced my chair away from the lake), but AITA for being naked outside today?",128,546,0.93
1472,Everyone Sucks,"Right, so took my girlfriend to go see Toy Story 4 today. She's been excited for weeks about this, and I knew she wasn't going have many days off until it was out of circulation. So, we get tickets, and sit down. And we sit next to a father, and two girls, had to be about 6-8.

All through the movie, the kids are bouncing around and talking the whole time. And I can tell my girlfriend is getting pissed. I'm getting annoyed, too, but I recognize they're just kids. They don't know better; they're dad, on the other hand, is a different story. My dad would have pulled my ass out of the theater, and basically told me to cut the shit, or we were going home.

I looked over to their dad, and he was on his phone. Which absolutely infuriated me. Kids talking during the movie is one thing, but a father basically doing nothing to stop it gets to me. Keep in mind, the two girls were actually sitting next to me, so the father was two seats away. So I ask the father to get off his phone. He gives me a look, but puts the phone away. For about a half hour. Again, not saying anything to the kids, as they legitimately talked through the entire movie. I actually get up to tell an usher, but of course no one actually does anything.

Movie is over, and I'm livid. Mainly because I can tell this really affected my girlfriend's experience. The family is leaving, and of course, they leave their shit in their seat. So I just say, as he's leaving, ""yep, of course you're not going to clean up after yourself."" Guy pretends he isn't listening, so I just say, "" Pretty awful parenting you're doing there.""

The guy turns around, and basically says that it's been a long week, and he just wanted his daughters to see the movie. Separation, he has the kids all week this week, and all that jazz. So, I say, ""yeah, and you're sharing this theater with other people. Going to a movie doesn't mean you get to be a shitty parent. I guess we're just lucky you didn't take the kids swimming, right?""

That's when the guy proceeds to tell me to go fuck myself, and leaves with his daughter. And yeah, a good part of me feels like an asshole now. Maybe I should have just let bygones be bygones.

1473,Not the A-hole,"My parents had two children before me.  They only wanted two children (an ""ideal family with a boy and girl""), but they became pregnant with me unexpectedly.

&#x200B;

The story my mom told several times was that she was scheduled for a tubal ligation (this was in 1975), but arrived at the appointment certain that she was already pregnant (with me). She claims she told medical staff who was prepping the tubal that she ""swears she's pregnant."" According to my mom, a nurse or doctor (don't recall which) said so non-nonchalantly that they ""can just abort it at the time of the tubal.""  My gut feeling is that she wants to be remembered as a hero who saved my life. I have serious doubts about that.

&#x200B;

First of all, I think if she felt she was pregnant and wanted to keep me, why not cancel the appointment before? Second, if she waited until the appointment, why would someone automatically assume that she would want an abortion, at that moment, despite going in for a tubal ligation?  Third, couldn't she have gone ahead with the tubal even though she was pregnant?

&#x200B;

After some serious thought digging and putting clues together, I believe my dad coerced my mom to get an abortion, but at the last second, she chickened out.

Here's my evidence:

\-My mom frequently told me on my birthday and sometimes on Christmas that I was a ""mistake"" and ""accident"" and never a ""surprise."" She also lamented how my parents had to get a bigger house, car, more furniture, food, etc. because of my existence.

\-My dad told me several times that the family was great until ""\[I\] came along.""

&#x200B;

\-He did the bare minimum of being a father to me: food, clothing, shelter, etc.

&#x200B;

\-I was often criticized for upsetting my special needs older sister, when I did absolutely nothing to her.

There are many other things I could post here, but for my own sanity, I'm wondering if IATA for confronting them? They are big on keeping up appearances, so they could lie and/or be so angry that I would suggest/bring up such a thing. Or simply not even remember.

We were at the park earlier today and my 3 year old needed to go potty #2, so we rushed to the public restroom closest to us which ended up being occupied. We waited outside about five minutes and my son kept saying he couldn't hold it anymore, so we ran over to the public restroom on the other side of the park. Got there and it's shut down for whatever reason. We were on our way back to the first restroom when my son began crying that he was going to go. I kind of panicked and made an executive decision to have him potty behind the bushes by the park trail. These shrubs are grouped close enough together that you can't see anything behind them. He dropped a deuce without incident, and then I took my kids to the restroom (which was finally available) to clean my son up. I also got a plastic bag from my car and went back to the bushes to pick up after him.

When we got there, there were two women investigating the area that my son had used. They said they saw us going behind the bushes and leaving and that it looked suspicious to them so they went and checked it out. I explained what had happened, told them I was there to pick up my kid's poop, and apologized that they had to see it. As I was bagging it up, one of the women told me she thought that allowing my son to potty outside at a family park was inappropriate and that we should leave. I was taken aback at first, but then I quickly responded, ""I don't think that's necessary."" I left them after that and went over to the playground to throw away the bag and have my kids play for a bit.

About half an hour later, a cop pulls up in the parking lot and I see him talking to the two women that I had run into earlier. It was obvious that the conversation was about me, as I could see them pointing in my direction. Finally the officer comes over to speak to me and get my side of the story. Long story short, the officer said I didn't do anything wrong but advised that I should leave to avoid further problems. I told him we weren't bothering anyone and if the women were that disturbed then they could leave. He went back and forth between us for another 15 minutes and finally I decided it wasn't worth the headache so we left.

I was just telling my sister about these miserable women at the park who had nothing better to do today, and she kind of gave me a strange look.

My husband tried to pressure me to abort, but I told him no. It was earlier than planned, but it was okay. That was when he told me that he didn’t want kids and because I didn’t care either way, he didn’t think it’d be a huge deal. I told him I didn’t want to get rid of the baby. This ended our marriage. I had my son and have raised him alone.

Now, my ex is not a complete deadbeat. He does pay very generous child support and has set up a college fund for my son, so he won’t have to worry about it, more than the courts would demand. He just doesn’t see him. My son is now 7 years old. During this time, however, I have allowed my ex-mother-in-law to stay in contact because I believe it’s important. I don’t have my parents in my life (their choice) and I wanted my son to have at least one grandparent. She sees him often and is a good grandma, if a bit pushy, but never much to write home about.

She never had much to say about her son not being in her grandson’s life. I don’t bring it up and I certainly don’t bash her son, as I think that’d be rude. She normally didn’t discuss it. However, over the past several months, she’s brought up bringing my son to visit his biological father. I ask if my ex has asked about him and she says no, but it’s about time they reconnect. I say that it’s a bad idea and that he’s chosen to walk out of his life. If he chooses to come back in, then myself and my ex can discuss it. But until then, it’s off the table. Still, this becomes a topic every few months.

My ex moved out of the state I live in when my son was 3 months old. Ex-MIL goes to visit him a few times a year, he never comes to her. Recently, Ex-MIL asked about bringing my son on a trip with her. I asked whereabouts and wouldn’t you know it…it’s the state where my ex lived. And this is normally around one of the times she goes to see him. I told her once again, no. This is a terrible idea, he doesn’t want to see him, and to just let it go.

Ex-MIL told me that I needed to think about my son (I always do) and that maybe my ex was ready. I asked again, has he said he is and she said no, but “To be fair, no one’s asking him this either.”

At that point, I asked her to please leave and told her there would be no trip. She told me at one point, my son would resent me and that I should get it, because my parents have nothing to do with me. That stung, because I really struggle with all of this. I wish he had his dad around, but I know my ex. He hasn’t made an attempt in 7 years. His mom won’t make a difference.

Am I being difficult here?",22,35,0.92
1483,Not the A-hole,"This situation started when someone I know was at a local grocery store that had a mom cat and kittens. The people who worked there offered her a kitten, so she accepted and took the kitten home. 

The kitten was about 4 weeks old at this point, and much too small to be away from it’s mom. The person only fed it dry kibble at first, and didn’t take it to the vet, even after I suggested 4-5 different options for low cost clinics in our area. 

Two weeks in, the cat still had not been to a vet (but was given occasional wet food). 

This cats health seemed to decline and the girl got red bumps all over her skin, so she gave the cat to another acquaintance as there are two small children in her home. They assumed it had fleas. The acquaintance’s housemates didn’t want it inside the house, so they put it in a cage outside. For three days. In the south, where it’s been above 95F for the last week. 

I heard about this yesterday and contacted her to tell her I would take the cat and to bring it to my house. It was incredibly dehydrated and very hungry. Today, I took it to the vet. It has a variety of health problems, including worms and incredibly bad mange, but not fleas. It’s malnourished and needs supplements. It weighs 1.3 lbs. It cost only $58 with the exam and all the medications it needs. I’m going to nurse this cat back to health - the question is what to do with it after. 

My girlfriend thinks I should return it to the girl and the acquaintance for them to care for it once it’s healthy. She says this will be a lesson to them and they seem to grasp the seriousness of how badly they went wrong. She also thinks that it’ll be fine because taking care of a healthy cat is easy. However, I think there was just such an awful string of lack of judgement (and lack of ability to search for help/answers/generally problem solve) that they can’t be trusted to care for the cat appropriately. I also think my investment, financially, emotionally and time-wise in helping this cat gives me considerable say here in what happens.

I would like to find the cat a different, capable home and tell the original owners that I’m sorry but I wasn’t comfortable with giving the cat back to them. WIBTA?",33,54,0.95
1484,Not the A-hole,"I work for a US business chain and mostly handle advertising and marketing for our company. I work in a large Midwest city and when it's nice out I either walk or bike to work. 

I am an avid shoe collector as well. I collect mostly Nike basketball shoes and like wearing them to work. I pair it with my tie and normally get compliments on my outfit. I wear slim fitted suits and think the kicks go well with the suits I wear. My boss has never complained and it has sort of became my style. 

Today I was having lunch with a few work friends and two people who started with our company about a month ago. One of them asked me if the basketball shoes were just a summer thing since she saw me biking. When I told her that I wear this year round she asked how old I was. I told her my age (26) and she made a comment about how young people just don't have the same respect for themselves or others as they used to. I asked her to clarify and she said people in her day (shes 38 so not much older) dressed for the job they wanted, not the job they had and how putting very little effort into my outfit showed that I don't care enough about the job to look together or presentable. 

We argued for a little. She talked about how women would never get to do that and I mentioned how women got to wear dresses that came down to their knees in the summer but guys still had to wear suits. We ended the discussion with an ""agree to disagree"" and went our separate ways after an awkward and silent lunch. 

It made me wonder if I am the asshole. As a black man I think a lot about how I dress and what I present to the world so her saying that I dress without any forethought bugged me. I put a lot of thought into what I wear. I prefer basketball shoes to dress shoes but that doesn't mean I don't care about my clothes. Am I wrong? Is my style of dress disrespectful in nature?",41,25,0.85
1485,Asshole,"This happened to my dad (the potential asshole) and my sister (S: the 11yo who got left behind) around 10 years ago. I was 17. I’m a bit fuzzy on some details but I’ll try to be concise and accurate.

Our parents were in the process of separating. Mum, S and I flew to Beijing and spent a few weeks with mum’s family. S disliked our trips to China; her Chinese is weak and she can be very withdrawn. Dad had been invited to a conference in Tibet and took the opportunity to bring me and S.

All arrangements were done by a lady who helped organise the conference (CL). We were there about a week, but left the trip early because Dad had a really important meeting he couldn’t miss that was in London in 4 days’ time. His flight from Beijing to London was in 2 days’ time. Mine and S’s was with mum later.

When we got to the airport, we learned there were problems with flights, and somehow only my sister’s plane ticket was no longer valid. Dad spoke with CL who didn’t know how this happened, but she said we should go and she would wait day and night to get the first available ticket so S could fly to Beijing asap.

S was in full panic mode, hyperventilating, tears streaming down her face. I offered her my plane ticket, but they were non-transferrable. I offered to stay behind so S didn’t have to be alone, but getting two tickets back to Beijing on the same plane would be nearly impossible, plus it would cost more and take longer when I had a perfectly good plane ticket to use now.

Dad decided we should get on the plane and left S in the care of the conference organisers. They assured us they would look after her and it would be 1-2 days max to get her on a plane back to us.

Walking away from her sobbing and terrified was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

Dad told mum she went *apeshit*. Mum told every available family member (who sided with her, obviously). The next 24h were a flurry of angry and anxious communication. Dad had to prepare to fly back to London and didn’t stay with us.

S stayed one night and the organisers got her a flight out the next day. The flight was to another Chinese city with a connecting flight to Beijing. The airline was made aware and flight attendants looked after her the whole time. She was back with me and my mum ~30hrs after we’d left her in Tibet. Dad got on his London flight while she was still in transit, and learned she was safe after he landed.

Mum was mad for months after this event, saying she would never let dad look after us again. I had a conversation with my sister when she was around 20 and she said, “I don’t really have any warm feelings towards our dad. I still haven’t forgiven him for leaving me in Tibet.”

So, what’d you reckon Reddit? Was my dad the asshole for leaving my 11yo sister in Tibet?

**EDIT:** Adding this in because I feel it’s important context, had to cut it because of the character limit.

This was no normal “flight mishap”. When we arrived at the airport we learned that all flights in and out of Tibet had been grounded (by the Chinese government) for the whole of July. It was now August, but the airlines were trying to make up for a backlog passengers trying to get in and out of Tibet, so everything was chaos. **There were no tickets for flights out of Tibet for the next 50 days.**

In order to get my sis on a flight out of Tibet, someone had to wait by the counters at the airport 24/7 alongside a *shitload* of other people to try and snap up any seat on any plane the moment one became available due to a cancellation / no-show. It was a complete free-for-all (Chinese people don’t really do queuing) so it came down to who had the loudest voice and deepest pockets.

If dad or I had stayed, it would’ve been nearly impossible to get two seats on the same plane. So we would have had to travel back separately anyway.

**EDIT2:** We are not white. We are Chinese. Growing up, we visited China once every 1-3 years to see family. My sister also could speak Chinese, just not fluently, but she was definitely conversational.

Of course I fully accept that my dad was a complete asshole for what he did, no doubt. I have recalibrated what my expectations should be for good parenting. I’m also seriously considering that maybe I was an asshole too (less than my dad) because maybe as a 17yo I should have gone against my dad and kicked off? It really felt like at the time that would’ve made stuff worse, but it might have been the right thing to do.

If you see me in the comments “defending” my dad or clarifying things, it doesn’t mean that I don’t think he is an asshole. I am just interested in exploring externalities to find where people’s moral lines in the sand are. Sorry if that puts your knickers in a twist.

**EDIT3:** (last one) S was not left alone with no adult, or with complete strangers. The conference organisers were colleagues my dad has worked with before - not super close like they had worked together for years, but they had done some research together. We had just spent a week together with some 30-40 people, including the conference organisers (about 5, Chinese based in Tibet) and about 10 English-speaking attendees from around the world: America, Germany, etc. There was a really friendly German man who had been very nice to us the whole week.

My sister was left at the airport with one of the conference organisers, who took her back to the hotel where everyone else was staying, and she saw the German guy who asked her “what happened, how come you’re still here?” and she promptly burst into tears. They (the English speakers + conference organisers) calmed her down, stayed with her, and tried to make her feel comfortable and safe. She was then taken to her own private room where she could spend time and there was an adult just outside if she ever needed anyone. I think she got to play with a small dog too. The next day she was taken to the airport and handed over to airline staff who walked her through the airport onto the plane and looked after her on the plane, at the next airport for the layover, and the second flight, finally delivering her back to my mum and I waiting at the airport in Beijing.",249,395,0.9
1486,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend has a somewhat large scar on the side of her face she got a few years ago. She's got a lot of integrity and doesn't let herself be too bothered by it most of the time, but there have been times where I can tell she feels a bit sensitive about. Particularly social situations where appearance is heavily stressed. It took a LOT of coaxing to get her to accept her sister's offer to be her maid of honor last year.

She's still objectively gorgeous, and of course to me she's no less than perfect just the way she is. So it just came naturally to me to say that I think her scar is beatiful when it came up in a conversation yesterday. I was really shocked when she ended becoming really angry with me and told me that I'm an asshole for saying that, and I better not dare say it again.

I tried to apologize and calmly explain why I said it. I know her scar is something she can be sensitive about, so I didn't want to start an argument over this or anything and make her feel worse. She screamed at me to just drop it and that was the end of it.

I feel torn about this. I know she can be insecure about her scar, but I don't understand why she would get so upset at an offhanded compliment. Was it just not my place to talk about it? AITA?",22,26,0.88
1487,No A-holes here,"Hey everyone, so I’m a bit conflicted and I want some judgement on whether or not IATA.

Last Friday I ordered a cake from a family owned bakery in the area for my mother. I was told the cake would be done by Saturday afternoon, and should pick it up then. So far everything is good, I pay the full price for the cake and go about my business.

When Saturday rolls around I run into a slight medical emergency which occupies my till late after the bakery has closed. At that point I had nearly forgotten about it. Regardless, I received no call from them, so I figure I’ll simply pick up my cake Tuesday (The shop is closed Sunday and Monday).

So today I walk in and ask for my cake. The young lady goes into the back and after 15 minutes of searching they can’t find my cake anywhere. As a compromise, they offer me a display cake, which I gladly accept. 

About 10 minutes after I leave, the shop calls me and informs me of the situation. Apparently, since I was unable to pick up the cake Saturday they threw it out without telling me, which is why they were unable to find my cake. Since I took one of the cakes, the lady asks that I pay for another cake for the one I took from the display.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay for the second cake, considering both parties had a miscommunication?",36,72,0.91

You don't get to hear his side, but I am tired of people knocking on my door and trying to sell me stuff.

I just don't want them to blow up on me and be like ""Why didn't you fucking tell us?!"".

Edit: For those asking for info: They used student loans from whatever organization (s) to pay for each semester. I had a scholarship that paid a good amount for the eight semesters, but there would still be some left that they had to pay for via the loans. And then when I went into my fifth year, they had to use the loans solely to pay for my schooling since the scholarship had run out.

1491,Not the A-hole,"When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. There would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

We made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car, a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college. Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram Stories) and we decided... no.

Wife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and I said ""Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

This has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

The car is already sold, so there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that.

1492,Asshole,"Sometimes I call-in for takeaway from a local Italian place. It's in a mixed-use shopping center with a bunch of restaurants & retail on the ground level and apartments above. There's one main strip of parking that's more than half taken up with parking spots dedicated to specific shops. If nothing on the main strip is available you have to park in a garage behind the apartments and walk all the way around (about 5 minutes) to get to the shops. The Italian restaurant is at one end of the shopping center, and there are two take out only spots branded for the Italian restaurant.

I pulled into the parking lot at about the time my food was supposed to be ready. One take-out spot had a parked car and the other had a person sitting in the car with the car running and lights on. I figured she might be about to leave, since the car was running, so I circled all the way around hoping for an open, undedicated spot (which was not likely and there weren't any), and assuming she'd be gone by the time I came back around. I circled once and saw the car still parked there. The person was just sitting in the car, with the engine running, in park, lights on, and didn't appear to be doing anything. I made another loop to check if any spots had opened in the meantime, and then went back around to the garage. Walking back down from the garage she was still. Just. Sitting there. Lights on. Engine running.

It had been at least 10 minutes since I first saw her idling, so I got pretty annoyed. I knocked on her window and said ""Hey, this is a take-out only spot. I just had to circle around and then park all the way over in the garage because you're just sitting here. Thanks a lot."" To which she said ""I'm waiting for take-out."" I assumed she was lying, so I just rolled my eyes at her and went in. I waited in line and picked up my food, and as I was coming back out, I saw her walking in. We made eye contact and she sarcastically said something like ""Here to pick up my food!"" as I passed her. 

To be clear, this place does NOT have curbside service. You have to walk in, wait in line, and pay to pick up your food. The only thing I can guess is that she pulled in, called in a take-out order when she was already in the parking spot, and waited the 15-20 minutes for her food to be ready in the car with the engine running. I guess I probably shouldn't have confronted her, but by the time I'd come back around I was so frustrated to see her STILL sitting there when it had been unreasonably long.

My sister, her husband, and their 2 year old son stayed with us from Thursday through Sunday, while my husband's brother's family (him, wife, and 4 kids under 10 years) stayed at a hotel then came to our house after my sister left on Sunday through this morning. 

Having a lot of people in my house is stressful as it is, but adding all the kids to our 3 (10 and under), especially considering our different parenting styles, just makes it harder on me. Not so much my husband, he just goes with the flow.

This morning, my husband calls from work to check-in after his brother's family left our house. I start to tell him about how on his way out the door, after hugs and goodbyes, his brother told me he would like to start bringing his family to our house twice a year - they live across the country from us, this was the first time we've seen them in a decade.

I tell my husband how I responded: ""Okay.... it was good seeing you all, have a safe trip!"" Then I tell my husband about how this will never happen because I wouldn't be able to handle it. He says, ""You *could*, but..."" Then I sort of cut him off and say, ""No way, I'd honestly just leave.""

1496,Not the A-hole,"“Bob” continually oversteps my boundaries and those of other (female) coworkers. We’re billers, for context. 

He is 84 years old and calls every female “sweetheart”, “darling”, “honeybunch” and so on. The only exception is our boss (whom he calls “miss”, rather than ma’am, despite the her being married). It’s not like the South or UK where endearments are a matter of course. He doesn’t mean them that way. 

For further context:

There is an MA he calls his daughter. On his desk, he has a color picture of her in a bikini. He printed it off her Facebook. This is the second time. She also didn’t give it to him because he was on the phone with tech support begging them to let him print out one photo in color — “it’s a picture of my daughter, you see, I want to be able to look at her pretty face, I got it off the internet, she’s so pretty...”

He is a shameless sleazeball, is my meaning. Especially to the team. 

CatLover was a middle aged woman who had the lovely job of double checking Bob’s work, and they did not get along well, not in least because Bob felt any mistakes he made were to be attributed to any and everyone else. She left for personal reasons. 

Sparsibo was also middle aged, and Ukrainian. Bob would talk at her in “Russian” (see the name I gave her for why I put quotations) then ask her “What kind of Russian are you that you don’t know your own language?” He’d talk at her for upwards of half an hour, even as she would try to say she needed to get her work done. Now I’m not saying she left because he was harassing her, but I’m saying she left. 

NewGirl is around 35 and attractive. She’s taken over CatLover’s old job. She is a certified coder, but Bob asks her at every turn if she’s sure she understands, tells our boss he thinks she ought to sit with him for a couple weeks(!!!) before he goes on vacation. 

Grandma is Bob’s age and thinks he’s just such a funny guy. 

I’m the youngest on the team (22) and a conventionally attractive blonde. The kind you look at and assume doesn’t have a brain. That said, I’ve been in my position for seven months now and have proven my worth by becoming our boss’s right hand man when we were down three people for two months (Grandma was out on medical leave and CatLover and Sparsibo left at the same time). Bob refuses to call me by my name, instead exclusively by pet names, has touched my shoulders, back and neck repeatedly even though I remind him firmly each time that I don’t appreciate it, and has multiple times used his bulk to keep me from leaving my own cubicle. When I remind him not to touch me, he apologizes and says, “I like you, you’re a good girl,” but then the next day he’s right back to getting handsy. I have told my boss about this, but her hands are tied because of Bob’s best friend among the doctors and he’s so close to retiring.

1497,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway.  For background, I (31F) was born and raised in the U.S. (west coast) but my parents immigrated from a more traditional/conservative country when it comes to gender norms.  My SO (29M) is a white, middle-class Southern guy.  We've been together about a year; he spends most nights at my apartment but we don't officially live together.  I don't know if I'm TA because my SO basically blames my ""problem"" on me being raised in a more traditional culture and says my expectations aren't in line with American ways. Not in so many words, but that's the gist of it.

My SO does some things that aren't completely rude per se, if it was just between two buddies, but that I don't think are exactly polite ways to treat a girlfriend.  Some examples: He doesn't open doors for me or let me walk through doors first, usually he walks through doors first to the point of letting it almost close on my face, if he sees me carry something heavy or struggle to reach something high he doesn't offer to help, he usually walks ahead of me even if I have to struggle to keep up, if he's driving he'll get in the car first and close the door and get comfy/settled before even unlocking my door so I'm just standing outside the car for a while, when I get home from work he just nods and mumbles ""hey"" rather than give me a hug or even a smile, things like that. 

I don't think he means to be a jerk and if he were just a friend I wouldn't think too much of it, but it just comes off as rude to me since I'm his girlfriend and I feel like he should treat me more courteously than a buddy. Sometimes it's embarrassing, like last week we were leaving a restaurant and as usual he walked out the door first and it almost closed on my face because I was looking at my phone. Another couple entering the restaurant gave him a dirty look, went ""geez"" and held the door open for me themselves. I felt so humiliated.

When I tell him these things bother me and ask him if he could do things like hold the door for me, help me carry things, not walk in front of me, unlock my car door before getting comfy, etc., he accuses me of wanting to be treated like I'm ""better"" than him or put on a pedestal just because I'm a woman. I mean, he's right that I wouldn't expect those things to happen between two male friends, so I guess it is ""just because I'm a woman"" technically.

He says it's important for him to treat his partner like his equal, and wants a partner who wants that, too. He pretty much dismisses my complaint because I am from a more traditional culture so he pretty much says any gender-norm-based things that I'm accustomed to, don't apply in the US.

We realized we'd get fined pretty hard for this, so we decided to have a couple of others (who were sober, don't worry) drive over to a Home Depot and pick up some supplies (mesh, plaster, and paint) to fix the wall. My friend and two others then get to fixing the wall; by this time I had passed out on a couch.

By the morning their wall job had dried off--it was pretty impressive, I could hardly tell anything had happened--and it seemed like everything was a-ok. I fully reimbursed the people who got supplies from Home Depot for both gas and the supplies, since those expenses were my fault to begin with.

But then my friend tells me that I need to pay him and the two others that actually fixed the wall $10 each for the time they spent working. Not seeing a reason to drop $30, I refused to pay their 'service charge'. I told him I think money should be spent on professional goods and services, and because of that I don't spend money on things I can do myself. I also figured that because he rented the AirBnB, he'd want to safeguard his record by ensuring the wall was properly fixed and therefore did it himself. He said it didn't matter because I didn't do it myself, that they could've spent the time doing other things, and that I needed to reimburse them for fixing my problem.

&#x200B;

Reddit, AITA for not seeing a reason to pay their $30 fee?

EDIT:
To the people who are saying I'm the asshole for breaking the hole, I don't think that's fair--tons of people have drunken idiot stories and it's petty to pick on that, that isn't even what's at question here.
Also, I think a lot of people are failing to see the awkwardness of a friend demanding money for a favor. You're replacing a personal relationship with a commercial/transactional one, which is just weird. Imagine if your friend demanded you pay them for helping you move some furniture or something--that's not normal, you asked a friend for a favor rather than just hiring someone for a reason. It rubbed me the wrong way at the time and still does.

EDIT 2:
This being said, the overwhelming YTA response has made me realize that maybe I should take them out for beers or something. But paying them in cash is just strange.
And FYI, it's not illegal to host parties in an AirBnB. The owner even told us it was alright beforehand.",232,698,0.88

1500,Not the A-hole,"My fiancé has some family that lives on the other side of the country from us (2 cousins who are sisters, and each has her own family).  My fiancé is extremely close with Family 1, but not as close with Family 2.  The problem comes that the son of Family 2 is a terror.  He's 8 or 9 and is actually not allowed in my fiancé's parent's house.  When we visited them a few years ago, he ran up to other tables and interrupted their dinner (complete strangers!), and the parents would find him, bring him back, and then let him run off again to do the same thing.  Then, he was completely climbing all over me (like had his legs/feet in my face and was over my shoulders) while  I was trying to eat dinner.  Long story short, he's a brat and everyone (including Family 1) knows it, except for his own parents- they think it's funny and don't stop it.  (Which has been a point of family drama for several years, long story).  The parents told me a story once of how this kid PUNCHED a teacher and ran out of his elementary school and down the street, and they saw nothing wrong with it and thought it was a hilarious thing to tell someone they just met.

&#x200B;

The wedding isn't for awhile, but I am so worried about him being there.  Weddings are really expensive and I want things to be nice for our friends and family, and having a totally uncontrolled child is absolutely not what I want.  Also, there are other children that will be invited and even in the wedding, so we can't really uninvite all kids.  To make it even worse, this kid has an older sister who is very sweet, so excluding him might unintentionally exclude her as well, which is not the goal here at all.  I've been trying to find a way to hint to his parents that only they should come (not inviting them is not an option) or, if worst comes to worst, straight up tell them he's not invited.  

&#x200B;

My fiancé thinks it's horrible/assholeish of me to not want this kid there and keeps saying it won't be that bad, but I don't even want to take that chance.  WIBTA if I excluded this kid from attending my wedding like I want?",67,141,0.95
1501,Not the A-hole,"I'm in a long distance relationship for now. There's been some tension and my girlfriend has been thinking I'm on the spectrum for awhile. I've never been diagnosed with autism. At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group is frankly from what I can tell very toxic. It's less a support group than a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths and can never understand emotions and never avoid hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description of me and the comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. Some of the things she goes on about is incredibly trivial, like that I usually don't fold my laundry properly. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result. I've actually gotten some books and resources to read about the issues but sometimes don't get time to read them because we have a long drawn out conversation about something she read on there, usually that we already discussed.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set a boundary of not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, especially she relies on that group for support over my behavior. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does. I've told her that it's still a hurtful thing to constantly discuss if she wants to remain in it for now, which she insists she does, and is taxing on my emotional health and making it difficult to make the changes she wants. Am I wrong for asking her to not discuss that with me?",81,97,0.89
1502,Not the A-hole,"I keep snakes as pets due to my passion for them, none of the snakes are venomous, only constrictors.  I keep the snakes in their enclosures in my room. However whenever my parents friends who have 2 kids 9(m) and 11(f) come over the mom always complains about the safety of their children. I have a rule that the kids can't go into my room because they always go through my stuff and ruin things. Their mom always talks shit to my parents like ""why do you even allow her to keep snakes"" ""those aren't pets"" ""you should throw them all away"", the dad is totally cool and even asked me a few times if he can hold the snakes. Now I have tried explaining the mom MULTIPLE TIMES that they cannot escape due to their enclosures and if they DO escape I have docile species that don't even bite and would just run away and hide because they'd be scared.
      Yesterday they came over. When I went to the bathroom the kids went in my room.  When I came out of the bathroom I found the mom looking horrified at her children being amazed by my snakes. Of course I started smiling when I saw the kids paying so much attention to the snakes and being curious, it makes me happy when people don't have the ""it's a snake so it must be bad venomous and kill me"" mentality. But the mom started yelling at me. 
     My parents came as well into my room to see what was happening. She kept yelling at me that her kids could've been in danger and how irresponsible I am. I was just looking at her like ""what the fuck? what the fuck are you smoking?"". 
     After nicely explaining to her that her kids life was NOT in danger because the snakes couldn't escape she, still yelling, started telling my parents that I need to move out and how could they live with me. At that point I snapped and I started yelling at her that when I went to the bathroom I CLOSED my door and if anyone was at fault it was she because she didn't teach her kids to respect rules and since my parents AGREED to let me have snakes in their house it shouldn't be her problem. I grew up differently, when I was told no, it was NO. When I was told you're not allowed to go in there, I wouldn't. So I expect the same from her because she always talks about how great of a parent she is (she just lets the kids do w/e they want). She just called me an asshole and ignored me. When my parents and even her husband took my part she got super pissed off, took the kids and went home. 
     I understood her concerns but she needs to understand that that is MY room and her kids shouldn't have come in there especially that my door was closed and they know the rule. However I feel bad for the kids because they are curious and want to know more about the ""worm dragons"" as they call my snakes. The dad as I said it's totally cool and would love for the kids to know more about snakes other than ""snake bad snake bit you die"" mentality their mom is teaching them.

1504,Update,"[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c3cizl/aita_i_cancelled_on_a_friend_for_a_date/)

You all helped me realize why I felt like an asshole. I was being manipulated by Agatha, and I was prioritizing a tenuous relationship that I had been conned into thinking was strong over a strong relationship that has a great amount of potential. 

I sat down with Betty, and she was happy to see that I was taking her concerns in stride, and she was thrilled when I told her my plan. The plan was to go to the party, greet Agatha and wish her well, congratulate her, and at some point, in private, tell her that her behavior towards me has been unacceptable, and I will need to take a break to reevaluate our friendship. It seemed like a good plan- Betty got to support me, and see it through; I got to have the closure I needed. 

Needless to say, that isn't what happened. It may be important to note that Betty is a person of color. Agatha and I are both white. 

We showed up at the party, and Agatha was all smiles. I introduced her to Betty, and she engaged her in a brief conversation. We stayed for about an hour.

Before I could speak with her alone, Agatha got everyone's attention. Everyone at the party was white, btw, except Betty. Agatha thanked us all for coming, and started rambling. She was talking, and talking, and the subject wandered from her award, to her tennis, to her family... and somehow, she ended up talking about how much she hates (insert race here) from (insert country here). Aka, people like Betty.

Betty is not above kicking some ass, but to my amazement, she just sat there, nodding, as everyone else in the room laughed along uncomfortably. After Agatha settled down, she gave a toast, and everyone resumed conversation. I wanted to say something- but Betty smiled, and took me to my car, and drove me home.

At home, I was actually really angry, and I sat down with Betty and yelled about all of the horrible shit Agatha has done in the past that I just forgave. It's like I was looking in a funhouse mirror version of her, not the real thing. Betty listened, and told me it was alright. I apologized a lot to her, and she told me that it wasn't my fault, and that she wanted to help me have healthier relationships from here on out.

I have cut off all contact with Agatha, after a brief message to her telling her I needed some time to myself. She hasn't tried to reach out, and I don't think she will. 

Thank you reddit people for opening my eyes. If y'all hadn't reinforced how awful Agatha's expectations were, I would have dismissed and excused her actions at the party. I'm devastated to have lost a friend, but I know in my heart that she was never really my friend- what I lost was an illusion. But, I have gained a healthy perspective.",70,661,0.96
1505,Not the A-hole,"So I live in the house I lived in with my ex before we broke up. Each time she comes to get the kids, she knocks and lets herself in.

Last night she complained that she was scared by the dog and that I needed to do something about the dog barking so loudly at her.

I replied to her by saying that she does not live in my house and therefore must wait until someone opens the door when she knocks, she should not just let herself in. I explained to her that when she enters the house without waiting for someone to open the door, she is provoking the dog.

She was not happy about this, and did the same eye-rolling/exasperated response that she did when she were together.

Am I the asshole here? Is it reasonable for me to ask her to wait until I open the door before coming in? Is it reasonable for me to blame her for provoking the dog ?

1506,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few months ago but it is still being brought up by family members. 

For my cousins (m)21st birthday he wanted to go out for a high end type of meal which I (f22) was completely fine with it’s his birthday, the problem however is I suffer with major allergies and choose not to eat meat or fish as well. 

Beforehand I’d already checked through the menu for anything suitable and there was literally one dish I could of had, however because it was something I’d never heard of/tried before that was a complete no go as trying new foods has resulted in anaphylactic shock several times so now I’m always very nervous trying anything new food wise. My sister (27) pointed out to me that they do have a kids menu and generally the foods on there are less likely to carry the same allergens, so I checked through it and I could eat like over half of the options so I thought it was sorted.

On the night when all the food starts to come over everyone started to question me to what I’d ordered as they all refer to me as a ‘difficult eater’. As soon as I’d said I’d ordered from the children’s menu my oldest cousin (f29) and my aunt and uncle (50s) starting to go off about how I’d taken the attention off my cousin on his birthday, and I’m sat there saying ‘you are the ones asking me what I’m eating and making a deal over it’. In the end I couldn’t stand the glares I was getting anymore, paid my share of the bill and went home early.

Now whenever a meal from that side of the family is organised I’m the only one that is never invited.

Edit: Wow I did not expect to get so much feedback, thank you everyone for posting this has honestly made me feel much more confident about that I made the right choice in the situation, I will definitely not be going around their house for anything to eat in the near future though.",195,949,0.93

1508,Asshole,"This one got me heated. So the backstory is that my buddy is getting married (M21). He told me previously to not tell people about the wedding because he doesn’t want a ton of people coming. So, naturally I didn’t tell any of my other friends and just invited my girlfriend. 

My girlfriend is in a sorority and had to go through a whole process to get excused from sorority recruitment for the wedding. Also she goes to school ~8hr drive away. She also ordered a dress from Australia specifically to wear. 

After this happens, I am talking to my buddy and I tell him that my girlfriend is coming and he sends me this text -“Hate to be the bearer of bad news but we aren’t able to give plus ones to anyone unless they’re like married :( if we did we’d have to add another like 100 people and we’re already maxing out the venue space. Sorry bro”

This all happened when I was pretty drunk. I kind of shrugged it off and told him jokingly that we just got married and that we will bring a thiccc donation. I didn’t want to disappoint my girlfriend after everything she has gone through to be my plus one! I plan on going and bringing my girlfriend. Would that be a dick move? Obviously I know the day isn’t about me but still I’m not trynna go alone. Its kind of silly to have a venue where plus ones aren’t allowed.

Edit: Forgot to mention this but sorority rules are very strict and would be a $500 fine to skip recruitment without an excuse

1510,Not the A-hole,"I’m a single mom of two kids, so obviously funds can be pretty tight. My ex pays child support for our minor child, but he doesn’t make much and a lot of comes down on me. My youngest is 15 years old and my oldest is 21. The latter is living at home with his girlfriend and their son who is a year and a half. They both are in college. My son had moved out when he was 18 to go to college, but he moved in when his girlfriend got pregnant, because they couldn’t afford to live alone.

My daughter has felt a bit lost in the shuffle since her nephew was born and I’ve worked hard to make sure she knows that she’s still important, that her voice is heard, etc. She gets amazing grades and works her butt off in school, which is in contrast to her brother who just kind of coasts. She has the opportunity this summer to go to a really cool academic program for a couple of weeks. It was expensive (with no financial aid), but with my ex’s help, I would’ve been able to swing it.

Until my son came to me and said that he failed two of his college classes. He said that he needed to take summer courses or he would be on academic probation, which would mean his son wouldn’t qualify for the college daycare (the only way we can afford childcare). Financial aid does not cover these courses. If I paid for them, I wouldn’t be able to pay for my daughter’s program, which isn’t at all for school credit.

I weighed the options. My son failed because he skipped classes a lot, not for his own child, but because he didn’t want to be there. I felt like it’d be rewarding bad behavior. At the same time, it’s the only way they have someone to watch the kid. My ex couldn’t help pay for the course either and he couldn’t pay for the full academic program.

In the end, I felt like I was just enabling my son and told him that he had to figure it out on his own. He got really mad and I told him to look into daycare assistance and then maybe reapply at a later date. My ex backed me up and surprisingly, so did my grandson’s mother. She said that he’s been irresponsible and needs this kick in the ass. My son has been grumbling around the house ever since and has been a jerk to his sister since then. I told her not to worry about it.

1513,Not the A-hole,"Was talking about this with my SO recently, she thinks my idea is exploitative whereas I think it's giving a steady job to people that traditionally have trouble finding work.

I'm not going to be exact with details, but my business deals with transport of corporate documents. *Very private documents.*

After reading an article about how a similar business operated abroad and an employee had Down's Syndrome but his illiteracy became his strength in the privacy business, I realized that I hadn't ever considered that avenue of data protection. What if I could guarantee clients that my own employees wouldn't read those documents, while also giving jobs to people with illiteracy? Seemed like a win-win in my book.

(This is probably important: they would be paid a full wage, equal to current workers; I think it's disgusting that [people with mental or physical disabilities can be paid less than minimum wage](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/subminimumwage). Also I don't think all people with mental disabilities are illiterate, but illiteracy is a trait I would specifically look for.)

I ran this idea by my SO and she looked kinda disgusted and said I would be exploiting people with learning disabilities. I mean...kinda? I don't know. I need an outside opinion.

So reddit, would I be the asshole for using employee's illiteracy as a selling point for my business?

EDIT: cool, so there's a general consensus that I'm NTA. I'll take that to mean I should look towards moving this idea to the next stage. Thank you all who replied, I've read every single comment.

EDIT 2: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up quite so much. There's a pattern emerging of people with similar questions and comments so here's my best attempt at responding to them:

> What happens if they learn to read? 

This is the most asked question so far. The answer is: nothing. They continue to do work, maybe their responsibilities change. Same as any other business where an employee gains a skill.

>How would you make sure they were illiterate?

I'll likely consult with an disability consultant and get referrals. It's not my duty to ""make sure"" they'd be illiterate.

>What about your current staff? Would you just fire them to be able to hire illiterate people?

My current staff are fantastic people, nobody's getting fired.

>How do you know they won't just lose the documents?

This came up a surprising amount. We have checks and balances to make sure this won't happen.

>This plan sounds terrible.

It might be! Several people have said it could easily backfire and there's a chance it might. Asking WIBTA here is my first step to gauging how ethical this is.",273,1626,0.97
1514,Not enough info,"I met a friend online a few years ago who lives on the other side of the country. We mostly had a good platonic relationship - chatted almost every day since then and had a few visits in person where we stayed with each other for a week. She usually had a serious boyfriend during that time. Recently she visited me overseas in a tropical country for a vacation, and we ended up hooking up for those \~10 days. At that time she had a casual boyfriend (who she claimed was okay with an open relationship).

I will try not to go too deep into details, but we had a lot of sex. Halfway through we stopped using protection, but I always pulled out except for maybe once. Now I know this is not an effective means of birth control, don't get me wrong - but I think it's important for the context of the story. Anyway, we kind of have a big argument on the last day before she left. Basically just us realizing it was all a fling and that we each have traits that seriously piss each other off, and would prevent a potential long term relationship that we were discussing. So we didn't talk for a few weeks, and we make up after that and go back to our usual long distance friendship.

Maybe two weeks later, she tells me she is pregnant. I honestly believe her - she sent me pictures of everything, including the ultrasound with her name and the date on it. The pregnancy timing lines up correctly, give or take a week of course. We both are on the same page about getting an early abortion (at home via the pills, not in the clinic) and I agree I will pay for it when it's done. She said it would be around \~$600, which seems about right.

However when she said it was done - I started asking her for proof, like a picture of the receipt show it was paid for and how much. She would only show me a document that says the cost/date and that it's covered under her state's abortion assistance program which allows her to defer payment for \~2 months. It was essentially a proposed plan under that program, with an empty signature spot stating she agrees to pay for it. I only got the picture of the form, it was not signed. When I tried explaining this to her, and telling her that I would send payment after she actually pays for it and I get a legit receipt - well, she totally started flipping out, and it led to increased arguments and a situation where she blocked me. We have not talked since then, but I admit I made no effort to contact her via other means like FB and other social networks.

With her involvement with several other guys and the nature of our casual relationship, me never receiving 100% confirmation the abortion happened, plus I paid for most of her expenses during the vacation after we started hooking up - Am I the asshole for refusing to send her the \~$600 right away, and still never sent her anything? In the end it's already all said and done (she clearly never kept it if she was indeed pregnant, since I've seen all her FB pics partying many months later) - but it still really continues to bug me and sometimes keeps me awake at night.

So here’s some background: I’m a college student (F) and my older sister and I have a good bit of an age difference. We also have an older brother who is older than both of us, but he is living in England currently so he is not involved in this. Throughout my childhood, my sister and i were very close and she was always there for me. Being older, she would miss out on hanging out with friends to go to my basketball games (which i played for 4 years so it was a long time) and was like a second parent. Our parents weren’t around much so she sacrificed a lot. However, she’s extremely manipulative and controlling- if i don’t follow her exact plan that she has for me, she will guilt trip me and go to extreme lengths to get me to live life her way, including giving me the silent treatment and telling her children i don’t love them.

So earlier this month before the Fourth of July, my sister was going to give birth to her 5th child. Since starting college, i stopped doing what she wanted me to do in life and me changing my major was the last straw. We lost contact for the most part. However, she asked me to watch her kids (ages from 1-6) while she gave birth. Her husband would be at taking the oldest child to a play for his birthday, and my mom could watch them but my sister wanted her to attend the birthday celebration instead. I said no because i had to study for a test and she had other options. She completely blew up at me and said that i should’ve dropped everything to help her and that i was to never see her family again.

My whole family thinks I’m TA for not helping her, even though she had another option, it just wasn’t as favorable to her because it would mean my mom couldn’t drive my BIL and the birthday boy, so they would have to Uber. AITA?",27,78,0.91
1516,Asshole,"\*\*Love reddit, finally made an account to ask this question.\*\*

This dog is a rescue dog - we'll call him McLovin.

McLovin has his issues. When we were at the no-kill shelter we wanted to find a dog that mixed well with both our current dog AND my son. They brought out a few that weren't great fits, and then we stumbled upon him. He was PERFECT. Temperament/size/etc is everything we were looking for but was at the pound for 7 months. Knowing full well we might have some issues at first, it shouldn't be anything we can't conquer.

Took him home, he apparently slept off the medication they gave him and he has been an absolute nightmare. Keep in mind that my kiddo loves him. They sleep together every night. My wife loves him, because he loves to cuddle. I on the other hand - can't fucking stand him most days. It's like taking a no-flush/no-wipe shit. Very rare, but you count it as a victory.

Issues are this:

McLovin has to eat dog shit. He doesn't like to. He HAS to. Fresh poop, old poop, soft poop, hard poop. We changed his diet some - and while more expensive - this helps (as long as you are standing there).

McLovin also has to pee. ALL THE TIME. No it's not allergies, as this is year round. Whether we leave for work or walk out to the car, he pees. I have ripped up all carpet, and laid new flooring, and he has soaked it daily for 4 years. It's down to the floor boards. It's on my walls. Yes i clean it. Yes i fucking hate it. Yes I'm going to have to rip up 'new' flooring and lay tile.

McLovin also loves to eat whatever the fuck he wants to. Leather work boots? He ate a pair of size 14 boots down to the sole. Metal hooks and all. Got metal poisoning from it. Plastic toys on the ground? Fuck em - he'll eat those too. Grass? YUP. Wood chips?? WHY THE FUCK NOT.

We've tried to ""handle"" these loving qualities by caging him when we leave or leashing him when he has to go outside. He pisses immediately inside the cage, then tries to clean it up - which he then gets sick from and pisses randomly some more. Leash it you say?? Well then this fucker won't go shit because he's sad. He won't do anything. Won't walk. Won't pee or poop until he is back inside. So we walk beside him, but then he darts away to find fresh shit. He can't even be outside when the neighbors let their dogs out, because it turns into a yelling match between the fence posts. Hates every other dog in the world - thus we can't take him anywhere.

I tried talking to my wife about finding him a new home. She's having none of it, but now i think that she is holding it against me that I fucking hate this dog. He's only 5, and i find myself driving home from work some days DREADING what i am going to have to clean up when i walk in. I don't think i can do 10 more years of this. If this were a relationship - everyone would be saying get the fuck outa there. Since this is a dog that I adopted - am i the asshole for wanting to never see him again?

\*\*Edit\*\*

Yes we have tried training. Has to be 1v1 training as he wants to attack all other dogs. He does great until the trainer leaves. Shock collars work to an extent, but you can't leave those on 24/7. Muzzles to go outside don't work as he just wants to rip them off. <--yes even with training.

Is there a point where you can realize that a dog is beyond your care and would be better off somewhere else - thus leaving you happier? I wouldn't take him to a shelter. I'd find a home for him. Would prefer it just not be my home....

Thanks for all the responses. The other dog is the most well behaved dog I've ever owned, so it is shocking to see the two extremes at once. For those that say I don't know what i'm doing and should never own a pet- trolling maybe but i think it's fair to say I'm in over my head and need some help. I've had some time to cool my jets, read through the comments, and come to the conclusion that WE need training again. I've called and made some appointments - something needs to change and i need to learn to love my dog again. Exercising the crap outa him sounds like a top priority as well. Main reason we haven't pursued it past few years is because of cost. I don't know how people afford more than a few sessions. I'll work on my attitude, knowing he is a dog with issues. Thanks redditors.",113,141,0.88

1518,Not the A-hole,"Okay so here’s the situation, my husband and I are traveling and my mother in law (MIL) and father in law (FIL) are watching our cat at their house while we are gone. It’s a long trip so he has been with them for almost 3 months. We pay for everything he needs and missed him a lot. He is an indoor/outdoor cat, mostly indoor because he likes beds and comfy couches but he also likes to frolic outside in the grass too so he can go outside if he wants. 

While we were out of town my husbands sister (SIL) and brother in law (BIL) came into town for a visit. BIL is allergic to cats, I’m not sure of the severity. He has been to our house before and we have always had a cat but I haven’t seen him around them for long periods of time. So when they picked BIL and SIL up from the airport SIL basically said that the cat had to go or they wouldn’t stay. MIL and FIL have been watching our cat for 3 months now so it wasn’t a surprise that they had him. So since MIL and FIL really wanted to spend time with SIL and her daughter (MIL and FIL’s granddaughter) and SIL basically gave the last minute ultimatum they decided to lock the cat out of the house for the duration of their stay. 

Now, I understand BIL has an allergy, and allergies suck. But no one even called us to ask if the cat would be okay stuck outside for days at a time. We were perfectly reachable by phone but they just decided to put him outside and we found out when we came back and got a message to not let the cat inside and he has to stay outside. If we had known I could have gotten my dad to take the cat because he also lives in the same town. There is also other family that do not have cats that BIL and SIL could have arranged to stay with.

So, AITA for being pretty upset at my MIL and FIL for forcing my cat outside for almost a week? AITA for also being upset that SIL and BIL expected them to get rid of him to accommodate their visit?

Edit: I think I may have been unfair to my MIL and FIL here. They love our cat very much and take very good care of him. They were in a hard spot and I think made the wrong decision in not calling us. While he was outside my MIL checked on him and petted him everyday and made sure he stayed around. I think no one really thought the visit through enough until the last minute and I was upset that SIL and BIL were okay with them putting the cat out so they could visit. They are all really wonderful people and this is not going to be a relationship ender. MIL and FIL have now apologized for not calling us when this came up.",58,97,0.89

1520,Not the A-hole,"Pretty simple scenario.  I live with a roommate (Chris).  We just moved apartments from 2 bed 1 bath to 2 bed 2 bath.  His girlfriend Kara also moved in with us.  The new apartment has 1 master bedroom with attached bathroom (2 sinks).  That is Chris and Kara’s room.  Then there is my bedroom, and one additional bathroom that is not attached to mine but is next to it.

Since we moved in, any time I refer to that bathroom as “my bathroom” he chimes in with “well, it’s not really your bathroom, it’s the community bathroom.”  Which is true to an extent. Any guest in our home, as well as myself, will be using that bathroom exclusively.  So from my perspective I feel that he should avoid using that bathroom whenever possible, as I have to clean it up after myself and all our guests, whereas only he and his girlfriend use the other bathroom and only they are the ones responsible for cleaning it.  

His perspective is that it is the common bathroom, he’s paying to live there, therefore he gets to use it.  Last night we were chillin in the main living room and he just went into my bathroom to piss.  When I said I’d prefer he didn’t do that, he said “it’s disrespectful to my girlfriend to walk through my room and potentially wake her up.”  Which is fair, I guess.  But then I went in the bathroom and there was piss on the toilet seat.  I said “it’s more disrespectful to piss on my toilet seat than it is to potentially wake up your sleeping gf”.  To which he just said “No, it’s not.”

AITA here?  I really don’t feel like I am but I’m willing to admit I’m wrong.  We had a shouting match this morning about it I just want some alternative perspectives

Me and Chris are both 20-something men from the US

EDIT:  for what it’s worth, each of us pay 1/3 of the rent equally.  Some people are saying that if they combined pay more than me they’re entitled to it, but the way I see it they are paying for access to two bathrooms and I am paying for access to one.  The fact that they share should be offset by the fact that I clean up after guests, even if they pay for 2/3rds of the bathrooms",145,487,0.96
1521,Not the A-hole,"I’ve been married for 12 years. 

Last week my husband and I went to a party with all of his friends. Throughout the evening 3 separate people made the same joke to us, “No wonder she never has sex with you.” 

Later, at home, I asked my husband if he had been talking poorly about me to his friends and mentioned the jokes. His reply? “Are you seriously mad about the truth? It’s guy talk, what am I supposed to tell people when they ask, a lie?” 

It has been 12 years, I fully admit that we have had our good and bad years as far as sex goes, but we have never gone longer than a week. I told him that I was hurt and embarrassed and asked him why he would do that to me. He stood firm in his rightness and would not back down. I then got pissed and said that the truth is not that I never have sex with him and that if he would like to see what that is like I could make it happen. We went back-and-forth for a while like that until things finally calmed down a bit.

Ultimately he admitted that he would like to have more sex, I made it clear that that is not the way to go about it, and now I am at work thinking that I should probably try harder. But shouldn’t he have to compromise as well and keep his fucking mouth shut? I still feel sick knowing that he tells everyone that we are in a sexless marriage. AITA for not understanding “guy talk”? Is it normal for men to talk like that about their wives? 

I understand that ultimately this is a relationship issue but I would like you to focus more on the guy talk issue while making a judgment please and thank you.",896,2451,0.95
1522,Asshole,"So this happened about 2 months ago. My wife calls me while I'm at work concerned that my son (18 months) was in danger from swallowing a coin as she thought he may have but didn't see him do it. I could hear him in the background playing so knew it wasn't an immediate danger and told her to wait until I get off work before she took him anywhere.

About an hour goes by and I realized that instead of going to the doctor and having to do costly x-rays that we could go to my dad's and use his metal detector to see if he actually swallowed it or not. The plan was for me to lay on a few different coins to see if they would be detected through me and, upon successful checks, see if one is in my son's gut. 

I notify her of my genius (to me) plan and she thinks I'm an ass for not wanting to go see a doctor right away. Ended up going and he did in fact swallow a nickel that we did a follow up x-ray to determine if he passed it and they never even gave me a chance to see if the metal detector would work or not. So now I'm out a couple hundred bucks and I am an asshole for wanting to use a metal detector on my son instead of the doctor.


EDIT: Thanks for all your opinions, my wife thinks this whole thing is hilarious. I get that I'm an asshole for not wanting to go to the doctor and instead try a home remedy to save a few bucks.

1523,Not the A-hole,"Hello reddit, I’m on mobile so formatting and whatnot might be weird. Forgive me for my sins.
Backstory: My parents are split up and they each have 50% custody over us 4 boys of which I am the oldest (I have 1 older brother in care of my Mom). When I am at my mom’s house, I am sometimes forced to babysit (with at least 1 day of notice) because my mom needs to go to therapies and grocery store trips. It is just my mom and my older brother is incapable of babysitting, so I have to be the one in charge. I understand why my mom wants me to babysit - she needs me to. However, when we are at our Dad’s house, he and his girlfriend (who is “good with kids”) ask me to babysit with 0 days notice there on the spot, often waking me up the moment they need to leave and dumping the small ones in my hands. I do not like this, and I have been voicing this since they’ve started doing it. Here are the problems I have with it:
1. They have me babysit twice as often as I do at my Mom’s
2. There are 2 of them, 1 of them could easily stay and watch them
3. It is usually relatively unimportant, buying weed or going to a completely different city to take care of animals (which is important, but see 4)
4. They have 3.5 days a week to do these chores themselves with no issues, and though my dad is usually working, his girlfriend has her own car, money, and is fully able to go on her own
5. It is usually full on babysitting, 5+ hours a day, making and providing meals about half the time

So what do I do? I do this incredibly often (sometimes 2+ days a week) and have voiced my opinion on it. Because the divorce was pretty intense and Dad is technically only a step-dad (has been basically my whole life), whenever I say I don’t like it he goes apeshit and accuses me of being a disloyal sun and that I don’t love him, etc.. I can only imagine what would happen if I were to refuse babysitting.

AITA for being mad at this or am I ridiculous?

1524,Not the A-hole,"SO and I are looking to get a camper, the catch is neither of our vehicles are capable of towing a potato so I pitched the idea of selling my car and getting a truck/SUV. She was all for it and since then I've started shopping around. The majority of pickup trucks aren't really something I'm interested in aesthetically and realistically we wouldn't get much use out of the truck bed.

&#x200B;

I found an SUV that was suitable for our needs and something I liked but my wife shut it down instantly. Basically every excuse in the book, it's old it's ugly. My response was I like it, I'm the one who's going to be driving it and the only time it would effect her at all is when we go camping half a dozen times a year.

&#x200B;

We've been arguing about it for a little while, I have a few other options in mind but I couldn't understand why she was adament I didn't get this specific vehicle until yesterday she drops this.

Her: Can I tell you something stupid without you judging me. (regarding the SUV)

&#x200B;

Me: Sure.

&#x200B;

Her: I don't want you to get the SUV because my friend told me you had a SUV like that in highschool and you and your ex used to have sex in it all the time.

&#x200B;

Me: ... wtf that's pretty stupid and... it's not even true.

So now she is claiming if we get said SUV every time she has to travel in it she is going to be emotionally traumatized because of some bullshit her friend made up. We've been together for 10+ years and married for 3 and this all just seems ridiculous to me.

1526,Not the A-hole,"Hey Reddit, long time lurking first time posting so excuse any typos.

So here's the situation: I love dogs. So much so that my entire career at this point is dog related. Part time at a pet store with dog grooming, part time at an abused/unadoptable pet sanctuary, volunteering at animal shelters on my days off and squeezing in dog sitting jobs in the tiniest bit of free time I have left over. Make no mistake, I love me a good puppo- despite not having one of my own because I'm still living with my parents.

So recently my mom's friend (We'll call her Lauren) asked me to look after her little chihuahua, Bonnie for the weekend, and I agreed. Thing is, that was ***five months ago***. After the weekend was up I couldn't get ahold of Lauren. In fact, no one could. I tracked down the Lauren's daughter who explained to me that her mom had *Munchausen Syndrome* and had been hopping hospitals trying to get a doctor to agree with her. What's worse, is that Bonnie wasn't Lauren's only dog. Lauren had left Bonnie's blind and deaf big brother Wilson in the yard of condemned house where he died of neglect and exposure three months ago, after the person Lauren asked to keep an eye on him stopped being able to come by to feed him.

Last week Lauren finally called me to say she was coming to pick Bonnie up on the 26th. Thing is, my family and I have fallen in love with this goofy little dog, and I don't want to give her up without knowing she's going to a good place. After some thought, I told Lauren that I'd be happy to give her dog back if she could:

\-Prove to me that she has a secured place of residence (that isn't her condemned house)

\-Prove to me that she has an income and

\-Pay me back for all the days of dog sitting, vet fees, and costs of the supplies I needed to take care of Bonnie.

That last bit is where this goes from 'I'm obviously not the asshole' to 'maybe I am?'

See, I charge on the lower end for dog sitting. About 15$ for a half an hour visit and 20$ for overnight. As of last week Bonnie has been with me for 111 days at overnight charges. That's a starting cost of 2,220$, a 500$ vet bill from when I had to get some of Bonnie's teeth pulled, and another 250$ of just general pet supplies like food, treats, poop bags ect. All together it'll be over *3,000$* by the 26th when she claims she'll come and get her dog.

When I told Lauren this she burst out in tears. Explaining to me that she needed Bonnie now that Wilson was gone. That the dog was her life, but she couldn't afford my fees. I don't doubt that Lauren loves this dog, and she's obviously not mentally well and could use a companion to keep her grounded. But at the same time I don't know how much I can trust a woman who just dumped her dogs on two unsuspecting people without a word for months on end, and had one of them die of neglect because of it.

So let me have it reddit, aita for not giving this woman's dog back until she pays me the 3 grand? Let me know if I'm being unreasonable here.

&#x200B;

Update: Holy hell this blew up. Thanks for the gold and silver to whoever gave it to me. I see a lot of things in the comments that I'd like to address though.-I was technically \*hired\* to care for Bonnie. I have text receipts of me providing her my rates and her agreeing to pay. As much as I love dogs, I am running a business here. I can't just give 109 additional days as freebies.-The girl who was taking care of Wilson was only in town for that month. After that she started driving an hour out of her way to go take care of him until she couldn't afford to do so. No neighbors wanted anything to do with Lauren or her dogs and that's why he was left to die. (I actually got doors shut in my face when I went around asking.)-I get that ITAH for even having terms of conditions for her to get her dog back. Perhaps I'm naive, but I was really hoping that maybe her losing her house and her other dog might put some sense in her head. If she did somehow come up with the money I'd still make house checks regularly to make sure Bella was in a safe environment, and would call our ASPCA animal cruelty responders if she wasn't.

Thanks for all the advice. Bonnie and I are lawyering up just in case, but I doubt she'll go to the police. She's made a lot of fake calls to them before and no longer trusts them, and I'm good friends with the sheriff in our county because I sit for his golden. (Her name is Chewie and she's a very good girl.)

1529,Everyone Sucks,"I guess where to start. This is a throwaway because I'm very active on the Airbnb sub and I don't want people to misconstrue that this is somehow a backdoor advertisement for my place. 

I'm 23, about 5 years ago I got a really nice inheritance from grandmother after years and years of probate. I am madly in love with this little ski town in Northern New Mexico so I went and bought a condo there. I use it whenever I can but to make it feasible I also put it on Airbnb. It doesn't really make me any money but I figure I'm allowing other people to pay my equity and plus I have an awesome place I can use whenever I want. 

I try to be generous with my family regarding the condo, but after  years of it being on the Airbnb market I finally had to tell people that I can't accept long term ""free"" reservations. It just happened too many times where all my friends and family would reserve big holidays or whatever months in advance and then not only would I miss out on the income from those big events, a few times they didn't even show or arrived late or left early.  (To illustrate how big a deal this is, I make 80% of my yearly income payment over about 25 days of holidays...it's a huge deal to miss out on that income). 

My sister and I are sisters for sure but we don't really get along that well. It's even more exacerbated because she blew through all of her inheritance in about two years and really doesn't have much to show for it. So my house is a major thorn in her side. In April she asked me if she could ""reserve"" my condo for 4th of July week. I told her I couldn't block it out on my Airbnb calendar but as long as no one rented it, she could use it. I even looked through my texts and I even told her when we were talking about this ""please understand that if someone rents it last minute, I have to be able to get the income."" She agreed to that. 

I thought it would be a non-issue because the place always rents well in advance for 4th of July but this year it didn't. She was supposed to drive up Saturday the 29th. On Friday the 28th I got a rental request for not only 4th of July week (at the premium price) they wanted to stay on through middle of September. This is thousands of dollars which will help me install a new hot water heater. 

I told my sister that I was sorry but the place rented last minute so I had to let it go to the paying customer. Well all hell broke loose. She screamed her head off at me saying that she had made non refundable rafting reservations, made special arrangements with her ex to get the kids that week and soured her relationship with her boss for extra vacation time. 

I told her I was really sorry but that had been part of our agreement. She said I was a stupid bitch and our agreement meant that last minute meant like week prior, not the day prior. I hung up on her because I don't need to be called names. But then I got many calls from my other siblings and mom saying that I was really screwing my sister over.

So basically 5 years ago. I decided to sell my moms camera. It was an old one (Nikon FM10) which was laying in our house for some time. I put it up for P2000 and not long after. A guy tells me he will buy it. He said he wants to start collecting old vintage camera’s and he saw mine which could be a good start for him. We meet up and our transaction goes smoothly. But 2 days later, I see him post an ad on a buy and sell group and he was selling the camera I sold him. For a higher price P2500, his post said the camera has been with him for a long time and he wants someone to take care. So I inform my mom (I was 17) and she is pissed because the guy lied. This is when I comment on his ad, “Hey dude, I just sold you this 2 days ago. You said you were a collector.” People notice my comment and start calling him out. He removes the ad and messages me saying he’s sorry for lying then blocks me. I told my mom and even though she was pissed, she said I should’ve just let it go. 

Of course, this was 5 years ago so he prolly sold it already but I was wanna ask. Was I TA at the time?

Edit: To clarify, I was mad because of his description of the camera (saying it was with him for a long time) which is why I made the comment. Not at him reselling it.

She had received nothing to drink or eat for more than 24 hours before surgery, and despite being on IV fluids, her mouth was parched. The rule was ""nothing by mouth,"" but she was begging the nurses for just a sip of water or some ice chips or a wet rag to suck on. If you've ever been in this situation, you know how miserable it is.

Because I didn't see how one or two tablespoons of water could hurt, especially as they'd allowed it for her to swallow some pills, I gave her a sip of water a couple of times when the nurse want looking. My son says I am in the wrong for breaking the rules and possibly endangering my friend. I say the rules are overkill.  AITA?

I'm especially interested in the opinion of medical professionals who can explain to me why my actions were dangerous.

1539,Not the A-hole,"We’ve had fights over this in the past and I’ve given up but it seriously still bothers me. She doesn’t want to shower daily because washing her hair daily is bad. She smells a little funny sometimes and she will shower about every 2-3 days. It’s a serious turn off. She also doesn’t want to shower until after sex, but I’d prefer if we both showered before with a rinse after. I feel like I’m going crazy and don’t know if this is common for women. FWIW I try to shower daily, but will sometimes delay an evening shower into the morning or vice versa. She kinda smells but I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I always shower the same day if I exercised at all that day.

Edit: she has been depressed in the past and I didn’t bring it up then because I attributed her lack of showers and what I considered to be proper hygiene due to her mental state. I brought it up after and that was when we got into a fight because she just thinks it is better for her hair and skin to not shower as often as I do. I brought up wet hair only because I was flustered typing the OP and didn’t provide enough information. 

I can see there’s actually a bit of divide and not everyone thinks showering daily is necessary or even the healthiest. Personally, I feel gross if I don’t shower near daily which I probably attributed to her being gross if she doesn’t as well which is not the case. She doesn’t quite stink, but I can’t say she smells good or pleasant. 

Regarding sex, I don’t want to hop right in the shower before each encounter, but knowing she possibly hasn’t showered in a day or two before a potential encounter definitely makes me hit the brakes. If she showered more often, I probably wouldn’t want showers both before AND after sex. 

I will definitely suggest she shower after exercising as she frequently mentions her sweat doesn’t stink. I think there may be some denial there as I don’t quite agree.

My fiancé and I are getting married in a few months, and we're super excited. However I've come across a bit of a hiccup that I don't know how to handle. My stepfather and future father-in-law have both agreed to give a speech at our wedding, which isn't an issue. However, my fiancé wants her mother to give a speech as well.

You may be wondering why this is an issue. My future MIL is an amazing person. She is also a public speaker, which is why my fiancé wants her to give a speech. I would personally love to hear her give a speech at our wedding.

However, the issue is with my mother. My mother went through years of abuse from my birth father, and this has made her paranoid of what other people think about her. She has also withdrawn a lot since the abuse, which means she is super shy. I would love to have her give a speech as well, but I know her well enough to say that it's out of the question. However, if my MIL gives a speech and my mom doesn't I know she is going to feel horrible, since she really is a sentimental person.

I'm kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place here. I know it's not fair to my MIL, but WIBTA if I asked my fiancé not to invite her mother to speak at our wedding?

EDIT: No, I haven't actually talked to my mother yet. I know I'm making an assumption here, but I know her and her thought process very well. I do plan to talk to her on this matter before making any decisions, but I would also be very surprised if the outcome isn't the situation I described above.",34,99,0.94

1542,Not the A-hole,"I run a charity, and we provide educational opportunities (scholarships, camps, etc) to underprivileged children, and victims of abuse. It's a rather small charity, just focused on my city.

We recently had a new scholarship recipient. Mother signed the contract, which gave Child1 many awesome opportunities, in exchange for the promise that she would actually follow through with those opportunities, and stick with it at least until the end of the year. Child is a toddler, so these educational opportunities were not difficult, nor did they have requirements of advancement; they were all just a lot of fun and helpful stuff.

Mother has another child, who does not fit the criteria for becoming a scholarship recipient. She tried to fabricate information to make Child2 seem like an ideal candidate, but was upset that we would not accept her. We continued to provide support for Child1, but Mother decided she was done, and withdrew Child1 from the program.

According to the contract, this meant that Mother had to pay for the portion of the programs that Child1 had already completed, as well as a withdrawal free from the camp she had currently been attending. Mother refused, so we decided it would be best for us to just eat the costs as a loss.

Mother then showed up on my front doorstep at my house, and screamed at me for a while, threatening me. I took out a no trespass order against her, but I'm still afraid of her. She then went online, and posted reviews on every site that she could, as well as blog posts across the internet, fabricating lies concerning the charity. She also recruited others to do so, and it took 3 months to get all of it taken down.

We are now sending out a mass invitation to apply for scholarships to the children's ministry directors at all of the churches in our area. (Edit: We are asking the churches if they have any children that they know of who could benefit from our services.) However, Mother is the children's ministry director at one of these churches, and the board of the charity does not think it wise to reengage her, given her threats towards me. Our solution is to just send a letter to all churches except that one- however, we risk being seen as racist, if anyone makes the connection, because it is a church that caters to a specific ethnicity. But there is no one else there that we can contact regarding this matter, as all youth activities report straight to Mother.

AITA (or rather are we the assholes) if we exclude a church, because of the actions of their children's ministry director, and therefore potentially exclude a modest number of children who could benefit from our services?",56,187,0.94
1543,Not the A-hole,"Some context: my best friend (we’ll call her B) and I have been best friends for 12 years. We’re both 21 years old. 

Anyways, a few months ago I discovered that B’s boyfriend was cheating on her after I found his Tinder account. I sent the screenshots to her and they shortly broke up. B was devastated as they were together for nearly 3 years, but as awful as it sounds, I was relieved. I hated the guy, because it’s the same type B goes for again and again: good-looking but a total douchebag. B’s ex was a total dickhead to me. He would make comments about my appearance and weight behind my back and refer to me as B’s “ugly friend”. I never told B how I felt about him though, I just acted like I was glad that she had time to discover herself.

Fast forward to two days ago. B’s told me that she’s decided to get back on the dating scene and that she made a Tinder a couple of weeks ago. I was initially really happy for her until she started complaining about being left on read and being ghosted. I then encouraged her to seek out more matches. So she got out her phone and started swiping. The problem was that she was being insanely picky. She would only swipe right on guys who were tall and Greek-god looking. She would literally swipe left on everyone else, and she would then proceed to complain that none of her matches were messaging her. 

I told her that she should stop swiping so selectively if she wanted a relationship. We then got into  a really heated argument and she told me that I was just jealous of the fact that hot guys liked her but not me. I will admit that B is about 50 times better looking than I am, but that comment really stung. She knows that I’m really self-conscious already. So I then told her that her standards are way too high and that she needs to calm down and not act all high and mighty. After that incident we haven’t spoken since.

1546,Not the A-hole,"Honestly I’m at the brink of losing all respect for him at this point. 

Me and my dads relationship has always been on the frosty side, even when I was a kid I never saw him and when I did it was never pleasant. If it weren’t for my Mum we would’ve been broke a long time ago due to his drinking and gambling. 

As I have gotten older I’ve managed to become extremely jaded about people due to his behavior, so I moved away and have barely heard from him, even when I come to visit. Until I got engaged to my bf of 4 years, he was then excited to walk me down the aisle, do the speeches but more importantly go on my bfs stag do. This made me nervous, as I have seen him dragged off in a police car more than several times in my childhood through to my teen years I didn’t want the same for my bf as this is his bachelor party. 

So I set an agreement with him, if you keep the drinking to a minimum and quit gambling you can go. He agreed and I was still skeptical throughout the year. But he wasn’t drinking and I didn’t have any indication of him gambling...until the weekend before the stag do. Turns out he was doing it in secret for 3 months but not so secretly spent £1200 in that time. My mum was in tears as she wanted to at least pay for the alterations on my dress but was struggling to find money for this weeks shop (she has a really good job and this broke my heart).

1547,Not the A-hole,"
My partner and I have been trying to have a baby for 5 years. We have various fertility issues, and as a result need a sperm donor, lots of medications, and more patience than anyone naturally possesses. Due to the specific nature of our fertility issues we are able to inseminate at home, which is our preference, and we’ve recently decided to move away from frozen sperm from an anonymous donor to using a known donor, a friend of ours who is the same race as my partner. Friend is a bit of a slacker and has been very flaky in the past, so we took time over the past year checking in with him, making sure he definitely wanted to donate (he offered, we didn’t approach him and ask) and was really comfortable with the idea of providing genetic material to create a child he wouldn’t parent. He assured us he was excited to help us. 

Four days ago I told him I will ovulate soon (thanks to copious medications) and would he be able to donate for us on X & X days. He doesn’t answer for hours and when he does, he claims he’s drunk and wants to “think about it when he’s sober”. I immediately felt alarmed but told him no problem. He didn’t get back to me the next day, but yesterday he finally told me that he wasn’t ready to start donating for us because he has too much going on with work, but he’ll let us know when he’s “ready to start this process”. 

I’m... really upset. Of course I would NEVER pressure anyone into this, but I have also spent countless afternoons sobbing to this same friend about my struggle with infertility, how horrifically this struggle (and 3 pregnancy losses in 5 years) has effected my mental health, and telling him how much anger and resentment I hold towards my body for not working correctly. Nothing unprompted, if it matters - he pushed me to trust him and open up. I rarely ovulate on my own, something that went undiagnosed for years, so any time I do manage to ovulate with the help of medication is a BIG deal. I’m not very open about my struggles with anyone BUT him (again after he pushed me to share more so he could be “closer with us and this process” so it’s not like this friend isn’t aware of how long we’ve been trying or how hard it’s been on us. 

At this point, I don’t know that I can be around this friend. Im obviously pretty emotional but I really just feel like this is not the kind of thing I’m going to get over. I don’t hold any ill will against him, but I also don’t want to see him. Even thinking about this is painful. WIBTA if I just quietly stopped hanging out him one on one or going to group events he’ll be present at?


**EDIT**: I thank you all for this discussion. Some really good points were raised to me, and while a lot of people seemed to completely miss the point I was trying to make, I understand this is an emotionally charged topic. I’ve decided to take a while to cool down and let my hormones regulate, and at that point I’m going to have a frank sit down discussion with our friend about why this was so hurtful and how I’d like to move forward - which will be going back to an anonymous donor. Using a known donor was a nice theory, but it leaves us open to too much risk, even though we love this friend dearly and would have enjoyed having this connection to him and his family. I will ask that y’all please stop PMing me that I’m a horrible person. Just leave it in the comments so it’s easier for me to report you.",258,385,0.9

1549,Not the A-hole,"So my wife and I have a dilemma and I want to get other opinions. We are close friends with another couple that have two kids, ages almost 4 and almost 1. I've known him since high school and her just the 6 years they have been together.

About once a month, this couple asks us to watch one or both of their kids so that they can go out or because they have some other social commitment. Generally we don't mind, but I think I've reached my breaking point. The nights that they ask us to watch the kids are weeknights and usually for about 5 hours each time. Their kids do not go to bed early, so my wife and I are putting them down around 9:30-10pm, which means we don't get back home until after 10. Also, very rarely does this other couple provide dinner for us. We have to come up with something after we get there and realize, yet again, we have to order something and pay for it ourselves. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to get paid - though baby sitters in our area make about $15/hour. But I would expect that they leave us some money to order a pizza or something. I honestly don't know if this couple has ever had to pay for a baby sitter since they seem to use us or family in the area.

My wife and I don't have kids yet, but we are expecting our first in November of this year. My wife watched one of the kids last night and didn't get home until almost 11. Being nearly 4.5 months pregnant, she doesn't always feel the best and is generally uncomfortable and tired a lot. But she's also too nice to say ""no,"" even though she also feels like we are being taken advantage of. I'm trying really hard not to ""keep score,"" but we both know there is no way this couple could watch our kid(s) on a weeknight for 4-5 hours a stretch. They're too busy doing their own things. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to put an end to this?

Also, what would be a polite way to tell this couple we feel like we are being taken advantage of? I want to just have a direct conversation with the husband, who is a good friend of mine, and just tell him that we can't do this anymore. Please let me know your thoughts.

1550,Not the A-hole,"Context here: I'm an ex heroin addict. The why and how isn't important, but I got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. I'm 26 now and completely clean. I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.

Now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.

She's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

I went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone.

When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. I'm being told left and right that I'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and I need to apologise, but I'm still upset that she evidently believes I'm incapable of doing this.

1552,Not the A-hole,"I work in the service industry as a restaurant general manager and I have an assistant manager that runs the place on my days off and I’ve put him in charge of some tasks but he answers to me.  I have a boss who makes final decisions and so ultimately we both answer to him 

Back in January, my AGM let me know that he would be taking a couple of days off at the end of June to fly across the country to see family.  I told him that should be fine but to let me know the details.  In our industry, if one of us is gone the other has to cover the hours, or the person leaving has to coordinate with our boss so get the time covered so the person staying behind has some relief for days off and mental sanity (hours are long so every shift is 12 hours).  We do have two employees that are key holders that can assist with coverage to keep my hours lower.  One of those key holders is out of town for the entire month of July for a destination wedding for her mother and this has been approved since last fall.

Then, in May my boss put on our google calendar that he would be gone from 7/3-7/8, which I thought might be problematic but didn’t worry too much because I hadn’t heard about this other guys vacation yet...until 2 weeks before he’s set to leave and he announces that he has purchased tickets for himself and his girlfriend (the other key holder) for an eight day trip.  My boss told him it wasn’t approved because he didn’t give enough notice, but he told him it was a family reunion and there were older family members there and basically worked it out with my boss so that he would be able to go as long as he found coverage for his shifts and his girlfriends shifts.

He ended up getting one shift covered and so I ended up working 7 twelve hour shifts in one week and now I’m brain dead and exhausted.  Which leads me to my question.

This guy is the kind of guy that will trap you and make you listen to every detail of his trip until he’s done talking about it. He will tell everyone who will listen, and in our bar that means he will tell every guest and employee all about how amazing and relaxing and wonderful the trip was and it will be all I hear about for the next few days.

I’m not trying to claim that he and his gf don’t have a right to enjoy a vacation, but if I go out of town I won’t be taking her or our other keyholder and I would make sure he got at least 2 days off ( I’ve been doing this a long time and have taken vacations before but have never left someone in such inconsiderate conditions).

1553,Asshole,"I am the manager at a boarding facility of about 15 mostly high school dog walkers with consistent weekly schedules. They are beholden to their parents summer schedules and during the school year there are a lot of school obligations. This means there are a lot of vacations and time off that I feel like I just cant say no to.

When the dog walkers are interviewed and trained they are told that we ask them - especially during holidays - to sign up for an extra shift here and there to help pick up the slack. This makes for a lot of variation in the weekly schedules sometimes.

I’ve put up a white board calendar with shift times for dog walkers to sign up on and also to keep track of vacations. It’s worked out really well, but it seems a couple times a month, something will be missed by me and someone won’t be in.

Under me is a supervisor who is over 60 (this is potentially important), walks dogs herself, and trains the dog walkers.She has come to me about 2-3 times over the past year or two with concerns about scheduling mistakes.

This is a physically taxing job. When someone doesn’t come in or if I didn’t get a vacation day right, it can add on to the list of someone else. 

I fully acknowledge this is difficult because I will also stay late, come in on my day off, or exercise dogs during my daycare hours. It sucks and I hate when I make a mistake but I’ll try to pick up more slack than I distribute to other people whenever possible.

The supervisor is getting very annoyed by the scheduling mistakes recently and by the fact that she feels like she’s out of the loop with what’s going on with the dog walkers in terms of their schedules. She does not do any scheduling but wants to know who is out when in case there’s an issue.

I feel like I’ve improved so much from when I started and the mistakes I make are human error. I try my best to write everything down correctly, but it just doesn’t happen sometimes. I VERY MUCH admit that I am not a fantastic manager and I could improve a lot, but that I’m at my limit for what I can do with the schedule as it is now. We may just need another system.

So me and the boys have group chat on messenger. There are nine people in the chat, but only seven of us is from the ""core"" group that started the chat  and we have been friends for over 10-12years now.

We are pretty close with the people we grew up with, including the girls from our neighborhood. We often party together, we travel together and we often just hang out.

We rarely invite other guys to the chat, so if one of the girls had a boyfriend who would hang with us, we wouldn't necessarily add him to the group.

The problem

A guy used to date one of our friends for a long time. We all liked him at first, but we quickly realized he is not a good person. He dropped out of school, quit his job and moved inn with our friend. He would often smoke weed at parties until he got caught (Illegal i Norway). Worst of all is how he changed our friend, she was now a full time student, working part time, and now had to take care of him. 

Luckily for her, she realized she was better without him and they broke up. Still he did some awful things to her, but she didn't mind that he was in the group and moved on. 

Today nobody talks to him or hang out with him. When we plan stuff we have to DM each other instead of thru the chat because we don't want him there. And we don't want to create a new chat because of all the memories we have in the old one.

A group of guys invited us to their table and we both went along they bought us drinks and everything and we could both tell they were straight...no biggie. I guess she felt really uncomfortable and told me that she needed to go to the bathroom. Mind you I didn’t know that she was lying about going to the bathroom she genuinely said “hey Kate I gotta go to the bathroom” So I said “cool” I was just talking to these guys, they were being really sweet we’re talking about where they’re from and what not and I looked at my clock and realize should be gone for about 20 minutes. She calls me shortly after I look at my phone and realize that she had been gone that long. 

Shes crying when she calls and says she feels really uncomfortable and the guys were hitting on her, she wants to leave because she’s in a relationship.

I can come with her or i can stay alone with these strangers. She stormed out. I ran after her alone & scared. I kinda forced myself into the car (she kept telling me to fucking get out) bc I would have been alone in Hollywood with no one. 

I was just so confused because we were at least 40 minutes away from our place, she was my ride, it was my birthday and I was just so confused. We got into a massive argument in her car about how she was so ready to ditch me bc we were with straight men at a club when she’s in a relationship. she drove me halfway home while telling me that I needed to get out of her car.

1560,Not the A-hole,"I recently moved into a new apartment and for the last two months, I have noticed many issues with my next door neighbors. We live in connected townhouse apartments. They allow their three female children to play unsupervised outside. So far in the last 2 months, I have seen these kids destroy someone's rose bush, destroy vegetation in my garden, attempted stealing an umbrella off my front door, climb on my fence and property multiple times, stay out as late as 12 AM, climb up a tree and fall out of it, throw rocks at my window/patio, play shirtless outside, leave their toys all around neighbors houses, and ride their bikes in the street (we almost hit them one day as we tried to park as they were running between cars) 

&#x200B;

The parents are no where to be found or at least they do not take responsibility for their children. There have been events where I run out yelling at the children to stop throwing rocks at my apartment. I know as a fact that the adult who is responsible for them is aware of the situation as I can hear him through the wall saying ""why are you throwing rocks at people's window?"" This is very frustrating as this gentleman does not take any responsibility for the action of his children and refused to address their behavior.

&#x200B;

Just this weekend I had another altercation where I caught the children on my fence again as well as throwing rocks tearing at my flowers. I did contact the police and as soon as they arrive, this man runs out and states that he has been watching the children the whole time, which is complete BS.

&#x200B;

Another important thing to note is that I suspect the parents are smoking marijuana around these children. Almost every day I am noticing the smell of marijuana coming from the common walls that we share. I contacted police about it and after they spoke with them, I did not smell the smell for a week. I have also noted the smell coming from their patio. It is worthy to note that since moving, I have been job hunting and have been home all day of the week. I have noted that these people are pretty much home all day as well. They never seem to leave their home, but when they do, it is very quick (for less than an hour or so). I have a hunch that they could be selling drugs.

Now these three children are between the ages of 5-10. I have already contacted the police on 6 occasions and they have told me every time that nothing can be done about it. I have also notified the property manager on multiple occasions and nothing seems to be done. I have a lot of video evidence.

We’ve been together 3 years and in that time all I’ve noticed this guy will eat is goddamn pizza. Most days he’ll go to one of those cheap halal places and buy a small pizza, cut it up and toss it into a salad. 

Family gatherings, he’ll go straight for the pizza. Dinner time, pizza. We go to 5 guys, he’ll get a freaking grilled cheese with a side of pickles. Date night. Fancy pizza places. He will not stray.

 I’ve spoke to him about it and he just shrugs and says its what he prefers. I’ve told him how upsetting it is for my boyfriend and I to want to experience interesting cuisine together but I can’t do that because all he’ll eat when we are out is pizza. I’ve asked him if it’s a comfort thing or if he thinks he has an eating disorder, but he just swears up and down he actually just likes and prefers pizza. I’ve asked him to be more adventurous and he says he will but never actually does. 

His birthday was last week and I was just so at my wits end and sick of goddamn pizza that I organized dinner at a Japanese place which my parents love and his parents love.

1566,Asshole,"Throwaway account.

Recently my gf and I got into a little argument about her not wearing a bra a couple of times when we’ve gone out. Side note that she has small boobs and her excuse for not wearing a bra is that it’s because she has small boobs and no one will notice. But here’s the thing, I notice and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Not only is it inappropriate, I don’t want random creeps staring at her obvious nipples... (we live in a colder area). I made her promise not to leave the house again without wearing a bra and this is where she said that I’m being an AH. But I personally don’t think I am. She says it’s for her comfort and because she has small boobs she doesn’t “need” to wear a bra. But honestly it’s inappropriate for other people when we go out and I don’t want other guys staring at my gf’s tits. Small or not.

update: jesus didn’t think this would blow up. i accept my judgement and everything and i know i approached the situation really wrong but i still believe in my reasoning regardless if it’s “AH” reasoning or not. like i’m not gonna let her go to my parents house when they can clearly see her tits, you know? i get that it’s her body and everything but there’s a time and place for shit like that. thanks for the input.

ps i don’t care about your bra size or whether or not you wear bras. here for judgment, not whether or not you have small/big tits lmao",2085,3426,0.84

1569,Not the A-hole,"Ok obvious throwaway, but here is the deal. My son turned 18 in January, but has some developmental delays and functions somewhere between 12-16 in most areas. I adopted him from foster care and he has many behavioral issues, most significantly lying and property damage. 

So recently, he made friends with a 17 year old from a pretty messed up household. The kid hasn’t been to school in two years, the mom calls the disabled younger son retarded, she doesn’t work but her ex husband who still lives there, even though she is remarried to someone who lives in Ghana, works three jobs, etc. The mom especially seems mentally ill. Three weeks ago, my son ran away to live with them. He filed a false police report against my dad, saying my dad held a gun to his head. Because of his disability, they wouldn’t arrest him. The woman and my son’s sent me some incredibly vulgar and threatening messages saying they know where I live and such. I called APS, but since he is 18 and said this is what he wants, nothing can be done. We talked a few times while he was gone, and he told me that he wanted to come home, then that he couldn’t have a relationship with me until I stopped telling lies (he then listed the things he had told me about the family. I am not sure it was him messaging me).

Two days ago, he came home sobbing. Told me the police had been there, he was terrified, he wanted to come back. Of course, I let him. He said he didn’t want anything to do with them anymore and wants to work on fixing the damage he has done to his relationships with the family. 

Two hours ago, he ran away. Took his medications, his clothes, his bow and arrow and jumped the fence. I can’t handle this stress anymore. WIBTA if I tell him he has made his choice and now can deal with it?

Edit: I called crimecheck and reported him missing and they checked the address of the friend and that is where he is. I knew this before I made the post.",25,126,0.97

1571,Asshole,"I was out with my nine month old male German Shepherd the other day and we took the usual walk through several fields. Numerous other people walk their dogs in this field and I've never had any problems before. Yesterday I let my dog  off (as usual) however after about 10 minutes or so a guy with a smaller dog on a lead appeared from around a blind corner I was also walking around. My dog who I admit is big but is a softie tried to go and sniff the other dog. Immediately the owner picks his dog up and starts kicking towards my dog shouting ""fuck off, get back"". I tell him to calm down and call my dog back. The guy then proceeds to shout and swear at me for having such a big dog off the lead. It's safe to say I lost it and shouted and swore back and then we went are separate ways. My question is am I the arsehole should I have my dog on the lead at all times or did the guy completely overreact.

1572,Not the A-hole,"My daughter is 17 years old and just gave birth to her first child last month. All in all, she’s a good mother. She takes care of the baby and while I do lend a hand, she does a lot of the work on her own. The one thing my husband and I pay for, is daycare as there’s no way she could afford it on her own in this area, though we only pay for it when she has to work. She’s on her own finding childcare if she wants to go out with friends or something like that.

She starts school in a month and will be starting off her senior year. Per our agreement, we will pay for the baby to go to daycare while she goes to school as well. We also watch her if she has to work outside of daycare hours, but we won’t watch her outside of that.  (Also, while my daughter provides mostly everything for her daughter, we provide everything for our daughter.) Her friends came by to visit the baby. They were all discussing homecoming and all of that stuff. One of her friends was asking if she’d even be able to go. My daughter off handedly said “Yeah, my mom will watch her.”

When my daughter got pregnant, we discussed this stuff. I told her specifically that while we will pay for daycare and babysit for free outside of daycare hours, along with helping her out, she is on her own in terms of childcare when it comes to hanging out with friends or fun activities like homecoming, prom or stuff like this. I don’t bring this up in front of her friends, but I do when they leave. She asks if myself and my husband (her step-dad) could please just watch her. It’s her last one. She works so hard. I said, yes, she does, but she’s a mom and that baby is her responsibility. It’s her job to find childcare. I didn’t let it turn into a fight and stayed firm.

Eventually, she gets her dad (my ex) to agree to watch her when these times come up. My ex is upset with me for staying firm on this-even though he was in agreement when she got pregnant and didn’t even want her to keep our granddaughter. He says I’m an asshole and I’m stealing the last years of her youth.

Am I in the wrong here?

&#x200B;

ETA: Some people have asked if I had my daughter pay me, if I'd watch my granddaughter. Answer is still no. It's not about the money. I have 3 other kids, plus 2 step-kids, on top of a full-time job and other responsibilities. Agreeing to care for the baby more than I do, would wipe me out. I get that she needs a break, but I help her as much as I can. 

I also never said she couldn't go, just that she had to find childcare, which she did and I have no issue with her solution. I think it'll be good for granddaughter to bond with my ex, as they barely see each other.

The baby's dad is in the picture. He's just also gong to homecoming, so it's not an option for him to watch her.",183,283,0.95
1573,No A-holes here,"Context:
Ive been working at a food establishment that is called, let's say Hizza Put as a shift manager for about two years now. 

On Sunday night around 10:45pm
(Closing time is at 11pm) a Native family of about 11 people come in and ask if we are open and tell me they want to dine in.  Now we dont have an official closing time for our dining area but my boss says to ""Use your descresion"" so given that it takes about 12 minutes for me to make these pizzas and get them out of the oven I let them know that I can't seat them but I can make their order to go. They agree and I put the order in the oven.

     Everything would be fine if that is all that happened. Now as those pizzas were in the oven two caucasian men came in around 10:57 and ordered a carryout pizza (A little annoying but whatever, ita just a carryout). One chatted with me for a bit before I went and made their order. After putting their order in the oven they asked me for drinks while they waited so I gave them each a soda. Native family's pizzas come out, I give them their order they leave (11:01ish). Now the two mens pizza comes out (11:12ish) I give it to them in a box and go back to finish up on dishes. 

      I finish dishes and realize the two men are still sitting and chatting and drinking their sodas in the store. I realize they must not know we are closed but I forgot to tell them and I hate confrontation and kicking people out so I decide to mop the floors and then if they're not gone I would let them know they have to leave. I finish the floor. Let them know that it is now 11:25 and they will have to go home. They apologize and express that they thought we closed at 12pm. They take their stuff and leave. 

     Now, somewhere in the time this happened one of the Native family members that had left drove by and saw that these two men were still in the store and got very very angry I didnt seat their family, called me a racist and is currently trying to get me fired. 

AITA for not allowing the family to stay and eat while I finished my closing routine",57,80,0.87

1575,Everyone Sucks,"Many years ago (30) my parent got divorced. I was an infant at the time. The youngest of 4 daughters. 
She was working as a secretary at our church at the time, my parents went to the church’s minister ( let’s call him Bx) for marriage counseling, long story short she divorced my father and Bx became my stepfather a few years later. ( Bx was married to Barb at the time, of my parents split -this will matter later) 

I’m now in my 30s and one day I was sitting / chatting with my mother and she brought up a story (she has the tendency to humble brag looking for validation) about how generous she is- here’s the story: Very soon after my parents split Bx came to my mother (I guess as a shoulder to cry on) and told her basically, he was having marital issues with Barb, that barb was angry with him that he never given her an engagement ring and all these year later married, still no ring. Something along those lines. To be clear we are talking about a diamond is what she wanted. 
Then, My mother tells me SHE offered to give her engagement ring aka the one My father had given her  To bx to give to barb, as she is no longer with my father, but bx declined the offer. 
(But Apparently bx told her this gesture was the point fell head over heels for my mother, divorced barb and moved in with us, into the house my father built.) 

Now I am very close with my father, and I resented bx until the day he died- so that certainly plays a part. (Ps Bx was 28 yrs older than my mother) 

But I was kinda pissed off when I heard this story coming out of her mouth. I asked her why she would do that? that didn’t she even consider that one of her 4 daughters would have appreciated it being saved for them or at least have the option. 

This is not the reaction she expected she fully expected for me to say “wow your a saint for that gesture” or something along those lines. I asked her where the ring was she said it’s in a box in her closet somewhere basically haven’t looked at it or cared about it for 30 years. So, I said well if you come across it I would like it, I would like to make a pendant out of it or something since it clearly didn’t matter it her. She refused said now she’d like to keep it.  I’m like ;eye roll:  fine, it’s typical of her to be fickle like that but AITA? It’s not about the diamonds value I could buy a diamond if I wanted one, for me it represents my father who is very dear to me.  She was going to just hand it over to this random person, in my mind, but not her daughter who would like it for sentimental reasons. I never saw their marriage I was an infant so us daughters and symbolically that ring is the only thing tangible left of its existence as I have no memories of my own. I have no memories of my parents being happy together just post divorce which was 2 decades of turmoil. So am I the asshole for thinking it’s kinda fucked up of her?",18,64,0.95
1576,Asshole,"My SIL got married last weekend, and blocked off hotel rooms at a hotel for the entire weekend. The hotel is more like a mansion that you can rent, so the rooms are differently sized and have large windows. My husband and I had a room on the 2rd floor. This room is really nice, had a lot of natural light, and weirdly small light fixtures, so I thought nothing of having the curtains open during the day. 

We ended up having some morning, well, activities. We didn't think our room was visible from the ground. Well, it apparently was, and about 30 people, including SIL, got a full show. 

We finished up, came down for brunch, and got the ugliest stares I've ever gotten. We were shouted at, called names, the works. I was surprised but really offended. I'm a married woman. It's not immoral for me to have sex with my spouse. We didn't know people could see into that window!

Some of the people who viewed were children, which apparently made it worse? Some of my relatives are nudists and my great-grandparents ran a nudist camp, so I don't really understand how seeing naked people is traumatising for a child. We weren't naked or having sex at them. In the camp, it was somewhat expected that if an area was private or semi private (ex. the woods) there was a non-zero chance that a couple would use it to bang one out. If you went in there and viewed something you didn't want to view, that was on you unless they touched you or started after they saw you.

The wedding was a little tense but still very happy. People were fishing for apologies not just for them seeing but for doing it in the first place. I don't feel it's necessary. We didn't MEAN to have basically public sex, but I'm not going to flagellate myself for a simple mistake or feel guilty for having a sex life.",41,42,0.76
1577,Not the A-hole,"We’ve been friends for about 4 years. She’s a great woman and I love her but I’m also emotionally exhausted. She called me after the most recent incident, I told her I wasn’t in a good place mentally to be her emotional support system. She’s incredibly upset with me and our group of friends think I’m being cruel. 


Here’s the backstory, she’s been dating her boyfriend for 10+ years. They have 2 kids together. He cheats on her every few months. I can list at least 15 different women/incidents that he has cheated with in just the 4 years I’ve known her. That’s not an exaggeration and those are only the times she has definitive proof of. She won’t leave , she’s never going to leave. I try to be understanding but I’ve also told her I don’t understand why she stays, her response is always a different variation of “Men will be men” and that she loves him. 


I’ve always been there for her, usually she catches him late at night. Going through his phone while he sleeps. She’ll call me hysterically crying, I’ve always dropped what I’m doing and either talk to her on the phone for hours or go get her and talk in person. This drama typically goes on for 1-2 weeks of me basically being her on-call therapist. I feel as if I put in more effort to help her recover emotionally than he does.I’ve offered every bit of advice and resource I can possibly think of. At this point I’m exhausted. She is a sweet person and a good friend to me and I understand the hurt of being cheated on and I know leaving isn’t easy but I honestly just don’t want to hear about it anymore.

1578,Not the A-hole,"So my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. After several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. A few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. I wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing I'd eat it the next day. 

Since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. I got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. I open the fridge grab MY BOX and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. I know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so I knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

I'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. Knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon I decided to sprinkle Ghost Pepper flakes on the last two slices. We actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. So I'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. This fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more.

1579,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I are expecting our first child in about three months. We've been so busy with other things that we haven't actually had a serious talk about names until last month. Our relationship has taken a serious nosedive since then. We're either giving each other the silent treatment or arguing, there's no in between. We have never had such opposite tastes on ANYTHING until this.

I am a name snob, I fully admit it. No matter how much people say it doesn't matter, a name does effect people's perception, especially first impressions. I want to give my baby a name he can carry into adulthood without shame. Something that works no matter what path he takes in life and doesn't give people pause or make them say ""oh, like [insert fictional character here]. You know, since he's going to be a child for what, 5% of his life? He needs a man's name, not a baby name. I don't want to call him some ridiculous/cutesy name or some shit that lets my husband stroke his nerd boner. Example, his top name picks include Ranger, Ryder, Flash, Sixx, Baratheon, Ender, Trapper...yeah. YEAH. TELL ME I'M THE CRAZY ONE. And as if those are frightening enough, he wants to fucking pair them up. Imagine my poor son living his life named Sixx Baratheon [surname]. It's insane and I'm honestly rethinking my marriage that we are FIGHTING because he wants to give this kid a ridiculous name so badly. Those are just the highlights btw, his list includes a lot more Game of Thrones names and celeb stage names and 80s action flick names and all kinds of shit.

I like traditional, classic, slightly overused names. Adam. Jack. James. Michael. Charles. Kenneth. Thomas. I've composed a mile long list of similar names and he turns his nose up at every single one. ""They're *man* names,"" he whines. ""Too old,"" he says. He wants something ""fun and cute"". Okay, but by the time our kid is 45, I imagine he's going to be tired of this shit. Hell, probably by the time he's 15. 

I've told my husband he needs to sit down on this one. He's too blinded by the sonogram of a tiny baby and little blue onesies and teddy bears to remember our son isn't going to be little for long. But he won't have it. He's screamed at me that he should be the one to name him anyway because he's a guy and understands boy names better than me. He's told me I'm boring and tasteless because of my picks. I've straight up told him I will fight for our child to have a sensible name as long as it takes. He's said he's going to do the same so our son doesn't end up saddled with a ""dumb and overdone"" name. I don't know the legality of this, but if there's any power I can abuse to name the baby MY choice when he's born, I'm 100% ready to do so. I hate to say it but yeah, it's worth my marriage for my son to not end up named literally anything my husband likes.

I saw a seat a few rows back that had another empty middle seat with two much skinnier people. I asked the flight attendant if I could switch seats to which she said yes. I got to the new row and seat and asked them if I could sit in the middle. They were now upset in which I understand. Everyone in our row could lean back with room and ease.

1582,No A-holes here,"I unexpectedly inherited the large estate of a distant relative, my dad’s sister with whom he had been estranged for years due to her lifestyle. Basically, she was an alcoholic and a gold digger. She and her late husband never had children, and I’m an only child in an otherwise small family, so it seems like she thought it would be nice to leave me all of her assets. Weird, unexpected, but here we are. 

She has a co-op in the city that I’m planning on moving into myself, but has a beautiful country home up in Connecticut that I’m planning on selling. It’s a victorian mansion on a considerable plot of land, including a small lake. 

The house is paid off, but was in poor shape as apparently her usage of the property declined with her mental health in the years before her death. I’ve spent all summer pouring my own sweat and cash into fixing things up to be able to get top dollar for it. Additionally, I had to pay off a not inconsiderable tax lien. So it’s by no means 100% free money, but damn close. I’ve poured maybe 50k into it (my life savings + a loan) and asking price is in the low seven figures. 

This weekend we received a unique offer. Not totally lowball or unfair, but truthfully it is kind of low and I was hoping to get more, and my realtor thinks I definitely can, because we priced it aggressively to begin with. The offer came with a folder, a multi-page letter and a family tree. A cute couple had traced their family back to the 1800’s when them immigrated, and it turns out that their great-great-great-great-grandfather built the house by hand, and it was their family farm and main residence for nearly a hundred years until they lost it to the bank in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street Crash. An incredible story. They had ancestry website printouts, public record copies, the story checks out. The explained that they didn’t have full asking price, but it would mean so much to them to be able to purchase the house and bring it back into their family. They said they had been watching and waiting for years for it to go on the market.

I shared this with my friends and family because I thought it was very cool, but people have seemed shocked and disgusted to hear that I don’t plan on accepting. I personally don’t think their sob story is worth \~100k. People are saying it’s not like it’s really my house or that I have any real attachment to it either financially or personally, it’s basically free money, I should pass on my lucky break to others. But I’m young, I don’t know what the future holds. I might want to have kids, I know I want to travel, I’ve long dreamed of opening my own business in the city and we all know NYC isn’t cheap. I think it seems dumb to just piss away money on strangers like that.

1585,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I have ben together for 1 year. We are 20 year old. 3 days ago she found out her former high school classmate took his life. It was very shocking to her because apparently this guy was super popular, star basketball athlete, very friendly, in student council, had tons of friends, on honor roll, etc. She was just completely shocked by the whole thing. All her high school classmates were posting about it on facebook and it was kind of a big thing in their high school circle.

So my girlfriend is a very emotional and empathetic person. She has admitted she didn't know the guy very well and they never had classes together. She says she knew his dad a lot better because he coached both the varsity girls basketball team and she was on the girls basketball team. However, she's been a complete mess about the whole thing. Like to the point where that she keeps talking about it and breaking into tears. This is a guy she hasn't seen since graduating 2 years ago. A guy she admits she barely talked to. She even made a 2 social media posts dedicated to him. Today she called in sick for work because apparently ""the whole thing was too much for her.""

So I decided to lightly tell her that I think she was over reacting about this whole situation and she doesn't have to make other people's pain her own. I told her it seemed she was trying to coopt the pain his family and friends would feel for attention or because she feels she should feel a certain way about it because this is honestly what it seemed like to me.

She was furious with me and now won't talk to me. My friend thinks I was an asshole and that I should have just let her mourn that way she feels. My logic is that it's day 3 of mourning and that life moves on and again, she barely knew this guy.

She said she would give us her blessing if we waited 5 years before we got married.

1590,Not the A-hole,"I had my first pregnancy 4 years ago. Now, I don’t know all of my friends on Facebook super well. Some are casual acquaintances from high school or college. I announced the pregnancy when I was 12 weeks along. I was very careful to not post too much about the pregnancy, but I would update every few months. The pregnancy was pretty difficult and I was scared, being a first-time mom and all, on top of hormones. 

When I was about 6 months along, I got a comment from one of those casual acquaintances, we’ll call her Holly. She said something along the lines of “You’re so blessed to be pregnant. I had a miscarriage two months ago and it’s just devastating. Hope you never feel that pain.”

The comment took me by surprise. I wasn’t sure how to respond to it. Like I said, I barely knew this girl, I think we talked a handful of times. And to say this to someone who you knew it was their first pregnancy (it had said it in that very post), seemed insensitive and making it about her. I felt for her, definitely, but it just wasn’t the time or place. So, I removed the comment and nearly forgot all about it. I gave birth to my son a few months later.

Now, I’m on my second pregnancy, twins this time. Once again, waited to post. On my announcement, Holly commented. This is probably the first I’ve heard from her since that day and I nearly forgot about her during this time. I’m sure I’ve seen her stuff, but again, we weren’t close so I can’t say I could pick her posts out of a crowd. But anyway, she put:

“Wow, you’re expecting again. Last time you were pregnant, I tried opening up to you about my loss and you deleted the comment. What was that about? It was a hard time and I wanted to reach out.”

Out of context, it received a few shocked face replies. I replied that while I sympathized, she kept finding inappropriate times to talk about this stuff, and she left out that she had tried to “reach out to me” on a picture of my six-month baby bump.

I'm 23f boyfriend is 25. 

my boyfriend has an annoying habit of telling me that certain dresses do not suit me, I get that he works at a clothing store but it does get annoying. I would normally ignore him or walk away when he would make the comment. 

example... that dress is bunching up around your waist and making it look wrinkled, you should add something to the bottom so it weighs it down and does not make it look like you have belly rolls. 

that dress is awesome but its riding up and you can see your undies when you bend over 

things like that 

yesterday we had gone out shopping and he was trying to give me tips on what style of dress would suit me, I was getting annoyed and started to walk off so I could stop listening to him, he then asked me why I was walking away. 

i just turned around and said 

""i don't want to listen to your retarded ass tell me what I can and can't wear, just leave. 

he has left and is now refusing to speak to me.

1594,Not the A-hole,"Background: my brother is seven years old. He failed kindergarten once but is moving up to first grade this year, however he only knows a few basic sight words. Never tries sounding anything out. He refuses to learn whenever I attempt teaching him to read which is understandable for a seven year old, but he spends all day on his tablet watching dumb videos on youtube and playing games. Our parents tend to baby him but regardless, I think it's time for something to change and he actually use his tablet for something productive.

&#x200B;

During the school year, he never even tells us if he has homework and we just never find out making us look bad, not him, in the end and even if I ask he lies and says there is none, even taking it out of his folder.

&#x200B;

I took it upon myself to download an app lock and locked all of his games and youtube and I downloaded two reading game apps, ABC Mouse and one other one which are both very good and customizable as well as interactive and interesting. He threw a fit and hasn't touched the tablet since or even opened the reading apps (except for trying to break the code). It's worth mentioning that he also has a smart TV and many many toys to keep him entertained as well. I told him for every thirty minutes spent on the reading apps he could have an hour of game/youtube time but he insists on telling me how unhappy and angry he is, currently lying on the couch next to the tablet. It's bad enough that he ignores everything I say without any repercussions or gets out of it by calling me ""mean"", but now he took it to a whole new level and is hitting the tablet. It's an amazon fire so I'm not too worried about it breaking though. He is now declaring that I'm not his brother anymore and I actually feel pretty bad because we were getting along earlier. 

&#x200B;

I feel that our parents are not giving him the academic attention he requires and he won't cooperate when I try either and something needs to be done about it that I feel our parents won't do. If I call it out, I'm told that I don't help either and that I need to ""learn how to control the situation"", basically it's my fault if he doesn't listen to me. 

&#x200B;

Am I being too hard on him? I could read way before his age and maybe I'm just not being compassionate enough, maybe I just don't understand kids and should let his school be doing their job. I also grew up in a more rigorous school district and we recently moved to one which is very slow and has kids behind a lot and I don't want him to end up like that. Was it my place to do this since I'm not a parent?

I offered to make the cake as I really wanted a reason to bake a rainbow cake. I thought I did a pretty good job and added ""happy birthday jan"" (fake name) with icing on top. I send a photo of it to my mum and she loved it. 

the night of the party my girlfriend went out to celebrate a friend getting a promotion, I let her go as I cant force her to stay. I just added that I would like her to not be hungover at my grandmother's birthday party, she agreed. 

turns out that her and her 2 friends came home drunk, my girlfriend then decided to let them eat the cake and make a huge mess.

I woke up to find my girlfriend asleep on the couch with cake smeared everywhere, I managed to vacuum the floor and ""clean"" the couch, I added a blanket over it to hide the cake stains. 

I then had to run to the store and get a cheap cake, boy was I mad. 

my girlfriend was also super hungover. 

I decided to wake my girlfriend up and force her to call my mum and tell her exactly what she did, my mum was not pleased and I really embarrassed my girlfriend. she has not come home and missed the party (not that anyone cared tbh)  my grandmother was thankful for the cake but would if wanted my one. 

I got my girlfriend to tell my mum that she got so drunk that she ruined the cake that (boyfriend) made for his grandmother, she also apologized.

We met up the next day and we talked about it and honestly as soon as she said it I knew I wanted to be a dad. She told me she wasn’t sure but I told her that she would regret it if she got rid of it and we could be good parents. 

My dad’s in prison and my mom is either drunk or passed out so I can’t talk to them about it. Taylor told me that she hasn’t told her parents yet.

1605,Everyone Sucks,"My (21F) friend (19F) has a drinking problem. She doesn't drink constantly or alone; she’s actually a great student who’s super involved on campus. She does, however, use alcohol as an escape from her anxiety and is a mean drunk. She insults us mercilessly when we try to take care of her (without remembering it) about half of the time she drinks.

Her attitude has always been “it's not alcoholism until I graduate!” She never apologizes or accepts consequences and has told me outright that when she’s drunk she can’t be held accountable, as she never would behave like that sober (once said this to me after texting my SO trying to sleep with him).

We've sought medical attention for her four times due to her drinking in just over a year (and should've many other times). Since we live on campus, each of these incidences was reported to the university, and she's basically been on probation with the school since she stepped foot here.

After the fourth incident, she came clean about her issues and sought therapy after months of our urging her to do so. She was informed that if she messed up again she could be suspended or expelled. At this time, she joked to me that she had been avoiding trouble with the school for so long by blaming ME for her drinking problems. She said I coerced her into drinking heavily. I then realized why I had received multiple emails from administrators requesting I go to our counseling center to address ""substance abuse"" despite receiving no citations.

She went sober for a couple months. Once it ended, she was doing exactly what she had before and confessed that she was lying to her therapist about her drinking. After a particularly bad night that spring, me and most of my friends told her we were done, leaving her with only a couple people to look out for her.

This all led up to a few weeks ago, where she was up to her usual behaviors. I went to the women's bathroom in my dorm and found her almost fully naked and unconscious on the floor of a stall (not unusual for her). I saw her and walked out. Later I started feeling a little guilty instead of angry and didn't want something horrible to happen, so I mentioned what I saw to one of her friends who I happened to see \~30-40 minutes later. She ended up finding her, trying to get her back to her room for over an hour, then calling a police officer. The officer drove her home.

She's now at risk of getting kicked out of school, and with tuition being $75k per year, it's a $150k investment going down the drain, which I hope happens so she learns some actual consequences. Some say I'm an asshole for leaving her alone, but I feel like it isn't my job anymore and I've already done too much for her.

We started planning out everything from clothes, to toys, to diapers, etc.  We were in agreement on most everything until the topic of where we plan on having the delivery came up.

She tells me that she wants to have our baby at a ""natural birthing center"" or something along those lines.  I had never even heard of a place like that so I did some research and what I found was alarming.  Generally, there is no physician present for the delivery but instead, a midwife or doula.  These people aren't trained medical professionals and I don't believe this is the way to go about having a child.  I work in medicine and I am very aware of all the risks associated with childbirth.  If something were to happen during the delivery, she/baby need to be in the hospital with doctors on hand.  I am not going to allow her to put the baby at risk like that.

I discussed with her all of my concerns and showed her some data online justifying my worries but she refuses to budge.  We got into a huge argument and now she's left me to go stay at her parents house.  She told me that it's hurtful to not trust her decision.  She kept insisting that she feels that this is the best route to take.  She also said that she was born in the same way and that God will ""take care of everything.""  My wife normally isn't very religious so this was out of the ordinary for her to say.  I almost feel like her parents (super religious nutjobs) are meddling in all this.

I don't know what to do.  I care about my wife/baby and I want the absolute best for both of them.  How can I be assured she'll get the level of care required at the birthing center?  It all just seems very sketchy and I will not change my opinion on the matter.

UPDATE: 

Thank you for everyone's input.  I plan on going to see her tonight to open a dialogue.  Unfortunately, I am still very resistant to change my opinion.  The health of my baby and wife are paramount and if she is not getting the absolute best care available (i.e. from a trained, certified, tenured attending OB), it won't suffice.  Midwives are not doctors and do not have the extensive knowledge and expertise that doctor's possess, nothing will convince me otherwise.  The birthing center my wife wants to use is 16 miles away from the nearest hospital...not acceptable imho.

I love my stepkids very much. I think they are sweet and gracious and the two 11 year olds have become pretty good friends. However, we only have them on the weekends and every single weekend they come over absolutely filthy (as in haven't showered or changed clothes since we dropped them off Sunday), they are absolutely starving and they never show up with school work, among many other issues. 

to me this detracts from our weekend together. We have to spend the entire night Friday (or Thursday) getting them into the bath, getting them clean clothes and then about 20 times since the divorce my husband and I have had to get in touch with the school to find out what work they will need to do over the weekend. Their mom just does not care. I guess it's her prerogative not to care, but she is absolutely hurting the kids. The 6 year old is being held back a grade and the 11 year old is very much in danger of getting kicked to the remedial school.

The only way I've though to that we can do this is we tell her that the kids must be dropped off to us having showered, have clean clothes and have their homework. Or else we are turning them back.

The dinner is great, food is great, service is great, but at the end of the meal we get our bill and the gnocchi is \~$7 more than what was listed on the menu. I bring it up with our waiter who informs us the dish actually comes as either an appetizer or a full meal, and we were served the full meal version, as the waiter assumed that my s/o didn't want only an appetizer. I explain that she did in fact only want an appetizer, and that I would like to be charged the appetizer price since that was what she attempted to order.

&#x200B;

Our waiter went to get the manager who told us that since we ordered the full sized version, and subsequently ate the full meal, he would still have to charge us for the entree price. I told him that this seemed like an unethical way to get customers to unwillingly order something that costs more than what they truly wanted (especially because there was zero indication on the menu that the gnocchi came in 2 different sizes), and that I would have to refuse paying for the full size entree. He then told me that despite there being a misunderstanding, it was my responsibility to pay for what I'd already eaten. After arguing back and forth a bit more, the manager finally agreed to change the bill and charge us for the appetizer price, albeit in a condescending and judgmental tone. So here I am now, wondering if I maybe handled this poorly and should've just paid the extra 7ish dollars and been on my way. So, AITA here?

I came in to work to find my coffee mug missing. We do not have communal mugs at work, everyone brings their own from home and keeps it in a cupboard. It's a huge office, lots of people. It took me awhile of looking around and eventually I found my mug sitting on a desk in front of some new guy I'd never seen before.

I go over, take my mug (half full as it was with tea) and say exactly 5 words. 'Don't take my mug please.' I did not raise my voice though I will admit I was a little sharp. I didn't report him for theft. I didn't even give him a telling off. I just walked away at this point because I now need time to wash out his tea before filling it with my own coffee.

Fast forward to the afternoon and he has complained to my supervisor for being mean (maybe?) and intimidating (I really don't see it).

He is also claiming that he didn't even take the mug and it was someone else who made him his drink in the first place, which in my mind means he should really be mad at whoever stitched him up with a stolen mug in the first place.

Nothing came from it but my supervisor thinks that I overreacted, and if I don't want my stuff stolen I should lock it up. 

Why it would be ok for someone to take stuff that they know isn't theirs just because it isn't actively nailed down is beyond me but I'll put it to you,

I just chuckled and didn’t think much of it. But as weeks have gone by, I keep wondering why Susan thinks I’m hosting her bridal shower. 

Background on my relationship with Claire and Susan: Claire and I are very close in age; we are about 4 months apart in age. We grew up like sisters. Susan is about 6 years younger than us. I’ve never been close with Susan because since she was young, she had an entitled attitude and was very manipulative to get whatever she wanted while doing no real work. Claire and I grew apart solely due to the fact Susan didn’t like me in our high school and college years. As Claire and I got older, we started getting closer, but not quite like our childhood relationship. Also, I know Claire doesn’t have many close friends so I knew she didn’t have anyone in that group that would host the bridal shower. Susan didn’t offer to throw it on her own until I volunteered shortly after Claire’s engagement was announced. 

Also, it was a huge financial obligation and I had to save for 6 months to ensure I had enough to cover expenses for throwing a party. Susan and I split costs about 70(me)/30(Susan) so I know I won’t be able to host it entirely on my own. 

WIBTA for not hosting her (Susan’s) bridal shower? Or making it clear that I’m not planning on hosting?",19,28,0.97
1619,Not the A-hole,"We’ve (both 31 f) been best friends since we were kids. She’s been in an 8 yr relationship with a man who has gotten progressively more verbally abusive to her.

His mother approached me at her baby shower a couple years ago- before I knew how bad it really was- and asked me “how is Ashley handling Brandon?” I thought maybe she was referring to how their personalities are so different, so I said I think she was handling him fine. About a year later *her* mother brought up how he speaks to her daughter and how furious and concerned it makes her.

Then last summer, in front of me during several outings, he called her stupid and told her to shut the fuck up. He didn’t tell her to shut the fuck up one time, he said it no less than 30 times in my presence. He made overtly racist comments. He bragged about calling his mother a slut and a bitch when he was a child. He made snide, judgy comments about how other women were dressed. He snapped at me after I made a few benign comments about how he was acting, and the way his face twisted up in rage when he did so made him appear scary and unhinged. The last time we all hung out, I became very quiet after he was behaving this way, which is very uncharacteristic of me, and he definitely knew that it was a reaction to his behavior. I ended the night by hugging her tightly and telling her I love her and left without another word.
A couple months after that last time I saw them, she and I met up for drinks. She said things like “Brandon knows he needs to work on himself” and “he started reading Bible verses to me when I get upset” (he’s an atheist and she’s Christian).
I started crying and told her that I could not support her marriage to him. I told her he was abusive and there’s no way I could sit and smile at their wedding and be happy for them, let alone give a long supportive and loving speech like I had always planned on doing. All she kept saying was “I know I know I know” and tried to convince me that he was changing.

Last time she texted me to hang out I only responded that I missed her and I did not try to make plans.

A couple months ago they got married at City Hall and she’s pregnant again- she didn’t tell me about either event. They are having a wedding reception this month and I was not invited. A couple weeks ago I sent her a long text message telling her I love her, I will always have space in my home if she needs it, and that she’s smart, funny, kind, an amazing mother, and that I hope one day Brandon can become the type of partner that sees all of that in her. She never responded.

At this point, it feels like our friendship has officially ended. Everyone knows about his behavior and since I’m the only person who spoke up against it, I feel like an asshole. I see everyone in pictures at her “bachelorette party” this weekend and I feel sad and unsure about how I handled things. Am I the jerk letting it come to this?",50,97,0.97

1622,Not the A-hole,"Seven months ago my fiancé called off our wedding one month before. We were together for 4 years and lived together for 2. He broke up with me in a text and just said he couldn’t do it and was too overwhelmed.  He refused to have an actual conversation with me so I never got any real answers or closure. I basically had to assume he had some kind of mental health break combined with cold feet. 

When everything happened my dad took over contact with his dad. Apparently his dad offered to compensate mine for lost wedding costs (over $8k of deposits). My dad did not accept, partly due to a cultural sense of honor and partly to avoid a feud. I strongly disagreed but my parents had paid for the majority (I was personally out about $1k). They told me to let it go so we wouldn’t be tied together due to money. 

Fast forward seven months. I have since learned that he was cheating on me. It turns out he got married to the other girl two days after he sent me the text to end it. So now I think he’s a psychotic asshole. His actions were clearly premeditated to some extent.

He doesn’t seem to have any conscience and ended up even pushing our final shared living expenses off on me after our lease was terminated.  So there isn’t much point in trying to make him pay for any of this.

I am considering sending his parents a letter spelling out exactly what he did (I have evidence), include an invoice that outlined all the money that was spent, and basically ask them to pay or address it with him as needed. Good idea or asshole idea?   (I know it’s not their fault but he’s their son and they were cowardly and avoidant when everything happened.)




Update: thanks everyone. I left out many details for brevity but I think what it comes down to is that I never got a voice or a chance to even talk with them about what happened. They were my family and then poof, they were gone. The money sucks, and he’s an asshole, and I kinda think they are too, but I think mostly they just were embarrassed and not sure what to do. (FWIW, they apparently did not know what had transpired, just that he was dating someone else).
I think my plan is to write them the letter expressing my sadness of the lack of closure and to reinforce that this was all their son (since who knows what he told them). The money is only one part of what this cost me but as some of you said, bullet dodged. I know they may never respond but I think it will help me just to say it and make sure they are aware of what an asshole their son is. But I won’t ask them for any money since as many pointed out they had already offered and mine declined. I really hope karma is true because mine only declined because we thought he was depressed, not a cheater.",82,561,0.97

1625,Not the A-hole,"Background: I’ve been a doctor for 10 years now, and occasionally I will get text messages and calls from friends and family for things. For the most part, it doesn’t really bother me, as long as I have a genuine relationship with a person and I don’t feel like they are using me.


So she texted me yesterday about a “mole” that she had on her upper body, and asked me how much I knew about them. I’m not a dermatologist by any means, but I know enough to know what I don’t know, and when to defer to a specialist. 


After trying to get her to describe the mole over text, I gave up and just used video chat, because a picture is worth 1000 words. I look at it for about 30 seconds, don’t see anything that looks out of the ordinary, and deduce in my mind that its most likely an ingrown hair. 


Me: well, that looks like pretty much an ingrown hair, given what you told me about it and where it is

Friend: oh ok, that’s pretty much it?

Me: yeah that’s pretty much it, I don’t see anything that would cause me to get worked up or excited. 

Friend: thanks, but are you sure?

Me: (slightly annoyed) yes...

Friend: well because I was reading on webmd and it said-

Me: hangs up phone, goes back to enjoying my beer. 

Another friend that was hanging out at my house and privy to the conversation thought it was mean of me to hang up on her like that, but I don’t think he fully understands.

1626,Asshole,"I was brought up Catholic but left in my teens. I haven't been to mass since and I got married in a civil ceremony. Three months ago I gave birth to an absolutely beautiful baby girl. This is where the conflict starts.

My mom and sister are both still hyper-Catholic. They weren't happy about my civil marriage and have been insisting on having my daughter baptized since I announced my pregnancy. My mom even once stated ""all my grandchildren WILL be baptized!"" It goes without saying if I'll have a Catholic baptism for her. One day I was talking with my sister about it. She admitted there was no chance of a Catholic baptism but asked if I'd at least consider one in a different church. She asked if I still believed in God, I admitted yes I did though not practicing religion. I thought about it and decided my daughter having a moral foundation in a more liberal church would be OK, she could decide for herself if she wanted to be religious when she was older. So I agreed to that. 

Then I decided to troll my mother and sister a bit. Last month I saw a church flying rainbow flags for Pride month. So I looked it up. They have a lead pastor who's an open lesbian and mentions her wife on the church's site. I decided I was definitely getting my daughter baptized here! I called them up and spoke to the pastor a bit. She's a cool lady and definitely someone I wouldnt mind having baptize my daughter.

My husband however said he won't stand in the way of this but thinks I'm being a bit out of line. He noted he's not religious either but the lesbian pastor clearly is and doesnt want to be seen as just a ""lesbian pastor"" and I'm basically using her sexuality as a weapon against my family. I haven't told her this or that this is why I'm selecting her. My husband thinks I should either put my foot down against my family or choose a church to baptize our girl based on more practical reasons (the one in question is on the other side of our city, kind of far) instead of using this one and this woman to make a statement. He says at least I should talk to her and mention my reasoning. 

So, am I being an asshole?

1628,Not the A-hole,"This has been bothering me for several days now, and I'm not sure whether I'm being immature or justifiably upset about it. Essentially I'm at an airport with a hungry one-year-old, and I'm looking for somewhere to sit and feed the ravenous little beastie. Doesn't change anything that I have a kid, that's just how it was and is some context.

The waiting area at the gate is packed, except for a block of three seats. The three seats have a sweater and handbags on them. I look around at the nearest other people, who are several yards and a row divider away, on their phones, in their own worlds, and don't seem to be in charge of these seat bags.

While I'm surveying the area, my daughter is going nuts, and there's nobody to ask to move the bags. It's not practical to grapple my daughter into eating while we're standing up, and there's nowhere to sit on the ground. I make the decision to move one of the bags to free up a seat and sit down.

The moment I start to move one of the bags, a guy at the opposite end of the opposite row of seats (maybe 20 feet away) gets out of his seat, stands up, and points at me. Let's call him Seat Protector Guy (SPG).

**SPG, repeatedly, yells:** ""THAT IS *EXTREMELY* RUDE!!"", while standing and pointing at me moving the unattended bag.

I do mean ""yells,"" and with a booming British-sounding accent in an American airport, which made the yelling really become a spectacle. The waiting area got quiet, and a bunch of people turned around to see what's going on. It takes me a moment to understand that SPG is pointing at me, and to realize that half of the waiting area is now watching.

At first I'm speechless, then like an idiot I lose my cool and try to argue with the guy.

**Me**: ""There is *nobody* here!"" (gesturing at the empty seats).

**SGP:** ""THAT IS *EXTREMELY* RUDE!!""

**Me**: ""... there is *nobody sitting here*!"" (gesturing at the seats)

**SGP**: ""THAT IS *EXTREMELY* RUDE!!""

The woman (partner?) sitting next to SPG speaks up.

**WOMAN**: ""They left for just a minute, they'll be back!"" (not yelling but clearly pissed off at me).

The woman then gets out of her seat, walks over to the seat I just picked up the bag from, and blocks me from sitting down there.

**SGP**: ""THAT IS *EXTREMELY* RUDE!!""

At this point, my daughter is extremely upset, and I don't have time to fight this battle. I swallow my pride, disengage, walk away, fumble my daughter's food from deep within her diaper bag while holding her and standing up, and do what I have to do. My heart is racing from being publicly humiliated.

After a few minutes, a family sitting nearby comes over and offers their seats, but we're already in the feeding rhythm, and I have to politely decline their offer. After about 20 minutes, the owners of the unattended bags come back and sit down, apparently unaware that anything had happened.

After a while, I start to wonder whether I was actually the asshole? 

Long story short: I tried to move an unattended bag to sit down at the airport, got publicly humiliated.",57,63,0.86
1629,Not the A-hole,"So a week ago I'm home when a truck runs off the road and through our fence.

I run outside to see if everyone is ok to find blood on the windshield of the truck. When I open the door, I see the driver and it's obvious some of the wood of our fence went through the windshield and severed part of the guy's neck and the guy is dead. I call 911 and I then retreat to my front porch to watch all of the emergency workers deal with the accident while I sob uncontrollably.  I didn't sleep at all that first night.

A couple days later, I get a knock on my door. I answer it and there are the three adult children of the man who died in the accident.  They explain that they believe their dad probably had a heart attack and ran off the road because he had a previous heart condition. I listened as sympathetically as I could but I started feeling sick and the visions of this man come flooding back to me. 

That's about the time one of the daughters ask me if I removed the gold chain from his neck since I was the first person to get to him. I explained that I would do no such thing but that it was possible it was torn off by the post that went through the windshield and hit his neck. I left out the gory details that their dad was nearly decapitated by the post. 

They asked if they could search my yard for the chain and I said yes. They looked for about a half hour and then came back up to the house with no luck. They asked me if I planned on filing a claim against their dad's insurance for the fence his truck destroyed. I was completely mortified by the question but quickly said I doubted it because I just wanted this all behind me and it was just a fence. 

Before they leave, they ask me if they can place a wreath in my yard in the spot where their dad died. I'm completely mortified but I replied that I would rather them not since that's my private property and I don't want to be reminded of what happened there. They get upset at my answer and tell me I'm being unreasonable. I reiterate that I don't want any wreaths in my yard and tell them I need to handle some things so that they would leave

When my husband gets home he says that I was being unreasonable and that these people just wanted to grieve in their way. I stood my ground and explained that this was all a traumatic experience for me and I want it over.

The next day we get up and discover that they placed a wreath in our yard anyway.  I absolutely become infuriated and go down to remove the wreath. My husband tells me that it's there and I should just leave it, but I really didn't want a reminder of what happened there. 

Overall, they placed four wreaths and I removed each one. My husband is now really upset with me and says I am just being an insensitive asshole for hindering their grieving and I say they are assholes for not honoring my wishes. AITA?",1182,6164,0.97

1633,Not the A-hole,"Here we go - I have been in a group of friends (husbands, wives, kids) for almost 20 years.  We started out as a neighborhood group and have grown bigger as our friendships have evolved and most of us have moved out of the original subdivision.  We are adults 40-50 years old.  The men play golf most every weekend and one evening during the week.  Holidays and birthdays are big get-togethers with sometimes 50 people. I am currently the only unmarried person in the group (divorced in 2011).  This is the sticky part.

&#x200B;

About 7-8 months ago, one of the women in the group named Cindy, started coming on to me.  While flattered, I would never do anything as I like her husband Mike and have know her kids since they were preschoolers.  It seemed like a little harmless flirting at first, but then it moved into some very direct propositioning.  She had her reasons for wanting to become sexually involved and put a mild bit of pressure on me to begin an affair with her.  One of the ways she pressured me was to text me racy pics and those soon moved to x-rated pics and videos.  It really put me in an awkward spot and I told her that.  My response was that I found her attractive, but she was strictly off limits to me since she was married.  Even if I didn't know her husband - I still would not have done anything.  And I didn't.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I found out that I had missed a few golf days and I just chalked it up to bad timing.  Well....there was a huge 4th get together and I asked around about it and it seemed no one would own up to me not being invited.    Apparently, there have been other events that I didn't know about and I wasn't invited there either. I finally got some answers last night when I ran into a friend and her daughter at the grocery store.  She would barely look at me when I spoke to her and her teenage daughter spilled the beans.  Cindy was caught with the racy pics on her phone and ""confessed"" to Mike that I had put her up to it and was pressuring *her* to have an affair.  Needless to say, I was stunned at this revelation.  I thanked her for her honesty and went home and thought about it for a long time.

&#x200B;

I have saved every single text and pic.  Last night I printed them all out.  If I showed Mike 10% of what she said to me and what she sent to me - he might leave her.  Meanwhile - I am pushed out of my friend group for doing what I thought was right.  I told her at the beginning that this was heading down a road of hurt - but when she got to the painful part, she pushed me under the bus.

UPDATE:  I reached out to Mike and he texted me that he never wants to see or talk to me ever again.  Some of you have suggested that I reach out to a leader in the group and I have done that - I will be meeting with another couple tonight.  She is a gossip, so anything I show her or tell her will be public knowledge two hours after I leave their house.  You get what you get.

&#x200B;

UPDATE #2: It turns out that the whole group knows nothing, just a few.  Mike and Cindy filed for divorce in January due to his infidelities and tried to keep it private.  From my end, everything is good.  It turns out that both or them are assholes.",733,8793,0.98

1635,Not the A-hole,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

* Winston Churchill  
* a giant NHS sticker  
* Crumpets  
* Tea  
* Picture of the 13 colonies

At our wedding we're having a table to commemorate relatives who have passed who would otherwise have attended. Last year my fiancée's cousin miscarried, and we were happy to include the baby on said table, as it would have been born by our wedding date and would have been in attendance.
The problem is they want to have a photo of the baby's face, post-stillbirth, as the tribute. Not only do we think it's a pretty shocking and upsetting picture to have on display at a wedding, but we have two pregnant women in attendance at our wedding, one of whome also miscarried very recently.
We're happy to accommodate other options, but we're worried they might not be happy with us for refusing their wish.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback so far. Seems like most people are on our side, but I feel like a few people might have misinterpreted what the commemorative table is, as if we're having a fully set dining table with empty seats.

Lots of cooking, drinking, and partying which I'm really not into because it's tiring and I don't think my kids really enjoy it because they barely even know their father's relatives.

Today, my youngest had his 1st birthday. I never planned to give him a party because 1.) I know we don't have the money to spend on all that food and drinks, 2.) I really wanted to have an intimate celebration with just us and my kids' grandparents, and 3.) I don't feel like socializing with more than 20 people I barely see. However, when I woke up this morning, my child's grandmother from his father's side asked me what was my plan for my child's big day.  I know she's already invited their relatives  and I didn't want to embarass her. So I strayed from my original plan and went to the market to buy all that was needed and spent the rest of my day cooking and preparing everything for tonight's event.

We just got finished putting away the dishes and cleaning everything. The guests have all gone home by now. 3 people brought gifts for my son. I know I shouldn't cause it's not right to ask for anything in return of something you gave, but I kinda feel sad because there were more than 20 people who came and only 3 people remembered to bring something for my kid.  His relatives are well off, and just last month my son's cousin celebrated his birthday and received tons of gifts. I don't know if I'm jealous for my kid, but I feel like I should've just spent all my money on my kid.

I told my partner that this will be the last party we'll ever throw and all of my children's future birthdays will be spent by us going out or doing whatever ny kids love. He didn't say anything but I know that he doesn't agree with me.

Edited to say that English is not my first language and I apologize for any grammatical flaws of this post.

It's a cheap machine, the only upgrade is a solid state drive and I think I have less than $50 invested in the entire thing. Still, my wife and daughter don't take care of it and I think it's because they know it was ""cheap"". E.g. I insist that it should be turned off and put in the computer desk drawer when not in use. My wife leaves it running her game all day. Or if it's closed she leaves it on the table or where ever she was playing. Our cat jumped on it and now there is a horizontal band of lines about 1 inch tall from screen damage. If it were in the drawer it wouldn't be damaged. Also, the top is a nice blue color, is now covered in cat scratches. Her stepdad is gifting her his PC, a significant upgrade to ours in every regard, and I told her she is sharing that with our daughter and I'm wiping our laptop, fixing the screen and making it mine only.

She's unhappy because she likes (and uses) the portability of the laptop and she doesn't appreciate being banned. I said it's because you're unable or unwilling to take care of the last one after I gave a few sensible directions. Not only that, but the bad things I said could happen actually did, so my point is proven. She also doesn't want my daughter on the computer she's about to get because my daughter can be rough. My wife has food and drinks near the computer and because of that, our daughter does too. I said no one wanted to listen to me on how to take care of the last one so now it's up to you to keep your new one nice. I can't enforce rules by myself unless it's for my computer only, which I can do because it will only be out when I'm using it.",63,31,0.86
1641,Not the A-hole,"Ok, I know that title is a bit complicated so here's the context:
The college I go to has a guidance councillor/careers advisor. She's a really kind woman probably in her mid to late 40s but thats beside the point. She works with the headmaster of the college to help students get interviews for jobs and Apprenticeships, and she helps them prepare for the interviews.
She helped me get an interview for an Apprenticeship in Sunderland. I live in Newcastle so its a little far, but I agree to go because its only an hour's ride on the metro train. They get me a nice looking shirt and a tie for the interview and everything that they said I can keep, and they helped me prepare for the journey etc. spending a lot of time and effort in general on this.
The day of the interview, I get there 20 minutes early, let reception know I'm there and sit down. 2pm - the time the interview is arranged to happen - arrives. The receptionists leave the room so I quickly make sure I look ok in anticipation for my potential employer. 20 minutes pass and there is literally N O B O D Y around. Not a soul. So I reckon they're not coming and leave. 
Today I came into college, my careers advisor asked me how it went and I explained what happened. She was sympathetic and explained that these things happen etc. just general reassuring advice considering this was the second interview I've ever had.
This whole post concerns the head of my college. He was very angry about this. He called me into his office and started shouting at me once I explained what happened. He claimed he once waited two hours for an interviewer to see him and that these things are normal. He ranted about how I've wasted his, the advisor's and my own time by showing up and then just leaving, and that I ""should have asked someone about it"" despite me telling him around 3 times that there was literally nobody for me to ask. So what's your verdict AITA?",94,103,0.94
1642,Asshole,"I honestly feel like I am taking crazy pills here. My entire family is furious with me over this and I don't even know what to do. I sprained my ankle 10 days ago, only 5 days before my daughters wedding. It was really, really bad. Like so bad that just walking to the bathroom even with crutches is intensely painful and difficult. I thought that maybe, possibly I would be better by my daughters wedding, but on the day before I realized there was just no way I would be able to go. I would be a burden on absolutely everyone and the chances of me falling down and making a disaster of myself were too high. 

&#x200B;

I thought people would understand, after all my daughter saw me in the hospital and was super worried. Instead basically everyone is super pissed off at me. My ex wife was basically screaming at me over the phone, telling me to man up and get on my feet and go. My sister was telling me that she sprained her ankle and was fine soon after (I remember that, it wasn't NEARLY as bad of a sprain). My daughter apparently was incredibly sad but said it was okay because she knew I was in pain, but then later on was apparently upset with me. My son just said he was very, very disappointed that I couldn't just handle the pain and go. I think I got like 15 calls and a bunch of texts saying I need to go. 

&#x200B;

Oddly enough the only person who understood was my son in law, who texted me saying that he understood why I didn't go and hes sorry everyone was being mean to me. He got someone to record a bunch of videos of the wedding to send to me which was sweet. 

&#x200B;

I can barely even walk on it. Like at all, even with crutches its incredibly unstable and REALLY painful. With the crutches I still have to lift the leg, which causes the ankle to go into extreme pain because its holding my foot in the air. I don't even know what I can possibly do to tell them how horrible this is for me, they all already know, they saw me in the hospital and it had only been 5 days since then. Its not like I could have gotten a wheelchair on such short notice, and even besides that the wedding was on a beach with stairs leading to it. 

&#x200B;

I understand being upset I couldn't go, but it feels like everyone is specifically blaming me for this as if I have any control over this. They all think I should have just sucked up the pain and gone. From what I can recall, neither my wife nor my son have ever had any kind of mobility injury like this. Its not the type of thing you can just suck up, its literally an impossibility for me to do most things.

1645,Asshole,"This happened a couple weeks ago.  A big group of us were staying on a lake.  A woman who I had never met before was wearing her wedding ring while she was swimming/playing around.  At one point it fell off her hand and fell into shallow water.  A bunch of us ended up spending alot of time trying to find their ring including using snorkel gear and some old cheap metal detector but never found it.

I suggested to the couple to go out, rent a nice water proof metal detector, and do some searching.  Instead the husband pretty much gave up and put very little effort into looking for it.  He didn't go out and get a metal detector and he only looked for about an hour.  It was frustrating to see so little effort put forth into looking for a 6k ring that had alot of sentimental value.

The following week I rented a very nice metal detector for 45$ and a digging set and drove back to the lake (4 hours away).  After 2 hours BOOM I found the ring.  I was planning on going to a Jeweler / police and asking them to see if the ring had been lost or reported stolen.  Since I know neither one of these will popup since the couple know they lost it in a lake I was going to cash in afterwards.

Question is, now what?  I may have just met the couple but I know who they are and could return it to them.  However they could have just as easily taken the time and found the ring themselves but didn't.  Am I the asshole for wanting to sell it rather than returning it to the owner?",509,1238,0.93
1646,Not the A-hole,"This literally just happened, and I stewed over it the entire way home, wondering if I was being a Karen. So unless there's a sub called r/amithekaren, I figured this is the best place to go.

I went to a local bagel shop to grab a half dozen bagels for me and my partner. It was like 10:30 on a weekday, so it wasn't busy. At this particular store, there are two counters—one where you order, and one where you pay. The woman at the first counter got my bagels immediately, sliced them, and put them in a bag. Then she walked down to the second counter where there was an elderly couple waiting to be rung up. She put my bagels down and cashed out the elderly couple. They added lattes to their order. She told them to have a seat and their order would be right out.

Then she cashed me out, and told me my order would be right out. Even though my bag of bagels was ready and sitting right next to her. She left my receipt in the machine and started making the coffees for the elderly couple. Then she made their sandwiches. Then she took their food and drinks to them. Then she sat down with them and started explaining how to sign up for the store's rewards program. All while my bagels were just sitting right there over the counter. There were no other employees in the front of the house, or else I would have flagged down one of them.

I know I'm not the most patient person, which is why I feel like I'm the asshole. But after 3-4 minutes of standing in line and looking at my food, I reached over the counter, grabbed my bag, and left. At this point, a line had formed behind me, and the people behind me glared at me as I walked out the door. But like, I didn't know how long she was going to be, and I just wanted to get home, make my sandwich, and get on with my day.

1647,Not the A-hole,"
My neighbor is a single woman with two boys, twins aged eight. I don’t know the mother well but I often see the boys, as they play outside in their front lawn pretty often and I’m always working on my yard. They’re cute, sweet, charming kids and I enjoy talking to them from time to time.

Anyway, a few days ago they’re playing outside as usual and the mother comes out and asks me if I can keep watch to make sure they’re ok while she works on something in her basement. I say okay. They are doing normal kid stuff and I’m trimming some bushes, when I hear them arguing. At first I assume it’s a play fight. They are tousling around a bit, and then suddenly one of them slaps the other super hard across the face. The kid falls to the ground, holds his cheek, and starts sniffling. I quickly go over and ask them to calm down,  if they’re ok, what’s going on. The kid who slapped the other starts frantically apologizing, and then both of them tell me that they’re ok and ask me not to tell their mom. I chalk it up to boys roughhousing and tell them just to be more careful and considerate of each other.

Half an hour later they go inside, and one hour after that I get a knock on my door. Their mother has one of the boys in tow and there’s a giant pink and red blotch across his cheek. In hindsight, it actually looks really bad as the kids face is very pale. The mother is very irate and asks me why I wasn’t watching the kids, why I let this happen, why I didn’t immediately call her, etc. she also says her son probably fractured his finger from falling. I tell her sorry, I thought they were ok. She continues yelling and tells me that I’m irresponsible. She literally even pulls out the racism and says that “the Hispanics” like me don’t know how to raise kids. The argument ends with me telling her to get off my property and her continuing to yell for several minutes after I shut the door. I’m speechless. The whole thing seems like a non issue to me, but maybe it’s because of how I was raised.

The next day the two boys come ring my doorbell alone and apologize for what happened. I tell them it’s okay, just don’t fight each other from now on.

1648,Asshole,"I’m 24M. My older brother got married last year and his wife [37F] is pregnant with their first child. This is her first time being pregnant ever.

To start off, my SIL has a somewhat strained relationship with me and my other siblings. We think she takes herself too seriously. But my brother is fiercely protective of her and that’s caused some tension within the family.

I’m not the most enthused about her, mainly because of her rudeness to my girlfriend [20F]. I’m not exactly sure WHAT my girlfriend has done to her, but she doesn’t like her. 

She is 7.5 months pregnant and had a baby shower on Saturday with her friends. Nobody from my family was invited, not even my sister. But still, we all gave her presents. I remembered that she’s into fitness and being healthy so I got her a copy of “The Complete Guide to Postnatal Fitness”. 

(Edit) This is a summary of the book: “The third edition of this Complete Guide. A guide for new mums, fitness leaders and physios on how to regain fitness following the birth of a baby, including lots of exercises, advice, and all relevant anatomy and physiology. Clearly explained, fully updated and packed with exercises. Includes new guidance and up to date references, and all illustrations replaced with new photographs.”

It seemed like a present she would enjoy and the bookstore lady recommended it.  I wrapped it and gave it to her at a family lunch yesterday after her shower.

I also gave her a present my girlfriend had picked out. It was a little teddy bear wearing a shirt that said “Chanel”. It’s kind of tongue in cheek because my SIL loves wearing Chanel.

She didn’t open the presents at lunch but she did later on at home. Last night, I got a call from my brother. He said, “What were you guys playing at by sending those presents?” Apparently my SIL was super offended that I got her a fitness book, because it contained weight loss tips. She’s also mad at my girlfriend because she thinks she’s mocking her for wearing a lot of Chanel. 

I’ll admit, the Chanel thing is sort of an inside joke amongst the family and my girlfriend was being a bit sly with the teddy bear. But the fitness book seems harmless enough. I can see her being annoyed by the implication to lose weight but it’s not really an offensive thing for me to gift, is it? 

AITA? I think my SIL is overreacting. So my GF was being a bit cheeky with the teddy bear, grow up. And the fitness book was recommended to me by the lady in the bookstore when I told her who I was shopping for. It can’t be THAT bad if that’s the case.",818,2397,0.95
1649,Not the A-hole,"So this happened like a week ago and when I mentioned this to my friend and he said I should’ve just let it go. 

So here’s what happened. I was scanning the Marketplace on Facebook for a watch. I see this guy selling nice cheap watches and I decide that it could be an alternate watch I could use. So I PM the guy saying I’m interested on the watch and we plan a meet up. Our meetup was supposed to be at a mall. 

On the day of our Meetup, I send him a text as a reminder of our meetup. He replies with an Ok. So the time of our meetup approaches and I get ready to leave. I text him that, “I’m going there now.” Where he replies, Ok. Now i don’t have a car so i commute going to the mall. I get there and a few minutes later he texts me asking if I could meet him up at the other side of the city. I reply with No because I’m not familiar with that part and the mall is where we agreed to meet up. He explains that somebody else also wants to buy the watch and it’d be easier for him since he is already there. I reply to him saying that if he won’t go to our agreed meet up location then I won’t get the watch. He then replies, “Thanks a lot. I was gonna buy something for my kid after the sale. Now I’m losing money because of you.” 

I go home and I was still mad about the whole thing. So I go to the Marketplace and I decide to rate this guy. I gave him a bad rating. Apparently he saw the notification because he messaged me telling me I’m such an A-hole for doing that. He blocks me after and I don’t get a chance to respond. 

I told my friend and he said that I could’ve just let it go since it wasn’t worth the drama.

1650,No A-holes here,"My sister gave a baby up for adoption around 15 years ago. It’s an open adoption but the child was not placed with family and is one the other side of the country. My sister sees the kid every few years I think. The boy has met my mom once when he was around 6. I have never met him. 

My sister hid the pregnancy but then kept the baby for around a year before placing him for adoption. During that time we did not know of his existence. I don’t know if that makes a difference. We didn’t see her much and there were circumstances surrounding why we saw less of her during that time besides the fact that she was avoiding us. 

My mom thinks I’m an asshole for not listing this kid as family. I say this kid has a family, my sister gave him to one. Isn’t that the point of adoption? I don’t say this out loud. I just don’t list this kid as a nephew and my mom always questions why. AITA for not thinking of him as my nephew?",17,51,0.93

1654,Not the A-hole,"So my GF wants to move out from her parents home. I'm really supportive to her decision since she has to take a lot of shit from her parents for no reason. Her idea is to do flat-sharing with some friends. She asked me if I would pay a small part of her rent, so that she could afford renting a flat. Since I live with my parents, it's going to be easier to hang out at her own place, which means I'm going to spend a lot of time there. So I agreed to pay a part of the rent to help her out, no big deal and almost self-explanatory to me.

&#x200B;

Now the complicated part:

She just found a flat that fits 4 people, which would be perfect for this purpose. There are 4 rooms, which are not all the same size. Two rooms are about 5 square meters bigger than the other two. Because of that, my GF wants to split the rent by square meters per person, rather than the whole rent devided by 4. She brings 2 cats along and would keep their food, litter-box cat tree etc. in her room. Therefore she needs one of the bigger rooms. She would be the one to sign the rental contract. That means she gets to decide the rental conditions for all the other parties. Until now there is just one friend of hers who would move in aswell. She want's the other big room. So only the two smaller rooms are available. I think it's stupid that she and her friend pay more, if she is the one to decide and can't afford the bigger room on her own.

I've also lived in a flat-sharing community once. We just split the whole rent by number of parties, even though none of the rooms was the same size. We assinged the rooms randomly and never lost a word about it being unfair or something. But how she handles this in her flat, is her business.

&#x200B;

Recently my GF asked me, if I want to move in with them, since there are still two unoccupied rooms. I'm pretty down for it because I get along really well with her friend who is moving in aswell. I think it would be pretty dope. If I were to move in, I would play less for the smaller room. But since my GF can't afford the rent of the bigger room, she would still want me to pay a part of her rent. Which makes no sense to me. I get the smaller room and have to pay the same amount or more than my GF, who gets the bigger room... Plus the reason why I was willing to help her out with her rent would be gone, since it wouldn't be her place, it would also be mine. Yes, you could say that if I'm paying the same amount as her would be fair, because I suggested to split by 4 anyways. But I don't understand her point in splitting the rent that way and then demanding me to pay for her part aswell.

WIBTA if I told her she should split the rent by number of parties so she can afford the rent on her own. And if she decides to do it the other way and I move in, I won't be willing to pay a part of her rent? Either way I would probably end up paying the same amout. But this wouldn't be fair for the rest of the flatmates.

&#x200B;

Sorry for not responding individually but i don't have enough time for that rn. I brought this up to her yesterday. It's no problem for her and we will find a way that works for everyone =) Thanks a lot for your oppinions and advices! I have to defend my GF here a bit aswell. Shes genuinely kind and doesn't deserve how she's treated by her parents. She has a full time job but will go to university for the next few years and will have to live from her saved money. I get that few of you don't understand the concept of flat-sharing but it's actually a pretty easy way to get a own place with little money (speaking of about $800/mt.). It's pretty common for students in my country. Howewer she never intended to treat me unfair or something. We will have a look at our options and hopefully be able to find a good solution that meets everyones needs. Thanks again!",117,523,0.95

1656,Not the A-hole,"I've pretty much struggled with my weight all my life. I wasn't overweight as a kid but I always was self conscious about the way I looked, especially my chubby cheeks which stayed with me well into my teens.

I did all the diets, forced myself to skip meals and worked out and did sports a lot from 12-17 years old. Pretty much everyone around me noticed it and were concerned about my eating habits but I always shrugged them off telling them I was fine. All I wanted to do was get rid of my cheeks but they always stayed the same shape no matter how much weight I lost. My parents noticed how bad I looked and forced me to go to a doctor. He was really worried about my weight as I was 48kg and 5'5 at the time but I shrugged him off for years thinking I was fine. 

Until one day I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I'm never gonna lose these fucking cheeks no matter how hard I tried to lose them and started to force myself back into eating.
 
Long story short, I finally started gaining weight again and noticed the difference and was really happy about it. After a year and  a half I've gained 11kg and now weight 59 kg and was pretty proud of how far I've come. I posted a video of me going on a weighing scale while the lyrics on Anaconda played ""Fuck those skinny bitches in the club"" and wrote a caption explaining how I was poking fun at myself for being skinny but finally being able to gain weight again. I thought it would go fine since most of my friends know how hard it's been for me to realize how fucked up my eating habits were. 

One of my friends replied and said I was an asshole because I was making fun of overweight people and how much harder they have it compared to me and I should go eat a sandwich. I was really surprised because I didn't think I was fat shaming anyone at all but now I'm not too sure. I don't know if I was being insensitive or not but it wasn't my intentjon.

On Saturday night, my 16 year old daughter (Elle*) had her first date with a boy that she really likes. They were going to see a movie at about 8pm, so she was still having dinner at home before going out. I cooked steak and potatoes for my children, but I decided I’d also put some garlics in the oven to caramelise as Elle loves roasted garlic. However, I was aware she probably wouldn’t want them tonight if she planned on kissing the boy, and I thought I’d have a bit of fun with that as her Dad. 

When I served up dinner, Elle rejected the garlic as I expected she would. Innocently I asked, “Elle, you love roasted garlic! Why don’t you want them tonight?” She went very red in the face and wouldn’t tell me why. I asked once more and my wife told me to be quiet and that I was embarrassing her. I laughed and apologised to Elle, but also joked to my wife that “I wouldn’t want garlic breath when we first kissed either”. 

My wife and Elle are both very mad at me right now. They think that I embarrassed her for no reason and was being cruel when “no girl wants to bring up kissing with her Dad, especially not garlic breath kissing.” I was just having a little fun. Am I the asshole?

1664,Asshole,"The background: my friend/housemate works at a restaurant chain. Yesterday, my girlfriend and I decided to visit that chain for a date. I texted and asked my friend whether she was working to say hello, and went to eat. Her shift ended halfway through the date, and she came to our table and asked to join us.

Here are where the problems begin. For me, that's the kind of request you politely agree to, even if you're bothered. In my view, she shouldn't have asked in the first place to avoid putting us in an awkward position. But she joined us, and I made the best of things despite being miffed (making conversation and all that). At a certain point a coworker of hers asked her away from the table, and in that period my girlfriend and I finished our food. I texted my friend and told her we would be leaving soon, but that I'd wait a little bit. We waited around 5 minutes, paid our bill, and left. On our way out we ran into her, she looked very hurt by our leaving, and asked why we left. I responded that we finished our food and I was taking my SO home.

Later that evening she texts me and asks whether we were bothered. I opted to be honest and said that yes, we were bothered, but we left because we had finished eating, and it had nothing to do with us being uncomfortable. She responds saying that she was very hurt that I didn't tell her, so I asked to discuss it at home, in person.

For context: my housemate can be difficult to talk to. She has the tendency to respond emotionally very quickly and take things very personally. Things like asking her to change the toilet paper when she finishes it can cause her to be in a weird mood all day. These are tensions that affect our relationship, and after yesterday are pushing me to stop trying.

The bottom line is this: we had an argument. She said that I lied to her (which is true), and made her feel bad for missing a social cue, and that she was very hurt we left. I essentially told her that she did miss a social cue, and that she had no right to react the way she did since she has historically made it difficult to be honest with, that she intruded on our date and we had no reason to wait for her, and that she was being unfair. She kicked me out of her room

1665,Everyone Sucks,"So I think it's best if I set the scene first.
Myself and my friend were invited to a garden party at the weekend, we were both stopping over. The garden party started at 19:00ish.

My friend lives 40 minutes from me, and he is then an hour and 10 minutes from the party. I was driving and picking him up on the way.

The day before I had texted my friend and told him I would ""attempt"" to get to his house for 16:00ish, and that I wanted to detour slightly and pick something up on the way.

Well on the Saturday afternoon I didn't end up setting off to my friend until about 17:45. My fault and later than planned but we would still arrive at a good time. I rang my friend at 16:00 and told him I wouldn't pick him up until later, possibly around 18:00. He was relieved as he had not got ready and was binge watching stranger things...

I rang him when I had set off  telling him I would be there in half an hour. Again, he was relieved because he was STILL watching stranger things and hadn't got ready at all...fine I said, but please get ready now and we can get straight off when I get there...

I arrived at my friends at 18:25, I parked up and rang him... To my surprise he said he had 5 minutes left to watch to stranger things and invited me inside, he has still not packed and was not ready to go. ""No!"" I said, ""I will wait in the car come down where you are ready""

Well 20 minutes passed and I eventually went inside to use the facilities. I waited while he continued getting ready and packing his clothes.. Nearly an hour later we were both in the car ready to set off. It was 19:20. He had taken 55 minutes getting ready...

Bear in mind we are still over an hour from the garden party, 20:00 would have been an okay time to get there I had thought. I then reminded him that we need to take a 20 minute detour as I need to pick something up on the way. He then moaned at me saying to leave it and head straight there. I told him if I had known he was going to take an hour getting ready I could have driven there and back. I was not changing my plans, he had already made us late. He said if anyone enquired as to why we were so late he would blame me. Ludicrous I said.

Despite the tiff I still went on my detour which added 20 minutes to the journey. Certainly alot less than the 55 minutes I had to wait for him. Along the way I said we should probably stop off for somewhere to eat as the food will probably all have been eaten when we arrive. ""sure"" he replied.

Well an hour or so passed and we were about 10 minutes from the party. Despite his protests I stopped at a mcdonalds as I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach. I went inside as I needed a wee and brought some food out, including some nuggets for him. As I sat in the car eating my burgers he had a go at me for not driving and eating at the same time and how I had made us late (the time was about 21:00)

How had I made us late?! I argued. I had given him ample warning what time I was going to be there. He was binge watching Netflix. I said he was disrespectful as he should have been ready when I arrived. He accused me of being disrespectful for not being there at 16:00. But I would still have had to wait an hour for him to get ready?! And I informed him at every step the time I was due to arrive.

1666,Not the A-hole,"This happened at a subway station. We were 5 guys (all 21M) and only I had a bicycle with me. To get down to the station we got in the elevator, and we could just about squeeze all 5 of us + the bike in there.Then a mother with a baby stroller asks us to leave the elevator and tells us its not friendly to not let her in the elevator since 4 of us don´t really need to use it. She probably would´ve fit in there with me and my bike. So:

1. Me + my bike + my 4 friends = works
2. Her + her stroller = works
3. Me + my bike + her + her stroller = works
4. All 6 of us + vehicles = doesn´t work

She didn´t seem to be in a hurry and we weren´t either.Using escalators with those ""vehicles"" isn´t allowed. Carrying a bike downstairs is not recommended at all.Were we as a group TA to use the elevator ourselves and not letting her use it with me (3.)?

1667,Not the A-hole,"Sorry about how I worded the title, English isn't my first language and I don't know how else to say it.

My sister is having a baby and she had a baby shower last weekend. She decided to have it on that particular day about 2 weeks prior. On the other hand, I had been planning to go away for the weekend with my partner and propose to him and I booked a hotel room about a month ago. So as soon as my sister invited us to the baby shower, I said we couldn't come because of previous plans and she was cool about it.

She suddenly decided to have a problem with it when I told her what it was for, after it had already happened. The thing is, we're gay and gay marriage doesn't exist where we live. When I told my sister we had a romantic weekend away and that I proposed to him, she said: That's why you couldn't come to my baby shower? You guys can't marry anyway so what's the point of being engaged?? I can't believe you missed my baby shower because of a meaningless gesture!

She got very angry with us and complained to mom and dad, and they're on her side. My ""fiance"" (the quotes are /s) thinks they're all assholes because they completely shit on our excitement about being engaged by saying it doesn't matter anyway. I am caught between my sister ignoring me and my parents sending me passive aggressive messages, and my fiance telling me that they don't deserve to have me in their lives and I shouldn't try to make amends before they apologize.

I have no idea what to think. I feel horrible about upsetting my sister, but I also feel like it was nasty of her to tell us our engagement doesn't mean anything. I don't know if I need to try to make it up to her, or do as my fiance says and wait until she apologizes to me.

***Edit***: Just to make it clear - my sister had no problem with us not being there when she first told us the date and we said we had plans. She was totally understanding because she understands two weeks is such a short time. However, after the baby shower and the proposal weekend were over, she and her husband, my partner and I all had dinner together, we gave them a present for the baby and announced that we got engaged. She then realized that that's what happened that weekend and got mad because, in her opinion, I could have postponed the proposal since we can't legally marry anyway.",308,2133,0.95

1669,Not the A-hole,"A solution with my SO on this topic has already been reached, but I want to know if I was in the wrong to start with.

I don’t wear a bra if I don’t have to (I.e. if it’s not for work/a formal event). I have some chronic illness/pain issues that make it very uncomfortable to wear one for more than a few hours at a time. It gets to the point where I can have shooting pain all over my body and become nauseous. I don’t wear bras with any underwire or extra padding to help mitigate the issue, but it only does so much. SO knows this, and my family knows this, but his family does not, or if they have been told they’ve forgotten. They usually don’t speak directly to me, and will ask/talk about me through SO.

Anyway, yesterday I had to work for about 6 hours in the morning (wearing a bra the whole time because work), and I’ve been more exhausted lately, which can cause pain to come on more easily and be more noticeable for me. It ended up being one of those nausea days, which makes me even more exhausted. 

We had SO’s niece’s birthday/pool party to go to later that day (turned 8), and I didn’t want to seem rude or sick due to my discomfort. I did not wear a bra. I also did not wear a shirt that was tight (my shirt was baggier than SO’s) nor see-through. The most I did was tie it to the side so it would have some shape to it on the lower half of my torso. I thought this would be okay, a nice compromise, and you wouldn’t be able to tell unless you were really trying to look, especially since I have kinda small boobs. SO didn’t even realize until we were already there and he was rubbing my back a little in the spot where my bra would be.

SO was upset later because a) how could I dare to not wear a bra around family? And b) especially around kids? 

We didn’t interact with any of the kids. We sat at tables with adults on the opposite side of the venue who were drinking margaritas while the kids swam. Everyone else was dressed in similarly casual and loose fitting clothes, and the kids were all in bathing suits. His sister was even wearing a strapless dress, so, being more covered than the mother of the child, I thought I was fine, given everything else I had done to be appropriate.

I think his big problem was what his family and his niece’s father’s family would think, how they would judge me/us. His family has judged me before to him, but never to my face, and he never told me until after the party yesterday that they had in the past (not even at this event), so how was I supposed to know?

We agreed that next time I would wear an extra tank top underneath around his family. I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I also don’t want to feel like puking around his family all the time. I can manage that as a compromise and maybe should have done that to begin with.",132,203,0.9

So my fiancé and i go visit his dad once a month my fiancé is (21 and I’m 18)

When we first started visiting we agreed that we would pay the way there, and he would pay the way back because we’re on a limited income a month and have to budget it in.

So we went this weekend and his dad took us to Canada’s wonderland because he wanted to have a fun day, which were very greatful for. 

Last night he asks us if we have the money to pay for the ride home, this is how the conversation went. 

H (him) F (fiancé) 

H: so you guys got the money to get home tomorrow?

F: no... we thought you were paying.

H: well i figured since we payed for everything this weekend you could pay for the ride home.. how much is it?

F: 33$

H: really, you guys can’t afford THAT?

F: *stands there uncomfortably* sorry, thank you.

So he puts the money on the table and we say our goodbyes because he works early the next day. 

So we wake up today and he’s talking to his girlfriend about how we took advantage of him and how we disrespected him all weekend and not helping doing anything (which my fiancé offered to help with every little thing but refused any kind of help). He was calling is disrespectful, rude and selfish kids. Note: he thought we were sleeping so he could talk all the shit he wants without us defending ourselves.

If we had budgeted in the ride home, we could have afforded it, but we didn’t know we were paying so we can’t just take money out of the budget like that, we have bills with a very limited amount of money to spend. 

I’ll be giving the 40 $ back to him with a note that says, “I’d rather go hungry half the month, than be called a disrespectful kid.” 

So Are we the assholes ??

Edit: we decided not to leave the petty note

Edit #2: we decided not to come visit his dad as much because all we do is get judged and criticized for our decisions  and our mistakes, it’s been hard on my fiancé’s mental health.

Every time she sets her alarm it goes off and she snoozes it 1-2-3 more times. Which wakes me up and most days I end up just being up for the day much earlier than I need/want to. 

I’ve suggested that when I’m tired or need extra sleep that I’ll just sleep in the guest room on those nights. However that is met with much disdain from her, as she wants us to sleep in the same bed because that’s what couples do.

1675,Not the A-hole,"**Edit: Sign a prenup**

Context: My girlfriend and I have been together for just over 9 years. When I met her, we both had pretty stable and well paying jobs within the same industry (though at different companies).

4 years into our relationship I decided I wanted to leave and start my own competing business. I felt as though my career wasn't progressing, I had made a lot of useful contacts working there, and quite frankly that I could do a better job than my employer which was full of dead weight.

I had a lot of money saved up, but needed more to really get started, so naturally looked to getting a bank loan. At the time I asked if my girlfriend would be willing to cosign since I'd be able to get a better interest rate and we both planned on getting married eventually anyway (I haven't proposed, but we've talked about it lots before and there's no doubt she'd say yes). My girlfriend refused because she didn't feel comfortable taking on the debt, and I left it at that. I never pushed her beyond an initial ask.

Moving forward to now, my business has been enormously successful owing to some extremely helpful friends of mine along with a lot of hard work. The topic of marriage recently comes up since her younger sister just got engaged, and she wanted to ""make it official."" I agreed, and asked if she would be willing to sign a prenup concerning my business. Specifically, to protect not just my current business value, but also future growth over the course of our marriage. I have **no problem** with excluding marital assets like a house/savings/etc which I'd be happy to split 50/50.

This caused into the largest fight in which she accused me of being greedy, cynical, and just an all around asshole for even asking for a prenup. In her words, ""what the fuck does till death do us part mean to you?""

I don't think I did anything wrong. My girlfriend was unwilling to take the risk when I started my business by cosigning the loan, so I think it's fair to protect it in case our marriage fails. 

For further background, my girlfriend has never had anything to do with the business despite working in the same industry.",645,1823,0.96

What I don’t understand however, is my coworker, who is a native Londoner. She is seriously degrading towards Americans and the US, and consistently makes derogatory remarks about things like ‘ew, American women don’t care if they fat- have you seen the stuff they wear? They let it all hang out’ or ‘wow you guys are so thick, you can’t even point to England on a map’ etc. Just really stereotypical comments. Anything American, the British can do better, apparently. 

She has been in this country for 12 years, her son is American and so is her husband. She’s not new to the culture. Recently we’ve been asked to oversee the opening of a new office in California.

We are doing this project as an equal endeavour as we both bring different strengths to the team.

I've known my roommate for almost 10 yrs, and I was practically raised in his house. We moved in together 3 yrs ago, we have a 2 bedroom apartment. 

On the 4th of July, my roommate's brother shows up to drop Amy off at our apartment, apparently my roommate was supposed to be babysitting this time around but he buggered off to his girlfriend's house, later claiming he forgot. So I offered to babysit instead. Amy's parents were throwing a bachelor's party at their house for a friend. They were supposed to pick Amy up at 11 PM, but there was a incident, cops got involved. They asked if she could stay the night at my house. I accepted. 

My roommate locks his bedroom door when he leaves because the latch doesn't work and my dogs (I have 3) will get in there and mess with his stuff, so his bed was out of the question. The living room only has 2 arm chairs and a bean bag chair, so neither of us could sleep in there. So we ended up in my king size bed together.

Oh, you liked the last Avengers movie? Well, I THINK IT'S FOR MENTALLY CHALLENGED CHILDREN. Oh, your eyes are brown. THE COLOR OF SHIT*.

I'm exaggerating but only slightly. She will turn every conversation into a diatribe about what she hates, what she thinks is stupid, and in what many ways you are dumber than her. Most other coworkers just sort of wait until she's done and leave or ignore her completely and leave before she gets the chance to start talking, but as soon as I met her, she seemed to really enjoy making ME in particular feel like shit and I couldn't escape her. So I made it a point to tell her if she was going to have that attitude, she shouldn't speak to me at all.

I mention that he's muslim because she is British, has never been religious at all and comes from a vaguely christian background. This came about very suddenly with no warning at all, one week we were happily married, still sleeping together, future plans, etc the next it was over. We have 2 small children (6 and 8) who took it reasonably well. I was devastated and it completely broke me for a long time because I was 100% in love with her and would have done anything for her, I begged her to go to marriage councelling but she would not. She says that the marriage wasn't working for her but had never told me! She is a workaholic and I did pretty much all of the childcare when we were still together, now we split it 50/50 but she gets rid of them to relatives and clubs as much as she can so that she can do more work.

 and he lived there too but she decided to move closer to where his friends are to a bedsit where she cannot look after the children (it's an hour away from their school, only has one bed) so she lives in a back room of our family home when i'm not around. I now have a girlfriend that I stay with when I don't have the kids. We mostly get on ok with not too much arguing and we've kept this all out of court (and are not actually divorced yet) because neither of us have much money. I don't want to sell the house yet as I won't be able to get a mortgage on a big enough place for myself and the kids but I have considered moving and making do to be finally free of her, her response was that she would only see the kids in the holidays if I won't let her stay at my new house, she would not consider moving closer to where her kids live.

I recently had a vasectomy, I'm 44, we have 3 kids and we aren't planning on having any more. After one Sunday lunch with our BILs, we sent the kids away and us adults had some drinks and started talking about my vasectomy.

My BIL laughed and said: What are you talking about, we haven't used protection since high school.

I was going to reply something, but the kids came running in so I dropped the topic. I later thought about what he said and talked to my wife about it, saying that I don't think it's safe for them to be having sex without condoms, as a couple of gay men, and my wife laughed at me. Apparently, just because they've been together for a long time, it's safe? She told me to drop it and let them live their lives however they want.

I thought it was ridiculous of her to have that reaction to her own brother not using protection and realized she wasn't going to tell them anything about it.

I rehearsed a whole speech about how I wouldn't want anything to happen to them and that they should stay safe.

They said they had never slept with anyone else their whole lives and if they managed to have an exciting enough sex life not to cheat on each other for 12 years, they'll probably manage the same in the future.

Now everything is cramped in our 2-family and my dad is sleeping in the living room while my sister and her infant son are in his room and I'm in the other bedroom on the top half of the house.

Recently, my dad has gotten frustrated with sleeping on the air mattress in the living room and decided that he would like to have his own room again so he decided that my sister would take my room and he would take back his room and *I* would sleep in the living room instead.

Let me say first and foremost that I don't mind the  air mattress or sleeping in the living room, but I know that my nephew's crib will *not* fit in my bedroom since I have a desk and a bookshelf that take up a lot of space in a small room. My dad's room is the perfect size for them. I brought this up to him but he insisted on taking the bigger room. I even offered to let him sleep in my room and use it when he came back from work so he had a place to relax after a long day (he is a landscaper so his job is tiring) but again he refused. I believe he is being stubborn and he insists that my sister take my room but I know that in order for that to happen, he would need to get rid of my things and I don't want to do that because they serve important purposes. 

It doesn't help that my sister is incredibly nosey, nasty, and entitled. I really don't want to do her any favors but my nephew and dad both deserve their comfort. I just don't think it should come at my own expense.

1688,Asshole,"I’m the mom of two girls: 8 and 10 years old, with my husband. I also have a 21 year old step daughter that I’ve known since she was 6, We took her to Disney when she was 11, before our 10 year old was born. Fast forward to now, we’ve decided our younger girls are old enough to go. My in-laws are coming (paying their own way) and my sister is too (also paying her own way).

As I’m sure you know, Disney is expensive. We’ve been saving up for awhile and assumed when we were going, it was a time that my step daughter couldn’t come because of college classes. She told us that she’ll be off that week so she can. I explained that we can’t afford to take her too, but if she can save up for the park fare and plane ticket (she can stay in one of the rooms), then she can come.

She got mad and said it wasn’t fair that we had planned this family trip without her, and that I expect her to pay it on her own when she’s a college student. She has a job, but she doesn’t make a lot. Her grandparents can’t help her much either, but are now saying they feel bad about going and maybe we should post pone until we can all go. I said that she’s an adult and it’s not unreasonable to ask her to pay her own way. They ended up agreeing, but my step-daughter is even more upset and my sister is starting to side with her (though she can’t financially help her).

Are we being unfair here?

ETA: She would be missing college classes to attend this trip, just to be clear.

ETA2: Okay Guys, wow. I didn’t expect this to blow up the way it did. I think the real eye opener was people accusing me of not loving my step daughter as much as my bios, which isn’t at all true. I’ve raised her and love her so much.

However, I can see how it would come across that way, to you guys and even to her. I apologized to her and we’re putting off the trip until we can all go as a family (without anyone skipping school, and with my husband & I paying for all the kids).",1046,2455,0.95
1689,Not the A-hole,"A friend (21m) of mine (20f) went through a rough break up not too long ago and he’s been slow to bounce back. He’s a good looking guy, but a little socially awkward and his self esteem isn’t great. I’m not interested in dating him, but I thought a little romp might give him a pick me up. One night we were hanging out and I hit on him, one thing led to another, and we started having sex. I didn’t push him or anything, just let him know I was physically interested, and he responded a bit hesitantly but positively. We were literally right in the middle of doing the deed when he broke down crying. He said he still missed his ex so much and he thought he was ready for a hook up but he isn’t. I told him it was no problem, that I hadn’t meant to make him uncomfortable, and that we could just talk about things if he wanted. It was altogether kind of awkward but I didn’t think it was a huge deal. But now, some of my friends know about it and think it was shitty of me. They say I shouldn’t have used sex to try and cheer him up. I guess when they put it that way, I feel bad, but I really thought a good lay might make him feel better. And obviously as soon as he wanted to stop we stopped and I didn’t push it. But I don’t know. AITA?

EDIT: A lot of talk surrounding how my friends know. I confided in my two room mates about the situation because having a dude start crying during sex was so unexpected and I wanted their advice. They don’t know the guy and knew I wanted to keep this between us. You can say I’m the asshole for telling them, but I was not bragging and I did not want to humiliate the guy. I just wanted their advice.",135,223,0.93
1690,Not the A-hole,"TLDR; Friend doesn't respect certain boundaries of mine (not sure if that's even the right way to phrase it) .. I've told her directly multiple times that it bothers me ... so WIBTA if I give her a taste of her own medicine?


So a little backstory ..... I've got a weird thing about feet, I hate them, even my own. When I was a kid my phobia was so bad that I was NEVER barefoot, except for swimming/showering etc. If even my own bare feet touched any of my bedding or a piece of clothing, I'd immediately have to wash it. I've gotten a ton better over the years, I have to wash my hands after touching my feet, but that's about it. I still don't like other people's feet, won't touch them and don't want them near me. 

My friend knows about this phobia, we've been friends for about 10 years, I was her maid of honor. Lately, she thinks it's funny to put her foot on me, and laughs at me freaking out. I've gotten pissed off and yelled at her about it, and she tells me I'm overreacting and it's ""just a foot"". I've also had serious talks about it with her, telling her I don't do things I know bother her, so why would she keep doing these things just to bug me. 

I have another ""quirk"" she knows about, where I would just rather people put the lid down on the toilet before flushing. I even have a funny vinyl sticker on it to remind people. (Google toilet flush plume, that explains why I prefer this). She will use my washroom, then come out joking about how she left the lid up. If I confront her about this, she says I'm ridiculous to be worried about it because I let my dog on the furniture, so according to her it's all covered in poop now anyways.

I'm frustrated, and talking to her about it doesn't seem to make a difference, so WIBTA if I stop avoiding doing things that bother her in the same way? If she doesn't respect my boundaries, why should I respect hers? 

I know this might not be the mature way to handle it, but it's really stressing me out and I'm on the verge of just cutting her out and moving on. I don't really want to throw away a 10 year friendship, but I'm really at the end of my rope with her, there's been other problems, but these are the most recent.

1691,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so I was doing my student teaching and at the very end of the year, the last time I would see the class before their final, the student Bill was upset that he was getting only 88% and felt he deserved an A.

&#x200B;

This is high school sophomore English. He had received +90% on his essays and projects through the term, but had a \~60% on participation and classwork. Projects and essay were weighted in the gradebook, but in spite of that, Bill still was at a B.

&#x200B;

I explained that his behavior in class (frequently being on his phone, distracting neighbors, randomly yelling ""Timmy time"" during class) impacted others and showed that he wasn't interested in the class. He tried to argue things like that since he turned in the final draft, he shouldn't be penalized for not doing any of the pre-work or the rough draft.

&#x200B;

I decided to let him write an essay that explains why he deserves an A and that I would bump his grade. I want to stress this part while I said that the essay would need to be in MLA style, I did not specify that I would be deciding this based on the content of the essay. I sort of felt that writing an essay is an extra credit task, doesn't need too much scaffolding.

&#x200B;

Last day of school, Bill turns in an essay that was not in MLA style.  I glance at it, but don't read it and tell him I will put it in the gradebook. Bill did not stay, and its probably a good thing. His essay had two main arguments: participation should not be a factor in grading and only end products should be considered and that I, being visually impaired, cannot assess a class accurately on participation.

&#x200B;

Needless to say he did not get an A. But am I the A-hole? Does it seem like I broke a verbal agreement with the student and cheated him out of an A? Saw Bill on public transit the other day and it was AWKWARD.

&#x200B;

Edit: If this is not clear from the post, or if this matters: I am in fact visually impaired.

1693,Not the A-hole,"So basically, I made a will for myself. I was a student funeral director who knew how south things go when there isn't a will so i got one in place my first day of classes. I took it a step further and included in the package (actual will, power of attorney, health care directive) who I did and did not want attending my funeral, and who and who may not speak at it.

Specifically, there is this dude I know who thinks he's God's gift to the planet. He's about 70, but literally EVERYONE I know has a story of why they don't like him. But he's a force in the church, so he is usually speaking at funerals.

I have NEVER heard eulogies that never mention the deceased, but this guy manages it. He bitches about himself, his wife, his whoever the whole eulogy, and suddenly remembers its a funeral in his last sentence after an hour of talking. At HIS WIFE'S DAD'S FUNERAL he said it was hard for him because she wanted to proofread the obit.

So I specified that this dude, his cronies, and several family members are not to be allowed in. I have also specified that none of them are to speak, and whoever is to speak will read a eulogy written by me (I write it yearly, changing anything to keep up with the times) because it drives me nuts that funerals aren't about the person who died.

I have no plans for dying any time soon, but as anyone in the funeral industry will tell you, sometimes there's no control over that, so I want my ducks in a row now. But I was told I shouldn't be so demanding, so AITA",88,203,0.95
1694,Not the A-hole,"So I live on a formally quiet street in a rural town in Oregon. I've lived on the same street for 20+ years (I'm 26). No complaints. The neighbors are friendly and I couldn't think of an issue other than some occasionally barking dogs.

Until last year.

So last year a new family moved in an they're a bit rough to live next to. But the big thing is that two or three times a week they have a little house party of about ten-twenty people. No big deal right? I wouldn't think so. Except for their five foot tall party speaker. Pointed at my room. From twenty feet away. Full volume. Mariachi.

Two to three times a week my house shakes. My animals hide. My little sisters cry. You can hear the beat from the other side of town. I can't hear my tv from six feet away. The street is halfway blocked by their SUV's. My home becomes unlivable as long as their party goes on. My dad went next door and asked very nicely (he's a lot better of a man than I am) for them to turn it down and they told my super sweet and friendly dad to ""fuck off"". Nice. I called the cops and they said as long as they turned it off by midnight it wasn't a crime. Well even if it was our podunk PD doesn't deal with crimes that don't involve meth (word for word from one of our very best public servants).

So about three weeks ago the cars pulled up and the music started up at 2pm and something broke inside me. I waited till it seemed like the party was in full swing then I put on an absolutely ridiculous outfit of pink shorts and a super tight A-top (am a cis-gendered, pasty, skinny guy with a beard for mental imagining). Climbed up on top of my roof overlooking party yard. Then I put on a show. Without going to much into it I put on the weirdest bit of interpretive dance surely ever performed to mariachi music whilst also shouting loud insults that would have made the frenchmen from Monty Python's Holy Grail proud. The party quickly stopped and all the male attendees challenged me to a fight en mass. I refused and kept the dance. Then they threatened to call the police. I told them that was a wonderful Idea and that I'd love to talk to them too. Also their fathers smelt of elderberries. For some reason they didn't call the cops. After about ten minutes they turned the music off and went inside. I got off the roof and collapsed from exhaustion and burnt feet.

Several minutes later the music started again and I wearily regained the roof. But lo as soon as they saw the pink shorts they spat curses (well more like all looked at eachother and then me again and muttered them) and retreated inside again. That was almost a month ago and they haven't had a party since. In fact I haven't heard their barking dog or loud violent kids either. The blessed silence is ample reward for me. What do you guys think? Was it worth it?

Edit: Yes they're Hispanic but so are the majority of families on the street and those families are as fed up with these folks as we are.",49,216,0.91

1697,Not the A-hole,"Bit of an odd story. I'm a Cowboys fan and my husband is an Eagles fan. We actually met tailgating at a Cowboys Eagles game back in 2010. 

Fast forward to 2018 and we found out we were pregnant. My husband and I have vastly different taste when it comes to boy names. I love classic and traditional names and he prefers names that are much more uncommon. We decided that to make a bet. If the Cowboys made it farther than the Eagles, I got naming rights. If the Eagles made it farther than the Cowboys, he got naming rights. We did something similar for our dog but that was with fantasy football. Now we have a doggo named Mcnabb. 

Both were eliminated in the divisional round. After some disagreement (the Eagles technically made it one more day but only because they played on Sunday) we decided the higher record would win. That meant I had primary naming rights. 

We had our baby about 2.5 weeks ago. I gave him a traditional name that is associated with a former Cowboys player. I posted his picture and name on Facebook for friends and family to see (I live in a different state than my family) and so many people asked how I convinced my die hard Eagles fan husband to give my son a name that was associated with a Cowboy. I told them our bet and all hell broke lose. People asked how I could make my husband give up his naming rights, his brother said I should be ashamed, and my own mom said she couldn't believe we let our son's name ride on a football season. 

My husband isn't mad about this in the slightest. In fact, he has said he wants to do it again and that he'll be naming the child Carson regardless of the gender if/when he wins. I don't see the big deal. His brother said that there is no way my husband would have went through with it if I lost but my husband said that he would. We agreed to this bet but everyone flipping out made me question it.",267,705,0.95
1698,Asshole,"I am at my limit with him.

I work in a tech company, and being the only woman, a lot of the men in the office like to come and have a chat with me. There's nothing wrong with this as in our field we have some amount of downtime, and our boss doesn't seem to mind, so I'm always happy to be sociable.

One of my colleagues is a nice enough person, but his breath is so foul, and he is so unaware of this fact, that I cannot stand it anymore. He has the kind of bad breath where it's clear that there is rotting food stuck between his teeth, and when he smiles, you can see it too. When he has been in a room and spoken in the last 20 minutes, even if he is gone, you can still smell the lingering sour nearly vomit inducing breath left behind.

Worse yet, when he comes and talks to me, he has no concept of personal space so he keeps inching in closer to talk when I pull back. He is so blissfully unaware of how he smells that I think he is legitimately confused as to why I will pull my head back whenever he comes to strike up a conversation. It's the same thing over and over; I will be sitting, doing work, and he'll come up and greet me. Assaulted with the putrid odor coming from his mouth, I'll wheel my chair back a bit, and he'll interpret this as an invitation to move slightly closer. So I'll move back again, and yet again, he'll move in more. 

One thing that I figured out a couple of weeks ago is that if I stand up and position my right leg in front of me with my left leg back, kind of like an elderly yoga class version of a Warrior I pose, he won't actually physically climb on my front leg to close the distance between our faces. He is completely unaware of why I do this.

Of course this doesn't completely mitigate the effect of his breath on my urge to vomit, as he tends to speak very loudly, and laugh in a boisterous way (think hHHHHHHAAAA hhhhhAAAAAAAAAAAA hhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHaaaaa). 

I can't tell him directly. I'm afraid that he will immediately hate me. But I am at my wits' end here. I don't want him to necessarily get in trouble and if I were to take this up the chain of command I would make that perfectly clear. But I've legitimately thought about quitting because of this.",38,55,0.89
1699,Not enough info,"I'm (28F) from a family of 4 other brothers. 3 older, 1 younger. My parents, my mom especially, have always coddled my brothers, to an unhealthy point in my opinion. They are all still dependent on my parents in some form or another, with the 3 older being over the age of 30 and my younger one who is 23. 

The 23 year old is in college and currently commutes an hour every day to school. He wants to move out and be independent, so good for him right? Well then my parents started talking about buying a home by the college for an investment property, to rent out to college kids. My brother would live there and rent the home while going to college. I said that sounded like a good idea. 

Well come to find out, they plan on having my dad cosign the home with my little brother (who isn't paying any part of the down payment). My brother would live there with roommates, but then if he got married in the future, it would just be his home and my parents would not be making additional income off rent. My parents are both older, so it's likely they wouldn't sell the home and get equity before they passed either. Meaning my brother would get it all as he is part owner. Then my mom said if they did end up selling it, my brother would get 50%. 50% equity for pretty much putting nothing into it. 

Once I found this out I tried asking what their motivations were, as I thought they wanted investment property and it sounds like they are getting absolutely nothing from this. My mom got really defensive and started accusing me of being jealous. I said no, that they are just making a really dumb financial decision this late in their life (both retired and have just enough for a comfortable retirement). Then she said she wants to get him a house before the market gets too crazy. More coddling!

Anyways after 3 years my aunt went back to Nicaragua because she did not like it here, I can count in one hand the amount of times I’ve talked to her since she left. So the other day, i receive a text message on WhatsApp from her asking me how I was, etc etc.... I respond to her and tell her that I am currently at work that I won’t be able to text her back. She responds saying it’s fine, that we could talk later. An hour or so later she sends me a text saying that she’s been sick lately and that she doesn’t have the money to buy medicine due to the situation being tough back in Nicaragua, which I understand. I see the text on the my lock screen but I don’t read it. My boss who also uses WhatsApp sent me a couple of messages work related and I opened the app. I’m still at work so I haven’t responded to my aunt. 30 minutes later I get a text from her saying “Wow thank you so much nephew for having the courtesy to respond to me when I’m in need”. Now this really bothered me when it finally wrapped around my head. I didn’t mean not to reply to her, but I’m obviously at work so I couldn’t get to her at the moment. I get home and explain the situation to my mom, she tells me that she was going to talk to her, she also confirms with me that she has been sick and I should probably send her the money. I was honestly very bothered by the fact that she sent that last message the way she did and I explained to my mom that I didn’t want to send her any money because of that and the fact that I hadn’t talked to her in so many years and the first time she reaches out to me is to ask me for something. I already send a pretty decent amount of money to my grandma bi-weekly for her to be good over there. I also buy shoes, send clothes, and money to my dad who also lives over there. So me sending money when I can is not a problem but I don’t like the way this situation unfolded.

1703,Not the A-hole,"My son is at a high school where drinking and drugs are rampant. 

He’s a great kid. He studies hard and he has a job and he always tells me or his mom where he’s going to be when he leaves the house. 

A couple weeks ago he came to me and said he was curious about drinking, that he knows it isn’t good for him and we’d be really disappointed if he went out and drank, but he wants to know what he’s missing. 

I explained about people feeling alcohol relaxes them in social situations, self medicating, how a lot of his friends just drink to look cool to other people and wouldn’t actually be doing it if they didn’t feel they had to, etc. 

But when I started thinking these same thoughts around his age, it was the beginning of my going out and experimenting behind my parents backs. 

So I told him there was nothing mystical or special about alcohol and to prove to him he wasn’t missing some once in a lifetime teenage experience, I’d get us some beers and we could drink them together at home. I just asked he promise me he wouldn’t go out and drink at house parties because he’d be putting himself in unsafe situations and jeopardizing his health. 

He had a can and a half before he was tipsy  (he’s 120-125 pounds soaking wet) and barely even got that far because he hated the taste. 

He said thanks for the experience, it sucked, he wouldn’t be taking up drinking. 

Obviously I said if he had any other questions or if anything ever happened he could always come to me. And that was that. 

My wife is ENRAGED. I didn’t think to run this by her (yes, that part was a mistake) because usually we’re on the same page about child raising decisions and put up a united front. She’s convinced it’s done some sort of irrepressible damage to his brain to get drunk that one time. My argument is better once under our supervision than who knows how often at strangers houses. 

She says showing demystifying alcohol and making it seem like less of a big deal will make him more likely to drink, not less. I disagree.

1704,Not the A-hole,"Long time lurker, first time poster, auto-correct's worst nightmare. 

I work for a small company that conducts training for professionals in many fields. Many of these lessons are in the evening, and it has a night school kinda vibe. As such, my work hours usually start up around midday and end after 10 pm. During the day I spend the time in meetings, planning courses, meeting with clients and other duties as we have a small company and everybody has a hyphenated job title.

One day I had a full day of internal meetings and lessons but I got really sick the night before. So very early the next morning, I messaged everyone who I had internal meetings with via our company messenger (including our CEO) and then also sent the HR manager a message saying that I wouldn't be in for the day. They all responded and told me to get some rest etc. 

Later that evening, I get a frantic flurry of messages and a call from the HR manager saying that no one is there for my lessons, and I should have told her that I wasn't going to make it. The thing is, I told her I wasn't coming in for the day.

Now, I was pretty in and out of it for the day. I was pretty sick with fever and chills and the full shebang. I sent messages over the company messenger because it was the quickest way to let people know I wasn't coming in. It is our company policy that to have a sick day recorded you need to email HR with your request. I was going to request the day of retroactively, after I felt better, which is what many employees do. For me, it was a matter of letting all the relevant parties know of my absence asap so they could adjust accordingly.

My HR manager blamed me for leaving lessons unattended and in the next company-wide meeting they discussed how to ""punish"" employees who do this in the future. In our company protocol, if we are sick, we must send an email to HR and if it's an emergency, like a couple hours before lessons, we can send the manager a message, via a phone messenger like Whatsapp or whatever. 

The thing is, I messaged early in the morning when I realized that I was not going to make it. Hours before I was even due at work. And everyone affected responded. I was totally pissed and written up for this infraction. It was noted that I was absent from lessons without contacting the company. 

The CEO even questioned the HR manager about getting a message because I even messaged him and he knew I wasn't going to be there that day. However because the message didn't come via the outlined methods in our protocol, he didn't fight when she said that technically I didn't tell them I was going to be absent. 

For this, I have refused to apologize to the HR manager and I am annoyed because I felt like I did my due diligence with informing everyone of my absence. I feel picked-on, but perhaps I am being a snowflake in this situation.

Looking forward to people weighing in. AITA here?

1706,Asshole,"I just moved in with three housemates, and for the first few weeks of living together, we bought groceries for the whole house and split the bill evenly. Last week, I bought my own groceries but still intended to eat dinner at home with the shared groceries, so I was fine with contributing to the bill. Going into the week, it was my housemates' and my expectation that I contribute equally to the grocery bill. That week I ended up coming home later than I had in previous weeks, at a time when my housemates had finished eating and either left an insufficient amount of food for an additional person to eat dinner, had leftovers that were made from groceries I bought and not charged them for but also not told them not to eat, or I cooked for myself or ate my own leftovers (shouts out Panera). I didn't plan to eat this way, but that's how it worked out that week. 

My housemates were understandably confused when I let them know at the end of the week that I hadn't eaten the household groceries at all that week and that I thought I shouldn't have to pay for them as a result. Their perspective is that we can't force each other to eat in a timely manner and that everyone had an equal opportunity to take what we had in the fridge and pantry. They also say that they made enough food for everyone since they bought enough food for everyone, and that there was always dinner available. 

I responded by saying that none of us were paying for the privilege of looking at groceries sitting in the fridge or simply having them available to us, but for eating groceries themselves. They also consumed the food all on their own and none of it went to waste.

My housemates think I should have to pay for the groceries from last week that were theoretically apportioned to me when they were purchased, even though I didn't eat any of the food included in the bill.

Am I the asshole?

EDIT: It seems I'm the asshole for not having been communicative enough, and I fully recognize that and agree, and the system is wack and I've since completely and clearly opted out, but would being the asshole mean that as a result I should have to pay them for food that only they ate? They would have had to go out and buy additional groceries if they hadn't eaten what was originally intended for me.

I don’t mind that she’s going to see other friends, but it’s frustrating that she says she’s here for my birthday but isn’t hanging out with me the only time I’m off. I was a little hurt and being petty asked her if she was planning on renting a car since she’s flying into Seattle (since I’m not going to get her.) She said sure and got really quiet afterwards. The thing is I probably would have tried to make the drive to Seattle if she was spending the whole time with us, but since she’s not prioritizing us with her time, I feel like I shouldn’t go out of my way to prioritize her.

I told him no.

1714,Asshole,"My friend and I disagree strongly on this, and as we both lurk this subreddit, we saw no better way to solve the argument than right here.

Some background information. I've never owned a pet before so I don't know completely how one is supposed to be treated. This past week, I was staying at friend A's house for a few days with her parents, and they owned a cat. It was super friendly, so I wasn't worried about being bitten or anything, but I never carried it around or really handled it in any way either. Friend B was also present. For the first three days I was there, the cat would always come up to the table while we were eating and paw on our chairs to get some of the food. When it came up to us, the family would shoo it away. But it would come over time and time again to beg, and I honestly felt bad for it.

Here's where the fuck up happened. The parents made some steaks and put it on plates for us to eat. When we were finished eating, there was only one steak left on the plate. Around 10 minutes after we finished eating, something happened that drew everyone's attention to a different room; it was important, but also none of my business, so I stayed behind at the table. Seeing this opportunity, the cat walks over, and jumps from the floor, to an empty chair, to the table, and starts eating the last steak. My first instinct was to tell the family, but they were super engrossed in what they're doing. So not wanting to disturb them, and frankly not seeing the situation as urgent, I just let the cat keep eating the steak. Admittedly, friend A's dad walked through room at some point and didn't notice the cat; I could have told him, but had never really talked to him before, and felt uncomfortable doing so.

By the time everyone comes back, the cat actually finished the entire steak and had begun licking the plate clean. Apparently, they didn't want the cat eating people food at all, and were shocked after realizing it finished the whole thing. The parents weren't mad at me, but friend B says I'm TA for letting the cat eat it. She argues that I should have known that the cat wasn't allowed to eat people food given how everyone was treating it, and that someone else might have wanted the steak for later; I should have told the dad, or just moved it myself. As I see it, I shouldn't have been expected to know how to treat someone else's pet, and even if I did I shouldn't be expected to physically move it away from the table. If someone wanted the steak, they should have put it somewhere where the cat couldn't reach it, given they had time to before leaving it alone. Plus the damn thing wanted human food the whole time I was there, and I didn't want to take the moment away from it. AITA?

My fiancé has 5 siblings, who are now married, plus a bunch of cousins. Our families agreed to help us pay for the wedding. We were all getting along great in the beginning, but then things got hectic. It was slowly becoming less and less about “us” and more about what everyone else wanted. A lot of money was also being spent, but not ours.

Eventually, it got so tiring. The wedding wasn’t becoming what we wanted and if we complained, we were told that we weren’t planning it. Eventually, my fiancé and I decided to elope. We ran off and got it done one weekend. It was so freeing and relaxing, with no one’s expectations weighing us down.

We got back and told our families. They were pissed. A lot of deposits are non-refundable. My parents are saying we should go through with the wedding as planned and do it for the family.

1722,Not the A-hole,"To render a much longer story short, my mother abandoned me at birth. I was largely raised by one aunt and my grandparents with occasional bouts of my mother dropping in until I was 8. Then she got involved with my step dad and I would spend one or two weekends a month with them until  I was in 8th grade. After that I kind of lived with them in high school (I say it that way because we really didn't get along, and I was probably no picnic, but my mother was violent and I spent a lot of time not actually living there), then I moved out and joined the Army. Fast forward 25 years and I have a home and family of my own. Meanwhile for a host of reasons my parents have some serious health issues and while our relationship has improved I would not say that we're close. But, I am their only child and I have stepped in to help with things like setting up grocery delivery and a home health care aide. I have no problem contributing some money to their needs, but I draw the line at either of them living with me. 

Until recently this was fine with everyone, but my step dad's health is declining pretty rapidly now, and eventually my mother will not be able to live on her own. Now the family seems to think I should be planning to move them in for hospice care for my Dad and long term living for my mom. That's not an option as far as I'm concerned.  Everyone else seems to think I owe them this because they're my parents, but functionally that's never actually been our relationship. Emotionally my parents were my aunt & my grandparents.

They intend to have a proper wedding in the future, when finances allow. However, in the meantime, she's forbidden me from mentioning it to anyone in our family or even friends of mine who know her,  but do not know the family.

These are kids who never had an apartment and want us (the parents) to give them what they need to get started. It's a financial imposition to ask us to furnish their house, and I know that both my family and the groom's family would be delighted to help if they could. 

In addition, the groom's family all knows this is going to happen and I feel our family will be terribly hurt if they are shut out completely. We're not inviting people to the courthouse,  obviously,  but they can call and offer their Congratulations anyway. I'm worried that, when they finally do have their wedding,  nobody will want to come because they weren't even given the dignity of a notice. 

Further,  I  make lots of crafts and baked goods. I like to post the projects on social media for critiques and she's forbidden me from posting the wedding cake picture. Her real wedding will have a professional cake,  but I wanted the practice, around just a few of us will be there. Frankly, my enthusiasm for helping her is dwindling and I am contemplating *not* baking the cake, as literally this exposure was all I wanted.

But she won't let us enlist the help of others. We have to replace what we give her and do without in the meantime, because we don't have money to buy these things right now.

This is probably our only chance to have a biological child and we've had a long time to discuss how we want to do everything. My husband and I are comfortable, financially, but we're not rich or anything. But we live nicely. Our baby will never lack for anything. But we decided to avoid buying crazy amounts of baby clothes. Neither of us are fancy or stylish and we're not a huge fan of the baby clothes we see in stores. I've noticed that a lot of the options for girls still tends to the frilly side, lace and bows and pink and princesses. That's not us, it's not our style. So we decided to keep it simple and bought what we feel will be more useful, onesies and sleepers, t-shirts and those cotton pants, socks and hats. Keeping it very simple.

&#x200B;

Our moms saw the baby's closet and dresser and they asked if they could go out and buy us some cute stuff. I showed them the things we already bought and said as long as whatever they buy is on par with all of that then feel free but anything girly or frilly won't get any use. I've been very clear about this for nine months.

&#x200B;

They went out and bought several huge bags of baby clothes, all of it ugly little lacey, frilly dresses and princess stuff, hats with bows. All the stuff I asked them to avoid. I'll never use any of it. I called them and thanked them but asked if it was possible if they could take them back because we'd never use any of it. I even offered to reimburse them. Both mothers are hurt and say we're trying to deny them a loving relationship with their granddaughter. This isn't the first grandchild so it's not like they'll never get to spoil a grandkid.

&#x200B;

The other issue is the baby shower. I HATE baby showers and every time I've been asked if I want one I've said no. I've never liked baby showers and I don't see the point in them. I've been very clear for nine months that I wouldn't attend one if it was thrown for me. I just learned that they're planning one but they're telling everyone that my husband I are having money troubles and that's why we aren't buying the baby nice clothes. That's a load of hooky.

&#x200B;

I called them both and told them they knew this whole time how I felt about baby showers and that if they insist on throwing one that I won't attend. Now they're both upset and calling me unreasonable, cruel, cold, saying I'm trying to isolate them from the baby. I think as hard as we've worked to see this pregnancy through that I'm entitled to do things how I see fit. There have been some other issues, like their refusal to accept the names we've chosen, or the lack of religion/baptism. It's all come to a head and I'm stressed as fuck. I told them that if they can't respect our wishes then we'd limit their time with our daughter until they could. Everyone we talk to is saying we're awful and cruel.

Backstory.  My husband (41) and myself (36F) have been married for 6 years now.  He has a younger brother who is my age who is getting married this fall.   They aren’t particularly close as there is an age difference and they are two very different people.  No ill will.  Just no relationship.   BIL calls when he need something (literally without fail)  but otherwise it is all communication via text.  For example a text was sent along the lines of “hey bro, if you want to be one of my groomsmen, you can. Let me know.”  Yeah, um we are wedding-ed out.  No thanks.  We don’t feel the need to live up to the expectations of others when there is not a relationship the other 364 days of the year.   All for photos and the proper image being displayed.  We dislike the pomp and circumstance.  We are fine attending of course but that’s the extent of participation.   We will enjoy the time with the cousins as they are close.   

We already have an expensive flight not to mention the resort is $400 + per night..,plus use  of hard earned PTO.  Which we cherish like gold coins.   

Now details have very slowly been released.  It’s on a need-to-know basis despite questions having been asked.  

Today, it gets texted that my husband will walk their mother down the aisle.  FIL is present and available.  My husband walked my MIL down the aisle at our wedding.  

It’s BIL’s wedding and I thought proper etiquette is for the groom is do to this.  

My husband told BIL that he should escort their mother or their father should, but that he was escorting his wife - his date (me).  BIL protested.  Husband didn’t back down.

Are we the assholes? No one’s the asshole? Everyone’s the asshole? 

Note it is a wedding in the great outdoors.  No set religious aspect (all raised Catholic but no longer practicing).

I got off on the wrong foot with this couple because they were using some of my stuff without asking (food, cookware, etc).

Quite often they don't actually clean my cooking stuff though and I'll have to do it before cooking, though.

Another thing that was bothering me was them staying up late and being generally loud with friends.

She wants the expensive, finer things in life, whilst he wants to do what he loves (researching maths). 

Whilst I like my flatmate, I find I resonate more with her boyfriend. He struggles with anxiety like myself, so we both feel comfortable with each other.

It might be that she 'wants to have a child via surrogate, as she will HAVE to do all the breadwinning in future'. Or that 'maybe next time he'll get her a nice birthday gift with a proper price tag'. Usually, they're subtle digs at him not making enough money.

I also think I'm siding with him because of his anxiety, and that's a shit thing to do considering she is my friend.

My wife is at our vacation home upstate for the week, partially for work. She has a pretty strict curfew for our son, he has to be home at 10pm. He's 17 years old as of 3 weeks ago.

Last night, at around 9:20, he asked if he could go to a friends backyard party. It was 10 blocks away. Even though he would never admit it to me, I know his friends at least drink alcohol sometimes, I've heard them talk about it before while they thought I wasn't listening. I assumed he would be drinking there possibly, or at least, I knew there was a chance he would. I decided to let him go and told him he has to be home anytime from midnight to 1am, and that he cant get drunk or I will know. I feel in retrospect like this was a huge betrayal of my wifes wishes. She doesn't even allow him to stay out past 10, now I was telling him he could stay out until 1am technically? Even if it is only 10 blocks away, its still a party. I drove him there, partially because I wanted to see what it was. I could see their backyard, it just looked like maybe 30-40 teens hanging out with music playing. I didn't see any dancing or anything too crazy.... He did nothing wrong. He came home at around 12:15, he didn't smell anything like alcohol, and he went to bed. Its possible he drank a beer or two and I couldn't smell it, but I don't mind as long as he wasn't drunk. We let him have wine at dinner and sometimes beer at family events. The next day, she called and we talked, and she asked what our son was doing and I lied and said he did nothing yesterday. I don't often lie to my wife, really at all, so this was really weird to me.

I feel bad for lying to my wife, but I also know that she is overprotective over him by a lot. Even when he was younger she didn't let him walk to his junior high school despite it being only 15 blocks away. I just feel sort of like there is no point in telling her because its such a minor thing that she would freak out over, its basically just not worth it at all. I am also worried that she would go even harder being overprotective over him.

Was I wrong? Should I have consulted my wife? Should I have asked her first if this was okay? I just feel like I know she would have said no and possibly gotten a bit upset that I would even ask. But again I also feel terrible for lying to my wife.",16,25,0.84

1743,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday I attended a bonfire hosted by a friend of my fiancé. My guests and I got there late, and when we arrived the people there had already been drinking etc for quite a while.

There was a guy there who is a friend of a friend of my fiancé's, I've never seen or met him before. He was looking dejected and my fiancé told me that he had been hooking up with a girl we both know but then she left to go to another bootycall.

This guy was super fucked out of his mind and clearly going through it, it came out that he *had a girlfriend* and he was saying ""I've cheated on my girlfriend what do I do, do I tell her or not?"". The people who spoke up (I was the only other girl after the girl he cheated with left) were telling him to just keep it quiet and not do it again.

I know the girl he cheated with and she has slept with a number of guys without protection. The guy who cheated also admitted they hadn't used a condom.

Today I created a fake Facebook profile and messaged his girlfriend telling her that something happened at the bonfire last night and she should ask him about it. She asked for more details so I told her the main points I believed she needed to know: this guy cheated with a certain girl, I have very good reason to believe it was unsafe sex and she's had unsafe sex before recently, and he was very upset/regretful but I wasn't sure whether he was going to tell her or not as he'd been debating it.

I don't know how (not that I didn't anticipate this might happen), but word got back pretty quickly and my fiancé came to tell me that in the Whatsapp group his friends have everyone was tlaking about how someone had snitched. This is the only part I feel bad about: I got put on the spot and my brother (who was also at the bonfire) was in the room, so I instinctively lied/played dumb and acted like ""Wow I wonder who would have done that"". In my head I was thinking oof I need to come clean about this later when I've calmed down (my anxiety ramped up immediately as soon as he came in to tell me).

Two minutes later he comes back in saying I'm lying and they all knew it was me because they'd seen the screenshots and it was obviously how I would talk. He said his friends were telling me he needs to leave me stat, that they hate me and they don't want anything to do with me anymore. My fiancé quietly and quickly packed his things up and left, and he spoke to me outside briefly to tell me that he can't trust me.

AITA for meddling here?

ETA: The girl just wrote to me to say ""Thank you so much for telling me this. I know it must be hard for you. But it’s better to know the truth that being lied to..."", so that makes me feel a bit better that I did the right thing, even if it was at the cost of my relationship :(

I have known my friend for 3 years and his dad for about as long, having only contacted the dad through social media since he lived far away.

His dad flew in for my friends college graduation and we and some other people all got dinner together. At one point me and his dad started comparing tattoos. I have one on my inner thigh I wanted to show him so we went to the bathroom so I could.

After I show him the tattoo he said “What else are you going to show me?” and sort of did an eye flutter thing. I ask what he wants to see and he says my dick.

Now I’ve had some drinks by then and decide sure why not? So I show him, he comments very nice and we go back to finish eating. Later that night my friend calls me up and is like “Bro why did you show my dad your dick?” 

First off his dad asked me too, second off idk why he told his son....and it wasn’t anything sexual for me at least. I’m straight I just thought it was sort of funny.

1745,Not the A-hole,"So, I was throwing a party at my place and a friend of mine, let's call her J, invites a friend of hers. This friend, let's call her Ashley, shows up and stays quiet throughout the night. 

Towards the end of the night, I get to talking to Ashley and we seem to hit it off pretty well as far as conversation. I talk to J at one point and she tells me that I'm ""laying it on kinda thick, but Ashley is a good girl and good luck"". I was kind of taken aback by this comment since Ashley and I had just had polite conversation, but I proceed anyway. 

As the night progresses, alcohol gets into the mix and things get more flirtatious between me and Ashley. I start trying to flirt with Ashley and do some polite touching. To be clear, this never progressed past putting my arm around her and touching her hair. No kissing, hand holding, or even sexual conversation happened. In response, she keeps touching my arm, rests her head on me, giggles at almost everything I say, and feeds me bits of food. J is witness to this the whole time along with other people. At some point, Ashley asks J ""Are we spending the night here?"".

A little while later, I got a bit sick and went to bed. J, Ashley, and another friend stuck around for a bit while talking to one of my house mates and then they all went home (I heard about it afterward). 

The next evening I meet up with J to return something Ashley left at my place and I get a whole lecture about how Ashley said I made her really uncomfortable and I was too aggressive. She said I need to be ""hypervigilant"" and that ""my actions have consequences"". Completely blindsided, I told J if she talks to Ashley to please tell her I'm sorry and that I never intended to make her uncomfortable. 

Still in shock, I contacted a few friends and asked them how they thought I conducted myself that night. All of them were shocked by Ashley's supposed reaction later. All of the people that were there and had witnessed Ashley and I interacting had been encouraging and basically asking ""When is the second date?"" type of talk. 

I have had the feeling that J has had feelings for me for a bit, and there is a tin foil part of me that thinks a lot of this is fabricated. I haven't talked to Ashley, but J has since texted me saying Ashley is fine, and that J is ""sorry this happened to me"" but she cares about my safety and Ashley's.

Everything was honestly easy physically. My parents, as a baby shower gift, paid for a night nurse for the first year. I had almost 6 months of maternity leave and didn't have to go into the office until child was a year old. We owned our condo, so we had very little housing expenses.

I can't possibly replicate any of this with my new partner. I'm in my 30s now, starting to get back pain. We'd have to move as my condo is only 2 bedrooms. I couldn't have a night nurse.

In the meantime, I'm trying to avoid him as much as possible by staying in my camper instead of coming home. I have asked him not to have women over to my house, and told him smoking pot in my house is not ok. He, my other roommate and I, use a Google calendar to convey our schedules and when people are coming over. I put on the calendar that I would be gone until Sunday, but ended up needing to stop by home Saturday at around midnight. 
When I got home, ex and a female friend of ours that he's been messing around with, were smoking pot in my living room. I'm not sure if they were going to hook up, but I'm still annoyed that he had another woman over in my house after I'd asked him not to. 
I'd been drinking, so I confronted him in front of her, and asked him why he hadn't talked to me about having someone over.

I'm quite introverted and my friend had at this point disappeared and when she did turn up was not interested in talking with me. Her objective was to flirt with the guy she liked, fair enough, she has a habit of bunny boiling, but I wanted to leave before long.
Eventually I managed to get a seat next to her and asked how long she was planning to stay. The reply was ""late"". So I said ""I'm gonna leave before 6"". ""uh huh"" she replied. 
I had given her a lift in so asked if she wanted me to bring her jacket from my car. Half way through my sentence she stood up and went to talk to the guy she liked. This pissed me off, so I sent her a message telling her not to be ""so fucking rude"" I got dagger eyes and she ran away with the guy.

Now the problem is, she's recently started a relationship with a mutual friend and until the BBQ had been super in to him. Though she likes to flirt, I've never known her to cheat, until now, she ended up shagging the BBQ guy.

An hour or so later I found her obviously miserable on the sofa, we had a chat about the way she'd treated me, she ended up crying and implying heavily that she only banged him because she was angry with me and he was comforting her. 

She hasn't spoken to me since then and I feel sick at the idea that she was taken advantage of because of my actions and I'm terrified the friendship may be over.

Thankyou all for your comments, replies and condolences.

I think the reality of the situation is, as many of you have suggested, that I was blinded by my own poor mental state, leaving me willing to accept the blame for her actions. I can see now that it's pretty clear I'm NTA...
 
We've had a talk/fight and decided to step away from each other for a while. I'm very, very bad at letting go of people, so I suspect not for good. This situation is a poor reflection of who she really is. But then in the past few weeks I've allowed her to walk all over me. That needs to change either way.

To those saying I shouldn't allow her to flirt with other guys: The only time I will tell her, or anyone else, what to do is when I'm directly involved. Any other time she can, and should, do what she wants relying on her own good or bad judgement.",182,991,0.94

During the flight a short while after I felt pushes/kicks in the back of the seat. I turn back to see and the parent behind me has his child in his lap and the child is kicking the back of my seat. I ask the parent if he could try to prevent this. What I said was something like ""hey there, could you try to stop him from kicking the back of my seat? "". The parent said that if I put my seat back up then it would be easier. I respond that I like it down and it would be great if he does his best to prevent it regardless. I felt some kicks more during the flight but nothing crazy so I didn't escalate any further. 

I told the story to my family and they though I was an asshole for putting my seat back when the passengers behind me had children and needed the space.

I don't agree and think that it's up to me to decide if I put the seat back or not. They also think I should have asked if it was OK before doing it, but I feel that I don't need the permission of the passenger behind me to do it.

Am I the asshole for thinking/acting this way?

I myself live 1.5 hours away in the city, but I visit my parents and relatives almost every weekend for lunch. Now my parents have been pushing me on getting married and having kids for years. My younger sister did it before me at 24 (I'm currently 27, male) so in their eyes, I'm in a race against the clock. A cousin of mine recently made her 3yo follow me around the house and ask me ""when are you getting married"" which should tell you how healthy my family dynamic is.

Honestly I still love my parents and relatives but they can be exhausting when they push the issue. And the thing is, I'm gay so I'm never getting married or having kids (not real options here). This isn't something I want to share with my family, seeing as in their eyes homosexuals are the cause of any and all problems of the modern world.

But afterwards she asked about hanging out again and possibly smoking and watching movies (it's legal where I live). I said yes because she seemed pretty nice and I wanted to get to know her better

She came over to my place a few nights ago. She originally said she'd be there at 5 after she ran some errands. 5 turned into 7 which turned into 8. No biggie, things like that happen. Before she was finally about to arrive she said her Uber dropped her off at the wrong place and she was gonna stop at the liquor store and get us some wine. I don't usually mix weed and alcohol (especially with someone I don't know well) but didn't want to say no because I wanted to roll with what she was into and figured I could just have a small glass and be fine. Anyway, she came over with two bottles and poured herself a pretty big glass. I poured a small glass and every time it got a little less full, she'd fill it up again without really asking, or would encourage me to drink more.

We end up talking and hanging out on my bed and we kiss, and then she made a bad joke that made me super uncomfortable because of some things in my past.

So we're making out more and I'm just really uncomfortable. I stop her and tell her that I'm having trouble dealing with some past issues and I don't think I can keep making out or go further, but that I'd like to maybe see her again by going to dinner or a movie.

As she's getting her things together, she starts getting really short with me, and says if she left anything here to just let her know...I don't know what she would've left since she wasn't here THAT long. She slings her backpack over her shoulder and pushes me away as I try and walk her to my apartment door. She slammed both my bedroom door and the door to my apartment.

1757,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. TL;DR: SO and I expecting a child, comfortable two-income household, mother of his eldest accuses us of loving our child more than theirs based on the amount of money we spend.

Background: My SO and I got back together couple years ago after a break up, during which he had a brief ""fuck buddies"" thing with some woman and she got intentionally pregnant and pushed for him to marry her. He didn't, obviously, but he did take full responsibility for the child. She's unemployed, didn't finish high school, lives with her mother. Tried to get some sort of alimony but he destroyed her in court. He does pay child support religiously and covers extra expenses. Baby mama hates my guts, says I stole my SO from her (though she met him when I was still his GF, and he wasn't in relationship with her when we got back together).

I am now pregnant with my SO and I's first child together. We managed to keep this news from his first baby mama for quite a while, but she found out eventually and has been unleashing hell around him ever since. 

Her rage is centred on me because she found out (via sm stalking) what we bought for our baby, where I'm giving birth (private facility), where I'll have my baby shower, etc. And she basically concluded that we are spending a lot more money in our baby that my SO ever spent on theirs and that pisses her off.

We have indeed spent quite a sum and plan on spending more in the future. I have no idea if her claims about this sum being more than what was invested in her pregnancy and their child are true, but it's very likely the case... because the thing is she doesn't work and so ever since she was pregnant all related expenses had to be covered by my SO alone.

I'm a semi-senior executive and actually make more money than my SO at the moment (though he earns fairly well himself). So it's logical to me that our two-income household has a better financial position than hers.

I don't tell my SO to spend more money in our unborn child, but we pay for everything half and half so he doesn't have to spend as much as it seems. As for where I'm giving birth, I have my own medical insurance, my SO isn't paying a penny.

So AITA for spending and overall setting up a comfortable lifestyle for our soon to be born child when my SO cannot provide the same for his eldest because he can't afford this kind of stuff on his own? I mostly feel like we both work hard for our money and if we're not going to use it to give our child a good life then what's the point in having it, but I'm thorn because I think we're also potentially setting a difference between the siblings and that his first baby mama will always push that view on her child, that might grow to actually think their dad doesn't love them the same or something.",517,1672,0.92
1758,Not the A-hole,"I've gotten in trouble with my parents a lot because of my SO's. (not directly because of THEM, more like because I'm an idiot that can't follow curfews, which is another story) 

ANYWAYS, my parents claim that i'm ""too easy"" and ""never too hard of a catch"" and that I need to make my SO's ""work for it, instead of just being a slut"".

To be honest, I don't really think much of my sexuality. I've been active for a while, and nothing bad has really come out of it other than meeting people that suck in bed. My partners have generally been good to me, it just ends up not working out. I do end up hurt but I can honestly say its never been because ""they've gotten bored of me"" like my parents claim they will or have. 

I can see why they're scared, as they are my parents and I am an only child. But them just always calling me easy has gotten annoying. 

My dad ""chased"" my mom, and she wasn't ""easy"" and they have been married for over 25 years.  HOWEVER, I can easily remember them almost divorcing every other year, constant fights, and ""leaving for a while"" moments from both their ends. I have no idea how they're actually still together. We were half way across the world together and my parents got in the nastiest fight that my mom almost flew back home half way through the trip. I was the one that got them to be okay in the end too because I told them they were both acting childish. 

They want to keep on lecturing me and how I should behave and act in order to ""find someone that will love me"". I know all relationships are different, but I just really want to point out that clearly ""being hard to catch"" doesn't mean I'll end up happy with a loving husband.

The condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing I guess because of theft or something idk but I asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn’t doing anything if she could open it up. She made a comment “Aren’t you a little young to be needing those young man” which really caught me off guard and I sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and I just mumbled again that I needed them. 

She basically made a condescending exaggerated “hmfph” noise and said “I outta really call your mama and tell her what you’re doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don’t need to be using these” before moving towards the condoms. My mom and I go shopping here often so while I personally didn’t know this lady, it’s not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

Here’s where IDK if I’m TA because she WAS getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that I basically aggressive said “it’s none of your business for why I need these, fuck off and do your job”. She was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like “excuse me?” and I said “you heard what I said”.

If I did get to know someone, I’d tell them the truth, and they usually took it really well. A few people even thought it was funny.

I know a girl named Amanda from the gym and we’d gotten pretty close, so I wanted to come clean to her. 

I told her that I’d lied about being gay, and she absolutely blew up on me, saying that she felt betrayed and lied to. I stressed that I still wasn’t interested in anything romantic, but now she won’t talk to me.

I’m just so sick of people assuming that all friendships between men and women have to be inherently sexual. AITA, Reddit, for pretending to be gay?

1763,Asshole,"This just happened today but I’m still a bit angry about it and want to know if I overreacted. 

I got married 8 months ago at a quiet little out of the way inn here in my hometown. Everything was perfect aside from a few small hiccups that were not the venue’s fault. I gave them a 5 star review on their preferred website. 

Since it’s so close to home, my wife and I often drive by the venue just to reminisce, and sometimes stop and just sit in the parking lot. Today we got up early and took the dog for a drive to Dunkin’ Donuts. It was particularly nice outside so we said let’s drive over to the venue and sit and eat our food there. It’s a beautiful property and we’ve done this probably half a dozen times over the past 8 months, just sit in the car in their parking lot and eat food and admire the scenery.

So this morning we pull into the parking lot like we have done so many times before, and I immediately see a groundskeeper in a golf cart do a hard U-Turn to come towards us. The parking lot is mostly empty, like always, but he parks right next to me so I figure he has something to say. I roll down the window and he says “There’s no dogs allowed on this property”. 

I was going to say “That’s fine, we aren’t getting out of the car” but he cut me off before I could say that so I just said “That’s fine, we-“ and then he said “also this is guest parking only, all other cars will be towed. So you need to move your car.” I was kind of taken aback by that and just said “Ok”. He then sat there staring at me and my wife and not saying anything, which made me very uncomfortable so we just backed out and drove home. 

I will admit that there is a sign at the entrance that does say guest parking only. But this particular Inn has two parking lots, an upper lot for the wedding venue and a lower lot for the inn. We parked at the venue, where there were no events going on at the time. There’s probably 80-100 parking spots, and there were only 2 other cars when we pulled in, so there were lots of open spots in the upper lot when we got there. 

After stewing over it for a bit, I went in and edited my review from a 5 star to a 4 star over this groundskeeper after he effectively kicked us off the property. My review was of the property in general, not just the wedding day itself, so I feel like any interaction applies. However, it’s such a small business and it emphasizes the “anything less than 5 stars is a failing grade” thing a lot so I feel like I’m actually putting a good dent in their overall score even by just lowering my review by 1 star. AITA for this?

EDIT/UPDATE:

OK I have changed the review back to a 5 star and I left a voicemail for the venue manager to talk this one out. Probably should’ve talked to her first, but you live and you learn. The purpose of the call to her is not to get the groundskeeper in trouble, as he did nothing wrong, but to humbly ask for her permission to sit and eat there from time to time. For whatever reason I have not been able to get across to the commenters how small this inn was, how detached the wedding venue is from the inn, or a number of important contextual points that are probably needed to put our wedding in perspective. 

I tried to reply to each comment as they came in but the overwhelming negativity went far beyond “you’re an asshole” and turned into what felt like a pretty personal attack in a lot of ways that didn’t even apply to me. Many assumptions were made about me, my wife and my dog and a lot of conversations spiraled far out of control before I was able to address all of the incorrect assumptions that spawned them. 

I will post an update in a few days when I hear from the venue manager. I thank you all for your input

1766,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I just had our first (and only!) child, and we’ve had a couple friends very generously offer us hand-me-down clothes and supplies.  
My husband and I are definitely comfortable financially, but babies are expensive and apparently they don’t start pulling their own weight for quite a few years, so we’ve gratefully accepted anything that has been offered.  
One friend gave us a giant bag of 0-6 month clothes. As I was sorting through, I found about half the clothes had pretty bad stains. I attempted to remove the stains, but any that wouldn’t come out, I put back in the bag.  
I know babies are messy and stain clothes and we’ve already seen the firsthand effects of a poop-pocalypse, but she’s my first and only, and I can afford it, and I want to be that mom who dresses her in adorable clothes all the time.  
So after I’d washed and sorted through the hand-me-downs, I called my friend and thanked her again for the clothes, and mentioned that there were some I couldn’t use because of the stains and asked if she wanted them back. She’s involved in lots of mommy groups, and I thought she might know someone who would want the clothes, regardless of staining.  
Now she’s annoyed with me because “babies get dirty” and I “need to get over” my snobbiness.  
I certainly wasn’t judging her in any way over the stained clothes, and I did thank her several times and only offered to return the others in case someone else could use them. I don’t think I’m wrong for wanting to put my only kid in cute (clean) clothes, but AITA here?",191,410,0.95

1769,Not the A-hole,"My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:

1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.

After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.

His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

1770,Update,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b84xxt/aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school_when/)

First off, THANK YOU everybody for your overwhelming support. I had thousands of messages in my inbox giving me advice, offering prospective, etc. After my last mini-update, I eventually got overwhelmed with messages, but if I missed your message, please don’t hesitate to DM again!

So later that day, my parents actually came to me and apologized for everything. I know everyone in the last post really hated them, but my parents are really good people. They have flaws, but all humans do. It’s not like they spent their free time brutalizing me; they knew I was smart and even encouraged me to apply to schools like Cornell. They just automatically assumed my sister would get in especially versus me (which, if you look at our scores, I can’t say they should be blamed). Nevertheless, they realized that they were being jerks and they apologized for making me feel like I’m not as capable as my sister. That they were shocked, but it was no excuse for what they said or how they made me feel and they love me and apologize for what they said.

Anyways for the moment you’ve all been waiting for
I decided that I want to go to Cornell! It was such a tough choice and wasn’t made without **serious** consideration, but ultimately, I’ll be happier in Ithaca. Plus, my sister is going to try to transfer after our freshmen year (if she still wants to go; she may find that she loves NYU after all that time). Whatever she decides, I have no doubt she will be extremely successful. Plus, it’ll be good to spend some time apart from each other and grow as people. NYC is only a short bus ride away, so we can definitely see each other during holidays and breaks.

I want to thank everyone again for their overwhelmingly positive support. I know I couldn’t have made my decision without each and every one of your messages! I’m sorry if this update is as exciting as many others tend to be, but I hope it gave the few interested people some closure :)

[Finally, to the trolls who are saying this is fake](https://imgur.com/a/zQwutjO)

TLDR: I’m going to Cornell!

EDIT: Since I'm already here, anyone want to give advice on the number one thing they wish they knew when they were 18 and was just about to start college? Or the number one thing they regret about college that they don't want others to make the same mistake? I could appreciate some pointers!",395,5395,0.98
1771,Not the A-hole,"I just got married and moved into a house. It's still messy even though it's been about a month. My husband has been working tons and I just started mandatory overtime, so we haven't finished unpacking due to being busy. I've told my parents before that we prefer a day's notice to them coming over just because they're overly critical if something is cluttered or messy.  A couple of days ago, my mom asks if she can invite the family over this weekend to see the house, but i said no it's still a mess and we've recently come up with a plan to get the rest of the unpacking done, so soon, just not this weekend. Today, my dad asks me to call him to see if I still wanted my old bike, which I told him I did and that I'd come get it this week. He then told me to not worry about it and that he was coming over later today and would bring it. I told him that I didn't want him to come over and got frustrated and repeated that I'd come over this week to get it. He got upset and basically stopped talking on the phone and then told me okay and said goodbye and hung up. 

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: the reason for me wanting the day's notice is because my mom has a habit of coming over and screaming at me about something I've done that bothered her (like if I was busy and didn't come over for a week shell come over unannounced and get angry and tell me I'm a terrible daughter).

1772,Not the A-hole,"This is going to be a long one. I used to post my mil adventures in r/JNMIL but shit happened and I had to delete my old Reddit. Anyway, let's get to it. 

Since my youngest daughter was hospitalized when she was 3 months old, I've severely limited her and her sisters contact with their grandmother. I'm not a religious person. They took that opportunity to tell me that it was gods punishment for not believing in him and that's my why 3 month old was so sick. 

Sleepovers stopped before then when I realized that my oldest was being forced to sleep with her grandmother. We don't cosleep and never have. We asked her to stop and she refused. 

When we did go over to her house, she would take my oldest aside (after I said no candy/sweets) and say, loudly, ""don't tell your mom. It's our secret"" as she opened candy to give it to my child but yell at me when I would snatch it away. 


If my MIL doesn't get her way, she guilt trips us. She says she ""needs to see her babies."" That we're ""punishing her for no reason"" and so much more. 

There's so much more but I'm going to post all of that back on r/JNMIL and r/EntitledParents
I honestly do feel like an asshole for keeping my kids from her but I can't take all of her crap constantly.

1773,Not the A-hole,"I have 5 siblings, all adults, and we all live close by. My sister lives in our rental home next door and my youngest sibling and his girlfriend live with me. 

My sis and I had planned an evening get together, beginning at 6. About 2 hours prior, I was coming home from getting supplies when I saw one of my brothers, S, walking towards my house. 

I got really mad, bc I wanted to relax for an hour before everyone showed up. I locked the doors and turned my surround sound up to drown out any noises. I also sent my sis a text so she could do the same.

Up til about a month ago, S has been in the throws of a serious meth problem that had all but pushed away everyone. S and I had the same mother, who passed long ago. I've always coddled him a little more than I probably should out of loyalty to her. 

The drug abuse led to us getting burned by S multiple times, and he's generally ungrateful for the things we do to help him. His water was recently shut off and I've brought him gallons upon gallons so he can continue flushing toilets.

Last week, S relapsed and did meth for 2 days. Towards the end of his last binge, the family told him that we couldn't continue to help him when he's like this.

I got a message from him that read ""thanks for locking me out."" I snapped. I didn't ""lock him out"" for any other reason than wanting an hour of peace and quiet before having to play host. He sent a follow up message that said he ""figured it would be okay to come early and to shower."" 

When everyone arrived, my oldest brother reached out to S and again invited him. S sent me a long message about how it was clear he wasn't wanted, adding that ""it's no wonder I do drugs."" 

I know that I'm not responsible for his drug use, but for him to blame me or the family enrages me, because we go out of our way to help him when he does nothing to help himself. He doesn't see it that way, apparently, and believes he's being shunned by the family despite a month of sobriety before last week's relapse. He wouldn't hear my explanations and instead ended our conversation with this: 

""even tho u help u make it known how inconvenient it is. and i still show my appreciation and let u know it despite the gripe. ill have my shit together soon enough and ill manage myself but ive been sober for a minute despite a brief relapse which has came and went and on one occasion OLDEST BRO reached out to me, that should bother me. but ill act like it dont and pretend everything is peachy while i put my cards together.""


He thinks any success achieved by me or my siblings comes from us ""helping one another,"" when in actuality we all have jobs and work tirelessly to climb out of the poverty that stifled our family growing up.

1774,Not the A-hole,"I (20F) have been in an ill-defined relationship with a guy (22M) for around a month. In the past, I've had pretty bad luck with men, but he treated me really well and I felt like we clicked. We have been spending a lot of time together where he sleeps over most nights. I have a lot more money than he does, but we try to keep expenses separate when we go out (which is rare). This results in him only ever paying for himself which makes me a little sad, but I understand. Unlike me, he isn't good with money and would rather spend it on food or weed. 

&#x200B;

He reached out to me yesterday asking if I wanted to get dinner. I said yes, but he changed his mind and asked to go see a movie instead. He has one of those movie passes, where he gets to see movies for free at a monthly fee. He sent me a photo of my ticket and asked me to reimburse him, again, no problem. When we get to the theater, he orders chicken tenders and tries to talk to me during the movie. He assumed he was going to come over after the movie, to which I said was okay in hopes of getting him to stop talking. I have always thought it's rude to be loud during a movie, especially a serious one. He could tell I was uncomfortable, so he proceeds to go and buy himself another order of chicken tenders. After this serving, he then falls asleep for the rest of the movie.

&#x200B;

I have to wake him up at the end of the movie, then proceed to go to the bathroom and text my friend to see what she is doing. She invites me over, and I'm immediately relieved I don't have to hang out with him the rest of the night. I leave the bathroom and tell him ""hey, I might go over to my friends place since it seems like you're really tired."" He got so defensive and said how I was wasting his time, and that I already said we would hang out after. I felt bad about this, but when I tried to explain to him why I was disappointed, he stormed off in the street. He waited for me a few blocks up, now calming down. He told me how he had worked 7am-2pm and it's not his fault he's tired. He started working himself up again and completely ignoring me, storming off into the street again. 

&#x200B;

What bothers me is that he invited me to a movie, made me pay, ordered himself a lot of food, and slept through the movie. On top of that, he refuses to try to see where I'm coming from. He thinks I should have told him halfway through the movie that I was annoyed/disappointed, but I felt that was inappropriate for the setting we were in. I no longer have any interest in seeing him again, but I'm worried I handled the situation poorly.

1775,Not the A-hole,"Ex is my friend, and we all have the same friends group where we go out and chill etc. We dated for a year, and been broken up for 3 years now but been ok friends. We talk during our group outings and planning etc and it's all normal, we laugh and have fun. Afaik nobody has feelings for anybody anymore. 

Recently we went out for a small trip, and she brought a friend and we both vibed together a lot, everybody saw that. On the way back, I'm driving and I had to give her a ride back, but had to drop the rest so they could go find new parking for their own cars to avoid parking tickets.  So it was and this girl alone when I was dropping her off, and it was so clear that were into each other so we talked about it and made out. 

However my ex told me to not hit on her friend, which I wasnt doing in particular. We were both hitting on each other if anything, and apparently she told her friend that we used to date (during the trip). 

So me and this girl didn't want to upset the ex, so I called her to ask what would happen to her friendship with her and with me, because I really like her. She kinda just told me I'm and adult and make my own decision and hung up. My friends told me she was so mad at me. 


Now, some background, my ex, not like 2 months after we broke up, she started dating another guy in the same friends group, and that caused so much hurt for me for a whole year because we'd all hangout together and I'd see them together. One year later, she started dating a new guy, and one year later she's single. She never asked me if it's okay to date this other friend in our friends group, so I think it's unfair that she got mad at me for going for her friend. 

Eventually, after I called her, me and the friend decided that we shouldn't go further and we just left. So nothing happened except making out.

I take care of our 4 year old and 1 year old. Our 4 year old has autism and is very high energy. He rarely sleeps through the night, maybe once every 3 months. Our 1 year old has anaphylactic allergies but he mostly sleeps through the night. I work a couple nights a week - though i have been off for a few weeks due to stress. 
When my husband is home he often falls asleep when the kids go to sleep, around 7pm. I do house work and try to be in bed by 10 but often can’t sleep til midnight. I deal with whatever wake ups happen in this time. My 4 year old is up 1-8 times a night on average. Usually he just wants a cuddle. If the baby wakes up it’s usually for 10-40 minutes. He’s teething. My husband doesn’t drive so i have to be up by 7 to get my 4 year old to his mon- fri program. We have to leave at 8. Our kids get up between 530-6 on average. 
I feel like since my husband goes to sleep so early that i should be able to sleep until 7 on weekdays and possibly later on the weekends when we have no plans. My husband feels like he should be able to sleep in as well. I know that sleep isn’t a competition but he sleeps so much more than i do, when he’s at work he gets to sleep solid and i never get to.

She got jittery and called the whole thing off, both the holiday and the relationship and while I was kind of sad because she was pretty great I realised after we broke up that I wasn't really into all the travelling or the serious relationship stuff myself so I didn't really mind.

The truck is in bad shape and barely runs which makes me suspect the owner might not have the means to get a new car or whatever you know. I don’t want to assume, but I would say that whoever drives the truck would have a hard time getting the truck out of a tow lot or paying a parking ticket.

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I’ve been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can’t find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn’t a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it’s about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub.

For example: moving out of state for an uncertain job, staying in a emotionally neglectful relationship, and quite a few more. I recently realized that I dread his phone calls. When he calls, he hardly ever asks about me. I tend to just sit on the phone listening to him complain about his life. He travels two states over to visit the aforementioned sort-of-partner, but hasn’t made an effort to visit me, despite knowing that I’m off for the summer. (Teacher.) Don’t get me wrong, we have had some good times, but these are few and far between. 

To make matters more complicated, about a year and a half ago I asked him to be my best man for my wedding in October. I was hesitant to ask, but a part of me would have felt guilty if I had asked somebody else. As one of two minor responsibilities, I asked him to plan my bachelor party. I had to really push to get any sort of planning off the ground, going so far as to suggest a cabin that we could all chip into for a couple of days, as I felt this would be fun. He hasn’t made any progress on it, past the planning I did, and it is getting down to the wire and he hasn’t made any effort to help this party happen. 

And I’m hurt. Maybe it’s foolish that I relied on him to do this, but I thought that he could put himself aside to make this important day happen for me, but it doesn’t look like it’s going to happen. It’s a “straw that broke the camel’s back” situation. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say is would I be the asshole for cutting him out of my life?",24,149,0.93
1783,Not the A-hole,"My friends and I (23 M) got a Star Wars lamp as a birthday gift for a friend of ours (23 M). Knowing how much he likes the Star Wars franchise, we thought it was a spot on gift.
Actually, it turns out it wasn't. When presented with the lamp he acted pleased, but then texted me in private the day after, saying he didn't like it that much, so he went through the store online catalogue to look for something he actually liked but found nothing that met his tastes.
Next time we see him, he brings the lamp with him and gives it back to me, claming that we could return it so we could get our money back.

I assume he hoped we returned it so we could get him another gift, but he never stated it out loud. 
Anyway, we felt offended by his behaviour and agreed he was being rude and out of place. We decided not to return the lamp and not get him anything in replacement for it.
Were we the assholes?

1785,Not the A-hole,"So I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed recently and I cant quite think clearly, which is why I need some different perspective.  I'll try to keep the details as sparse as I can since the individual that is the subject of this also uses reddit.


Recently, two friends/roomates/coworkers  of mine, let's call them Alex  and Samantha , and I decided to move apartments across the state. We pretty easily found a new place and decided to go ahead and apply for a lease. Since we're making more money than when we started,  we decided to go off into our own separate units. We've been fine up until this point, I'm just ready to be on my own and have my own space. Anyways,  Alex decided to get a 3 bedroom apartment while I stayed at a 1 bedroom. He had some friends that were also moving (one of which I am a mutual friend ) so it just made sense. 


I was pretty excited. I could be by myself when I wanted to be and then we could hang out pretty easily whenever. A win win situation. But then Alex took way too long to finish the application for the new place and now Alex and Samantha have no where to live for 2 weeks after our current lease ends. Alex and Sam looked around at hotels and airbnb's in the area but most of them were filled up what with next month being a very popular time to move and such. I felt bad for them so when they begged to stay with me in my unit for the 2 weeks it takes to get their apartment ready,  I agreed on certain conditions. 

Then all of a sudden last night, our power went out. The apartment we're at currently is pretty old, so this happens often. So often in fact, the building keepers leaves the room open that has access to the breakers.  That room, however, is in the basement, which can only be accessed behind the building and has no light source. I didnt frel comfortable going down alone, but I've got a medical condition that essentially requires air to be constantly flowing/ not stagnant.  It was already getting hard to breath in the apartment so I went to go ask Alex and Samantha if one of them could come down to help me ( I know how to reset a breaker,  just didnt want to go alone ) and they laughed and flat out refused. They both went back to watching whatever it wa on their phones and essentially left me to deal with it.

I'm heavily considering rescinding my offer to let them stay with me, since I've always gone out of my way to help these two whenever they need it, and now it feels like I've asked something small of them they wont even reciprocate. This coupled with the fact that one of my conditions they agreed to was go help with chores and there have been dirty dishes sitting in the sink for 3 days make me really apprehensive now.

1786,Asshole,"I am a 25 year old man and I work as a volunteer for a charity on the weekends. There are many other young volunteers there, mainly women.

Yesterday, we were setting up for a food drive. My coworker, a 20 something year old woman, was in charge of receiving new donations. 

A man came with a box of food. He asked me and another volunteer where he should put it. There were many volunteers milling around, and I pointed at my coworker. We were all wearing the same shirts so I said, “the young blonde woman over there”. The man asked, “which one?” I was at a loss, and replied without thinking, “the larger one”. I even made a gesture with my hands to indicate it. EDIT: She’s chubby all over, I didnt indicate her breasts lol.

He chuckled, said thanks, and went over to her. She saw me do the gesture and she looked really offended. The volunteer who was with me shook his head and said, “she’s gonna be mad”. Sure enough after the man left, she came and approached me. She said she knew what I said to him, and that she’s really really hurt. I apologized and said it was a spur of the moment thing.

1787,Not the A-hole,"This happened last night, and I’m not sure how to handle today.

I’m on vacation on a Caribbean island with some friends. After a day at the beach, and a short nap, we all headed out for the night. First to dinner, then to a tap house.

Friends of friends wanted to go to a more club vibe. They picked a place that had a crowd outside the door, a live DJ, tons of barely clothed 18 year olds, the typical island club scene. I’m 30, and past that part of my life. Due to a mix up, my drink didn’t make it when we ordered, no biggie. I was pretty much as tipsy as I wanted.

I managed to find a seat near where my friends were dancing, and switched between people-watching and texting a girl I’ve been flirting with back home. So I’m on the one couch in the club, texting on and off, with no drink. This concerned my friends, and they started asking if I was ok. I was totally fine, and I said so with a relaxed smile, telling them to have fun, I’m just chillin. Soon they said we were leaving because they wanted to go somewhere else.

When we got outside, they started asking me where I wanted to go, and I said I didn’t much care, most places are going to be like that tonight and I don’t mind hanging out. I’m told later that this was frustrating from their point of few, as it seemed like I was sulking and wouldn’t say what I really wanted. Friend’s wife, who’s the planner of the group, started calling me party pooper and scolding me for being on my phone on and off as we walked to the next bar. After 10 minutes of that, I’ll admit I got frustrated, and I said I’d see them at the Airbnb, and walked that direction. It was only two blocks away, for context. I dropped into a quieter bar for a drink to cool down before heading home, and a few minutes later they walked in, all apologies and hugs. This was one of the bars they were considering, so they now think that’s what I really wanted the whole time.

I was later told that being on my phone in the first club is what set all of this off. It made them uncomfortable because they thought I was not having a good time. I’m not a “pretend I’m fine” kind of person. If I have a problem, I communicate it freely. I really was fine chilling while they had fun dancing. I understand how it looked from their point of view, but the more I tried to explain that I was fine just relaxing while they danced, the more frustrated they got, thinking I was secretly upset and wouldn’t say anything. We’ve had this kind of miscommunication before, and I’m starting to feel like I’m taking crazy pills. I was totally fine until I started being accused of being in a bad mood. Being treated like I’m emo and ruining the night for no reason really did get on my nerves after a while. 

At this point, I’m thinking I might just not be compatible with these people, although I know they definitely mean well. But if ITA, I’d like to know that before I start tapering off contact.",33,76,0.93

1789,Not the A-hole,"Sorry if formatting is weird, still learning!

For some background, I’m a 21 year-old lesbian who’s been through a long questioning period about gender/sexuality since my early teens. Around 15 I identified as agender so I started to go by my middle name, which is a lot more neutral than my fairly fem first name (and I  liked the name better)
Nolan=middle name Deadname/DN=first name

My immediate family and friends were really accepting of the change. My dad’s family took it in stride completely, which surprised me because my dad can be such a hardass I forget his siblings aren’t the same way. A lot of my mom’s family was pretty resistant to the change (one of my tías, not the two that will be mentioned later, asked me if I could just use DN with family and Nolan with friends), which I get, but everyone eventually adjusted.

With exceptions. My nana, her sister’s, and my godfather still refuse to call me Nolan after 6 years.

An important thing to mention is that I was named after my maternal great-grandma who died a few years before I was born. It was an important name in the family, but it never felt like mine

My nana was never really mean about it, but it still hurts when she’d introduce me as DN. She just pretends I didn’t even change my name, even when I fought about it for so long with her (She did call me Nolan once but she corrected herself to DN and apologized for the slip-up)

My tías were a lot more prickly about it, arguing with me about “changing my name.” I asked the older of the two while we were going to a wedding in July 2018 why she wont call me Nolan when DN makes me so uncomfortable, as casual as I could and she said “We know you don’t like DN, but we call you it out of love. Not to make you angry.” Which still confuses me because it’s still upsetting.

My godfather was especially an ass about it. He outright said to me he was not going to call me Nolan and when my cousin corrected him when he called me DN he yelled that “I will not call DN Nolan ever and neither will any of my kids!” Six years down the line he’s kept that promise! I haven’t really fought him on the name after this because it upset me so bad (and he can be really scary when he yells).

I’ve been fighting to be called Nolan for so long I kinda just gave up after awhile. I still snark about it but I’m not talking as much about it. I’m still very bitter and upset about this that I don’t want to talk or respond to anyone that refuses to call me Nolan, but I’m worried it’s too petty. But talking calmly about it or arguing about it doesn’t seem to help any either.

So WIBTA if i ignore my family members when the call me by my DN?

TLDR I started going by my middle name and certain family members refuses to call me it for the sentimentality of my first name. WIBTA if I ignore them when they don’t call me my middle name?",82,194,0.83
1790,Not the A-hole,"Context: My BF and I are in a long-distance relationship, so we don't get to see each other regularly. In two weeks I am flying out to spend time with him and naturally, I am going to be with him as much as possible, including doing things like sharing a bed.

The problem with that? He hasn't showered in weeks. He's said that he just ""doesn't want to"" and I understand that he has depression which can make basic hygiene hard.

But: I'm not going to sleep with someone who hasn't showered in weeks, especially in summer. I think it's gross. If I can spend thousands of dollars flying out to see him and renting an apartment, he can take five minutes a day to take a shower or at least clean himself off.

Should I just put up with it? I knew what I was getting into when I started dating him.

EDIT: I've gotten a lot of comments wondering why I'm dating him in the first place so to provide some more info there:

\- I do genuinely like him a lot, and you don't tend to exactly notice how often your partner is taking a shower when you haven't seen him for over a year. I had thought he was doing better than he apparently was (shockingly enough, we don't tend to have long and in-depth conversations about when we bathe ourselves).

\- Secondly, I am disabled. I have a myriad of problems that mean I spend a lot of time at doctors offices or in the hospital and have trouble doing a lot of ""normal"" things like eating or showering (sometimes I can't physically lift a cup or utensil, and I have a nasty habit of passing out when I get too hot/stand up for too long/run/walk too much). I'm not bedbound or completely helpless by any means and I have plenty of ""good days"" where I can act almost normally. But because I ask for a lot from him when it comes to medical support and such, I have a lot of trouble asking for additional things.",301,766,0.9
1791,Not the A-hole,"This was two days ago. My wife and I were hosting a beach party with friends and my SIL and her bf was there too. Everyone was drunk and having fun and people were goofing off and giving other people “airplane” rides. You know, that move when you lay on your back and hold someone up with your knees and they spread their arms like an airplane. We were all being silly but I ended up being the one giving people “rides” and everyone loved it. 

The thing about that move is that you can hold up very large people as long as they don’t shift their weight rapidly. As long as they remain stiff like a board and you can hold anyone up basically. I did it for several of my large 6+ ft friends without a problem. 

Well my SIL saw and wanted a go as well. I got nervous because 1) she is VERY overweight and 2) she was drunk so she was stumbling around and being overall very unbalanced. If she had been sober, I would’ve managed bc I would trust her to stiffen up, but I didn’t know if she could do that. I was worried she’d fall on my face and break my nose. So there was an extremely awkward moment where we were all laughing one minute then she asks and then I awkwardly admit I was really tired now and want a break. 

Of course it was extremely obvious to everyone around that I just didn’t want to hold up my SIL. It was so awkward and she laughed nervously and walked away. Well last night my wife spend hours on the phone with her while she cried and blamed me for humiliating her in front of everyone. I feel terrible but I don’t know what I could’ve done better. My wife says not to blame myself and that her sister will get over it. I can’t help but feel bad though. It was an extremely awkward moment.

1792,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday evening there was a big party at the company my boyfriend is working at. There where about 270 people. 

He wanted me to join him, because I’m his girlfriends and that’s the thing girlfriends do. I’m not a very social person, but I was fine with joining him, there are some funny people in his company I wanted to meet. Plus we’re working in the same field, so I figured I've got some common ground to talk about.

There was a dinner with three courses. My boyfriend went out to smoke in between the courses.

I don’t smoke so I stayed at out table with 7 other people I don’t know, but we had some small talk, it was fine but not too entertaining. I was looking forward to the end oft the official party, when i could leave my place and join my boyfriend, meeting he’s friends etc. I didn’t feel like following my boyfriend out to smoke every time he leaves, because well i just don’t like to follow him everywhere he goes, plus i don’t like standing in the smoke.

Anyway just when the dessert buffet was opened, my boyfriend left to smoke again. I decided to wait with dessert till he’s back.

After maybe 10 min he wasn’t back yet, I decided to go and get some dessert for my boyfriends and me. I took a big spoon of chocolate mousse for him because just before, we were talking how much he likes it. 

I went back to the table and wrote him a text, that I grabbed a plate for both of us.

After maybe 45 min after he had left to have a smoke, I started to get really annoyed. I was still sitting there with this big plate of food, the other guests at the table finished there plate a long time ago and I felt like kind of pitied me for waiting for him.

He didn’t tell me, that he would be back after 10 min or something, but I just assumed, that he would be back  and eat the last course like the other times before.

I could have looked for him, but I had no idea where he was. And I also thought that’s not my ‚task’ to do.

I went outside to calm down and I wrote him another text, if he is coming back in the next minutes. I waited again for some time and then I just left.

I really wasn’t in the mood for fun anymore. I was so annoyed, that he just left me there like a jacket or something and went about to have some fun.

I would have been fine just staying at home, but if he wants me to come to some company party, then he also should want to spend time with me.

When he noticed, that I wasn’t there anymore, he called me, I explained him way I left. He apologized for just leaving me. He was talking to somebody then somebody else and didn’t realize, how much time had left. But still the night was ruined. And I’m sad now and wondering if I just should have stayed there. Then we could have enjoyed the rest of the night.

But that's not the way I want to be treated. If I take somebody to an event, I spend time with them or at least check in, if they are fine.

1798,Everyone Sucks,"My former co-worker is a serial workplace sexual harasser. He has a reputation of saying and doing unsavory things to young female employees, and before this year he always got away with it because of his senior position and the fact that his harassment is always verbal/not directly physical. But two months ago someone came forward with text evidence and filed a case with HR.

HR investigated the case, we got a copy of the show cause memo sent to him and his reply. We thought it was a slam dunk case for termination because he did not deny the allegations, and his justifications centered around ""I was not talking to her as her boss but as a friend"", ""It was just a joke, is HR going to investigate every green joke that every employee makes?"" and ""If she really felt harassed then why did she still talk to me afterwards"".

Two weeks ago HR asked him to come to head office. They talked to him, and the next day he resigned. This means that the sexual harassment charge will not be on his record, and he will be given clearance to work for another company.

I have been thinking about making an anonymous blog, where one of the posts would be about the harassment case he faced while he was in our company. The blog/post would not be an expose, but more of an individual's thoughts and reflections about working in our industry, and one of the posts would mention harassment in the workplace, with my co-worker's case as an example. I would discuss the circumstances but say that he resigned so a verdict was never reached, which is the truth. I don't plan on naming the victim but I plan on naming him so it comes up every time someone searches his name. This way, even if he doesn't have anything on his record because of his preemptive resignation, his behavior will still be known to possible future employers.

I'm aware that this is going to be negative for him, and maybe he does deserve the chance to start over. But I can't help but feel that it's unfair how he spent years sexually harassing women in the workplace, but he still gets away unscathed just because the company won't pursue an investigation against someone who already resigned.

So would I be the asshole if I do this?

Edit for those asking what the messages were.

He told her he would try to promote her, and if he's successful, then she should do something for him. That something is a sexual act. He did not straight up ask for sex, it was, word for word ""If I get you promoted this quarter, you should \[X\] me.""

In HR's show-cause memo, they said that this constituted an offer for better compensation in exchange of a sexual favor, and this was a violation of our country's anti sexual harassment laws, and a grave violation of the company's code of conduct. They asked him to explain why he should not be fired.

I 22F have a self proclaimed trans friend 24M whom I  know through social media 3 years ago, I'll refer him as ""him"" coz I don't believe he's trans. We are not too close but sometimes we do hang out for arcades and movies with some other of his friends, all girls.

In these 3 years, he's shown to be... well, I'd say, creepy. He does not dress, take drugs or appear to put any efforts to appear feminine despite insisting one day, he would become a complete woman. He has shown me his collection of woman's outfit of what looks like... role playing costumes. Nurse, Policewoman, Medieval, Traditional Chinese etc, though he never wears them. 

He's also oddly obsessed with female breast, and he love to talk about the bigger, the better. He always tells me that how he's envious about my size, and even in several occasions asking if he can touch them, duh, I said no every time. Once he even attempt to strip and asked us(me and the fellow girls) to take a look at how small his breasts are, though we stopped him.

Whenever we talk, he's always talking about transgender stuff, about how his family threw him out for being transgender, how he wish he could look more like a girl and how he wanted a boyfriend of his own. He also had been asking about private stuff like how does a girl feels when she has menstrual cramps, have sex or get pregnant, things that I feel uncomfortable sharing with him, and hey, most of the girls in his group are my age, or even younger. 

Then there came a day I finally said to myself that I am not putting with his crap any longer, so when he asked asked me out again, I replied that he is not a trans, and he is a creepy person that I'd want to avoid. 

His girl friends now calling me AH for hurting his feelings, and told me that I should just put up with him and not discriminate LGBT. Whether I discriminate LGBT or not I cannot say for sure, but I certainly am not believing he is a trans, or hang out with a person who makes me uncomfortable.

It was his mother, father and his 2 brothers (11 & 16). My mother was still driving up during this time. It was okay for a while but my FIL and BIL’s started asking really inappropriate questions. Things about my parenting skills, my weight and my vagina. Eventually the nurse told them they had to leave because they were being loud and were disturbing other people. They left, upset, but would be back after the baby was born.

About 10 hours later my mother arrived and I was about ready to push. My husband told me he didn’t think it was fair his parents weren’t going to be there and wouldn’t let up on it. Finally I told him fine because it was their grandchild too and I did feel bad about  my MIL not being there because I actually did like her, she just has no control over her sons or her husband. MIL and FIL showed up around the time I started pushing. 5 minutes in I heard FIL giggling and I snapped and told MIL and FIL to get the fuck out and don’t fucking come back until visiting hours. I heard a lot of commotion but my mother was just keeping me focused on pushing.

When I was told this, I asked him if he had given the little girl the middle finger which he denied and is not something I’ve seen him do. Nevertheless I asked a couple of other kids if they had heard what happened or witnessed it and they said my son had not given anyone the middle finger but they were playing a game were they crIss crossed the middle and index fingers on their hands to indicate they were safe and in “time out”from the game they were playing.

I saw how upset my son was thinking this adult had made a real threat towards him and I went off to confront the other parent. I asked her if she had told my son that she would bend his fingers back to break them because she thought he had given someone the middle finger. She did not deny it, weakly confirmed it and tried to explain herself by saying she thought it was the middle finger but later found out it was a game they were playing.

I went off on her and told her to fuck off while giving her the middle finger and telling her that telling a 9 year old boy what she had said was wrong and if she had a problem she should of told the parents and not the kid.  I also pointed out had anyone else pulled that shit with her daughter she would of been pissed and not let that shit go. You want to go threaten an adult go threaten an adult but don’t threaten a kid etc. 

She tried to explain herself but I just wasn’t having any of it. She ended up leaving the party with her daughter and husband. On the way out she saw my son and went up to him to apologize before leaving. Needless to say me yelling at her and giving her the finger made the rest of the party for me a bit uncomfortable.

I'm 24f girlfriend is 25f

when I was 8 my parents divorced, it was a pretty ok divorce and my mum was given full custody of me. my dad visited every day and took me out almost every weekend. 

around 3 years ago he met a new girl (kate) who I never really liked, I tried to tolerate her but it was becoming more difficult as her vewis got in the way. she is super anti gay and I'm lesbian. my dad tries to stay neutral on this and has stopped inviting us out together. but I cant help resenting him because of who he is dating. 

he still tells me he loves me and my fiance but I'm unsure if its true. he accepted me when I came out but now that he is with his girlfriend and going to a super homophobic church I'm unsure if he is still pro gay.
he has also liked a few of her anti gay posts. 

in 8 months me and my fiance are getting married and we both decided not to invite my dad and i would get my mum to walk me down the aisle. 

well dad called Me few days ago asking where his invite went, I explained that he would not be attending because he is dating someone extremely homophobic and going to a homophobic church, means I would rather you not come.
 i said it as nicely as possible but I still managed to anger him. 

I've now been blocked on everything and he had been sharing photos with the family in them and excluding me. 

most of my family have tried to stay neutral on this but some have expressed that I took it to far

1807,Not the A-hole,"Just got into an argument with my brother in law (not the one whose kids are being watched) because he says I am inconveniencing everyone and being a dick by not helping to watch my niece and nephew during the week. 

For added detail, the kids are about 14 and 12 and apparently need to be checked up on one once a day for just a few minutes around lunch time. I seem to be expected to be the one to do this since my office is about 5 minutes from where they live, however I commute over 30 mins to this job each way, work through lunch (9 hours a day) so I can leave early and beat traffic home, and my desk is literally 15 minutes from the car (it is a HUGE office building), so I can’t take a short break to check in on them without turning it into at least a 45ish minute ordeal. To clarify, i would have to stay late to make up any missed time from this, as my time sheet MUST equal 40 hours worked at the end of the week, unless I fill it with PTO. 

My brother in law is unemployed and lives just a little further away than my office is (maybe 10 mins max). He has not given any indication of any circumstances that make it difficult to check in on the kids, other than I guess it’s just an inconvenience to leave the house once a day?

1808,Not the A-hole,"Context: 6 years ago, my wife inherited her grandfather's apartment in a well-known ski resort (her brother and sister have equal shares). When trying to decide what to do with it (rent or sell), my wife (Laura) and her brother (Max) got into an argument as they couldn't find an agreement on the rental/selling conditions. Max wanted to provide the minimum comfort to the guests while adding additional beds to maximize profit, while Laura wanted to invest some money into the place to make it stylish. Because Laura is sensitive and didn't want to create a family scandal, she dropped the matter and tried to forget it.

For the last 6 years, Max have been taking care of the place and silently renting it (up to ~1200$ per week) without her sisters having any visibity on it, nor earning a dime. This is a topic we've been talking about together as it affects her a lot. Max clearly feels ok taking advantage of her which make her feel sad and depressed. Keep in mind that Max is a very tough person to talk to as he gets aggressive very quickly when things don't go his way, especially when money is involved. Laura recently tried to talk to him again about it but he keeps avoiding any real talk. This is especially hard to get anywhere as they don't see each other very often. We tried to ask for help to Laura's family (father, grandfather) but without any success. They clearly don't want to take ""sides"", something that we understand as family business can be tricky. Laura also offered him several times to ""buy her out"" so he could rent it as he wishes, but apparenly this is not part of his estate investments priorities.

AITA: Yesterday evening, I was attending my wife's cousin birthday and during a talk we were having with Max, Laura mentionned the apartment. Now, I always try to avoid getting personally involved in my in-law's business as I don't feel comfortable with it. But yesterday, he tried to bullshit her once again and I didn't want to let this fly. So I got into a pretty heated argument with Max. I tried to keep it low but he was loud and his family heard every piece of it. I basically told him that I was not ok with him stealing her sisters' money and that he never tried to find any compromise despite Laura's flexibility. I asked him to make things right as I didn't want to see my wife getting depressed about it anymore. I even offered him some solutions (like a year-in-year-out rental deal while forgetting about the last 6 years) but the argument suddently went a very different way. He basically started to call me an opportunist, and that I was only here to steal his family's money. Told me that this was none of my concern and that Laura should speak for herself if she had any issue with it. My wife proceeded to call him names as she felt I was being disrespected and then pretty much left the birthday party in tears. I really regret that everything went down during a family birthday party as most people there weren't concerned by this.

“No phones allowed in the bedroom.” In order to use my cellphone that I have purchased myself, I have to sit in the living room of my house... leaving me with essentially no privacy. I do not believe in order to communicate with my friends that I should have to sit in a common area of the house where I can be monitored closely. If my sister and I were to somehow end up falling asleep with our phones in the bedrooms, he will come in yelling and wake us up to take them out. As if we’re doing anything, we’re literally sleeping. 
Earlier today he came into my room screaming about how I’m not allowed to have my phone in there and when I got up to speak he made the comment “you’re wearing inappropriate clothes, I don’t want you sending pictures” I was wearing shorts and a tank top in my own house lounging??? I was literally sitting under a blanket reading stuff on reddit dude, but go off. If I were to have a sleepover (honestly not really allowed to do that either) he goes as far as to tell the parents not to allow me or my friend our phones. He also makes our friends keep their phones out of our rooms when they come over to hang out.

1820,Not enough info,"A few weeks ago I (14) was woken up at 11 a.m.  My dad told me to come out to plan the day. This is not unusual as we would often plan what needed to be done. I got out of bed, quicker than usual, and headed out. As I was walking their way I decided I was hungry and popped a bagel into the toaster. Then I sat down on the couch.

Then my mom asked “why the hell did you go in there?” Confused I responded “I’m hungry so I got a bagel.” My dad then said “well that was the wrong move.” “How!?” I responded. He then said that it showed that I did not see them as important. Extremely confused I said that I thought this was a casual conversation. My mom then said, well as you can see it is not.

Then the toaster rang, so I went to grab the bagel (Note: at this point I believed that if you left something in the toaster it would burn). I set it on a plate and left it on the counter. As I returned to the couch my mom asked, what the hell were you thinking! I responded that if I didn’t take it out it would burn (I now know that is false). My dad, yelling, WHY THE HELL ARE YOU DISRESPECTING US. Visibly upset I responded that I didn’t mean to. My mom then said that “you sure as hell did!”

1821,Asshole,"My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn’t she have asked??

Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

1822,Not the A-hole,"So, long story short, I've dealt with pretty unwelcome treatment from my in-laws for years (lots of microaggressions and some outright acts of shittiness like being kicked out of a car by my SIL because she was in a bad mood).  In their defense, they would say they didn't realize I felt this way.  My husband says he didn't realize this even though I have a nightly bitch session about their general unwelcoming behavior when we spend time with his family.  And, yes, I have tried addressing this with them and, no, it didn't help. Yes, I have talked about this with my husband and, while he feels sympathy, he has never stepped in even when they've made me cry (see being kicked out of car, above).

They decided to vacation where we live this year; I used an out-of-town conference to leave for the entire week they were here.  My mother lives with us for half the year and was in our house when they were in town.  Now, she is all Mama Bear about the way they have acted and is mad at my in-laws, my husband, and me (for putting up with this for so long).  Evidently when they stopped by, my mother gave them the cold shoulder in only the way that elderly immigrant women can.  They ended up spending most of their time together in the house they rented rather than our house.

So, here is my question (finally!): my husband is angry that my mother treated his family this way and cannot let it go.  I understand how he feels, but also don't care.  They have truly been mean to me and he has only intervened when I threatened to walk out of a family gathering. AITA for feeling a bit pleased that they have gotten a taste of their own medicine?

I lost my airpod about 45 minutes ago and could not find it ANYWHERE. I checked the trash to see maybe if I threw it away with my food. I moved a paper plate to find an obviously used condom tied up at the bottom. We’ve taken out the trash at least half a dozen times since they left; it couldn’t be anyone else’s in the house but my sister’s. But her fiancé is at a research program across the country for the summer. I’m not super close to her fiancé, but I’m VERY against cheating. WIBTA for texting him what I saw?

Edit: A lot of people said talk to her, so i knocked on her door and she opened it and I asked why is there a condom in the trash. She looked like a deer in headlights and asked why I was going through the trash. I said it was none of her business and she said so it's none of mine and closed the door in my face.

Edit: So I texted her saying I knew she was cheating and I just wanted her to come clean and tell her boyfriend (I lied, I didn't know, but I couldn't prove anything). She said to mind my own fucking business. I told her if she doesn't tell, I will and she said if I tell, she'll tell mom that she caught me smoking weed (which is complete bull; she knows I don't smoke, but our mom HATES smoking because her brother is a drug addict and she thought she smelled it on me coming from my stoner friend's house).

**UPDATE** 

First, I just want to say Reddit is strange. I was downvoted to hell and called a creepy wierdo pervert because I thought the likely scenario (that my sister was cheating). Now that it was basically confirmed, the tides shifted? I never went to sleep so heavily in the negatives only to wake up upvoted; does Reddit live in a fantasy world where cheating never happens?

And anyways, I texted my sister. I told her that I'm honestly not trying to judge her, but if she doesn't think her relationship is working, she should go ahead and end it, but she shouldn't lead the poor dude on nor does she have to make up lies about me. She said she can do what she wants and why am I so intent in not minding my own business anyways, and that I'm acting creepy and weird. 

That was pretty much the confirmation (the fact she didn't deny that she was making up lies to me) and I told my mom about the incident. She's furious (she doesn't want her having sex at all, very conservative woman. The fact that she's *cheating* though made her irate) and she said to not worry and she'll handle it. I then texted everything to her fiance and told her I found a condom in the trash, it's my sister's, and that sorry but I felt he should know and I hope everything works out. He called me to find out about the situation (as it turns out, she DID try to make up lies about me to him, but she was vague. He still found it weird) but when I explained everything, he seemed to believe me and took it okay. All of this just happened so I'm awaiting to see how my sister reacts.

1826,Not the A-hole,"I (20F) do yoga 6-7 times a week, and 3 of those times I do it in a class at a studio nearby. I go to 3 different teachers there; 2 of them are lighter/probably good for beginners or those with injuries and 1 teacher there is particularly intense. Her classes are honest-to-God workouts and I love them. I've been going to this particular instructor for 2 years.

I'm pretty welcoming to newcomers to the studio; today, there was a new woman in the yoga class that is pretty intense. She was on the older side - probably about 50-60. She was beside me the whole class and I could see her struggling to keep up with some of the moves. After the class, she commented that I seemed to be pretty good at the moves and I said thank-you - I've been doing yoga for years. She said she was just getting into it but she found the class too intense and she might ask the instructor to tone it down next time.

That kind of annoyed me a little; you're totally welcome to join any class in my opinion and if you can't do a certain move, you should just modify it or go into child's pose (a resting posture) until you're ready again. 

What I said to her was basically that she can modify any move she likes if she can't do it and maybe one day she'll find herself able to do it. I was trying to being encouraging but she said again she thinks the class is too intense for her and the instructor needs to tone it down. I suggested to her that maybe this class wasn't right for her then and she could try one of the other classes that aren't quite as intense, as that would probably be a better option then asking the instructor to tone down the class for her.

She seemed quite mad at that, like I was trying to kick her out of the class. I wasn't, but I love my intense classes. I was a little miffed that she thought she could ask the instructor to tone it down for everyone just because she couldn't quite do anything; at the same time, I feel like I might be TA because this woman was trying to get back into shape and she's annoyed this young girl was ""telling her off"" or something.

1828,Not the A-hole,"Hey y’all. So basically me and my friends from high school had a rift about a year ago. I was not invited to birthday parties, BBQs and various other hang out type stuff

Come to find out this was the doing of my “friend”, who I’ll call L. L would regularly shit talk behind my back, saying I was too loud and fidgety(a result of ADHD) and that I couldn’t be taken anywhere. He eventually started telling lies about me to make sure I would not be invited, stuff like me calling my friends pregnant sister a “whore” and saying that I had tried to sabotage one of my friends from getting a football scholarship, just utterly ridiculous things that I would never do.

It worked for a while until my best friend confronted the rest of the group, and provided evidence that L was lying. I was welcomed back with open arms. Apologies were had all around and L was the one who was now excluded, though for a much shorter time than I was (about a month, where as I was around 3 months.) My friends all made fun of him and mocked him and called him a dick but eventually he was reluctantly fully re-integrated. 

Now whenever we’re all together and he tries to talk to me, I give one word answers, and walk away. He called me and gave a semi-heartfelt apology, saying that his parents were going through a divorce and it generally made him a crappier person, though he did not fully apologize for the rude names and the stuff about my adhd, but he also did apologize for lying.

Long story short, I shot down the apology and told him that I trusted him and considered him a friend, and there was no reason and no excuse for stabbing me in the back like that.

1831,Not the A-hole,"Background: my husband and I (F34) are raising two kids (M8, F11), in an expensive city, on two teachers' salaries. We've been saving for years to eventually move to a less urban district and buy a place of our own. In the past, we've kept our food budget really cheap by buying LOTS of cheap and processed foods. It's how we both ate growing up, but I've recently been trying to change that. I've figured out that we can afford some really decent meals if I shop around and we eat SMALLER amounts of really good foods. It's gone well so far, we've all lost a little weight, and everyone is enjoying trying new things and feeling fancy,

As a result, however, my kids are eating less than they are used to. They are getting the recommended number of calories for their ages, but I don't make enough food at meal times for there to be seconds. That's how we can afford to eat as well as we've been eating.

To be clear: we aren't on a diet. For example, last night for dinner we had a southwestern steak salad (4oz of skirt steak, spring mix, corn, beans, avocado, feta, tortilla chips, and homemade chipotle ranch dressing) with half a baked potato (with sour cream) each.

But some nights, the kids will say they are still hungry and ask for a snack. I think that they are just used to being stuffed vs. full, so my response is that they must wait forty five minutes for their food to settle, and then they can choose something to snack on. Only twice in the last two weeks has my son asked for the snack forty five minutes later.

My husband disagrees with this, and says I'm being a jerk by letting our kids feel hungry.

1833,No A-holes here,"My friend has been a vegetarian for about three years and became vegan shortly after. There was a period where we didn't talk much after high school but still followed each other on social media. On social media, he was a bit of a strict and borderline militant vegan (reblogging posts using the phrase ""omnivore"" once or twice). While I don't plan on giving up meat and dairy and stuff like that, I do respect his veganism though it made me a bit hesitant to reconnect at first. 

Anyhow we reconnected a bit and he wasn't nearly as intense about irl as he was online, so that's good. However when we hung out with friends earlier this summer on the beach, he ended up ordering fries and fried oreos (since he couldn't eat the pizza on the beach) 

I don't think I realized it until later, but I think it'd be safe to assume that the beach didn't have vegan batter for the fried oreos. (Oreos themselves are vegan from what people have told me and what I've looked up, with the only debate being over cross contamination which doesn't seem like a big deal for ethics-based veganism VS dietary restrictions) 

Next time something like this happens WIBTA if I kept quiet? It's not that I want to trick the friend, but I feel like I'll either be further limiting his food options or I'll be coming off as a buzzkill or worse, a know-it-all trying to make a point.

&#x200B;

So my brother is my best man. We have had a shaky relationship, but I feel like lately he has turned himself around and I thought it would be a good gesture for our relationship for him to be my best man.

&#x200B;

At the time, my brother was unemployed, and I figured that meant more time for him to be there for me with the wedding stuff. A couple weeks ago he got a new job and I congratulated him, at the same time politely reminding him that he makes sure he gets off the wedding day as to be there for me to prepare. He told me he did and everything is good to go.

&#x200B;

That was a month ago, we are now two weeks to the wedding and my dad (not him) informed me that the person that was supposed to 'cover' his shift that day called out, so now he has to go in that day. While he would still technically be able to attend the wedding (ceremony starts at 7, he gets off at 3 and is an hour away), this puts a HUGE damper on the plans we had as every person in the bridal party had a role to play in getting ready.

&#x200B;

I called my brother and asked him to let his boss know that's it's unacceptable that he needs to go in to work that day and that they need to figure it out. He told me to 'calm down bro' and that he can't do anything about it- with this attitude of not caring.  It upset me. He's my best man and he won't be there for the majority of the day.

&#x200B;

I don't want my brother to get fired from his new job obviously, but I feel like he isn't prioritizing his role as best man for me.

&#x200B;

AITA for being upset with him?",141,249,0.92
1835,No A-holes here,"My sister and her husbands 15 year anniversary was coming up and he booked her a surprise visit to Bali. Obviously that’s a huge trip and he asked family beforehand if we’d all be willing to pitch in and look after their 2 kids (8 y/o niece and 9 y/o nephew) on their 2 week vacation.

I immediately offered to look after my niece, but not my nephew. He is destructive, rude, doesn’t listen, and breaks my sons toys. He will literally break down wooden doors if he doesn’t get his way, because his hyper masculine father and traditional mother laughs it all off as a great big joke and boys will be boys. I have to admit, he DOES try and be a good father and they’ll usually own up to their mistakes but usually after the fact.  My own parenting style is quite different. On the other hand, my niece and son get along very well as they’re both obsessed with the same sorts of books and toys. She is very gentle, thoughtful, and articulate and she’s nothing like her brother. 

My brother in law at the time of my offering was very relieved and took me up on my offer. My parents took my nephew, grudgingly, and they pleaded with me to look after both kids which I resolutely said no to. They are both in their late 50’s and have a stupidly disposable income, as well as a private chef and maid. I’m a single mom, I don’t have time or energy to look after 3 kids, 1 of whom has destructive behavioral issues. 

I had a really good time with my niece, as I don’t work a traditional 9-5 so had a lot of free time for the kids. I didn’t take my nephew out on excursions because I literally CANNOT control him- he will spit, kick, yell, shove, etc, and he cannot he calmed down. 

I did however book my parents + nephew the same tickets to whatever I was doing, but I really don’t want him around my son (we limit exposure even at family gatherings) and so they’d go on different days. 

When my sister and BIL came back they were very grateful, and I have to stress they didn’t at all seem entitled or angry, but my sister expressed that she was very sad that her son was left out and he was jealous that he was stuck with the ‘boring’ family members whereas his sister had the ‘fun’ one. I feel really awful because he DOES love me, and he can be a very sweet and loving child. But his temper scares me, and I have my own 7 year old child to think about keeping safe too. My mom and dad still think I was wrong for offering to take one kid, not both, and as much as I loved my time with my niece I’m regretting offering in the first place.",74,351,0.95
1836,Not the A-hole,"This happened recently and I still don’t know what to think about it. A friend referred me to help house sit, something I’ve never done before. They told me: 1, don’t burn the house down. 2, take care of the dogs. Easy enough, except that it wasn’t. I don’t know what they did in between meeting them and sitting, but the place was completely fucking messy,

Dirty dishes everywhere, clothes and books strewn across the tables and floor, clumps of dog hairs strewn like spiderwebs. I guess that now I was looking, I noticed other things. Deep stains in the stair carpet and other things like that.
Since I’m enrolled in online college, I found myself with a lot of spare time alone at the house. Sitting in that shit house started to have an effect on me. So, I got on to cleaning. First it was the dirty dishes. I gathered the books and began organizing them into their lacking bookshelf.

All this was starting to feel really good. I washed and folded the laundry, swept and vacuumed the floors, I even scrubbed some of the nasty stains deep in their carpets. I dusted the shelves and turned that place picture worthy.

When they finally came home, I was expecting gratitude, or just a little something. Instead, they shoved the pay in my hands, coldly said ‘thank you’, and slammed the door in my face. When I later asked if everything was okay, they said that they were not paying me to do anything else and that I had no right to manage their belongings.

I just tried to fix up their house. I honestly just think they’re embarrassed and insecure but AITA?",60,165,0.95
1837,Not the A-hole,"I am male; This may be relevant below. 

A few weeks ago I was on line at the corner convenience store. One person was ahead of me at the register. A 30-something woman came up behind me and flagged my attention. She was obviously in a hurry and a little stressed and said to me something to the effect of, ""Can I go ahead of you in line? I left my kids in the movie theatre and need to get back to them right away."" The movie theatre is about two blocks away and across a street. I glanced at her and she was carrying a handbag, but I didn't see anything she was holding to buy, and I was kind of confused and wondering what the big emergency was. Not knowing what else to say, I just repeated back to her, ""You left your kids in the movie theatre?"" in a bewildered tone. Well, I guess she took this as a hard ""no"". She became indignant, saying stuff like, ""Fine, if you don't want to help a mother then don't let me go first"" etc. At this point I decided to just pay for my items quickly and leave. But before I left the store I had to know-- what was she buying that was such an emergency? 

Welp, it was a box of maxi pads. I guess she was having a period emergency and ran out to get supplies, but didn't want to go into details with a strange guy on the line. I don't know if she was holding the pads when she asked to cut in line, but if she was, I didn't see them at all. But after realizing this, I felt like a jackass.

On my way out she saw me. She flipped me off and yelled to me that I was an asshole. Was she right?",259,909,0.95
1838,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I have been together about a year. I lived with him for the first 5/6 months, then I moved back home. As of right now, I pretty much still spend a lot of time at his house, and I really come here after work to shower, eat, and change and get myself together. 

My boyfriend always tells me I can shower st his parents house or I can cook at his parents house, but honestly I’m so hesitant. His family is absolutely disgusting. I was brought up by a very organized mom. Tupperware, foil, plastics, etc. were essential. Leftovers were stored properly. We were taught to keep everything as clean as possible during the week, then we would deep clean (dust, mop, vaccuum, etc.) every Sunday. His family is completely opposite. They kind of...dont care about cleanliness like that. There is rarely any dusting or vacuuming so the carpets are kind of gross. Nothing really has a place. They leave their shaved hairs all over the soaps, sinks, and showers. It’s 3 males and his mom so I never know whos hair it really is. The shower is moldy, his dad claims it’s just the steam from the shower but it doesn’t ever go away? They have no respect for personal items and have used my bath sponge and toothbrush before. Every morning I have to search for both my toothbrush and toothpaste because it’s always being moved. Sometimes I find my toothbrush on the floor or other obscure places. 

He has a special needs brother who constantly pees all over the toilet seat and floor. I’ve stepped in it multiple times. Smeared feces on the wall. I know that he can’t help it, but his mom doesn’t really bother to clean up after him. The soap bar will look like he just mushed it between his fingers and threw it in the sink and jammed it in the drain constantly, and it will stay there for days. Weeks. As for the kitchen, everything seems very disorderly. His brother will take bites out of random foods, like a block of cheese, and just leave it in the refrigerator like that completely uncovered. He will lick a ba of doritos and his mom will roll up the bag and put them back in the pantry for the next person to find. There are random produce items out everywhere, some rotten, some still fresh, that it kind of grosses me out. The fridge looks like the most cleaning its gotten is a nice wipe down with a damp rag. They leave oil in their pans for weeks, I’m not talking a little layer, I’m talking he pulled it out to use it and there was a pool of oil and he just used it to cook. I don’t even know how old it is. Everything just seems very poorly taken care of. My boyfriend kind of sees it, but he has so much else in his life to take care of he simply can’t keep the house in order on top of everything else. I feel if I were to tell him why I always decline he will get his feelings hurt. He doesn’t bring people around because he knows how his family is, and I just don’t want to make him upset by constantly telling him no. WIBTA??",22,37,0.85
1839,Not the A-hole,"My baby showers in my back yard next month and my friend is helping, who I know loves planning parties.

Just today we had a conversation in messenger that got me irritated. Taylor is helping me plan the baby shower. Taylor tells me Sadie wants to help out. (Sadie is an ex coworker of ours, we all parted ways from the company 2 years ago. Sadie is more of an acquaintance to me, and maybe more of a friend to Taylor).

Taylor: Hey babe! I forgot to tell ya that Sadie wants to help with the baby shower too! Make sure to send her a FB invite 😘

Me: so is she coming to the shower too? Not that i mind because i like Sadie but i have a lot of people coming with their kids im expecting a turnout of 30 to 35 people already as is. I dont like that u laid it on me without consulting the person whos buying all the supplies.

Taylor: Oh sorry. I just thought she would be a good help, and she asked if she could. Just tried to help. My bad

I go on to apologized for lashing out and told her we have a lot of people that are coming I even had to delete people off the invite because they didnt reply in time before i got up to 30 people to say they were coming. 30 people is my cap.

Taylor: I understand you're pregnant and hormones are running high. If you feel like I am taking over the job of hosting your baby shower I can totally just make cupcakes or whatever you assign me?

I get a bit more pissed as she's blaming my hormones. 
Me: Its not my hormones. Its a courtesy of not inviting people to other peoples events without letting them know. For me it was just a slight boundary that was crossed. im sorry for lashing out at you. 
If it were your event i still would ask if my husband or kids could come with and not assume.

I then tried to call her because i didnt want either one of us getting frustrated over messenger and lines could get crossed. She wasnt able to pick up so we continue messaging eachother.

Taylor: I was just not expecting you to react like this, and honestly I'm really caught off guard. I have NO IDEA why you're talking to me like this, since you have never acted like this to me, and if it's not the hormones, and you truly intended to snap on your FRIEND that has put hours into helping you, and intended to do everything to make your shower amazing, then I think I'm good. I don't feel I did something so horrible that warranted a reaction like this from you. All I had to do was tell Taylor that you over invited, and thanks anyway.

I go on to apologized some more on how i came off. 

She read the last message i sent but never replied. Its been over an hour.

I feel that im justified. Its my budget. Its my backyard and can only have so many people that can be held in the back yard before its overly crowded. I just thought it was a common courtesy before you go inviting people to someone else's event you double check to make sure.

edit:
Good news i reached back out in messenger to my friend. I told her what i thought my expectations were and what i thought hers was. I explained how maybe i was unsure how things are done when i ask someone to host the shower. She responded back almost immediately and said she was so glad i had apologized and that we will still get together tomorrow morning to do planning and talk more about where in the middle we meet.

1840,Not the A-hole,"I have a 9 month old daughter who is adorable but a rather larger baby. She has cute, chubby baby rolls all over her body. Because she is so adorably chubby, my boyfriend (her dad) and I have given her the nicknames chunker monkers, chonkey, chunky, chunkers, and chubbers. 

We are calling her this right now because she’s an adorable, chubby 9 month old, as mentioned above. We aren’t gonna be calling her these names when she’s older. 

Well, my parents heard me call her chunkers and chonkey in front of them and got mad at me. They said not to call her that as she is, “a beautiful baby girl,” and “you’re going to give her self-esteem and body issues”. I never said my daughter is ugly and, as mentioned above, we don’t intend on using these nicknames when she’s older.

1843,Asshole,"My girlfriend Denise and I are both 17 and we’ve been together for 9 months now. She’s amazing and sweet and things couldn’t be better. Expect for one problem. There’s this girl Sarah who for a lack of a better word has been bullied by Denise and her friends for a little less than half. a year. They’ve been calling her fat, bitch, cunt, taunt her in various ways and while she’s denied it I think that Sarah or one of her friends spread a rumor about her being easy to get to bed which really upset Sarah. 

I’ve tried talking to her about it, but she would get upset when I brought the topic up and accused me of liking Sarah and not caring enough about her. Since it’s become such a touchy subject I just didn’t really bother her or her friends about it. I mean why bring it up if it’s only going to complicate your life more right? But it kind of came to a head a few days ago at the pool. Denise and I were hanging out some a couple of her friends when we saw Sarah. They wanted to pull a prank on her and while I tried to convince her not to do it Denise was pretty adamant so I just kind of acquiesced. 

They got some milk and popsicles from the life guards office and made a sludge and put it in one of those super soaker things. They sprayed Sarah with it and she fell into the pool. People at the pool laughed, but Sarah started crying and ran out. I kind of just ignored all this because it’s not really my problem and it causes friction between me and Denise. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Like I feel bad, but Denise and I have a great time together and I don’t want to risk us by brining this up.

So would I be the asshole if I didn’t talk to Denise about this?


**edit**: So this is an update sorry it took so long. I decided to talk to my Denise about what happened at my house. She started out by saying it just a fun prank and then when I pushed it she asked why it even mattered so much to me and that I don’t even know Sarah well. I told her I was worried she was acting rather cruel to somebody. She started accusing me of secretly liking Sarah and then not liking Denise herself. I told her that’s absolutely not true, I just didn’t like seeing a bad side of her. She told me again why it even matters and said we can just avoid this topic and have fun. She started kissing me and I went with it and we had sex.

Afterwards I didn’t want to push it, but felt that if I put it off I may never bring it up again. So I again tried to talk to her about this. She said its just some fun that she and her friends have and it’s no big deal. I told her that Sarah seems to take it as a big deal considering she was crying after the super soaker pool incident. She continued to insist that it was harmless fun. I told her I had to rethink being with someone who can’t understand the gravity of what she did and she kind of freaked out and left.

A couple days later I met Denise after not talking to her for that time and said she’d try to be more understanding about the whole situation. I told her to just stop messing with Sarah and just leave her alone completely. She said that maybe she had gone a little too far and said that although she doesn’t really want to stop she’ll do it because it’s bothering me so much. When I asked her about her friends she said they might not leave Sarah alone, but she’ll talk to them. I told her I understood and that was that.

I think that Sarah wasn’t cruel as many people put it, but rather she was just a little ignorant about some other people’s feelings. She thought it was just some fun and missed the bigger picture. I’m glad I posted and I’m glad I managed to really talk with her and work things out.",821,1604,0.9

1848,Not the A-hole,"Hey reddit. long time lurker, short time poster.These events happened today so this maybe bias.

Im from the U.K I’m 17 close to 18 and in the last few weeks finished my last year of 6th form getting ready for hopefully going to uni. In this time I’ve tried to get my first job but have had no success. I live with my mum but stay 2 nights a week with my dad, he doesn’t pay for any of my hobbies and I don’t ask him to so I don’t cost much. My dad is also very well off.

My dad had been out most of the morning, at the cinema without my siblings and I . However when he got back dad started talking about the hole he needed filled in the garden along with the planter ( which is going to be hard work)  and I said I’d do it for free since I didn’t have anything on that day I needed to do. So I’m playing catch with my brother saying yes to all the things he’s telling me to do. He’d  repeated it about 6 times so I knew what he was asking for.
Suddenly my step mum accuses me of ignoring him and being rude and looking down on him. I apologise but say I was listening just multitasking and I think the conversations over. They then walk off until about a minute lasted when my dad comes back and says to get out and find a fucking job. Then he says don’t come back until I get one, he gets angry about my unemployment a lot.

This sounds like I’m making it up for fake reddit points but this is what he does, if he has an argument or can’t get is own way he suddenly flips and does stuff like this and me and my siblings know it’s the step-mum whispering in his ear about how we’re disrespectful.  I say ok and pack my bags and go to leave like a bitch when he stops me and says “I never want to see you again until you find a job .“ which I though was extreme but left anyway.
So after walking around town for about 2 hours with a heavy bag and my stuff looking to find something, which was my own fault I probably should left it but I don’t trust them, I decide enough is enough and meet my mum and go home, This is at around 3.30pm. When my dad drops the other off at 6.00pm he calls me out to talk. SShe says he want me to be out from my mums house looking for work the whole of Monday and he wants my at his early on Tuesday to start hole. This is where I put my foot down, I tell him politely to fuck off and he can do the thing himself if he’s going to kick me out for no reason and tell me to never come back. And he reply by telling me he never wants to see me again

Now this was the straw that broke the camels back and other thing have happened like this in the past ( we think he may have narcissistic tendencies and be borderline bipolar since metal illness runs on that side of the family).

At this point, we agreed to minimal contact, so I could help her with college applications and such. She calls me by my first name and doesn’t consider me mom, but says she harbors no ill will.

Knowing that my family could possibly find out somehow, I finally decided to tell them. They were pissed that I had kept this a long term secret.

1. I don’t push back if a guy wants me to pay my share on a first date. To me, it’s a signal of “we spent time together but I’m not interested in you romantically,” so I’m not upset. I would not be interested in seeing the guy after that. 
2. Yes, I pay for dates. Just not the first one. And when I pay for dates, I plan them, invite the guy, etc. I would expect a 50/50 split overall over time. 
3. I don’t require expensive dates. I always let the guy plan the first date so he can pick something that’s within his budget. 
4. If I’m not interested in the guy and know I won’t see him again, I would offer to pay my share on the first date and gladly follow through.

They told me to find other methods to get food but I’m still a few months from getting my license so I can’t drive to go get it. When I ordered from a delivery service and paid for my own food, they yelled at me for wasting money. They got mad at me when I asked them what the kitchen good for if you’re not going to use it. I even offered to clean the whole entire kitchen if they let me cook but they still objected. Their reasoning is it would depreciate the value of the house. They’re pretty reasonable people so, AITA for asking them what the point of having a kitchen is if you’re not going to use it? 
Edit: thx guys, might show this to them to make. Hopefully, they oblige. 
Edit 2: Got my grandfather involved and he was not too happy about it. He called my parents and somehow convinced them to allow me to use the kitchen. The only exception is that I’m not allowed to use the frying pan but anything else is fine and that I have to clean the kitchen once a week. So got that resolved pretty quickly.

1855,Asshole,"I’ve been dating this girl for 4 months. She’s pretty cool overall but I did notice early on that she was really close to her younger brother. He is 3 years younger than her and still in high school. Weirds things they do:

1.She facetimes him nearly every day. Like we could be hanging out or at a party and she’ll be like “Oh I haven’t’ facetimed my brother yet” 

2. On Instagram nearly all her pictures are of the 2 of them (to be fair she only has maybe 20 pictures on Instagram in all but still I would say she has maybe 3 or 4 pictures that he isn’t in). He's comments on all her insta pictures stuff like ""love you""

She tried to explain it away by saying her brother was autistic and they were just really close. That made it a bit less weird to me but I soon started to realized her brother is a very high functioning autistic person and probably just has Asperger’s. Talking to him you wouldn’t think he had Autism.

It got even weirder recently. She’s doing summer classes at our university so this summer she isn’t going home. Her brother apparently missed her and so she invited him to stay with in her dorm for a couple days. Like in the same room. She claimed he was bored and had a small break before the summer activities he was doing started up and he wanted to check out the city and campus since he might come to the school next year and he had a friend in the area. She acted like it was completely normal.

My logic is if he wanted to check out the city, why didn’t her 16-year-old brother come with her parents and stay in a hotel or Airbnb or whatever? Staying in the same tiny room as your older sister is just weird to me. While he was here she and her brother made a plan to go to this popular local amusement. I wasn’t doing anything so I asked if I could come along. She seemed hesitant as if she didn’t want me to come but then agreed. The whole time were were there I honestly felt like a third wheel the whole time. She and her brother spent most of the time talking to each other. She occasionally would lean in to kiss me or hold my hand but she was focused on her brother most of the time. I have to admit the whole thing really annoyed me and after we got back I confronted her about it and said that he ignored me the whole time I was at the park and how weird the relationship between her and her brother is and it’s borderline incestuous (I was kinda kidding about the incestuous thing) But she got super offended and accused me of being a million things, creepy, , pervy, assholish, racist (her brother is biracial). I apologized many times for offending her but she stayed angry and a day later she broke up with me.

AITA here? honestly despite apologizing I still feel the relationship she has with her brother is weird. I talked to some of my friends who agree with me but my sister thinks that I was being judgmental and people have different relationships.",138,296,0.91
1856,Not the A-hole,"So I’m getting married in fall of 2020 and we are looking at venues and making plans. I’m trying to stay really relaxed about it all and enjoy it. My mom said she was talking to my grandmother and she already picked a dress to wear: a white dress. 

I freaked out internally a bit and told my mom that she shouldn’t wear white because the bride should be the only one to wear white. My mom argued that there is a tradition for the maternal side of the family to wear white which I’ve never heard of and no one I’ve asked has heard of it either.

1857,Not the A-hole,"Background info: I (17f) have a split family. I live with my grandparents most of the time, I go to my dad's maybe once a week, and during the school year, I go to my mom's maybe once a month, but I spend about half of my summer at my mom's. I have three siblings at my mom's (13f, 12f, and 6m) who are very loud and keep me up all night during the summer, throwing off my sleeping schedule until I'm practically nocturnal. My grandparents are very devout Christians, and I used to be as well, until I began questioning my faith about a year ago.  


I calmly tried to have a discussion with my grandparents about not going to church a while, so I could have some space to think about things and consider my faith from a slightly more objective perspective. They didn't listen at all. They cut me off at every opportunity and yelled at me that I was going to Hell, and while I lived under their roof, I would follow their rules.  


We argued about it a lot whenever Sunday came around, but I eventually gave up and started going with them without argument since it was only for one hour on a Sunday. It wasn't worth the arguments and constant tension between us. My grandparents then went on pretending I had never questioned my faith at all.  


Come summertime, I immediately went to my mom's for about 3 weeks. As usual, my sleeping schedule was ruined, but it was summer, so I was in no rush to fix it. My grandmother didn't like that I was staying up all night, and we frequently argued about it(I wasn't being noisy or keeping her up). My grandmother didn't like that I was eating in the middle of the night, so I started eating only one meal a day, and that was the end of that, or so I thought.  


My cat had to go to the vet for severe constipation and had to have his stool removed, and he had to stay overnight. The vet said that he had to stay separate from the other cats for a few days, so my grandparents left him in my room with a litter box, food, and water. I was fine with that, except my grandmother kept coming in to check on him every hour or so, and being as noisy as possible while doing so, waking me up constantly. She kept me up 5 hours past the time I usually go to sleep, then told me we were going to church in the morning.  


I tried to explain that I couldn't just change my sleeping schedule overnight AND that she had kept me up for a long time, but she told me she didn't care, that it was my fault for going to my mom's and my fault for spending time around my siblings, who are apparently ""bad influences."" I snapped at her, and we argued for the next hour or so, and I told her I was going to lock my door when I went to sleep, and she told me my grandfather would pick the lock and they would drag me out if they had to.  


I've told some of my other relatives about this and most of them tell me I'm in the wrong, as I live with them, I am a minor, and I can make my own decisions once I move out, which really made me begin to question if I was in the right. So Reddit, AITA?",13,27,0.86
1858,No A-holes here,"I want to know in case I'm ever in this situation again.

My dog and I took an 8 hour drive to another state for him to have surgery, the reason is that clinic specializes in this surgery and makes it affordable when it's usually very unaffordable.

We left at 2am from our state, got to the clinic by 10am, he went into surgery at noon, I picked him up at 7 that evening and we spent the night in a hotel before driving back in the morning. The plan was to leave as early in the morning as possible so my dog could get home and recover.

I woke up at around 5 am due to a horrible stench and my dog freaking out. He had some kind of reaction to the sedation and medications and shat ALL OVER the hotel room.

I just want to note that this is a hotel chain well-known for allowing pets so he was allowed to be in the hotel.

Anyway I leaped up and brought him outside as he was still in the middle of having this diarrhea everywhere. We spent about 30 minutes outside, it seemed like it all came out. Then I went back in the hotel room started trying to clean, but it was clear I did not have the needed supplies.

I went to WalMart to get cleaning supplies, got back about 20 minutes later and the situation in the hotel room was TWICE as bad as what it was when I left.

I then spent the next 3 hours on my hands and knees scrubbing hotel room carpet and all surfaces. All soft and washable things that got dirty (towels, sheets, blankets) I piled them in the tub. 

By the time I was done in the hotel room you could not tell it had been an epic shit disaster unless you were really looking for stains and knew which ones had already been on the carpet when we got there. It was very sanitary and clean.

I threw out all my own trash such as used paper towels and rags etc.

However I did leave all the dirty hotel stuff in a jumble in the tub. 

My dog was still sick and I felt I had to get on the road. I was also really afraid he would have explosive diarrhea in my car during the 8 hour drive back so I wanted to get going.

I left a note explaining the situation and a tip for the hotel staff.

1862,Not the A-hole,"TL;DR: Mentally disabled coworker has exhibited disturbing traits and I will be mean if it keeps him away from me. Coworker thinks he doesnt know any better and I should be nice. 

I work in a big box store. They hired a cart pusher that is mentally disabled, and at first everyone went out of their way to be nice to him. I got very bad vibes tho, and point blank refuse to talk to him. If he addresses me, I pretend not to hear, and go out of my way to avoid him. Something about him rubs me very very wrong. Maybe it sounds dramatic, but he has the glint in his eye of serial killer to me. 

He repeatedly comes up to my coworker who is nice to him and prattles off about how his friend was murdered, in great detail, and some guy shot her. No concept of social norms. Additionally, every time theres a murder of a woman in the news, he has to recite in detail about it. 

He is clearly mentally disabled to the point his mother has to care for him, but he can handle pushing carts. 

I recently found out that in a fit of rage he hit his mother in the face with a hammer. He also openly bragged in the break room that in high school he threatened to hit his teacher and she got scared and it was ""funny"". 

He has a bad habit of coming up to people he doesnt know and just starting conversations. After finding out about the hammer and the teacher threats, I told him that I dont like him, thats why I dont talk to him, and Id appreciate if he would leave me alone. 

Im a young woman and I am fearful that if I'm nice to him because of his disability, that he will percieve it as a crush, and then get mad and potentially hurt or stalk me when I don't reciprocate.

My coworker told me that he's too mentally disabled to control what he says and he doesnt know better so I should at least be nice.

1863,Not the A-hole,"My son was supposed to have just wrapped up his junior year in university. It turns out, he has been failing and dropping lots of classes. He always told my wife and I that his grades are fine and that his GPA is okay. The only access we had to his school account was to make tuition payments. We even paid for a more expensive school because he really wanted to go there. His sister also went to this school and had a great experience so we were okay with it. 

He came home this summer and told us the truth. He had been on academic alert since his first semester for failing a class. However, his GPA was still okay because his other classes pulled up the F. Overtime, he started failing and dropping more classes and his GPA went down more and more until he hit probation. He was suspended for failing to bring his GPA above a 2.0. Apparently he appealed the decision and the dean told him he could have one more chance instead of taking an involuntary year off but he would be dismissed from the school if he failed anymore classes. Well lo and behold, he failed another class and was kicked out. He then had no choice but to come clean to us.

We have spent around $28,000 a year ($18,000 tuition + $10,000 dorm/food, not including the spending money we gave him every month). We spent $84,000 for him to only come out of that school with 34 credits. We did this because both of us graduated college with huge student loan debts and we wanted him to enter his career with no debt. 

He applied to another school as soon as he found out he was suspended and got accepted. However, I told him I would not be paying anymore tuition, and that he would need to take out federal loans (and that we would not be cosigning on any private loans). I eventually relented and came up with an idea. I said he could earn my trust back by going to community college for a semester or two (which we would pay for). If he passed all of his classes, then we could pay for his other university on a semester-by-semester basis and we would need to see his grades online every term. I also said he would need to go see someone at school to figure out what bad habits or learning issues led him to this point and to help him avoid it from here on out. If he felt like he needed any kind of therapy, we would cover that too. 

Well my son absolutley hates the idea of going to community college. My wife thinks I'm an asshole for refusing to just give him a second chance without all of this community college nonsense. 

I also mentioned to my wife that college isn't for everyone and if this doesn't work out, maybe he needs to look into a trade. She wouldn't hear that either.

1867,Not the A-hole,"So there’s a lot of backstory which I don’t have patience, or probably space, to fill in.  But basically I moved with my wife 3 years ago to be by her family in California.  

When we lived on the other coast, I noticed a habit of immediately volunteering cash to her sister whenever she needed it for bills, etc.  Sister and husband are good people, weren’t devoid of funds because they were spending it on stupid stuff, they both worked, etc, and I get being all about family.  What annoyed me a little bit was that I was working massive OT, and then a second job, for us to save up for our dream wedding, and she just lend them the money without even asking me or discussing it.

Since we got here, my wife has bent over backwards to be accommodating to her family.  We were here nearly two years before we had our daughter, and during that time my wife would always watch out nieces and nephews whenever asked.  Even if she had work at 4 or 5 am the next day, she couldn’t say no.  And if childcare was needed and she wasn’t available, she would volunteer me first, and ask me about it later.  No consideration for how tired or anything else we may be.  Now that we have a child of our own, the stress and exhaustion level of her mom and sisters always factors into whether we ask them for help, usually I end up switching my work schedule around.

The last straw came with a move her sister’s family just made.  They were living in the house her mom owns and paying half the mortgage.  Now they have moved out because her mom wants to get it ready to sell.  The process of deciding if they should move out is a whole other story, but the back and forth has been about a year plus.  Suddenly, when they are going, they realize their mom will need a fridge.  So they take the one that came with our current place (we had our own) but guess who will have to figure out how and when to get it back when the time comes? Me.  Also, mom doesn’t have a TV in the living room, so wifey volunteered our bedroom TV and streaming stick.  And sister’s table she ordered for new place hasn’t arrived yet, so “we” volunteered to give her kids our babies picnic table that she loves and sits calmly at to eat.

I am all for helping family, but I feel like sometimes if I had an opinion or questions about the logistics of the help, it doesn’t matter because I’m not consulted until after.  AITA for this bothering me??",146,1239,0.97

1870,Not the A-hole,"Little bit of background: My friends and I had made a thing out of going to watch all marvel new releases at the movies together as a group. Been this way for years and the 7 or so of us have never missed one. A day or few ago, unbeknownst to me, everyone else in the group organised to see the new spider-man without me. In this group is my ex partner (C). I regularly talk to C and I was under the impression that we were on fairly good terms. We’ve been apart for months. The night before the movie, C tells me that C will be going to watch a movie with friends the next day, so they may not be able to reply in conversation. When, out of curiosity, I asked which movie and with whom, I was told to respect their privacy and that it was none of my business. I will admit that I pressed on with my questions (which I look back at and believe it was out of line). After being firmly told that it’s none of my business I stopped and left it and thought nothing else of it. 

The morning after, I saw the ad for the new Spider-Man on YouTube or whatever and texted the main marvel fan in the group to ask when we were all going to be watching the movie. “Oh actually a few of us are going tonight” When I asked who was going, I was met with a list of everyone in the group, including C. I asked C why they were trying to hide a group activity with me and I was berated for “putting this on them” because “it wasn’t their problem”.  I spoke to the other members of the group and ended up attending the movie with them later that day. Afterwards I’ve been told that I’m an asshole for showing up uninvited and that I shouldn’t have gone when C didn’t want me there (by C).

1874,Update,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aoadwq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancee_to_dance_to_a/

Two months ago, I married the love of my life. I was thinking about this thread the other day, how it went, and where my head was at when I made it, and I thought you guys might like an update.

A little anticlimactically, the thing I was stressing about was a bit of a miscommunication, which probably happens a lot here. Kayla wanted to dance with her late fiance's (I'll go ahead and just call him Luke from now on) father at our wedding, and Vanilla Twilight was an example of a song along the lines of what she wanted, not the set-in-stone top choice like I had thought. I (and a lot of commenters in the original thread) spent a lot of time over-analyzing the lyrics to that song looking for hidden meaning in every word, while it turns out she hadn't put much more thought into the suggestion than ""This is a kind of sad song that I like.""

We got together that night and she had made several playlists of possible first dance songs for us, songs for when she walks down the aisle, music to play at the reception, and song choices for her dance with Luke's father. We spent hours listening to them all and talking about the wedding. We even made a tournament-style bracket for our first dance song in her journal and put songs head to head against each other until the victor emerged. And at the end, we talked about the wedding and our relationship, Luke and their relationship, and grief, what it was like when she lost him and what it was like for me when I lost my mom at a young age, what a family is, and all the things we're hopeful for for the future. We stayed up until three in the morning just talking and planning and laughing and crying a little, and I'm so glad for it. After getting bombarded by dozens of different opinions from dozens of different people earlier that day, I had been worried that I was going to have a conflict with my fiancee shortly before our wedding. But there was no conflict, just a pure memory.

After that night, I starting putting in more effort to be involved with the wedding planning process and actually ask for the things I wanted, which Kayla actually really appreciated. We also took a long weekend a couple of weeks before the wedding to go on a camping trip together for just the two of us, which I highly recommend to anyone who is getting married. Overall, there was a complete flip in my feelings leading up to the wedding from being somewhat insecure and excited but nervous to being completely at ease, excited, and feeling stronger about my relationship than ever.

The wedding day itself was really wonderful and worth the wait. Kayla and Luke's father had their dance to Lean On Me, and I also had a dance with Kayla's mom and it was very emotional in a good way. I really felt that the day was a celebration of our love, and I was genuinely happy that Luke's parents were there to celebrate along with us because they are very much members of our family and I wish I had the space to describe all the ways they've been there for us through the years.

My amazing wife is who she is because of all the experiences that she has had in her life, and I don't want to be the kind of man who asks her to pretend that she has never loved before me or pretend that her grief is something that is or should be done with forever now that she has me. I just want to say how glad I am that we shared that night together and that the wedding was nothing but love and celebration. I never thought I could be so happy.",304,13240,0.97

So I am a pool attendant at a community pool, and my job is pretty simple. Test the pool water and yell at kids to stop running. Recently, there has been this one family that brings like 5 massive inflatable toys. This wouldn't be a problem for me if the family wasn't obnoxious and didn't constantly leave their toys in the pool everytime they left. So everyday I work I'm stuck with cleaning up somebody else's mess. Usually I just clean up their stuff and leave it in a corner of the fence, hoping that maybe one time they will do the same. But for the tenth time, around last week, the family came, played with all their toys and left me another mess to clean up. I was absolutely done with dealing with their mess. So I devised a plan. Every time the family left all their stuff in the pool I would pop one of their inflatable toys. 

It's been 3 shifts of this and they still have no clue why their toys keep popping. AITA for popping their toys?

My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.

It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.

Throughout the day, various friends were asking to use my sunscreen because they forgot theirs or ran out. Knowing how often I had to reapply and how little sunscreen I had, I always said no. Some people got annoyed because they would shake the bottle and say I had more than enough to share but I have had my fair share of sunburns and I just wasn’t willing to run out of sunscreen and get a burn myself because other people didn’t bring sunscreen when we were supposed to be on the beach for like 11 straight hours. My best friend in particular got mad I wouldn’t share because mine was spray and hers was lotion and she said she was feeling too lazy to rub hers in and the spray was easier. 

So, AITA for not sharing my sunscreen?",39,109,0.93
1880,No A-holes here,"Context: 

I drove my family 16 hours to visit grandpa (FIL) who just had open heart surgery (3 months ago)

We are 1 hour from Disney/LEGO/UnivStudios but didn’t plan anything fun. 

We’ve done the routine family stuff: walk the outdoor shopping mall, have dinner out, celebrate the 4th. 

Having done all that I thought I might be able to dip out after everyone had gone to bed and catch a late showing of Spider-Man. When I mentioned it to my wife, she blew up and started yelling at me. She said we have plenty of movies at home and I shouldn’t leave family like that. She said I could watch it by myself when we got back home from vacation. Then she asked me not to “abandon” her by sneaking out to go see it anyway.

Further context: this family takes forever to get ready in the morning. MIL doesn’t get out of bed until 10:30. Our son is usually playing with them all night, while my wife (who hates her parents) sits in the guest room on Facebook. So, I’m usually stuck watching tv, or browsing Reddit by myself out of boredom. I don’t feel entitled to see a movie, but I work hard and don’t take any vacation for myself. Also, my wife doesn’t like Marvel movies, so going solo was an afterthought. 

Still, I feel bad for asking her to go by myself. 

AITA?

UPDATE: didn’t take long for the rational redditors of this sub to help me sort this out. IM THE A-HOLE. I should have offered to make it a date night, and chosen a movie she liked, or something she could join me in. I also clearly overlooked her stress level. Despite her issues with her parents in the past, she’s clearly stressed about her father’s health scare. I’m gonna go apologize now. 

Thank you all for making me appear to be a wise, thoughtful and apologetic individual, when in reality I’m just another a-hole.",35,34,0.89

1882,Everyone Sucks,"Among my group of friends there's one person who is a chronic pathological liar, but for the sake of civility I've tried to refrain from calling him out on it and generally kept things sane. However, one thing that truly bothers me is that this person is a huge gossip, and doesn't have any qualms about spreading personal DMs he's had with other people to everyone else and sometimes using it to make fun of them.

Recently, due to a few accidental discoveries, I've also found out that said person has been cheating on his wife pretty much continuously for 5 years. Around the same time, he's taken a particular interest in trying to make me look bad to my friends due to something I did that he didn't like (the details of which are unimportant).

I took this info I had to him, but since I didn't really want to get involved with destroying a marriage, I told him that I will leave things be and forget about it if he acts like a normal person and stops gossiping about me. He agreed, and I thought all was relatively good.

Then, a couple months later, he started pushing boundaries by making small quips about me among our friends. I reminded him again and he freaked out and told me he was having a panic attack (this was an online conversation, so I have no idea if he was actually telling the truth or just trying to manipulate me). I told him to calm down and said I won't do anything now, but I didn't like that he was testing my limits. Around the same time he also decided to introduce a large portion of our friend group to another couple of friends that he has and getting them all to hang out as a group, all without me. He says it isn't his intent to purposely exclude me, but he makes literally no effort to invite me to hang out with them and I only find out about events after the fact.

Recently, I found out that he's been saying some nasty stuff about me behind my back and making my friends swear not to tell me, but one of them told me anyway. I'm about to reveal how much of a shit person he is to my friends as well as his, by exposing his cheating ways among other stuff he's lied about to everyone, as well as all the gossiping he's been doing about other people, but I'm a bit hesitant since it really feels like blackmail and like I'm doing it out of spite. I just want this person to fuck off and stop trying to target me, and I feel like our friends deserve to know this person's true nature because of how much they trust him and his words at face value, when really pretty much everything that comes out of his mouth is a complete lie.",77,292,0.94

My older brother has a son who I love like you wouldn't believe. His name is Aiden and he'll be turning 6 in a few weeks (I've never made a birthday of his, yet another one I wo't be there for) I have very limited contact with him because his mom hates my guts so I get to see Aiden every once in a while when my brother brings him over to my parents (where I'm crashing, also whos ponying up the massive cash for my next rehab stay). I'm pretty child like so Aiden and I get along really well and he loves playing video games with me. I did a stint in both county and rehab this winter and when I got out Aiden was old enough to know that I was gone so of course he asked. 

I told him I was away as a jet pilot in the army and that I also am in the navy seals. He thought that was awesome and I had to create really elaborate lies about killing isis people and had to show him pictures of these dudes with their faces covered up and say that was actually me but it's so secret that I can't be seen on the internet. he loved every bit of it. My brother is pissed of course but I don't think he corrected my lie. 

Am I the asshole for this? to me its way better because I'm fucked up enough as it is and when he's older I can' explain to him that I was never in the army or the navy seals.

I hav a family with two young children, and both are huge animal lovers.  We’ve never had a real pet before, and they’ve been dying for one.  We always assumed we would get a dog at some point, and have been waiting until we felt we were properly able to care for one.

Well the other day our neighbors cat had a litter of kittens and my kids are absolutely in love with these.  To me it feels like one of those really nice moments in life to take advantage of.  My wife is as well ( important context:  she’s allergic to all animals, and will need frequent allergy shots ).  

I am fine with whatever my kids and wife want, but when we told my mom our plans she freaked out on me saying that we’re basically barring her from coming over the house.  My response was that “you’re only over the house a handful of times per year, and I’m happy to have professional cleaning when that happens, as well as keep the animal in a separate room, etc”.  She’s allergic, my aunt is allergic, much of my family as well as my wife’s family is allergic to cats.  Despite that, it doesn’t feel fair to me for them to dictate what kind of lifestyle we have at home for the few occasions that they come over.

And oh on mobile, so sorry for any formatting error.

So I babysat my nephew, 2-going-3 year old of awesomeness, just now because my sister and BIL wanted to watch Far From Home. I went to the mall with them so I just had my niece for the ~3 hours they watched the movie. My sister gave me money for my nephew's entertainment and our lunch. Their request is only one: no cellphone or screen of any kind. My nephew tends to have a tantrum if the cellphone is taken away from him si he has been on a cellphone-fast for 2 weeks now.

So off they go watching the movie. We rode indoor trains and played zombie games where we throw balls at emerging zombies. Basically we had a good time. For lunch we went to a family friendly restaurant, in which I know the food is loved by my nephew. So we ordered some food and waited.

You know how toddlers are, they can't sit still doing nothing obviously. My nephew likes playing transfer-the-water. Basically he likes to transport water from one container to another. So I gave him two glasses and he scooped the water from glass #1 to glass #2 with a spoon. You can imagine the water got spilled in the process. He did spill the water directly to the table a couple time because there is flower pattern on the glass table and he wanted to ""water the flower"". But he didn't scream and bother everyone else, he didn't cry, he kept to himself, he finished his meal (noodles), and not once he asked for my cellphone. I tried to clean up as clean as I could and I left a large tip as a sign of apology (50-55% of our bill). Mind you, in my country tip is not expected and is seen as a sign of gratitude.

But when I was leaving the restaurant I got stopped by a woman whom I believe was there with her family. She said that she can't believe I let ""my brat"" made a mess and to just not bring him to restaurant anymore if he can't behave himself. I was flabbergasted and just say ""thank you for your input but I don't need it"" and left.

So AITA? I felt so guilty because I am not a parent and didn't know what a parent would do in that situation. But the lady was, so maybe she's right?

My friend and I both stayed over at my other friends house and I packed 2 pairs of disposable lenses for the next day, because I have dry eye syndrome and it helps if I switch out my lenses halfway through the day. 

I also buy the more expensive ones that have more hydrating properties to them, because of aforementioned dry eyes so I always buy the exact amount I need, not more. 

The next day, we were planning on going to a theme park. My friend is pretty scatterbrained and forgot to pack hers in her overnight bag. She has slightly worse eyesight than me and asked if she could have my second disposable pair. I told her sorry, no, because I was planning to switch halfway.

She was very upset with me the whole day and was very quiet. I felt awful but my own health comes first and I didn’t feel comfortable giving them away.

1894,Asshole,"I didn't know how to make a decent title out of this.

Mark is someone I met two years ago through our local Church volunteering program. We've also traveled together as chaperons for the children's choir.

He's a nice guy and a great friend, going out of his way to be kind and selfless. I can tell faith means a lot to him.

Last year was the first time Mark admitted that he's been struggling with his sexuality for awhile. However, he specifically told me he didn't wish to talk about it, mainly because he was trying to figure some things out on his own. I respected that and never brought it up.

About two months ago, Mark wound up in the ER due to a severe panic attack, mistaken for a stroke. We've been hanging out more since and he has been opening up about his life problems, a lot of which are currently centered on sexuality. He doesn't want to accept that he's gay because he can't in good consciousness leave Catholicism and lead a content life (his own words).

Now I happen to know someone from college, likewise religious and gay, who struggled with similar issues. We don't talk much these days, but I'm aware he's currently practicing celibacy and has devoted most of his spare time to charity missions.

Last time we met, he told me a bit about everything he's learned on reconciling faith and sexuality, and he seems happy and much less anxious than back in college.

My conflict:

Would it be appropriate to share this old friend's contact with Mark? Please note that I don't personally believe there's anything wrong with being LGBTQ, however since Mark is specifically struggling with the question of religion and sexuality, perhaps a talk with this guy could be helpful? Or at least give him someone to relate to.

That's my reasoning anyway, but I might be mistaken. Maybe I shouldn't meddle at all. I'm open to judgment.",72,109,0.91
1895,Not the A-hole,"The title probably makes me seem like the asshole from the get go, but the background info changes things. 

Background: I lived in a house with three other women this past year, we were all seniors/juniors in college. I’ll refer to my roommates as C, K and R. C, K and I lived together the year before and when we found the house we wanted to live in and needed a fourth spot filled, R agreed to live with us. Before signing the lease I made sure to let R know that the three of us are pretty laid back in regards to partying; we all smoke weed and like to go out on the weekends. This was something we wouldn’t be changing. R is very religious and doesn’t get into that kind of stuff but said it wouldn’t be a problem. Yet when we moved in she told us she wasn’t comfortable with us smoking weed in the house and was constantly asking us to be quiet in the house by 10 PM on Friday and Saturday nights. This made the relationship pretty tense, there weren’t many fond feelings by the time I moved out in May.

So I moved to my hometown for a job I got but couldn’t find a sub leaser, so my room is still in my name. I go up to visit on weekends to see my friends. Per our lease agreement, everyone is responsible for paying some type of appliance through the lease. I pay rent, R pays power, K pays WiFi/cable and C pays gas. We split each bill 4 ways it just has to be in one persons name. Early this past week R randomly texts us to let us know that she found a job in a different city and will have to be cancelling the power in her name because she needs to set it up for her new apartment. It was inconvenient that this happens around a holiday when we’re all gone and she was 100% violating the lease agreement but whatever, what can you really do? So today K calls the power company to get things situated and they told her it’d be no problem to get things switched into her name but it’d be a $300 fee. None of us are made of money so coming up with that randomly for something that isn’t supposed to be our responsibility was frustrating. We all tried calling and texting R a million times but she wasn’t answering. Eventually she responded to us and said that she wouldn’t be helping with the fee and it wasn’t her fault or problem. We essentially told her to go fuck herself and have a nice life. 

The three of us were able to scrounge up the money but we were all pretty annoyed by the whole situation. Last night I remembered that since I paid the security deposit in my name (I wrote the single check, they all gave me their share of it which is one months rent for each of us). I was originally planning on just giving everyone back their share but now I think I’m going to take the $300 out of R’s portion of the security deposit once it’s returned. K and C are on board for that and several of my family members think it’s completely fair but I still feel a little icky. WIBTA for this?

Edit: I want to clarify just a few things

First, July is our last month of the lease. We’ve already paid rent, R included. Luckily she’s not screwing us on the rent payment in that regard it’s just the power bill, fee and WiFi bill. It makes the $300 fee sting a little more though because it’s literally to keep the power on for the last month we’re in the house.

Second, I took some of your advice and made her aware I was keeping the $300 plus an additional $50 for the fact that I had to use a ton of time I was at work on the phone sorting this situation out. It was 2.5 hours or so and I used the hourly rate I get paid at work for this. R took it better than expected, she didn’t think it was fair because she says she gave us enough of a warning but I have the upper hand on this, there’s not much she can do. 

Third, and this is something I find funny more than anything; R hasn’t moved out yet. I don’t know what she was thinking by screwing her roommates over while she’s still living there but it’s so stupid that it’s funny to me. C and K have decided to throw all out ragers every night until she moves out which is definitely petty but I’m not there to stop it soo... c’est la vie.",33,53,0.95

Monday night I was on a walk with a new-ish friend. She is a older than me by a little, in her early 40s. We were speaking of my recent recovery from a long term illness, and she was saying how it's good that I am healthier now because I'll be wanting to have kids with my SO soon - ""maybe two!"".

I replied ""Hmm, nah, I wont be having children"" trying to keep it casual and move the conversation on. But she pressed the issue. 

I can't remember verbatim how it went *exactly*, but she would keep arguing whenever I would say ""No, I wont be having kids"" after that. i.e saying ""Oh you MIGHT do"". I'd reply ""No I wont be having kids!"". She would press more, ""but it might happen?"". Again, I'd say no. She'd say ""But you and (boyfriend) have been together quite a while now, you talk of marriage, you might be having them soon!"" etc.

And honestly I got super annoyed. I couldn't believe that at 30, someone was arguing with me about this. I am an adult and know my own mind on this. I was also SLIGHTLY annoyed that she related the benefits of me getting better from a serious illness to me now being 'healthy to have kids' rather than, you know, it being a good thing that I am healthier for myself. Like somehow my purpose in life is to have babies. But that was probably be looking too much into it I guess... Anyway.

I didn't even think about it at all before I said it... but I was so annoyed I blurted out ""I wont be having kids because I can't have them!""

She went quiet instantly and went ""Huh?"" and I panicked and said ""Yeah I can't have kids, I have dodgy plumbing, nothing works in there"" and she went ""Oh right"" and went completely quiet, before we changed the topic.

I was relieved that she wasn't going on about it anymore. However, since then, I have felt guilty for lying about something that's quite serious and very sad for a lot of women who can't have kids, but want them. At the same time, I really like how it got her off my back...

I called the police (non-emergency line) to report this, but got directed to parking enforcement, and they then directed me to the parks board, and they directed me back to parking enforcement.  In the end, it is now with the parks board and they send a park ranger to handle it on a priority basis.  Typical government bureaucratic red tape.  I have a feeling nothing's going to be done about it.

1909,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I met in a large city, where she was finishing her PhD. I'm a native of this city and she is from a small, rural community most of the way across the country. Once things started to get serious we had a discussion regarding whether I would be willing to leave the area with her, since she had no plans to stay there after finishing her PhD. I had a decent job, but wasn't in love with it and had no qualms about leaving.

&#x200B;

The only stipulation I had was that I didn't want to live in an overly rural area. I don't want to have a 20+ minute drive to the nearest store. I'm a gamer, and we long ago cut the cord, so we need a decent internet connection. She agreed and that was that.

&#x200B;

We made wedding plans. Literally one week before the wedding, however, her mother passed away very unexpectedly. Absolute tragedy. All of us were gutted. After the funeral we returned home, and had our postponed wedding. She finished her dissertation and started looking for jobs. She wanted to be as close to her family as possible, since we were still less than a year from her mothers death. She found a job a couple hours away from her home and we moved, leaving my family, job, and everyone I had ever known more than 1000 miles away. After 3 years there she doesn't like the way the place is being run and finds a better job in a city 30 minutes from her home. So much closer to her family and a better paycheck. Win/win!

&#x200B;

Over the last few years though, she has increasingly brought up her desire to move back to her family farm. It's a very rural area with zero cell reception and no cable. She knows I am against it, and always starts off with ""It just makes me so sad that you would never want to move there."" Which I feel is a bit manipulative.

&#x200B;

I can see it from her perspective. She wants to be closer to her now retired dad. But from my perspective, she is complaining about being 30 minutes away from her family instead of **literally** on the same property as them. I haven't even *seen* my family in 4 years. I gave up everything to come with her, no questions asked. She tells me I'm an ass when I get frustrated with her for repeatedly bringing it up and making me out to be the bad guy, when its something we had discussed before we got married.

&#x200B;

I'm putting my foot down because of a shitty internet connection and no cell reception, the massive downgrade in school quality, + a long drive into town whenever you need anything...and with 3 small children we always need something...

1910,Asshole,"My husband and I got married two years ago and we are child free. My husband’s sister has a 12 year old nephew and my husband is close with him. The plan is for nephew to stay with us for 2.5 weeks this summer. (We live on the beach and his mother will be having surgery and out of commission for several days, so my husband thought it would be a nice break for him). 

Several years ago, I used to model professionally. I’m not what you’d consider famous or anything but it paid the bills. My husband has always raved about my pictures and they are all over our house. Some of the photos are nude. They are black and white and, in my opinion, very tasteful. However, my husband apparently assumed that we would take the photos down during his nephew’s stay. 

Frankly, I see nothing wrong with the pictures and I am not inclined to take them down. I don’t think that nudity is inherently sexual or shameful and I am proud of my work. Unfortunately, this has become a point of contention between my husband and I, as he feels that the photos should be temporarily removed or covered. 

I would really appreciate some neutral perspectives on this, as my nephew is coming next week.",170,84,0.74

1912,Not the A-hole,"This happened like ten minutes ago. 

I do my homework (I'm in IB, so I have a shit ton of summer homework and other stuff to do) while I listen to music. And I listen to music through YouTube. So whenever I'm clicking through my work tabs to get to YouTube to choose my music, it just looks like I'm watching YouTube videos and not getting my work done, which isn't the case. Everytime my parents happen to catch me finding another music video to listen to, they make some snarky comment about how I never do my homework and only dick around, then lecture me for hours about how I'm gonna end up homeless if I continue this (this is gonna sound like a humble brag, but I""m putting this in just for context, but I have a 4.4 GPA and do a multitude of other extracurriculars that aren't easy to keep up with).

&#x200B;

The snarky comments wouldn't be bad, if they only did it once or twice, but they say it EVERY time they see me on the computer, regardless of whether or not they've looked at my screen, and they bring up how I'm always on YouTube whenever I'm not using the computer, too. I can't even smile at my screen without my dad saying, ""OH, so I guess your homework is REALLY FUNNY, right?"" alluding to the idea that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. That launches my mom into a tirade about how I'm lazy and never do anything I'm supposed to. When I try to tell him what I'm actually doing, he smirks and says, ""Sure."" like a middle schooler, and of course, my mom chooses to believe the worst. They won't stop. I've asked them to. They won't. 

&#x200B;

It's gotten to the point where I purposely sit with my computer facing away from my parents so they won't be tempted to start something with me. This time, I happened to be clicking on a music video and my dad walked up behind me and said, ""I guess you're really busy, huh?"" and my mom was nearby and I just knew that she was going to start with the disappointed ""tsks"" and ""All we've sacrificed for you, and you still waste your time on stupid shit like playing computer games."" So I just snapped. You know that feeling where you're so angry and frustrated that you just cry even though you don't want to? I did just that, and starting yelling for my dad to look at my screen and show him that I'm actually doing homework. He just backed off and said something like, ""Lol it's just a joke."" 

&#x200B;

My mom saw this and started screaming at me, saying that if the only reason I do my homework and go to school is just for show for my parents, then I should just drop out and become a homeless person like I was destined to be.

1915,Not the A-hole,"Note I’m on mobile. Please forgive me. 

Last Saturday I got married to the love of my life. Five months before the wedding (just a month after I got engaged) my mom’s family started bugging my sister and my mom about wedding invitation. They felt VERY slighted that they hadn’t got their invite yet. They bugged them until the day they got their invites then nothing. No one RSVPed. No one told me they couldn’t come. Just nothing.

Well the wedding came and went and I still hadn’t heard anything. No one showed up. No gift, no card, no message or phone call. I was devastated. I didn’t care at all about no gifts. I just wanted to know my family cared about me.

After I got back from my honeymoon today I couldn’t take it anymore. I put them all in a group message and confronted them. The message said something along the lines of:

“I just wanted to thank you all for not even acknowledging my wedding. I didn’t even get a message from any of you. I don’t even care about not getting a gift. I just wanted to know my family cared. Thank you guys so much.” 

Almost immediately my cousin responds by telling me I didn’t get him anything for his wedding three years ago and “I don’t owe you shit.” The problem with that is I congratulated him for his wedding, I didn’t get him a present because I couldn’t afford it at the time, and I didn’t go to the wedding because I wasn’t invited. I responded with “Fuck you too” and I blocked my mom’s entire family. I’m done with them

1916,Asshole,"My grandmother passed away last year and she left some of her grandchildren her most expensive jewellery and left me (20, f) her very expensive wedding ring. By expensive i’m talking tens of thousands this ring is worth. 

Personally I don’t see the point in keeping it, I’d rather hold onto the memories of her and the ring would just be sitting in its box on my dresser for the rest of my life. 

I’m a broke university student so in my head it would make sense for me to sell the ring and use it for something that would mean a lot to me. I could use it to a) pay off my student debt b) go travelling or c) use it as saving for a downpayment for a future house. 

To me selling it and using it for that would have much more value and whichever I choose would allow me to remember my grandma how I would personally like to.

My dad told my extended family about me considering selling the ring and they all lost their shit. They genuinely seemed disgusted that I would even consider selling something so valuable to my grandma and grandad (both deceased) and they kept saying its not what she would have wanted me to do with it. Now I do agree that my grandma probably wouldn’t have wanted me to sell it as she was very materialistic and her jewellery meant a lot to her, but she left the ring to me and the ring has little meaning to me. 

Now I am conflicted as I don’t feel anything towards the ring and it wont have any use to me, but I know my grandma wouldn’t have wanted me to sell it.

1919,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea when I was 7. My mother went the route of cutting many foods from my diet to manage it. She bought me special groceries and it was an enforced rule that no one else was to eat them but me (so off limits to mom, dad, and brother). 

Flash forward to now: my IBS-D has gotten worse and more foods have been taken from my diet. (There is prescription medicine for this but my GI advised that it is not breastfeeding compatible). On top of that, I got an allergy panel done and even more foods on there that I shouldn't consume. Quote from my fiance: ""I can't think of anything left for you to eat"".

I found these cookies - dairy free, gluten free, etc etc that are actually quite good. Also, as is most my food,  they are expensive. A month ago my fiance told me he didn't want me to buy him chips ahoy cookies anymore. That he needed to eat healthier. So I stopped. Now, he has taken to asking me if he can eat my cookies. At first, I laughed and said, are you serious? But then he ate some. He keeps asking, I say no, and he tells me not to be selfish as he eats some. I get mad. 

He finally told me that he does it because he disagrees with the notion that I can have food that is off limits to others. He says he wants our daughter to grow up knowing how to share. He says I  should buy more of my cookies and let the household eat them. He also pulled the poor card about how his family of 6 would share what little food they had growing up and I am being entitled. 

I can't tell if my mom made me an asshole or if my fiance is one. Thanks

1921,Everyone Sucks,"I'll try to be brief.

My friend, BigMan, got engaged around August, 2018. Told all of us the wedding would be in June. Invited me, my friend Owl, and my other friend Wrench as groomsmen. Actually, to be more accurate, his words back in November were along the lines of ""of course I'm going to invite you guys as groomsmen.""

Fast forward to February, 2019. I haven't talked to BigMan since August. Not even texted, emailed, etc. 

Owl tells me that he talked to BigMan, and that he was going to postpone his wedding. But, keep it on the DL because BigMan was planning on telling everyone separately. Okay, no big deal.

April, 2019 our mutual friend, SharkOutOfWater (who lives in a completely different part of the country, mind you), tells Owl that BigMan delayed it until July, not ""until further notice"" like we had assumed.

May, 2019 comes and goes and I still hadn't heard from BigMan. As far as Owl and I know, he hasn't told Wrench either. Finally, I decide that Wrench has to find out from us, because obviously BigMan hasn't said a word. So we told him.

We all decide we needed an intervention with BigMan. But, strangely, as we're planning our intervention, BigMan reaches out to us and invites us all over to his place.

The gathering was awkward to say the least. BigMan told us why he was postponing his wedding (which is waaaay too personally for the internet), and gave us the new date: July 20.

Life moves on. But I don't hear anything else from him.

It's now July. Last week Wrench heard a rumor from another friend of ours that BigMan wants us to rent tuxes for his wedding.

This week, still have not heard anything. And then, Owl tells me that our other very close friend, GoatLover, wasn't invited. GoatLover was REALLY close to us all in college, and it really upset me that BigMan didn't include them.

I went home that night and put it all together - I don't know what I'm wearing. I don't know where his wedding is. I've talked to him once in the past 12 months. And he's having me as a groomsman but not even inviting GoatLover.

I decided that I would rather watch this shit show from the sidelines than be apart of it. So 15 days before his wedding (I think?) I told him I wasn't comfortable being a groomsman.

Reddit, am I the Apple here?

Edit:
I think I got my answer: ESH. I should've reached out to BigMan. I mentioned that I was using the excuse that I didn't want to throw Owl under the bus for telling me about the delay, but I could've approached him without outing Owl just fine.

I also didn't mention just because of space that BigMan was in a different country for the academic winter semester, and I felt like I couldn't contact him just because he was far away. But I should've reached out, because I'm sure he was still able to text or even IM or something...

I'm not changing my mind - I really don't feel comfortable being his groomsman. But a well put apology from me is likely in order.",26,37,0.9
1922,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for reasons.

My husband and I have been together for 8 years. We've bought our own house and work mostly from home. We have a couple as close friends, let's call them Mark and Sarah, who have been together 3 years and are renting a small unit a couple streets over from us.

As close friends do, if one of us has to be away for work or a family thing the other will housesit and vice versa. We all have pets and don't like to leave them alone overnight (if we're all away together we opt for a boarding kennel). We always offer each other payment, shout dinner, or do something equivalent to show our appreciation to each other when this happens.

Sarah has a new friend called Jack. My husband and I have only personally met him once. Jack is an ongoing argument between Mark and Sarah, but we've stayed out of it because it's not our place to say anything about their relationship. A few weeks ago I drove to another city for work. My husband stayed home, but decided to see if Mark or Sarah would be willing to housesit for a night so we could have a date in this city on my last night there. All was fine, until Sarah says Jack will be staying the night at our house to keep her company.

I don't know Jack. My pets haven't met him and being guard dogs I don't know if they'll get along with him without us there to introduce them first. Husband's home office is also full of a lot of valuable stock. My response was, 'I would prefer it if you wouldn't because I don't know Jack and I don't feel comfortable having someone I don't know in my house without me there, but here's my Netflix password so if you're bored it's an option'. The reply I got was a wall of text on how it was disappointing that I didn't trust her judgement and she was sick of people questioning her friendship with Jack. I said that I didn't have an issue with Jack, I had an issue with someone I don't know coming into my house for the first time without me or husband being there. She gave me an ultimatum of either Jack stays or she doesn't housesit. I said that's fine and asked another friend instead.

My husband, Mark and I have spoken about this. Mark supports my decision, but his call may be biased because Jack is a whole other issue for him and he doesn't even want him in their house, let alone ours. Sarah has been curt with me since and this may have ruined our friendship. My husband thinks I should've just let it go because now we won't be able to rely on her to help us in the future, but then maintains that he wouldn't have been comfortable having Jack in our house either. AITA for making this decision?

One of my friends has been my friend since we were in first grade because his mom is friends with my mom. He's autistic. He's extremely bright. He was in the gifted and talented program in elementary and middle and took the maximum AP courses in high school. It doesn't affect him intellectually but it does socially. 

Every time I have invited him to a party he completely shut down and had to leave. I get it. He can't deal with loud noises. I was with him yesterday and he kept his headphones on because of the fireworks. I invited him to my house after prom with my friends because I hosted a sleepover but he went home early from prom and didn't want to come to my house after.

1929,Everyone Sucks,"Hello all...

I inherited my grandmother's engagement ring. It's a rather plain ring with about a quarter carat center stone and two smaller stones, one on each side. I have two sons that I had offered the ring to, so they could propose to their future bride. My oldest declined and bought the ring he gave to my now daughter-in-law. My youngest declined when he married the mother of my granddaughter, who is a wonderful person and I lover her to pieces. After divorcing wife #1, he asked for the ring for wife #2. I have met #2, but I am not sure she is the right fit for my son. I reluctantly gave him the ring about 6 months ago. They got married the weekend before the Fourth, but never bothered to call me and tell me, either before or after the wedding.

I have been stewing over this for the past week. I have never been one to be angry at my children. At least not like I am right now. To give you some background, #2 is calling the shots in their relationship. She is doing exactly what their father's second wife did to me. My son does not call or text me. I received some very strongly worded text messages from ""him"" over Mother's Day, which ruined my day. (I found out from #1, #2 likes to take over his phone pretending she is him. #2 asked me to not have any contact with #1 because I should embrace his new family now.) He has not communicated with me in any meaningful way since hooking up with #2. She has taken control of his FB account, and has unfriended me for both my son and herself. Probably because she doesn't care for my political and religious stances. (She voted for the current occupant of the WH. Enough said.) Now they get married and never bother to tell me.

As a result of the actions above, I want to demand my grandmother's ring back. The ring means the world to me and represents family, love and devotion. (FYI, his dad and I were married on what would have been my grandparent's 50th wedding aaniversary.)  This woman who now wears this ring, does not imbue any of those qualities. Excuse me for being crass, but she carries my son's dick and balls in her purse. And I'm not the only one in the family that thinks this way.

1930,No A-holes here,"My wife and I adopted two beautiful twin girls, through a closed adoption. I admit we sought out closed adoption, because we felt it would be best to raise our child without another set of parents or family there. We weren’t against our children seeking out their biological family when they were adults, but as we raised them, we didn’t want them there. To clarify, we’re the same race as our children, so we’re not keeping them from learning about their culture or anything like that. We’ve also never hidden that they’re adopted and we have their biological parents’ medical history.

Their biological father reached out to us when they were 10 years old. He wanted to see them. I don’t know how he got our address. It honestly spooked us. We wrote back that this wasn’t appropriate, reminded him what a closed adoption was and that we didn’t feel comfortable with this at all. He wrote back apologizing. We did not tell the girls about this.

It’s been 8 years since and the girls graduated from high school this spring. Twin A wants to find her birth family, Twin B does not. We told both girls that we’ll support either choice, that we love them and that no matter what, we’ll always be a family. I gave the letter to Twin A, saying I wasn’t sure if her biological father would still be at this address or still have this contact information but it’d be a start. If not, then the agency would. She became instantly furious with me and my wife for not telling her or her sister about this. When her sister found out, she was equally mad, saying while she has no desire to meet this family, it was their choice. I said that at the time, they were kids and it was our choice to make. They highly disagree.

The wife still stands by that we made the right choice in not letting the girls decide, but that we might have made a mistake in not allowing it. She admitted she feels guilt about it. Both of my daughters are upset with me. Twin A has her biological family’s contact and plans to meet up with them, which I 100% support, as does my wife.

I shared this with a close network I adapted after we adapted, to get their opinions as adoptive parents. Most agreed with me, some were on my wife and daughter’s side. So, I bring it to you here. Was in the wrong to not let my daughters’ biological father see them or give them the chance to decide?

&#x200B;

ETA: A few clarifications.

We did not know the biological parents prior to the adoption. We met them once, when we went to meet the babies at the bio parents' request. The biological parents' had wanted the closed adoption and we had been matched through the agency on that shared request. We did not coerce these kids.

Our original adoption agreement stated that there was to be no contact until the kids were 18. That was on both ends. Even if we wanted to reach out, the agency would not give out information until the girls turned 18.

Some have asked why we didn't want to go with an open adoption. Like I said, we built a community of people around us that chose adoption. Some chose closed. Some chose open. One family has a great experience. Their bio mom is part of the family, she’s been at every event. Sweet as can be.

&#x200B;

Two families that chose it, had really bad experiences. Bio grandparents attempting to do drop by visits outside scheduled times. Bio parents telling the kids that their parents weren’t their “real parents”. If they’d take the kids for the afternoon, they wouldn’t listen to the rules. One managed to reign it in with therapy. The other had to move and cut off all contact.

I said I would think about it, but that I would probably want to be paid with money, not community service because it is worthless to me.

I have every other weekend parenting time along with a day during the week. It’s not enough time for me, but it’s what was legally decided through court. Her and I do not have the best relationship currently because I feel like I’m always being taken advantage of and I allow it because she always uses the “it’s for your son” excuse.

I cherish my time with my son, but for the longest time, I allowed my ex to alter the parenting schedule to suit my son’s needs, whether for activities or family or if he just wasn’t feeling well. I always tried to be as accommodating as possible, even if it meant I didn’t see him for a week or more.

Anyway, last Wednesday I was supposed to get him overnight, his mother called me and I asked if he could stay there since his cousin from out of town was staying with them. I reluctantly agreed but told her I wanted to get him Thursday instead. She agreed, and when Thursday came around, I texted her after work and said I was on my way to get him. She said they weren’t home, and I had to press her for information why. She decided to take the kids to a lake and said I needed to stop being grumpy because my son was having fun.

We argued back and forth and since I did not drive all the way out to the lake to get him when I shouldn’t have had to in the first place, I told her that we should switch weekends (last weekend was hers, this one is mine) so that I had my make up time and his activities with her that fell on my weekend wouldn’t be interrupted.

Backstory: my dad found un-used birth control under my bed about a month ago and was extremely angry over the fact that 1.) I had birth control and 2.) I had it sent to my bfs house. Keep in mind that my parents are extremely strict and religious and can't even see my underwear on the bathroom floor without freaking out

Main story: my dad hasn't spoken a single word to me since the incident. Completely straight up ignores me and just acts like I don't exist. He won't even look at me if I walk by. My step mom on the other hand talks to me sometimes, but only to tell me how sad she is that I'm not like the other girls at church.

It's been hard dealing with this. I'm not comfortable in my own home. I can't even go downstairs to eat right now and I'm starving. They won't let my little brother hang out with me. They made family holiday plans for the 4th and didn't bother inviting me.

My bf and his mom think that I should apologize for ever hiding the birth control in the first place, but mostly to ""make peace"" but I don't want to. I feel like their punishment is too harsh and it's hurting me. I'm completely alone. I have over $1000 in bills to pay and I can't even attend college this year because I don't have the money and they don't help with anything.

They're saying I'm in the wrong for not apologizing and fixing it myself. AITA?",34,109,0.97

1941,Asshole,"WMy team is me (M mid 50s), my assistant (F mid 40s), and 3 others (25F, 26M and 29M). We've worked together for 4 years. 

Let me say that I'm a good boss. A non-exhaustive list: 

* The kids have an amount of work to do by a deadline. They can come in/leave when they want. 
* We all chipped in for some couches and video games in the main room. 
* If anyone were to have a baby they would get 4 months of paid leave.
* We have the highest productivity and highest employee satisfaction in the company
* Most days nobody leaves before 5. The employees hang out when they're done with work or wait for me/my assistant and we'll for drinks with our spouses (my assistant and I are married, to different people)
* I host a weekly barbecue with my 16 yo daughter and my assistant's 13 and 12 yo kids as well.
* The employees have jokingly referred to us as Mom and Dad. It's an exceedingly well functioning work environment. They come to me for advice and we joke around. I care about my employees on an individual level and would help them out any way that I could.

I'm overall an excellent boss. 

That brings us to this past week. I'm already in a bad mood because my daughter has been going through a MAJOR rebellious phase after we told her she was adopted and has been a disrespectful nightmare. We're giving her a long leash and going to therapy but it's stressful and I would like work to be not so. On Tuesday, one of the employees (let's call her Anna, 25F) wanted me to sign over some documents. I told her I'd do it when I had time as I was feeling on edge with my wife texting me after dealing with my teenager throwing a fit over something small when she was home from school. 

Anna said ""Oh, come on Bob, don't be an asshole. As if you have better things to do."" That is completely unacceptable, I'm already dealing with my kid being disrespectful and I don't need it from my employees. I told her to watch herself, that I'm not her friend or her father that she can speak to me like that, I'm her boss. I said if she speaks to me like that again she's fired. It's worth noting that I said this calmly and did not yell. She apologized and looked upset which made me feel bad. She also had red eyes later in the day. The other two were giving me looks all day and my assistant said there was no need to be mean. 

Anna and the others have been subdued all week. My wife says that I unnecessarily took my anger out on Anna. I say that I didn't respond in any way that would be unreasonable from any other boss being called an asshole by his employee, and why should I be treated any less respectfully? I do feel bad but don't want to demean myself. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I let this situation fizzle out without apologizing for appropriately reprimanding my employee?

&#x200B;

TL;DR: snapped at my employee. My wife wants me to apologize.

Update: Alright guys, I get it, I'm the asshole and shouldn't have said anything about firing anyone. You're also all right in that we have a friendly, joking atmosphere and I flipped my lid for no reason because I was feeling trod on at home and at work. I didn't want to admit I was wrong because apologizing takes a hit out of my ego- it's a character flaw that I need to work on.",92,220,0.93
1942,Not the A-hole,"My mother and I have had one massive source of conflict over the last decade or so: she wants grandkids, I will never give her any.

&#x200B;

Some facts about me (that my mother knows and acknowledges to various degrees) :

* 32 years old, only child
* a lesbian but not exactly interested in having a relationship with anyone
* have been vocally childfree/child-negative since I was about 14 years old
* vocally pro-choice and openly say I would get an abortion if I ever got pregnant for any reason, even though they are illegal in our country

&#x200B;

And yet, whenever I talk to my mother, she never fails to bring up:

* my female cousins having babies/my male cousins impregnating women
* me finding a man and getting pregnant asap
* me possibly having 'an accident' that ends in pregnancy (I'm *pretty* sure she means an 'oops baby'...)
* my clock ticking
* how her sisters are all grandmas already and she is not

&#x200B;

This has been going on for a long, long time, and I am just beyond tired of explaining my views to her. So recently I've just been replying with 'you will never become a grandma' and walking away/hanging up/ending the conversation.

1945,Asshole,"On mobile and using a throwaway.

My fiance just had emergency surgery earlier this week. She had a tubal pregnancy which means the egg stopped in her fallopian tube and started growing there instead of her uturus. That can be really dangerous if not caught, and it did cause a lot of internal bleeding. She had to have the embryo and enveloping mass removed from her fallopian tube before it ruptured. Thankfully everything went fine, the doctor said my fiance did incredible in surgery and she even got to go home the same day. The nurses said she started showing signs of recovery and the ability to walk so much sooner than the average patient. Super super thankful.

But of course, we still lost a pregnancy, and that comes with grief. My fiance has also never had surgery or been dependent on anyone before and this past week I've had to do everything for her and I've been super glad to do it. But it has definitely affected her pride and i know she feels guilty for having to be so dependent. I've helped her get up to go to the bathroom, take her meds on time, helped her walk, showers etc. I've taken off a few days of work to do so. My boss is totally fine with me missing as much as I need to for this. 

Yesterday, she had a really good day and I thought I'd be able to go back to work today. She was walking more and more and she even wanted to get out of the house for a bit, which was a huge improvement. Early this morning though, she woke up in a ton of pain again and I had her take one of her narcotics. An hour later I started getting ready for work, she was really out of it. She woke up and started crying, saying she was in pain, confused, and kind of scared. I told her I'd be back for an early lunch but really needed to get to work. She nodded and said she understood but she kept crying and saying she really did not want to be alone, but didn't want to keep me home. I told her to call me if she needed anything and to try to go back to sleep. 

She's really strong and I know it was just the medicine affecting her, and that she will be fine. I feel guilty because I think I was really looking forward to going back to work and not having to do everything for my fiance today, and the set back was disappointing. I could still hear her kind of crying when I left. Did I mess this up? I think I'm just exhausted and that could be messing with my judgement, and so I wanted to ask reddit. Am I the asshole for going back to work when my fiance was in pain?

EDIT:  My mom does stop by to check on how we are doing 2-3 times a day and has brought us dinner every night since the surgery. Also, while my boss is fine with me missing work it does not qualify as my sick time and I am not getting compensated while I miss work. We are also in a financial crunch at the moment because my fiance is in between jobs and I'm the only one who works. But we are not in a detrimental state of finances yet, but I just want to avoid that. I still think I should have stayed home and I love my fiance more than words.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone, especially those with words of comfort for both fiance and I. We kept in contact all day when she woke up from her nap and she felt much better. She was glad I went in to work. I took a super long lunch with her too and brought home her favorite chocolate strawberries. If I wouldn't have gone in I also wouldn't have gotten holiday pay for the 4th so we both agreed it made the most sense. Shes doing really well today too and we are looking forward to a weekend of resting and recovery.",71,56,0.82

* She cries when people even criticize her slightly, much less if people yell at her. 
* She panics in an emergency, like water boiling over on the stove caused a major freak out and inability to problem solve. 
* She would have to pass psych testing.

1949,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my girlfriend is afraid of water and any time we go to the beach I have to hold her while we're in the ocean.

I was pretty buzzed and we were walking back from chest deep water, when we got to ankle deep, I told her ""okay you can walk from here.""

She then has a full blown panic attack and starts wiggling and freaking out saying ""no don't put me down I don't like the way the sand rolls over my feet.""

I'm buzzed and her wiggling is choking me and hurting me because I'm holding her and already having trouble without the help of the water holding her up.

I have a moment of anger in this instance and say ""get the fuck off of me"" because she's damn hurting me of and then she sprints out of the water.

Her and her sister then proceed to tell me what an asshole I was because I yelled at her as she was kicking and screaming in my arms over standing in water that didn't even come up to her shins.

I feel strongly that she acted ridiculous but she keeps saying that I should ""respect her fear of the feeling of sand rolling over her feet.""

Edit for those asking for info: 

She walked out into the water, I didn't carry her out. It was her and her sisters idea to go to the beach. She asked me to take her out into the water. She's never been afraid of ankle deep water but deep water  because we've been to the beach 3 or 4 times while dating and this has never occurred until this time.

Edit: Someone gave me an idea and I wrote a very sweet love letter and apology to her about respecting her phobias and gifted her some river shoes in a beautifully wrapped box with note written with ""tender love and affection so that the sand may never roll over her feet again."" I'll accept the YTA judgement now for this admittingly petty but feel good move.

1950,Not the A-hole,"TLDR at bottom

I've been going to the same barber, to the same barbershop, bi weekly, for a year and a half now. 

Sometimes on Facebook they ask questions about new products, services, or ideas the owner has. Well they asked what everyone thought about bringing in a ""Hot"" nurse to do Botox injections occasionally. I commented about how it might be a bad idea because if something bad happened like an allergic reaction they don't have the staff or facilities to handle it.

Well the owner deleted my comment and blocked me from the page so I can no longer make appointments.

I told my barber about it and she was pissed. When she confronted the owner about it she got fired.

Here's where my question comes in. My barber told me that technically all but one barber don't have a (legally required) barber's license and that the owner doesn't have one either. 
Would I be the asshole for reporting the shop for having barber's without licenses?

1951,No A-holes here,"Edits at the bottom!

A bit of history: my husband and I have been together almost 4 years, married almost 2. I came into our relationship with 2 kids (currently 10 and 11 years old), and we recently had a baby. My SIL has never treated my older kids like she sees them as family, and has honestly never really acted like she likes me at all. My husband agrees. 

SIL recently got engaged and is of course now planning her wedding. She has not spoken a single word to my husband or I about any part she wants us or the kids to have in the wedding, which is perfectly fine. We aren’t expecting to be in the bridal party, or to really be involved other than as guests and to help set up/clean up on the day of. Again, perfectly fine, no issue there. 

The issue came up when we were visiting with my husband’s other sister, and she mentioned that engaged SIL (ESIL from here on out) wants our baby to be the ring bearer. Ok, that would be adorable. Weird for her to mention it to her sister rather than her brother, the parent of said baby, but whatever. Then the other sister said ESIL wants other sister’s son to be the one to escort my baby down the aisle, and ESIL’s daughter will be the flower girl. 

This is where I’m bothered. It clearly makes sense for ESIL’s daughter to be the flower girl. It makes sense to want the baby to be the ring bearer because I mean, come on, how cute, right? But if another kid is needed to escort the baby down the aisle rather than having the flower girl do it, shouldn’t it be one of his brothers? At this rate, my two older kids will be the only kids in the family excluded from being in the wedding. Maybe I’m overly sensitive, but it seems super deliberate to me based on previous behavior. It’s like a very thinly veiled “I don’t see you as family” in my eyes. 

I don’t honestly know if my kids would notice, or if they would even care. I guess my concern is if they DID notice and WERE hurt by it, I don’t know how to downplay it when I can 100% say that if I were in their shoes and someone who I called family seemed to be deliberately leaving me out of something while including my sibling I would be incredibly hurt. 

Anyone I’ve mentioned this to says I need to let it go because it’s her wedding and I shouldn’t make a big deal out of it, but I want to flat out refuse to let the baby be part of the wedding when his brothers are being excluded. My husband agrees, but he’s the only one so far. So, AITA?

Edit: of course there’s a typo in the title 🤦🏼‍♀️

Also, to clarify, this isn’t by any means the first time she’s done something to make it seem she doesn’t like my kids/doesn’t consider them family. I can see how it looks like she just want a kid from each family - which honestly might actually be what she’s doing. I’d probably have a better feeling if my husband or myself had been asked by her rather than hearing secondhand. We also haven’t seen her in over a month, and that was before we were told this was what she wanted to do. The build up of her behavior towards them is what leads me to believe it’s deliberate.

Edit 2: based on the responses I’ve gotten here, and a discussion with my husband, we’ve got a game plan. I can see how my feelings about ESIL are coloring how I feel about the situation as a whole. At this point we are going to operate under the assumption that none of us are going to be part of the wedding since we haven’t been asked directly. If she asks for the baby to be in the wedding, we will gently remind that he will be 18 months old at the time, and not likely to stand still for long, but if that’s what she wants then we can work it out. Unless she makes some mention of specifically keeping the older kids out, it won’t be brought up on our end. Luckily we don’t see her very often, so it’s not difficult to just not deal with her on the regular. Thanks for the advice, everyone!",46,34,0.79
1952,Everyone Sucks,"I recently started to look a **lot** like your average Muslim. Got a black beard and a short hair and apparently the eyes of one too according to my family. I do have some Muslim related origins which probably is a big reason for this. And, although I'm not one myself, I'm friends with some Muslims.

I also tend to wear relatively ""big"" clothes that kind of drag, and that look a bit religious.

&#x200B;

Anyway, a few days ago I was on a flight of a few hours. Keep in mind this is the US. I got through security, got on the plane, everything's fine so far.

&#x200B;

Now, however, this dude from across my row started throwing suspicious looks at me. He was a little behind me on the other side, so he could always see what I'm doing and I kind of had him at the edge of my view. And when I looked at my laptop I could also see him pretty clearly in the reflection.

&#x200B;

I get it, I get it, ""Muslim on a plane"" is all that he was thinking about. He didn't approach me, he just seemed like he was constantly worried about me. He had one leg out of his seat for most of the flight and always looked at me, barely even tried to hide it.

&#x200B;

I felt like having a little fun, so I decided, since nothing bad is going to happen like he thinks, I'll mess with him. I opened up a small book through my backpack and acted like I'm praying in Arabic and shit. I took deep breaths sometimes, like I'm readying myself up for some kamikaze mission. I looked at my watch many times like I'm waiting for something.

&#x200B;

Poor guy was buying it. He seemed absolutely terrified, started whispering to others, kept his eyes on me even more. He was convinced I'm gonna blow up the plane or something. I thought it was hilarious. The guy wasn't being directly offensive to me, but neither was I to him. I was just doing things at my seat. Yes, I knew how he would interpret them, but frankly I thought we'd be just even.

&#x200B;

I told my friends about it last night and some of them said I'm a douche and should've let it slide and just sleep off the flight or not pay attention to him. They said he probably would've slept himself if I hadn't kept him up because of everything I was doing.

&#x200B;

I think what I did was the ""proper"" punishment for someone like him. I don't blame him for worrying, I don't think he's racist or anything. But nor should anyone blame me for doing things from my seat, right?

1957,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. 

I visit my sister frequently, usually once a week, and she has a beautiful and friendly 2 year old dog who just craves affection and attention. Her dog is a very large dog, I'm not sure on the breed but it's about the size of a labrador but really built up.

She lives in a small house, but the dog has free access to the whole backyard. The issue - her backyard probably isn't any bigger than 15 square metres (if that). There's no real grass or any dirt, it's only fake green grass and a small uncovered/exposed wood patio. In the 2 years that she's had the dog, I think I've only ever seen the backyard clean from dog poo twice. It's at the point where you can't even walk out there because there's no where to stand, I'd say that 90% of the ground surface is dog poo. The smell is horrendous and she can't have any windows or doors open that are exposed to the backyard because of it. On top of that, on a regular basis, the dogs water bowl has a green moss-like-substance growing in it, like the water isn't really ever changed. She also doesn't have a dog kennel or dog bed, she just sleeps on the wooden patio. 

I have 3 large dogs, and my backyard is a fantastic size for the dogs, and they also have a covered area, plenty of toys and they're allowed inside. I know what the backyard can look like if it's kept untidy and dog poo isn't cleaned up in a while. But mine has never looked like my sister's, with 3 dogs. I just felt really bad for her dog. 

My mum and I constantly tell her to pick up her dogs poo, and she says that she will - but she never does. 

No one knows that I've done this as I only reported her today, but I'm incredibly conflicted on how I should feel. On one hand, I feel like a bad person because I do believe that she loves her dog and pets are family, but on the other hand I don't think she should be allowing her dog to live like this. I want the best life her dog and deep down I know I've come from a good place. But AITA? 

(Feel free to ask questions to fill in any blank information)

Edit: Id like to add that I'm in Australia so American animal laws don't necessarily apply to my situation.

Edit 2: I should've mentioned that her dog had to be taken to the vet once because faecal matter became stuck in her dogs ""private"" area, and then became infected. But it was concluded that, because of the area on her dog, it's a possibility that it would happened. My mum and I have always thought on the contrary, that her dog has somewhat grazed over it in the backyard. Idk though

Edit 3: The dog is 100% an outside dog. Her dog isn't allowed inside at all. She spends all the time outside. Eating, sleeping, everything. The part about 3 dogs being allowed inside, having plenty of toys and being covered and having a kennel is about MY dogs",47,178,0.93

throwaway because they use Reddit

TL:DR - read the title

Last month, my niece visited for three weeks.  She's a huge fan of a particular show, ""Future"".  I had never seen it, so we planned that while she visited, we'd binge watch the entire series (100+ episodes) together.  I even took 2 weeks off of work.  She just graduated high school, so I took her to Red Lobster to celebrate (her choice out of the admittedly small number of restaurants I could afford).  I thought we had a blast.

Yesterday, my sister called me. She said, “I have to talk to you. And I’m telling you because I’d want to know if I were you.  When Niece left your house, she went to visit Aunt Pam, who gave her $500.""  Pam is her aunt from dad's side.

“That’s great. I’m sure she was happy,” I said.  ??

“Niece said that Aunt Pam was the only one to give her money in the entire family. So I was thinking that you could give Niece some money, and just say that you forgot. I know it’s not a competition, but I’m making it one,” my sister says.

I’m a cashier. Aunt Pam lives in California and is an architect. Granted, Aunt Pam is a single mom, but I am 100% certain that she’s more financially secure than I am. In a financial competition, I will lose, every time.

I do have savings I could dip into. But that savings is the result of living a very sparse life. I don’t have a car, or a cell phone. I don’t go to restaurants.  I rely on DVDs from the library instead of a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon. I haven’t gotten new clothes in 15 years. 

My sister and her daughter don’t understand.  All they see is that I have savings (meant for emergencies).  My behavior to get to those savings - they just see as ""eccentric behavior"".

Even with all that, I could afford to give Niece $50 or so. But I am really uncomfortable with the whole idea. If my sister had brought this up before Niece visited, I wouldn’t have had a problem giving it to her. But now it seems as if I’m paying to be a member of that family. And there’s no way my niece will believe I “forgot”. She will pick up that I was “told” to give her money, and that kind of ruins it in my mind.

And I have to say, I’m incredibly hurt that those 3 weeks we spent together meant less to Niece than money would. I took 2 weeks off of work. Would it have been better to just work those 2 weeks, not spend time with Niece, and hand Niece the money from that? 

So I guess my question is this: Should I suck it up and give my niece money anyway? (I have a feeling my sister will not see $50 as enough, though, especially since she deems it a “competition”.) Maybe my niece won’t care that I was told to give her money. Maybe she’d just rather have the money no matter how she got it. Maybe I should count my niece graduating as one of those “emergency expenses” that I save money for, and give her $500. You only graduate high school once.",103,307,0.96

So I’m super in to baking. I find it fun, plus I get a little snack at the end of it. My sister is gluten sensitive, so must of the stuff I make, she can’t eat. 

My mom told me a while back that I should start making stuff for her. There are a few reasons why I don’t want to do that. 

1. Most of the stuff I make is my first time making it. My logic is that if I change the recipe and it comes out bad, I won’t know if it was something I was doing, the gluten free ingredients, or the recipe. 

2. I don’t like gluten free stuff. I’ve made some things for her before, and 90% of it I haven’t liked. Everyone says it tastes good, but I really don’t like it, and if I’m doing something for fun, I want to be able to like it. 

3. I’ve made gluten free stuff for her before, and she didn’t eat it! For Valentine’s Day, I made macarons, which are gluten free. I made about 20 and she had maybe 1. For her birthday, I made gluten free brownies, and she didn’t eat any, and a cake, which she had one (tiny) piece of and then no more. 

Obviously if it’s for her birthday, I’ll make them gluten free. But I’d just rather not make something I’m not gonna like and she’s not gonna eat.",60,52,0.88

In the last few years, he does it even more, thanks also a more secure financial situation (mostly because I have receive a not so little inheritance)

We live in a big house for our city's standard, but not a mansion, and every few years we must proceed to reorder everything and to transport some boxes in the garage of his mother.

Last time I snapped and we have had a huge fight when I found three years of past issues of a magazine in one if the libraries, where my things haven't any space (as it happens in every room, really).

A month ago he told that he'd like a thing, call it X, (big thing), and I told him that we'd need to rearrange something else in order to make some space for it and he agreed that it would be an unNecessary thing. Furthermore, it's a piece of forniture I don't like so much, and really we don't have any space left.
And it's not a lifelong dream, just a itch he'd like to scratch.

1964,Not the A-hole,"Little bit of relevant background on me. I am obsessed with reptiles, especially snakes. I have 2 as pets and their pictures are on my desk. They're great. 

A co-worker messaged me the other day and sent me a picture of a snake and asked me to ID it. I identified this species as a corn snake. He asked if they were dangerous, I advised they're very docile and have no venom. They're the most commonly kept pet snake. One of his neighbors may have lost it or it could even be wild. He told me it was in his house and snakes make him uneasy. I offered to come collect the animal, and if I didnt want to keep it i would bring it to a wildlife reserve. He declined and said he would handle it. I told him he could get a snake hook for $5 at any local petstore and that should make handling it a bit easier for him. 

The next day I asked him how getting the snake out went. He said ""Oh, it's dead."" I asked if was already dead or if something went wrong. He replied ""No, I couldn't have that thing getting back in my house, so I took its head off with a shovel."" Upon hearing that I lost my mind. I asked him ""So you murdered a harmless animal? That's psychotic."" I asked him if he would do the same if a dog got into his house, and of course the answer was no. We exchanged a few words back and forth and I have not talked to him since, and i probably will never again. I can't belive he did killed the animal, and then made a point to tell me he did so, he could've easily omitted that part. 

AITA for getting upset with and never talking to this co-worker again?

Me and my younger siblings have never been here before, and never met her family, but she has a very large hispanic family that’s very close & loving. (For instance, she stays in her sisters house occasionally , and her other sister & her kids live in my stepmoms house, while she and my dad usually stay in their apartment.)anyway, we visited them in michigan last summer, and her son was living in australia at the time, and we never met him. he’s home this summer, and yesterday we met him. he (30M) hugged my brother and sister and attempted to hug me, but i said “no.” a little firmly, and opted for a handshake instead. i don’t really like physical contact, and my dad and stepmom know that. he seemed a little upset, and shook my hand anyway. he was a little cold for the rest of the night, and when we got back to the house, my dad pulled me aside and said i offended him, and i should’ve just hugged him for the half second. aita?


tldr; my 30 year old stepbrother tried to hug me & i said no.

EDIT: thank you for all the responses. i’m going to talk to him later & explain how i feel about hugs. i’m okay with a lot of things, like high fives, and fist bumps, and invented handshakes, hugs just make my anxiety/ptsd shoot up. it’s just from an event that happened when i was young & ive been trying to work on it. ty for all the criticism & the nice comments too

EDIT 2: i tried talking to him at dinner, but he wanted to hear the entire reason behind it, and being that he’s virtually a stranger, i didn’t really feel comfortable telling him. i just said that there was an unfortunate event from when i was little, but he kept pushing it. i told him a little bit, just so he would leave me alone, but then he started pushing for a hug again. at that point i gave up, and just went and stood behind my stepmom the rest of the night. i put him on my list to watch out for. i also told my mom, but the most she can do is call my dad & try and talk to him, because she lives across the country. i only have about two weeks left, so i’m just going to try and stick it out until then. thank you all for the advice, and the silver 💕",287,746,0.94

1967,Not the A-hole,"I was raised Catholic, at 18 I left the church in a non ceremonious fashion, just disengaged after a few years of questioning my beliefs and discovering they didn't align with the Catholic Church. I stopped taking communion around this time as well, but for family events I would still attend the church events if I was asked, I just didn't take communion, recite the prayers etc. For the most part, for the next 14 years I got a lot of gruff about it, but my mother was supportive and never really cared much. A few aunts made a big to do, but 14 years later I think they have given up.

During those 14 years, I went to various churches or other religious ceremonies all across the board, but determined my beliefs didn't match up with any of them. I ultimately decided that I don't believe in organized religion, and instead my beliefs are personal to me. For the record, I've never once said anyone else on this earth should think like me, and the right to practice any religion no matter what it may be is extremely important to me. I would never condemn someone for going to any church, or having any form of religious beliefs, even if I do not agree with them on a personal level. I am also not preachy, and I don't publicly share my stance unless directly questioned, and still I’m hesitant to discuss with people I don’t know well.

This past weekend, during a picnic at my boyfriend’s families house they did a ""prayer"" over the food. They all bowed their heads, closed their eyes and said amen, you know very typical. I however sat still and quiet as to not impose on their pre-dinner ritual. I did NOT however, bow my head or close my eyes. My boyfriend happened to glance up and mouthed ""bow your head"" and I still did not. I talked to him later about it and said ""If I don't change my ways for my own family, I won't do it for anyone"". Also, to add, I feel it’s actually extremely DISRESPECTFUL to pretend to believe or engage in other religious rituals. Had I been told ""You need to pray with the family"" I would have respected this by not going, or excusing myself, as to not offend anyone. I don't ask that others cater to me, and I’m comfortable being around people who pray, I just do not participate. Boyfriend DID NOT call me an asshole, but something in his facial expression made me believe he wanted to say something like ""it’s not a big deal"" or ""I just do it to appease them"" kind of thing, but didn't want to start a fight. I've gotten negative responses from family members in the past too. To the point I stopped going to catholic ceremonies as to not upset anyone, even though I now feel a bit excluded from my family, but that was their choice and I respected it. (even though, deep down I don’t believe they had the right to dictate if I went somewhere or not. Especially for things that are not private events) Am I being the asshole here in these situations? Will answer questions if needed.

He's flirted with coworkers and then when they inevitably say they aren't interested or he finds out they have a boyfriend he stonewalls them. This happened with me, when he found out I wasn't single he become super rude.

This has resulted in some rude remarks. I once overheard a conversation where he criticized my clothing as he said it made me look like a ""fat ass"". I reported this to HR along with the other stuff about the flirting and he was reprimanded.

Now he rudely just brushes by me. He either says one word things like ""Move"" or ""Come"". I've put him out of sight and mind.

Well I had a department that did a training course and I wanted to reward them so I bought them all pizza. He's not in this department but a few others who aren't asked and I let them have a couple slices. He comes and goes to grab a slice but I tell him it's for that department. He stormed off. Later the people I made the exception for tell me I'm being the asshole for not giving him any slices but I paid out of pocket for this and I should be able to choose who gets slices and frankly I don't think he deserved any kindness from me.

1969,No A-holes here," It was my first day as a pool manager after being a lifeguard there for 4 summers. I was super nervous and was following and enforcing the rules to a tee. The pool i was at was a private community with lots of children. There is also a clubhouse outside the pool that has the bathrooms. I was told multiple times that the people are not allowed in barefoot. A little girl and her mom were rushing in to use the bathroom and i stopped them saying they needed shoes. The mom had to run down to the pool to get their shoes but before she ran back the child had an accident. I feel like they couldve made it to the bathroom if it wasn’t for me.

I have a slightly younger brother and a much younger sister. When we were kids and would get money from relatives for birthdays/Christmas, our mom would put it in our bank accounts that we wouldn’t get to access until we were 18. It didn’t add up to much. Maybe $300 by the time my brother and I turned 18. My sister was maybe 6 when I happened to see her bank statement and saw that she already had more money in her account than I had at 18. This really pissed me off because obviously she was getting more from our family. I wanted them to keep it fair and not give her so much, which my mom said she couldn’t ask people for, and I just had to accept it.
Obviously, I’ve moved on since, but I’d like to know what others here think, and how you would handle this kind of situation.

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. I definitely see how this sounds entitled. And like I said, I’m older now and don’t think/feel the same way I did back then. It really hurt at the time because it looked to me like my family loved and cared more about my sister. There was a lot of other preferential treatment she got, which provides a bit more context.

1974,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway, to protect my friend's and my privacy. 

My job consists of hosting events for people in my community. Although the events can get pretty large, there are a few people who consistently attend our events and who I consider as friends. Last weekend, we hosted a pretty large event- around half of the attendees were people who my colleagues and I personally invited, and the other half were friends who the invitees brought along. 

One friend (F) who frequently attends our events was at this particular event last weekend. Unbeknownst to either of us, a different attendee brought along a friend (A) who had abused F in the past. F was (understandably) upset that A was at the event and asked me to kick A out. Although I personally want nothing less than to ban A from every event in this city and to see him charged with assault, my company's policies prevent me from kicking any attendees out unless they are actively trying to harm others at one of our events. I explained the dilemma to F and promised that I would do everything possible to make sure that she wouldn't see A at all during the event. I also provided her with a private room that she could go to if she needed some time away from A, and I also let F know that she could pull me aside at any time if she needed to process anything that came up during the event. 

I've been wracked with guilt all week since the event. Although I can't afford to risk losing my job by violating company policy, I feel like I've failed my friend by prioritizing my job over her safety. So... AITA?",14,30,0.9

My parents have always been pretty generous with us. They helped us move out, gave us furniture and bring us lots of food every time we visit them, and paid for a portion of the wedding. I’m very grateful for all of this, so is my wife, but she holds a bitter spot for them ever since the one time they asked me to stop faking my anxiety attacks and get over it. She also can’t get past the fact that they forgot her birthday but celebrated mine and everyone else’s. I’ve tried to explain to her that to ignore the negatives and try to enjoy their company as they’ve been pretty kind to us, and she’s usually been pretty nice about it.

She’s been trying to have them come over for dinner but they’re always busy when she does. My parents want us to go over at their place for dinner a lot, and we always do, but she’s expressed to me she wants to host them, and also cook them a few meals to show off her new cooking skills. I guess she’s proud of our little home and wants them to come see.

So I tried inviting them once again, they turned it down. But they invited us over instead, and I accepted. My wife got really mad because they weren’t busy and turned it down for no reason and I accepted the invite when I shouldn’t have. I tried explaining to her that they do want to see us and it’s not like how she thinks it is, but she won’t listen and kept bringing up things like stupid stuff they’ve done in the last.

Needless to say, I got pretty angry and asked her to grow up and get over it and stop being petty and catty because she can’t let go of older things. She went on a long rant about how she’s doing this all for me and since then hasn’t spoken to me. I’m a little annoyed and don’t want to apologize honestly because they’ve always been this way, they’ve been very generous with us, and we have fun when we see them, so her getting annoyed over dinner is just stupid to me.

1979,Not the A-hole,"this has been a long time debate for me. As in several years long. My younger sister sings all day every day, she takes a music course, specifically for singing. I've heard her singing at 1am, sometimes

But, the truth is, she sounds like a bag of cats swung at a wall. She sounds dreadful. Every person I've asked if they like her singing, has sort of dodged the question and scrunched their faces, which I know means they don't like it.

Everyone in my family tells me to just put up with it, but it's driving me bananas. I live with her, and I'm the only person that lives with her and this genuinely makes me want to move out. I ask her to keep it down every single day and she will stop singing, but only for a couple of hours before she's shrieking again.

WIBTA if I finally told her the truth? that she can't sing and it's making me upset, being subjected to it daily?

Update: I told my sister, but I broke it to her very gently. I told her that her singing can be a little excessive and I usually can't even put on headphones because she's too loud.

1981,Not the A-hole,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200B;

Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200B;

He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.

I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone.

Im a 36 years old male in a sector dominated by men.

A few weeks ago I was asked by my supervisor if i want to partake in a male - female tutor programm to help . 

I thought ""sure, why not? Sounds like a good idea. Maybe I can help a women  to make her first steps in the field."" 

So I was assigned to a 22 years old female lets call her A.

&#x200B;

A big part of my job is driving around all day and speaking to customers, so we have much time for small talk. 

Just a few examples of the questions:

\- Do you have pets?

\- Any plans for the weekend?

\- Do you do any sports?

\- Do have any hobbys?

&#x200B;

Or I just talked about what I did with the wife and the kids on the weekend. That my girl got a good grade in school. Stuff like that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After one week my supervisor told me that she complained about me. I would try to flirt with her and that im beeing unprofessional. He asked my if I want to drop her before she accuses me of anything, because ""these bitches are crazy"". 

I told him that I dont think that this will happen and that I will ask her if she wants to change to another tutor. She wanted to change because she felt unconfortable with me.

Some time passes and I get assigned B. I tried something different this time. 

Work is work and personal life is life. So no more small talk while driving around because I dont want to make her feel weird. 

This time everything is fine for 3 to 4 weeks. 

Then she asked me why iam so cold towards her. So I told her about A and what happend and that I wanted to do better with her. 

Apparently A already that iam a creep and that she needs to be careful around me.

B told me its not fair that I act like that towards her just because I had one negative experience.

Maybe I should just behave ""normal"" and if she would have been in the position of A she would have complained too. Her personal life is not my business.

When she told me that my daily behavior is not ""normal"" I took a deep breath and told her I need to take a short break to think about the situation. 

So I got outside, smoked a few cigarettes. Beeing told that you are not normal hurts. 

Afterwards I told her that I do not wish to work with her anymore because I dont know how I should handle the situation. 

B told me that sexist men like me are the reason why we have so few women in our field of work.

So the other night I’d been for a few (3) post-work beers with some friends. The girl I’m dating joined for the last one. The two of us then headed off to a Japanese restaurant. Somewhere along the journey I impersonated a Japanese accent. As soon as the words began to leave my mouth I realised it struck me as inappropriate - sadly it was too late to spin into something else. Anyway, she responded with a curious look and, in a half serious tone, suggested it was racist.

I do not in any way consider myself racist and was taken aback by the remark. After thinking on it for a split second I responded saying that I didn’t believe it was racist, and then recalled the numerous times I’ve heard her impersonate various other stereotypical accents. She had no response to this and shrugged it off. It was left at that. I don’t believe this impacted the remainder of the evening in anyway, but it may have for her... I intend to bring it up in conversation when I next see her to talk it through.

I hindsight I think it was a joke made in poor taste rather than a racist remark. As a child she was very much an ethnic minority, and grew up in a primarily white (probably getting on for 100%) community. Something I obviously have no experience of.

Edit: Thanks to all for your input. As I’d eluded to in the original post, I was already fully aware I’d been the asshole here. The main reason for the post was to gain input from a more diverse background that my friendship group - which is predominantly white. For those still adding comments, it would be interesting if you could include your ethnicity and age to your comment.

Final edit: So I’ve since spoken to the girl I’m dating. I apologised for the inappropriate comment and acknowledged that this is considered by many as racist. To my surprise she responded by telling me that she hadn’t thought about it since it occurred, that I can be overly sensitive sometimes, and that she was joking when she called the act racist. To summarise, for her it’s all about context - the fact that she knows me, the fact that we’re dating, and that it was spoken without negative intent meant that she did not consider it racist. I feel fortunate in this regard, as it could quite easily have gone the other way.

For those questioning what I’d actually said, I’d pronounced that name of the restaurant in what I considered to be a Japanese accent (at least a Japanese accent was the intent).
For those questioning the accents she’d mimicked: multiple European accents, South African, American, Australian.",129,89,0.76

\-He started asking increasingly intrusive questions (“how often do you kiss” “how many girls has she been with” “do you think you prefer sex with guys or girls” “doesn’t it feel kinda taboo or does that just make it exciting”, that kinda thing). He also kept trying to get me and A to make out in front of him, at a party which I didn't think anything of at the time

\-I eventually realised what was going on - he was kinda turned on by me being with a girl. Idk if he had a crush on me or if it was just a sort of “omg wow real life lesbians!!” thing but at any rate I felt uncomfortable and infuriated that he would turn my relationship into a fetish, when the whole time I thought he just cared about me. And all those questions were probably fueling his weird sexual fantasy of us.

\-I wanted to be sure before I called him out on it, so I wouldn't look like a self-obsessed psycho. so the next time he brought up sex I played along and fed him a bunch of lies and he took the fucking bait

\-I told him we're in a 24/7 sub dom type thing (I knew he was a dom so I thought he'd like to believe that). he asked for details, which I happily gave. I said she sits on my face for an hour every night while watching netflix, she doesn't let me wear clothes when I'm at her apartment, I wear a remote control vibrator when we go out to dinner, she sometimes doesn't let me cum for days!!! the cherry on top: she wants a threesome with a guy because she misses dick SO MUCH and dildos just aren’t the same, and I'm a bit nervous about the idea but would do anything to make her happy (this conversation happened over text obviously, I couldn't have kept a straight face). He obviously volunteered himself, and later said he had always thought it was ""so fucking hot"" that I'm gay.

I felt so violated. I can't blame him for feeling that way but it's still fucking creepy.

My MIL is being pretty shitty to our 8 year old because she’s doing general kid things. For example, dinner was ready and our daughter was playing and she got mad at my daughter for not immediately coming to the dinner table. It had only been about 5 seconds that passed and my MIL said “I don’t have time to wait on you” and walked away in a huff. My daughter is bored but still having fun most of the time but if my MIL makes a suggestion on something our daughter could do for fun and she turns it down, my MIL acts upset. My MIL then will act like she wants to hold our 4 month old and then as soon as he makes a fussy noise, she’s over it and gives him back. She absolutely refuses to keep her voice down especially when I’m trying to put him down for a nap and he’s crying and fighting because it’s too loud.  I’ve watched my husband for 2 years trying to mend his relationship with his father and he recently got a text from his dad about how he is proud of him for recovering from alcoholism and providing for his wife and kids. Every single night we have been here, my FIL has gotten incredibly drunk. At first it was just kind of whatever because I know my FIL is an alcoholic but as long as he doesn’t do anything messed up to my kids or in front of them, I don’t really care if he drinks and neither does my husband. It’s been fine but last night he crossed a line. My husband just finished his first year of a 2 year degree and decided to take a break because he was getting about 3 hours of sleep each night and it seriously was impacting his health. He was trying to ask his drunk dad how he worked 3 jobs and went to school full time so that he could find a way to go back and finish his second year. His dad started telling him that he’s wasted years on school and just needs to deal. We decided to get ice cream down the road and when we came back, we heard his dad talking crap about my husband to my MIL behind our backs. My MIL told my husband exactly what his dad was saying and did not defend my husband to hers. I tried my best to comfort my husband by reminding him that he’s an amazing man who has messed up in his past but he’s certainly proved he’s turned his life around in his actions these last 2 years. Now, I do love my in laws but my patience is wearing thin from trying to keep the peace by just staying quiet and out of the way but I am NOT ok with someone treating my husband like he’s trash. Now it’s 7 am and everyone is up and about to have breakfast before we leave to go back to our home state. My MIL has been quiet and my FIL came over to me and my 4 month old and started tickling the baby’s feet like he isn’t a total fucking asshole. There’s been no apology toward my husband so far and I’m wondering if I would be the asshole if I brought up how awful they’ve been before we leave.",19,42,0.89

1994,Asshole,"I'm getting a lot of flack from my wife for being visibly upset at this woman and I am currently in a state of being where I just don't want to be around her right now. 

This woman had a rebound relationship and got pregnant. She told my wife that she preferred to go condomless and, wouldn't you know it, when she missed her period, she insisted there was NO WAY she could be pregnant. 

My wife and I had a feeling after her third missed week that she was pregnant. At work, she asked her, 

""If you *are* pregnant, are you thinking of getting an abortion?""

The friend responded, ""ABSOLUTELY NOT. I would literally NEVER do that. If *anything*, adoption.""

Relieved, we offered to take her child. We realized that it was financially difficult for her so we even offered to help her out money-wise as well as emotional and familial support before and after the baby was born. I'll let it be known that she actually made us believe that if she *were* pregnant, we'd adopt it. This got me emotionally attached to the idea because she said that, at the very bottom line, she'd never ever even think about abortion.

It got brought up weekly for about a month (they're really close, this wasn't intruding- just causal conversation) until she went silent. We didn't hear from her for about 10 days. She sends my wife a text and says she got an abortion.

While I understand her fear (and realistically I *don't* fully understand since I'm a guy), I feel like I got bait-and-switched with a potential child of mine. I know it wasn't mine, but the reason I'm so upset is because she actually had us believing that this child could have been a part of our lives. This goes beyond an abortion debate. It got real and emotional investment happened. 

I have a hard time seeing her, so when she comes over, my wife intentionally keeps distance by hanging out with her on the porch while I go work or hangout in the basement. I understand she's probably hurt to, but I feel hurt to, and I just need time to get to a place where I can be civil and polite, because right now, in my heart, I'm not.

**EDIT:**

I think people are misreading, or maybe I wrote it poorly. Here was our outlook.

a. If she wants to keep the pregnancy, we will be there for emotional support and, since she's single and not really established, financial support. We would first to just be helpers, not trying to steal anyone's baby here. 

b. If she didn't want to keep the baby because of financial stress and emotional toll, we would gladly give it a home.

Since she was clearly against abortion, we thought those were the two best options to keep the baby in a stable environment.

By asking if IATA, I want to make *very clear* that I am NOT inferring that she ITA. Thanks!",775,10314,0.89
1995,Everyone Sucks,"So about 5 months back, a mutual friend of my girlfriend and I moved into town and we offered him the spare bedroom until he could get his own place. He had been struggling financially, so i was also trying to give him an opportunity to save some money (I was only charging him $330/month for rent and utilities).

Very shortly after moving in he got a job that paid 1.5x what he was making in the other city. At this new job he met a girl. He started bringing her over all of the time, but considering my girlfriend and I dont even have him on the lease, him bringing a guest 4-5x a week was not cool. My girlfriend and I told him this, he told me that this girl was supposedly still living with her abusive boyfriend so they couldn't go to her place. I have sympathy for the girl, but i tell him that I dont feel comfortable with him bringing her to my place, because I didnt need the abusive boyfriend to show up and him and my friend start throwing fists.

So i start seeing him less and less after that. Fast forward to now and he hasnt been by in a month and a half, but his stuff is still in the spare room, so to me, that means he still owes us rent. My girlfriend has been reaching out to him, and supposedly he recently got 2 tickets so he asked if he could make payments. She agreed. We still havent seen any money.

So today, he texted me that he would be by tomorrow to pick up his things. I told him that he wasnt taking anything until he at least paid me last months rent. I originally was going to charge him for this month, too, because its past the 1st, but I figured the best im going to get from him is a flat $300. I haven't gotten a response yet, but I wanted to know if that would make me TA, given the circumstances.",86,54,0.92
1996,Not the A-hole,"So, my girlfriend\[25F\] and myself\[24M\] have been together for almost 9 months now. This weekend, one of her best friends is getting married and she, along with the other bridemaids were asked to lead the ceremony. She insisted that i had to be there, as everyone would bring their significant other/BF/GF, so of course, i accepted.

Last weekend she asked me how much i wanted to contribute to their wedding gift.  Even though she says the bride is one of her best friends, i have only seen her once, and we barely spoke to eachother. Conclusion; i don't know her, nor do i know the groom. I figured that 50 Euro would be enough, given the fact that i just started working, and trying to save up a bit. My girlfriend said that 50 Euro is a laughable amount to give, and that giving 50 Euro  would be an insult and we would come off as cheap. She asked me to give 200 Euro in total, split between us two, basically asking me to give 100Euro .

I told her that I thought 200 Euro would be a rather exorbitant amount of money to just give away, definitely for young starters who just started working, and that i would definitely consider giving more if i knew the couple better, but, since i don't know them, i kind of didn't want to give away large amounts of money (yes, 100$ is substantially for me). She told me that, because we were invited for the whole (fancy) wedding (ceremony+dinner+party), not only the party afterwards, my personal gift of 50 euro wouldn't suffice. I reacted by saying that if people want to organise a fancy wedding, they shouldn't expect their guests to pay for it. She has been very moody with me ever since, saying that I don't make any effort for her and the things she thinks are imortant.

AITA for not wanting to give 100 euro?",142,390,0.96

1998,Not the A-hole,"For the past year I have been living in an apartment with 2 roommates, let's call them Ana and Bob.  They're grad students, I'm an MA student. Ana and Bob are on the lease, I'm not. All 3 of us are gone for the summer and subletting our rooms; Ana and I are working abroad and Bob has moved in with his gf. Bob and Ana found the subletters. (the subletter for my room found the rent too pricey at the last minute so I'm paying $100 a month to make his rent lower.)

Bob's subletter had to leave abruptly for family reasons and he's having a hard time finding a replacement. Ana messaged me saying this would be tough for Bob financially and would I be open to the idea of splitting the rent on Bob's room 3 ways for 2 months? This would amount to $700 each, which is a lot.

I could theoretically afford to pay the $700, like I have that in the bank right this second because of a stipend for my summer job, but this expense would annoy me and mess up my summer plans. I don't like Ana and Bob so much that I actually want to pay this amount to help them out.

Legally I know I have no obligation to chip in but on a human level, am I the asshole?",21,31,0.88
