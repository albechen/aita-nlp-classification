4,Not the A-hole,"So its kinda of a long story, but I am a freshman in highschool, as well as the guy I went off on. So it all started out when I started hanging out with this 6'5 guy who I'll call ""Giraffe."" I was very open about being a lesbian, and he understood and respected that. The thing is: I have a very flirty personality and am very affectionate/touchy. I say ""I love you"" to everyone, even strangers. I thought that he knew that, but I guess not. I never really flirted with him, but I did hug and say ""love u"" to him a lot. I'm used to doing it with girl friends, so I didnt realize it could be any different. My perspective changed when a friend warned me that ""He gets a crush on every short girl he meets, be careful."" I didn't think much about it, because he knew I was gay. However, I invited him to hang out with me at the skating rink later that night, and he agreed. We hung out, and he always had his arms around me, and was very territorial?? I didnt mind, because I thought he just had the same personality as me and was touch starved. However, when I got home, he texted me and said that he liked me. I was obviously surprised, and had to reject him. I explained I still wanted to be friends, but he was...guilt tripping me?? He said ""I guess I was just born wrong, no girl will ever love me"" and saying stuff like ""I know youre gay, I was just hoping there could have been something more. I guess not."" I apologized profusely, and told him to stop trying to guilt trip me, where he said ""Sorry, wasnt trying to."" I grew up with manipulative parents, so I dont let people walk all over me. From then on, he would constantly flirt with me, until I told him I had a date. He started saying more stuff such as, ""Sorry I'll just leave you alone so you can go out with someone you actually like."" I didn't want to lose him as a friend because it was really fun to hang out with him, but I was starting to get annoyed with him. I ranted to him and said to stop acting like that, and apologized later. We were doing fine for about a week, until I got a message from a friend. Lets call her ""JoJo."" JoJo texted me and said Giraffe was making her feel bad for not wanting to go to homecoming with him, and eventually caved and said ""just as friends."" KEEP IN MIND this guy was pulling the exact SAME tricks and calling her beautiful and perfect etc (like with me). I told her to say no, and that he should'nt control her actions. She then said that she didnt wanna be mean, and at this point I was getting upset. I knew that if she would let him walk all over her, he would only continue. So i texted him to stop bothering her and that he should stop making people feel bad for saying ""no."" He denied everything, and texted JoJo ""Sorry I'll leave you alone then."" Of course, I felt like he was playing the victim card. I have decided to drop him as a friend, but I also feel a little guilty for pointing fingers. So tell me reddit: Am I the asshole?",29,35,0.93

6,Not the A-hole,"It's a short one. Genuinely conflicted as to whether or not I TA.... although I certainly feel like one.

So my cousin (who I get on very well with) has recently given birth to a baby boy after a long and difficult pregnancy. Her partner has invited me to go and visit them in the hospital as she wont be released for at least another week due to complications and an emergency C section.

I told him ""Thank you for the invite X but I'm not sure I'll be able to visit in the hospital. I'll be more than happy to visit her once shes home"". The real reason I don't want to visit her in the hospital is that I have previously had a miscarriage. Seeing pictures of her in the hospital smiling with her partner and their new baby brings all the hurt and anguish back from losing my own baby. I preferred to meet her at her home so she could have time to adjust and so I too could shake this sad feeling I have looming over my head - plus drop off some baby bits as a good will gesture.

Her partner blew up. He said I wasn't supporting my cousin when she needed me the most. I said ""I just thought it would be better if I met her at home where she would feel more comfortable"". He said that they both needed family support and he didn't think I was being fair by refusing to come down and support them. I tried to palm it off as a work thing and that I wouldn't have the time and he accused me of selfishly putting my needs before family.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you for all your kind words, I'll admit I should've been honest but I just don't feel comfortable with explaining it to him (who I've only met 3 times - they've only been together for a 18 months). He must've said something to my cousin because she called me in the evening to apologise on his behalf and quietly admitted he's struggling to cope at the moment. I'm going over to their house a few days after they get back, bring a casserole and talk to her in person then.  I just hope I can get over the negative feeling.",56,445,0.96
7,Not the A-hole,"As honestly as possible:

&#x200B;

I ordered a 7h15min cleaning for my 55m2 ( 592ft2 ) appartment ( filthy af, I know ), and told in the description that "" there's lots of garbage and dust "". The cleaner did an amazing job and I praised them in the feedback form that they sent me.

&#x200B;

Shortly after the company sent me an email that "" these kinds of clearance cleanings (sry no idea what's the correct term) don't belong to us, we expect the appartment to be in reasonable order and shape "".

&#x200B;

I assumed that the company knew what to expect when the time was 7h15min for relatively small appartment but then they send me this crap. I'm beyond pissed right now. In their T/C they don't say anything about "" cleararance cleanings "" nor do they specify anything about overall tidiness.

&#x200B;

The subtotal for the cleaning was 304eur/338usd which to me is a huge amount of money and personally I felt kind of belittled and ridiculed after the feedback THEY sent ME, which isn't a norm in Finland. Prior to their feedback I hadn't sent anything, just read it like 10min ago.

&#x200B;

I replied to them that "" use a little bit of common sense and read the description and duration and don't send me this if it's not what your company does. thanks to the cleaner, from now on I'll use another company. Either call after the order or add it to your t/c "".

&#x200B;

So AITA for getting salty at their feedback ?

&#x200B;

Kind of minor sort of stupid thing to ask but appreciate the feedback.

Edit: my reply to them.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Since this has got a lot of attention there's a couple things I'd like to clarify:

The service was prepaid and I decided time and date. I've used their services before and booked 6hours, this time the situation wasn't nearly as bad and I thought 7hr15min would suffice. Which it did IMO, the cleaner wasn't perfect but was never expected to me. I think he did a great job, solid 9/10. I'm perfectly fine with the cost as it was exactly what I decided to pay for. 0 complains about that or the cleaners work.

&#x200B;

There were no biohazards ( condoms, roaches, bedbugs, rotten food, broken glass etc ) or anything like that. More like empty snuscans, beercases, pizzaboxes, clothes etc. Imagine a teenagers dirty room when mom yells to him for the 5th time to clean your shit. That was my appartment.",278,510,0.92
8,Asshole,"My wife and I are blended with 7 kids - adults between us. Nobody gets along, they fight and are rude to each other, me and my wife. Her kids dint like me and my kids don’t like her. It’s been tough the past 13 years. My wife is very ill and we want to bring a unit family together, but the kids are not on board. We are all suffering. So I suggested I do holidays with my kids and she with hers. It crushed her and now she feels not important to me.",58,244,0.97
9,Not the A-hole,"Hey gang, 


As a long time lurker I now am stepping into the spotlight. I’m 28 and my fiancé is 30.  We both 120k/year. We’re getting married in two months. For years, we’ve talked about taking an extended honeymoon of 4 months to travel since we’re both in competitive jobs and taking time off regularly just isn’t possible. 


To make this dream a reality, a year and a half ago we agreed to start saving aggressively, pay debts, have a no-frills wedding, etc. My job only allowed me to take 2 weeks off (1 unpaid) for a honeymoon so I said okay but will be quitting instead. Travel for an extended time is a dream of mine and we’ve been setting ourselves up financially where we can afford for one (or both) of us to not have immediate work upon return. My fiancé’s job told him he can take the (unpaid) sabbatical and can return afterwards. So great, everything is in motion. 


Two weeks ago, I suggested we start booking the first leg of our trip. He told me he was having cold feet about me not having a job after return home. We keep our finances separate so I showed him how it’s financially feasible for me to not work up to 4 months, NOT dip into “emergency funds” and if needed, I have emergency funds for an additional 5 months AFTER trip expenses. After all, that’s what we’ve aggressively set ourselves up to do. Plus, I’ve been looking for a reason to leave my job and this is the perfect opportunity to have an amazing adventure and come back with a fresh start away from a toxic workplace. I ask him how he’s doing financially and how he’s tracking against our financial goals. Turns out he’s not. At all. He hasn’t been saving at any rate, let alone an accelerated one and he hasn’t been paying down debt. He’s been spending a lot of money on drinks, toys, and general convenience premiums (Postmates, Uber Eats). Because of his general overspending, he can’t afford to take a destination honeymoon, let alone take 4 months off work for no pay. 


All this is fine. We keep our finances separate. This doesn’t really impact me. I was bummed we couldn’t have the honeymoon we talked about and angry he lied but money management has never been his priority.


I told him we can take a honeymoon 4 day trip to Puerto Rico (he said that’s all he could afford) and then I would go on my long travel plans with my best friend who has been planning a trip of her own. He got very upset, telling me I should wait to take our designated honeymoon trip together and that I shouldn’t “replace” him. 


As of now, I’m still going. He’s unhappy and says it’s embarrassing to him for his new wife to go travel without him, which I understand but also don’t really think his ego takes precedence over my dream to travel (which he fueled for the last year and a half). So, AITA?

**Edit: the entire time he was telling me we were “on track” for this sabbatical and shared excitement, had destination bucket lists, etc. I didn’t force him and if he would have told me he didn’t want to go we would’ve planned a normal honeymoon and I would have traveled at a later date (not immediately after marriage) or even before marriage (we have talked about doing something like this before engagement even)**",1679,5605,0.93
10,Asshole,"Throwaway and mobile. 

My sister got married last year and she told everyone that if they did not come to her bachelorette or bridal shower, she would assume they did not want to come to the wedding and they would not be allowed to come. I was obviously at all of them and the wedding. 

I don’t have this rule with my wedding as I understand things happen and you can’t expect everyone to come all the time. However she didn’t come to either one of mine and when asked why (she says she’ll be there. RSVP’s and everything then just doesn’t show) she says she didn’t want to come because she has school on monday and she was tired. She’s a pre-school teacher. And both my events were on Saturdays. 

AITA for feeling like I should uninvite her? My other sister drove 4 hours to be at both and she wouldn’t even make the 15 minute trip... I’m also scared we pay for her to come and then she just doesn’t show. We had to scrape all our savings together to be able to get married and I owe my parents money for it too.

EDIT - I want to thank everyone for being honest and for helping me find a way to approach the subject with her. I was afraid I was being overly emotional because she hurt my feelings and that’s why I came to this thread. I needed honesty from people who weren’t part of the whole thing because it felt like everyone I asked was picking sides. I will be contacting my sister in the near future and restructuring my plans in a way that if she comes, great! If not, it won’t bring me down on my big day!",17,39,0.9

A couple days come by and Brad's ex, we can call her jenny, tells me about how she slept with the Brad despite him being in a relationship. Jenny felt used but decided to keep her mouth shut. Brad then finds out I know about this and begs me not to tell. He probably knew I was on my way to meet up with Stacy that day cause I had my own personal things I had to vent. I being one to avoid drama decide not to do anything. Months pass by and theyre on a break. Stacy talks to me and ask if the relationship is even worth keeping.

15,Not the A-hole,"I was sleeping and a guy who parked on the street rang our door bell because his car battery was dead. My mom thought it would be smart to lend my car keys to him so he could boost himself (not even use her own car that was parked beside mine). Apparently this guy was a “neighbour” but I’ve never see him before and we’ve only moved into this area 3 months ago. I also leave some valuables in my car including my wallet but she claims she was watching him the whole time.

16,Everyone Sucks,"Unless you’re living under a rock, a strong hurricane swept Caribbean and south east United States. My wife’s friend lives on the coast and she had to evacuate. It was too expensive to fly up north, so my wife said she can stay with us. It’s no biggie because I offered the same gestured to my best friend in Florida and he would have came with 4 people. 

The issue is that my wife’s friend brought her dog, who is not really potty trained. I already have two dogs and one if my dogs was barking non-stop I had to let him stay with a friend since the start of the week. This has been a burden on my friend as they have three dogs of their own and my dog is barking non-stop there.

We get that situation sorted but now the dog has been peeing in my house. My house is 90% carpeted. I also have an infant who is crawling everywhere and I’m worried she’s going to step in piss of the chemicals I use to clean the stain. My wife mentioned to her maybe having the dog stay in the kitchen behind a gate but she insisted the dog stay with her at all times. My wife not being a confrontational person obliged. 

We as a family have a “no dogs upstairs in the bedroom rule” and we’ve been allowing the dog to sleep with her in our guest bedrooms. She went out to dinner alone the the other night and asked if it would be too much trouble to watch the dog. I said no as long as it doesn’t pee everywhere because I have to my three kids to bed and can’t be watching the dog and said I’m not going to walk the dog. (Our dogs go outside in the backyard to do their business)

Fast forward to today. The hurricane is long gone, she did lose power in her apartment complex so she can technically leave. But she insist on staying until Sunday afternoon. She’s not a bad guest at all. She does her own thing and respects our privacy. The issue is my dog is causing problems at my friends.

I get a text from my friend saying that they haven’t much sleep the last four nights. My dog is vomiting and barking the whole night. He can be heard outside and is worried the neighbors will fall the cops.

This morning I casually mention to my wife’s friend while I’m making the kids breakfast what is going on(I did this on purpose to guilt her into leaving). She says she’s going to take a nap and go back head out.

I have not told my wife as she slept through all of this but she will definitely think I’m the asshole for mentioning the dog problem. She already said I was rude to her for mentioning the dog peeing in the house.  I would like to mention that my wife wants her to leave too. She’s a good friend of my wife’s since kindergarten but she’s good in small dosages.

Edit: I would like to add that my dog is more of an inconvenience to my friend than my guest is

Edit 2: INFO: I put my dog with my friend because my dog has known my friend since adoption. He’s never barked with him and has stayed with him and his three dogs in the past. However, my friend moved to a new house, so it could be why he was scared.

Edit 3: My wife’s friend left. Could not keep them separated. Her first day here the dog barked for 6 hours straight.

Edit 4: my dog was picked up shortly after my guest left. I bought coffee for the whole family and I invited my friend and his family over for a homemade dinner next Sunday.",79,612,0.94
17,Not the A-hole,"My roommate (19) is a vocal performance major, and is having a party at our place for everyone in his studio (all of the students that take with his teacher). I think this is a great thing, and really nice for the freshmen in the studio. 

There are about 15 people coming, and all but 3 of them are female.

My roommate put together some party favors, goody bags, and told me that he'd put some bath bombs, face masks, and other similar things in there. He also said he only made party favors for the girls in the group. 

Last night he told me while laughing that he had also put some condoms in the bag. I was shocked and immediately said he definitely needs to take those out. He said ""why? It's a joke."" I told him it comes off a little bit creepy, especially because he isn't giving any to the guys in the group. I feel like if it were really a joke, it would hit harder giving it to the guys, but even then it still comes off as creepy to me. 

I told him I would absolutely take them out, and he hasn't yet. He's now pretty mad at me. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: just to clarify a few things- the goodie bags are only for the girls. The boys don't get anything. My roommate doesn't yet know these people, as they don't have a ""class"" together. 

People are making some very good and insightful points. I kinda decided to leave it alone, unless my roommate brings it up again. I will then (calmly) tell him that I think this is really rather odd, and all that I'm trying to do is save him some embarrassment. I don't think my roommate is a bad guy, just maybe a little socially awkward and doesn't know exactly how to talk to girls yet (which is relatable).",95,234,0.95

19,Asshole,"About 6 month ago I got a hemorrhoid for the first time in my life.  It was new and strange so I told my wife about it but also told her that I was very embarrassed about it.  I told her originally because I do think communication is really important for a healthy and successful relationship.  She was really great and understanding and even picked up some meds for me.  Several weeks later she asked me how it was doing.  I told her that I was fine (I guess I wasn't super clear whether fine meant ""healed"" or just ""ok with how things were progressing"".  In any case I told her I was fine and that while I appreciated her concern, I would rather not speak about it ever again.  I did assure her that if things changed or if there new information, I would tell her.  Fast forward about a month and she asks how my hemorrhoid is. I kind of just look at her and ask if she recalls what we talked about last time this came up.  I reiterated that I was doing fine and that this is something I really don't want to talk about anymore. Fast forward again to today and she asks again.  My reaction is pretty much the same as last time - I ask her if she remembers what I have told her on this subject in the past.  Now she is upset and saying things like ""she doesn't want us to keep secrets from each other"" and ""we should be able to talk about these things"".  I agree with both statements, which is why I originally told her about the situation.  At this point I really believe she should respect my feelings/wishes and trust that I will tell her about anything that changes or is important - like I did originally.

IATA? Is it ok to request some small topics be off the table for discussion? Especially after we have already discussed them?  I feel like if anyone should be annoyed at this point it should be me, but right now, its her.

EDIT: She now knows it is completely healed and gone. I definitely told her that this time.  I would have sworn I told her it was healed when she brought it up the second time but she is telling me she doesn't recall that. I probably said some like ""fine"" or ""it was ok"". To me that may have meant healed but it was def not clear enough language in hindsight. Additionally, me thinking she already knew it was healed is why I kind of couldn't believe she was bringing it up a third time and def contributed to this being a bigger deal than it needed to be --------- Lesson learned: never use vague language.",66,102,0.89
20,Asshole,"My stepfather is an awesome guy. He loves my mum, super supportive to myself and my two half sisters (he walked them down the aisle) and i get on with him pretty well. He is a classic case of always heart in the right place but sometimes can be insensitive or annoying without meaning to be. 
Sadly he has a strained relationship with his two children (totally not his fault) and hasn't seen them for a long time. This has led to my mum (who i normally have a really great relationship with) to often try and overcompensate when i was younger (making me buy father's day cards and so on). 
My girlfriend and i have just had a little girl. In the build up he kept referring to himself as grandad and to her as his grandchild. This bothered me as he had never discussed it beforehand and when i tried to talk with my Mum about it making me feel uncomfortable she got very angry. She said i was just being hurtful, and that if he wasn't going to be called Granddad then she didn't want to be called Grandmother. 
I do not dispute that he will be like a grandfather to my daughter, but i have a Father who i am only  just talking to after five years because we had an argument. I feel like she is only considering his feelings and ignoring mine. 

The baby just came home, and i have just started calling him Uncle. My Mum seems a bit cold and has told my partner to lay off calling him Uncle and just use her first name. So i suspect there is an argument heading my way. 

So, am i the asshole here?
UPDATE: 
Many interesting responses. Thanks to everyone that weighed in. Have taken the action and spoken to Stepdad, clarifying that Grandfather is the role he will have (which was always the intention anyway) and that ""Uncle"" (something that my family has often called close friends of kids, so not really as weird to me as it seems for others) wasn't a good fit and that we shall just see what my daughter comes up with. He was absolutely fine with that and said he never cared what he was called as he knew what the relationship would be anyway, which was all i was concerned with.",259,592,0.93
21,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I separated a year ago. Best thing I ever did.

We have a 6 year old daughter and have had a couple of different coparenting schedules but the one consistent is that she's stayed with him on Friday night and me on Saturday night.

At the moment I have her 4 nights and he has her 3. He wants to make this 4 one week, 3 the next so that it's 7/14 and exactly 50:50. I have no problem with this. I never considered for a second that he deserves anything less than 50% custody.

However, he wants the interchangeable night to be Saturday. So he would have her every Friday and every other Saturday and I've said hell no. Saturday is the only night we get to chill and watch movies and not have to worry about going to bed early, it's my favourite day with her.

He's arguing that due to work schedules (his) this is the only night we (he) can change so me saying no is denying him 50:50 custody.

I have offered any other night (he can't do it), I have offered mediation (he doesn't want to be in the same room as me) and i have offered to let our lawyers sort it out (he can't afford legal fees).

So reddit, AITA?


EDIT: So this got waaaay more attention than I expected. He's dropping off our daughter at 10am tomorrow (yes, I agreed to an extra Saturday this week) so I wanted to message him before I have to see him. 

Here is my - I think, totally reasonable - message. 

--

Would it be possible to change your shift pattern to a traditional 9-5 on Tuesday and Wednesday and maintain your current hours the other days to allow you to have [daughter] every other Tuesday night? [Daughter's friend]'s mum is going to pick them both up from school and take them to dancing so she doesn't need collected until 7 or 8 (depending on what classes she chooses) and on Wednesday morning you could either use breakfast club, drop her into [neighbour] or drop her with me on your way to work.

50:50 split should also include an even split of school nights and non school nights If it works for you to switch Friday for Saturday in however you want to work this then I am open to that. However, I am not open to having her 2 or 3 weekend nights to your 5 or 6 assuming we're defining weekend nights as Friday and Saturday.

As above, I am happy to work with you on any other night of the week, whether that involves changing the days that we already have or not, speaking to a mediator or - as a last resort - consulting with a lawyer. 

Also appreciate that giving the timing and your dad's illness you may wish to postpone any changes until things have settled down and naturally if any short term amendments are required I'm happy to help where I can. I can do any overnight and drop her at school if it becomes a problem with your work or you have a meeting etc. 

Childcare, until now, has been the only thing that we've agreed on and I don't want to be at the point where we cannot be in the same room as each other as you intimated above. If we can agree, and put something in writing, then I think it will help us effectively co parent without conflict. 

I am not and never have tried to keep [daughter] from you. I do not and never would consider that 50:50 is not the optimum scenario. However [daughter], and we, are human and have other commitments - mainly work - so it cannot be uncommon that an exact split is not feasible. I think instead of focusing on the numbers and ratios we need to consider what it is that we actually want to achieve. If we consider hours rather than nights (1.5 hours in the morning, 5 hours after school, 12 hours full day) it's 30:29 assuming I get her at around dinnertime on the Saturday - so our current arrangement is 50:50

You mentioned that you want a day where you can get up and take her out without worrying about what time to have her back. That's Saturday. Not once have I wanted her back at a specific time without having a reason for it. If sometimes it's late then so what, it's Saturday? And if, like before, she wants to stay with you on a Saturday then unless I have a reason I'm not going to say no.  

I want an evening that we can cuddle up and watch movies/chill out without having to get to bed early. We don't get that during the week. Yes, if you have her back late on occasion or she stays with you then that means we can't do this but that'd be the exception rather than the rule. I don't just want time with [daughter], I want quality time, fun time. 

I don't want to go to a lawyer any more than you do but a weekend night with [daughter] is more important to me than a ratio.",224,1134,0.96
22,Not the A-hole,"I've worked here for about a year as a preschool teacher. I love my kids and I'm pretty happy with my job. 

My boss is really weird though. She's VERY conservative which is whatever, I get it, there's people like that in the world. But ever since I've started working there, she's shared her backward-ass views to me more than once. 

Situation one was when she got upset that I was handing out Lion King stickers to the kids. She said that she doesn't want our school to support Disney in any way. I asked why, and she said it's because ""they are way too liberal with a gay agenda, which is disgusting to me"". Like, what? Isn't the point of working with young children to love and accept them and teach them those same qualities so that the world can be a better place? It caught me way off guard.

Situation two was when she was doing some paperwork for our early learning coalition. They collect data to check the demographics of children who are enrolled in VPK. Not a big deal at all and standard for any school I've worked in. However, she made this comment: ""I don't understand why we have to report the kids ethnic background to the coalition. It's so frustrating. Most of them are mixed anyways. When I was young, no one was mixed."" Then she pointed to a kid and said ""what *is* he, anyways? I can't tell. What's the point of mixing races?"" Holy shit. I had no clue what to say and I literally replied 'are you serious' and she left the room. 

Situation three is her husband's Facebook. I don't have Facebook and neither does she, but out of curiosity one night I asked my husband to look her husband up, just to be a creepy bitch I guess. So we did, and he's got all these alt-right articles linked on his page, he's very open about being a white nationalist and supporting organizations like The Proud Boys and Richard Spencer and shit. 

She also treats kids of other races/family Dynamics/etc differently than she does white, straight, Christian kids. There's no solid proof of this but you can just tell.

I feel like the parents need to know this, maybe even the community, idk. But here's the thing- the school is a ""Christian"" school. My husband says that nothing will happen to her and that most parents will be okay with it and if I make a big deal about it, I'll just be a massive asshole and make us a target for retaliation from the school/her personally/whatever.

I thought it'd be a nice thing to do with/for her and texted her mother saying that I was going to bring her to get it done but to let me know if she wasn't okay with her getting her ears pierced (I was 99% sure what my daughter said was true because she wouldn't just make that up, but still wouldn't to let her mother know in advance). 

Her mother texted saying please don't bring her, because she wanted to bring her herself. 

I thought about it, but since I miss out on most things (every Christmas morning, most birthdays, trips away etc) I said screw it, she already has the monopoly on doing stuff so I decided to go ahead and bring her to get it done. 

She's now pissed, telling me I went ahead with it without her permission etc. I wasn't asking for her permission though, I was just verifying that she was okay with her getting it done. AMITA?",58,146,0.93

Obligatory on mobile so formatting might be screwed up :) 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now. Things are going well but he has a big problem with how much I use my phone. I agree that I do use it a lot, and that scrolling through reddit or twitter all day is an addiction. However, there are a lot of useful things I use my phone for as well. 

I have a set morning routine where I listen to a daily news podcast, do the NYT crossword, and do my Duolingo French lessons. This is whole routine takes about an hour in the morning. I understand that he wants to talk to me in the mornings and I end up on my phone, but the routine helps me. I feel much more productive throughout the day because I start it off doing something productive. 

After I’m done with this routine, I agree that using my phone beyond that is harmful and I need to reduce the amount I spend on reddit and Twitter drastically. He says that I should do my routine in the evening or before sleeping. This makes no sense to me, because I need to limit my screen time before sleeping, and also listening to the previous days news in the evening, or doing the crossword when I’m tired from the day doesn’t seem logical. 

My boyfriend says that even though I’ve been admitting for a while that there’s a problem I haven’t been working towards fixing it. He says that a big reason for my addiction is that I spend an hour in the morning on my phone. I agree that it might have an effect but I don’t think that changing that to a nightly routine will help. 

AITA for continuing my morning routine despite what my boyfriend thinks ?",71,205,0.94

29,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I have a 2 year old female Siberian husky. When we visit our families back home, we normally allow my in laws, my husband’s parents, to watch our dog while we visit our hometown friends or run errands. They also watched her when we went on long trips, such as our honeymoon. However, I’ve steadily grown wary about allowing our dog to be the at their house unaccompanied by us for several reasons:

1. They think we’re too harsh with our feeding methods. Our dog is very picky and finicky about eating, sometimes skipping meals. We know that it could be the nature of her breed and we do feed her high-quality foods (we even switched brands to see if that was the issue, but no change). Anyway, we have set mealtimes, once in morning and once in the evening. We set her food down for approximately 20 minutes and if she doesn’t eat, we take it from her. Our trainer taught us this method, so that she learns that food is not always readily available for her and is more likely to eat when mealtimes are. My in laws believe that her food should be available at all times, that we’re essentially starving her, and when they watch her, leave it out for her and just feed her treats all day. My husband tried explaining our reasoning but to no avail. They continue to do what they want regarding meals and treats.
2. Our dog resources guards, mostly with food and sometimes with toys, and only against other animals, not humans. This is another huge reason we only leave food down for so long, since we have a cat to worry about (we’re working with our trainer on her resource guarding). Our in laws have a dog and cat of their own, and our dog has gone after their dog once while guarding her food, so we understandably worry about their safety.
3. My father-in-law tries to coax our dog to eat. Which is fine because I do it sometimes too by talking to her and feeding her by hand. However, the way he does it, makes her upset and she starts growling. I watched him do it once and was speechless and became worried that this could make our dog food aggressive towards humans too. 

Because of these reasons, I would rather our dog be kenneled when we are unable to be with her while visiting family or when going on long trips. She has been boarded before and does well with it. My husband disagrees, saying I’m being too harsh, we should be grateful his parents offer to watch her to save us money, and that really “she’s just a dog” and we don’t need to be so strict with his parents. I’m worried for our dog but also about long-term, general effects. If they could undermine our parenting with her, what’s it going to be like when we have human kids? I told him this and he says we can’t jump to conclusions like that. I feel like I need to stand my ground on this but idk if this should be a hill to die on.

So, AITA here? By the way, my in laws would be upset with us since they do love visiting with our dog and taking her for walks, playing with her, etc.

EDIT: maybe using the word ""allow"" wasn't the best choice of words. I used it because when we have kenneled her in the past in lieu of them watching her, they have guilt-tripped us for that decision. They think we're so cruel to board her in a kennel instead and insist on watching her.",56,147,0.93
30,Asshole,"Ex and I had a nasty custody battle mainly because she wanted child support. It wasn't about the kids. It's about money. Our kids were always conflicted as to why we hated each other and why their mom threw abuse allegations that they never witnessed. 
Anyways, she met this guy online and he has money (which isn't saying a lot) but he hates kids. So she went from saying how I am some kind of monster who will sacrifice our kids to Satan and she's Carol Brady to saying that our kids don't need their mom around because dad is here so it's okay for her to move 1000 to shack up with her new boyfriend.
My kids are middle school age and not dumb but confused. I saw this as a teachable moment about their mom. I told them that their mother picked a man over them because she wants to be taken care of. That's up to them to decide how they feel or if they want to forgive her but they will always come after mom's needs with Mom.


Edit: Obviously I never beat her. My point is that she portrayed me as a monster who should not have joint custody but she ditches me with the same kids she was trying to ""protect"" after securing some d with money.

I'm also NOT going to lie to my kids and tell them that their mom is a sweet loving caring person. I'm not going to do damage control for her. I'm validating my kids' feelings by acknowledging their mother is a cunt and has been for a long time.",563,2113,0.93
31,Not the A-hole,"For some context, I am 19 and my boyfriend is 24. We live together (due to circumstances rather than choice but we love living together). We’ve been together about a year. I don’t have a great relationship with his friends because I’ve never really had the opportunity to. Since me and my SO have been together, they’ve never made an effort with getting to know me. I suggest days out, inviting them over, I even offered to use one of my work benefits to go to a theme park with them all (and their girlfriends) at 50% off. 

I’ve met my SO’s friends maybe 2-3 times and some of them not even once. They just don’t seem interested in knowing me at all. 

Last night, my SO and his friends went to the movies. Following this, they went back to one of their houses to smoke, eat food and play video games. My SO asked to borrow two of my switch controllers (I have 4 total) and I agreed. I said, ‘please don’t take my pink one’ and said he can help himself to the others. When he came home this morning I was unpacking his overnight back for him so I could put his clothes in the washing machine. I found my controllers, disconnected the top half (the slidey part of the switch controller) and went to put them down on the side. First of all, when I picked up my (VERY EXPENSIVE POKEMON EDITION) controller, I noticed it was slippery. Almost greasy? So when he came back I said “hey? Who used this?” And then he said “aw yeah I know it’s broke” I was like “WHAT? WHERE??”. Now the only thing that was broken was the hand strap plastic tightener thing, it looks like it had been stood on because it was snapped in half.

I asked why they didn’t apologise to me? For breaking my things? He thinks it would be weird and awkward for them to apologise, but I think they should’ve apologised to me, even if it was through proxy! They could’ve asked him to apologise to me? We’re asking for a third opinion.

Reddit, AITA for expecting an apology from them? Not even to my face or me directly but like a “hey dude can you tell your girlfriend I’m sorry for breaking it?”.

EDIT: sorry I forgot to mention, he won’t tell me which friend did it. I assume this is because he doesn’t want me to harbour any dislike for any particular friend of his. My SO apologised to me, but doesn’t think his friends should.",39,53,0.95
32,Not the A-hole,"My younger brother was kicked out years ago from my parents home for doing drugs. He was then kicked out of my aunts home for doing drugs. He now lives with my parents again (this was all over span of 3 years) and texted me yesterday that my mom kicked him out. He was drinking and got into a fight with her.

I've kept in contact almost every day with him, called him everyday in rehab, and try to actively listen to him when he opens up about his problems. However, I have been living on my own for a very long time now and I don't feel he is welcome in my home that I've worked hard for. I was kicked out too (my parents tend to do that) but I was able to land on my feet.

34,Not the A-hole,"My grandmother had been switching between Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism(I think) when she was alive, so my mother took a little after her. We may not have a religion in the family but she had always been a superstitious.


It started with small things like do not hang out clothes overnight, do not point at the moon and things like that. It has become more serious these days because apparently she has made some friends who practice the same things. She would buy talismans and hang ""good luck"" charms around the house or forbid placing certain items at certain places. It can get annoying being told of for setting off taboos for no apparent sense. My father was actually cool with that, saying that it's just small inconveniences to avoid bad luck.


I have already gotten used of her ways but one thing I cannot accept is to follow what she teaches. I think superstitions are ridiculous, and while my mother can believe in whatever she wants she shouldn't try to force it on me. I am starting to just do whatever I want like a normal free thinker/atheist and throwing out all those charms and talismans my mother asked me to hang in my room. Ofcourse, she gets upset every time I do that.


My mother threw a big temper at me earlier because I refused to go to a temple and kneel to repent for whatever spirits I offended, because I burnt a high fever for 3 days a week ago and she was convinced that I must have offended spirits returning to Hell's Gate on the 7th Month. She then told me stories of how people getting sick when they offend spirits and insist we go for an apology just to be safe.


I have just recovered from my fever and am still coughing and busy trying to catch up with the school works I missed, so I was in a foul mood. She hadn't been the least concerned about me when I was sick and when she does get concerned she thinks I offended spirits? W.T.F.


I retorted something like ""I am not going to apologise to some petty spirits getting offended so easily, maybe thats why they're in Hell. They should return to Hell's Gates and stop haunting people"".

35,Not the A-hole,"So I work at a small local business, part time during the school year, full time during the summer.

Between rent, food and trying to add to my savings again so I don't have to entirely put repairs on my credit card if I need them, I'm on a pretty strict budget. 

I talk about cooking a lot with one coworker and almost everytime I do one guy, John butts in that I should get an instant pot. And everytime I tell him I can't afford one right now and I like the stuff I have (crockpot, nice pots and pans set, grill) this has been going on since around Easter. 

So yesterday I'm talking to the other coworker trying to figure out how to do a pressure cooker recipe in a slow cooker and John says I wouldn't have this problem if I had an instantpot. I get fed up and turn around and say:

""Oh thank you so much for offering to buy me one! Especially since I've mentioned several time times that I CANT AFFORD IT. That's so sweet of you! Now don't get me anything too fancy.""

37,No A-holes here,"My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

Yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind. I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.

I'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is aware of these points.

I just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.

AITA for asking my wife to have an abortion?

Edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%. I realize that I’m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I’m going to get snipped ASAP.

Edit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. Here are the main takeaways:

* I apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended. She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally caught off guard.
* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like she tricked me (I don't).
* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",2724,24271,0.85
38,Asshole,"I, 38F, have a very large nose which I absolutely hate. Ever since I was a kid, I've been ridiculed for it and for some reason even adults feel it is ok to comment my appearance and make fun of my nose - yes you read that right.. 

I feel like my nose defines me too much. My husband says he likes it and to him I am the most beautiful woman in the world. I believe him. But still hate my nose.

Yesterday I finally had a consultation with a higly recommended plastic surgeon specialized in rhinoplasty. We discussed at lenght and booked a time for the operation at the end of the year. I am looking very much forward to it, I am thrilled!

I have not yet told my husband about this as based on our previous discussions on the topic I know he will be upset and not understand why I'd want to do this. I think I will tell him closer to the operation date.

I can easily afford this operation financially, we have separate finances and money is no issue. I can get the 2 weeks off work I need to heal. I have had other kinds of non-plasticsurgical operations before (6 in total + EDIT: they were 2 cesarean sections, 2 knee surgeries, appendectomy and an ankle operation so NOT plastic surgeries, people have misunderstood this..) and am not afraid of going under the knife. I really hate my nose and the doc will make it as small as possible but so it still fits my facial features. The operation will be done in a very good private hospital in my home country (the Nordics). I will take the money off my own savings account, there'll be plenty left and more coming in. I have dreamed of this for years.

Aita for not even discussing this with my husband but going ahead as planned? We have two kids (7 and 4yo boys) whom I will explain that it is done for medical reasons as they don't need to know about my insecurities at such young age, we'll discuss this once they're grownups; luckily they have their father's nose and are handsome boys.

46,,"My nephew is 5 and just started kindergarten this year. My sister got him a betta fish as a reward for keeping a green card for 2 weeks. I was against it from the beginning. I got home from work and saw he had a betta fish cup and he was already tapping it and scaring it. I didnt say anything, it's not my place. Anyways, it's been a week and I've watched him continuously tap the tank, and stick his fingers in it. This morning I came down and the fish is dead. I feel really bad. I thought about cleaning the tank but I wanted my sister to feel bad. I wanted her to realize a pet no matter how small is a huge responsibility, and even if it was bought for my nephew to feel rewarded she should have known it was her responsibility. Had she asked me about it before she bought it or if I would help take care of it I would have said no and told her it was a bad idea. I hate this and its infuriating, but I feel so bad and guilty for the fish. I messaged my sister to give her a heads up that I was pretty sure it was dead and she just said ""(sad emoji) ok. I think he was over feeding it."" WIBTA if I tell her it's her fault? AITA for not just cleaning the tank?

Edit: I feel that I must clarify, I did tell my nephew to stop when I was around if I saw him tapping the tank or putting his fingers in it. I told him the fish would die. When I said it wasnt my place I was talking about to my sister and her husband about rewarding their kid with the fish. I didnt mean I didnt say anything to my nephew... I was never there to see him feed it. The third time I saw him do it I yelled for him to stop in front of my sister who would just calmly tell him to stop or this fish would die, she wouldnt say much else after though. 

I guess I should've told her the day they got there I wouldnt be cleaning the tank or feeding the fish. I couldnt tell her that I think rewarding her kid with a fish is wrong or it would result in a silent fight for much longer than just a week. Thanks for all your feedback I'll read more when I get off work.

My sister was pissed and said not to torment her son over the first fish because they did everything they were supposed to do and it had been 4 days since they got the fish. ""Why clean the tank?""

56,Not the A-hole,"I live in a tiny, packed apartment with several other wonderful young women. We're all college students, and most of us are good friends. One of my roommates has recently stopped locking the door-- not intentionally, but out being utterly reckless. It's happened twice in the past day, and 4 times in the 2 weeks we've been moved in for this year. She's also locked herself out twice, and we have found multiple copies of our keys around our street-- it's not the most populated street so it would be easy to figure out where the key fits.

We live in a city known for crime including break-ins, especially on our street. If I told you which city, you would be horrified. Our apartment is street level, and anyone walking by could see if our door was open. If our door is unlocked, a gust of wind could open it. Our roommate is always the last one to leave in the morning and the last one back at night which means we have spent many days and nights with ourselves and our belongings in danger.

The non-offending roommates and I were willing to let go of things the first time it happened but since then, we've decided we're going to sit down and discuss a penalty/punishment system to keep her accountable. No one else is scatterbrained enough to leave the lock open-- I always check again and again if it's locked before I sleep, but since she gets home so soon after I'm asleep it's no good.

The current system we've come up with is  ***(NOTHING HAS BEEN PUT INTO PLACE YET, WE ARE WAITING UNTIL EVERY ROOMMATE IS BACK IN THE HOUSE TO DISCUSS THIS.)*** this, and it applies to everyone: First offense, you pay $20 to non-offending roommate. Each offense after that the payment doubles. After 4 offenses, you pay to install a security system (including a camera which catches who's entering and exiting the apartment for total accountability) and extra locks on our door (and installation, landlord won't pay for it.) ALSO. After three offenses, you agree to take responsibility in the event of a breakin. If someone steals my laptop while I'm out because you didn't lock the door, congrats, you are buying me a new one. If another roommate is physically attacked, she will pay medical bills. ***This isn't specific to this roommate, if anyone else stopped locking the door too, they would be held to the same standards.

She is FUMING. She says we're attacking her and blaming her for something that is not her fault and making a mountain out of a mole hill. I have lived in much worse neighborhoods before as have many of my fellow roommates and we know the terror of break ins, meanwhile the offending roommate's parents make more than all of the rest of us parent's combined. She's a spoiled brat who refuses to be held accountable. The police here are notoriously useless, we know if we're the victims of a break in we will never see our belongings again, or so much as a penny. i don't believe for a second that she's intentionally placing us in danger but seriously it takes one second to lock the door and check again if it's locked.

57,Not the A-hole,"I'll start with three pieces of backstory.

First, I was a pharmacist for years, but I eventually realized that I hated the profession and wanted to go back to school to become a physician.  I applied and was accepted to start school in the fall of 2018.

Second, my dad was diagnosed with a terminal illness in the summer of 2017.  His condition rapidly deteriorated, and after several hospital stays, he was admitted once again in April 2018.  He didn't like being in the hospital alone, so I took FMLA leave from work so I could stay with him.  It wasn't exactly a pleasant experience for me (I recall one instance when I stayed for five consecutive nights and couldn't wait to get home for a shower), but it was nothing compared to what he went through.

Third, my boss at the time was always terribly cruel to me, to the extent that he is honestly one of the few people I can say I've ever truly hated.  To give just one example of the countless instances of abuse I suffered at his hands, I once submitted a vacation request for a nine-day period (Saturday-Sunday), and he approved all of it except the Wednesday in the middle, which he denied and made me work, effectively preventing me from going anywhere during my time off.

Anyhow, when I went on FMLA, I had to fill out a form that had a spot for my ""estimated return to work date.""  I put June 1.  When June 1 rolled around, my dad was still in the hospital, and I got a text message from my boss asking why I wasn't at work.  I was livid.  He knew the situation I was in, he knew that June 1 was my **estimated** return to work date, he had not checked in with me at all during the several weeks I was on leave, and he had scheduled me to work on June 1 without informing me in any capacity.  I had had enough of him and his disgusting behavior.

I tried to call him, but he didn't pick up, so I sent him a text message (knowing that I would never need a reference from him) telling him that I quit and that he could find someone else to cover my shift.  He immediately called me back and said, ""So you're quitting with no notice?""  I was like, ""Yup.""  As petty as it may sound, hearing him on the phone not knowing what to say because he finally had no leverage over me was one of the most satisfying experiences of my life.

My dad ended up dying three weeks later, so in retrospect I'm even more satisfied that I quit when I did and was able to spend more time with him during his final days than I otherwise would've.  And I'm also happy with my decision to leave pharmacy behind and pursue medicine.  Medical school is tough as nails (I'm about a month into my second year at this point), but I feel so much more fulfilled than I ever did as a pharmacist.

Anyway, the reason I made this post is that I often see Redditors saying that there is never any excuse to quit a job without giving at least two weeks notice, but I've always felt that this was a unique situation in which I was justified, so I wanted to get some opinions.",29,108,0.91

One of our “inside jokes” from college was that she only likes white guys (bc that’s the only type of guy she crushed on/dated in college). Anyways, fast-forward and about three years ago she happened to marry a white guy. He’s super sweet and from the many times I had met him, I assumed he had the same type of sarcastic humor his wife and I have. I was having lunch with my friend about a week ago, and she made a joke that went something like “I got the white guy” and we laughed. About two days later, she had a party at her house and I was chatting with her husband. We were casually joking and I basically told him the joke she made at lunch. After that his demeanor kind of changed and after the party ended I got a huuuuge text from my friend saying it was out of line for me to joke about that stuff to him. She said that it made him feel like an object, and called me an asshole. I apologized profusely, and said I really meant no harm/I was joking, but I feel like she was harsh. AITA?",23,36,0.89

My father's European ancestry is on the paternal side; as a result I have a very white-sounding last name. But overall I am 75% Latino

So last week I was at my friend's apartment with a bunch of other kids, and one of my friends (who's a huge stoner) thought it would be a good idea to bring some of his burnout friends. 

So we started playing beer pong, and by this point I was really drunk. I was up against one of my friend's burnout friends. I had met this kid before and really dislike him because he's just such a dick. 

So every time he sinks a cup he says ""suck it white boy,"" and every time I miss a cup, he tells me I suck in some fashion followed by ""white boy."" I politely asked him to stop calling me that, but of course he didn't listen. So after the 7th or 8th time I'm called white boy, I respond with ""You're probably more white than I am you lightskin douche!"" (He has very very light skin for a black person).

60,UPDATE,"Hey guys! So I wanted to give an update since some of you were very kind and worried for me and my daughter! 

[Here is the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/co0j4u/aita_for_telling_my_ex_i_refuse_to_share_custody/)

So I made a very hard decision. After many peoples advice and opinions I decided to ask my daughter what she wanted. After a very long and hard conversation with my daughter she did tell me she would like to meet him. I don’t want to say much more about that... Can’t lie it hurt my heart but I remember being that excited every time my mother told me about my father.

I called him and asked him if he would meet me for coffee. He told me he thought that be great and we set it up.

Seeing my ex again was incredibly hard. After a very very long talk we decided that if we could both be civil adults we could stay out of court. I decided to let him know that I think he should pay for therapy for them both and he agreed that would be a smart decision. They have an appointment in two weeks and my daughter is excited. I’ve also made it clear there are no second chances after this.

I’m not going to say I’m not nervous about this whole situation. I’m actually very scared for my daughter. I want what’s best for my daughter and that’s it. I’m trying very hard to remember the man my ex was for me though. He was my best friend and rock for five years and I only hope he can be that for my daughter now.

Thanks for the many kind words from many different redditors. Many of you gave me the courage and reassurance that I could handle this and many others gave me healthy advice for my daughters future relationship with her father. Thanks again to the kind comments and advice!

EDIT: So I’m seeing a lot of people say I need to legalize his visitation and stuff but I need to know he can be a father first before doing this. When I say stay out of court I mean we won’t be having a long nasty custody dispute. We will talk to our lawyers when we cross that bridge.",136,2797,0.97

The one I’m having the biggest issue with is his farting at night. Our room stinks ALL the time!! I can’t take it anymore. I told him he needs to go to the doctor because it’s not normal, it’s something that has just recently became this out of control farting. 

So I called and made him a doctor appointment and am making him go. He thinks it’s funny that he farts all the time, and he thinks I’m an asshole by making him go to the appointment. He HATES going to the doctor. So, AITA?",190,922,0.97
62,Asshole,"I live in a house with two roommates I found and met online. None of us are super well-off financially, so we try to cut costs and save whatever money we can. My two roommates very, very rarely run air conditioning (and never do so at night), citing the heavy costs. We don’t live in an area that’s particularly hot compared to the rest of the country, so most people could survive OK in such a situation.

But I have high functioning autism, and I am much more sensitive to heat/cold than your average person. I am most affected by it at night; the heat has caused me many a restless night. My roommates, from what I’ve heard, are pretty much unaffected by the heat and have no trouble getting to sleep or functioning without AC.

I’ve been pushing for them to run the AC at night for a while, and they’ve long turned the idea down, citing the costs. But very recently (this past week), then gave in, and started running it each night. A week after they started running it, they told me that since I’m the one who requested it and who benefits from it (they emphasized how they don’t need it much at all) they want me to cover 100% of the costs of it, rather than split it evenly. Per month, it would probably cost a little over $100, and if we split it evenly it would cost us in the $30-$40 range each.

I don’t want to cover the whole cost of it (I made this clear to them); I want to split it three ways as we would everything else, and don’t think it’s fair to do anything different. Even if they don’t absolutely need AC, I’m sure they sleep at least somewhat more soundly with it on and are happier with it on, even if they don’t consciously realize it. It’s a service we all benefit from, I think. AITA for not wanting to cover the entire cost?",74,71,0.82
63,Asshole,"About 20 years ago I received an inheritance of about $60,000.  In the back of my mind I thought I might want to use it on a down payment for a new house, so I left it liquid.  I never bought the new house, but just the cash in a savings account because it was too much work to figure out what to do with.

A couple of years ago, my sister asked to borrow $21,000.  Her husband (a neurologist who owned his own practice) was having trouble making payroll that month.  If I lent her the money, she said she'd pay me back within a couple of months.  So I did - I wasn't using the money, and I knew she would pay me back.

Well, it turned out that their cash flow issues were more serious than I thought, because she said she couldn't pay me back immediately.  But she could pay me $1000 a month.  So she gave me several checks postdated so I could cash them once a month.  

Okay, fine.  Except then I get a call saying please don't cash the checks after all - she doesn't have the money at the moment.  Whatever.  Fine.  I didn't need the money immediately, and I knew she would pay me back.  At some point.

Last year, she told me that while she knows she still owes me about $15,000, she needs to borrow $25,000 more.  There was a tax bill they couldn't pay or something.  I still had money left over from the inheritance, and I wasn't using it, and I still knew she would pay me back, so I said okay.  She then asked to increase it to $27,000 ""just in case"".  

Fine, whatever.

Again, she said that within a few months, she could pay me back one to two thousand a month.  At this point, I kind of internally rolled my eyes, thinking I would get a call from her a few months later saying never mind, don't cash the checks after all.  So when she mailed me several checks, post-dated starting in June of 2019, and then every month after that, I just let them sit.

Now I'm getting yelled at by my mom because I haven't cashed the checks yet, and my sister needs to do book-keeping or whatever with her finances.  Apparently, it's rude to keep checks this long as it messes with the giver's cash flow.

Here's the deal.  I don't drive.  I work (as a cashier, I might add.  Let me just remind you all that she's married to a NEUROLOGIST, who borrowed money from someone making minimum wage), and I go to school.  I don't have time to go to the bank right now.  And since I don't need the money immediately, I don't feel the need to make a special trip.  Since my sister took her sweet old time paying me back, I don't see why I have to hurry to cash something when doing so is an inconvenience for me.

I'll cash the checks eventually.  Maybe in a few weeks, maybe during winter break.  But my mom (and my sister) are getting increasingly mad at me, saying I'm being rude and inconsiderate.

Maybe I am.  I await your judgement.  If IATA, then I'll go to the bank this very upcoming week.  Otherwise, I don't want to because I don't have a lot of free time.

UPDATE:  So yes, IATA.  On the bright side, I learned of a mysterious thing called ""mobile banking"".  Thanks, Reddit.  :-)   So I downloaded that app and now all the checks are cashed.  Yay for having money.",49,56,0.92
64,Asshole,"Ok so I’d be interested in hearing people’s opinions on this one on whether I (when I say “I”, it’s really “we” - myself and my wife) ATA.

To give a bit of background and context to the situation, my wife and I got married a few months ago. We both live in another country a long way from where we’re from, let’s say we’re from Canada and we live in New Zealand. We flew home to Canada and from there flew to a nice island in the Caribbean to get married. It was just a small affair with immediate family as that’s all we ever wanted. In all about 20 of us. When we got back to Canada, we held a party for friends and extended family just to mark the occasion and make everyone feel invited that way since we didn’t do the typical traditional wedding.
Anyway, over in NZ, my wife has twin cousins who she would always have been generally close to. Let’s call them Ann and Betty. Betty is married to Charlie. Still following? Good!
Betty and Charlie got married about two years ago and they went back to Canada to do it. We were invited and originally declined as we had other plans in NZ at the time they were going to get married but after some arm twisting, they convinced us to come. Now I should point out we were happy to change plans, it’s not like they forced us so we flew home and made their wedding. We gave them a wedding gift of a card with the equivalent of about $200USD (so whatever that is in you own country’s currency).

Anyway, fast forward to a few weeks before our own wedding a few months ago and Ann, Betty and Charlie gave us a wedding card between them with nothing in it.

Without sounding greedy but myself and my wife felt pretty put out over this given we changed plans that we had already booked to make their wedding and also giving B+C a generous gift. A, B and C all have good jobs making good money too so it’s absolutely not a case that they would be struggling for money and simply couldn’t afford it.
We always felt they were a bit bitter about not being invited (despite it just being immediate family anyway) and they made some comments before our wedding saying we were crazy for “only” having a small wedding and that we should’ve done a big traditional one as it would’ve brought in a lot more money.
It was just disappointing that they didn’t even get us so much as some cheap shitty gift like a picture frame from a dollar store or something!

So basically, AITA (or rather, are we TA) for selfishly expecting a wedding gift? Is it a case that people should not be automatically obliged to give a gift, regardless of what they have received from another person/couple? Are they justified in not having to give anything due to not actually attending the wedding?

Or are our feelings of disappointment justified and feel let down by the three of them acting stingy?",56,73,0.89

He said he would fully pay for the car but she has to be baptized in the church of his choice. A Spanish speaking church, and his brother and sister will be the God Parents. I do not speak Spanish, while I do enjoy that part of their family they would not be my first choice of god parents for my daughter, and it's not his choice anyway.

They're not happy about this and my older kid mentioned that he'd like them to come but accepted my reasoning for them not being invited. I need to know if I'm being an asshole about this or if I'm right. I feel guilty but at this point I have to think of my other kids and this is the only action I can take that will fix the issues we've had.   


The problem is that they only come to my oldest's parties and give him tons of crap then and for xmas. Xmas the last 4 years, my parents either didn't give my other 2 anything or gave them each a book.  My second son started noticing last xmas and it was a really shitty feeling all around. It went as far as my mom giving my oldest something that was way too small for him and meant for someone my second sons age, instead of thinking of my second son, she exchanged it for something else for my oldest. I told her it was crappy showing that type of favoritism and she said that my husbands parents should be doing that for the younger two. They don't though, they actually treat them the same and make an effort to make sure none of them feel excluded when they come see us or we go see them. My parents know this but it hasn't stopped them from pretty much acting like the other two don't exist 2 days a year. The rest of the year they're fine with them. We meet for dinner a few times a year, we go visit them and my mom dotes on all of the kids like a regular grandma but shit, come birthdays or xmas, its a 180.   
I feel like I might be an asshole because my decision impacts my oldest son because they won't be coming to see him for his birthday anymore.

In the beginning of our relationship, we discussed the topic of her dancing with guys and whether or not this is acceptable for me. At first, I said, I think I'd be OK of it as long as she does not have any romantic or sexual intentions with her dance partner, but I told her the idea of her grinding with someone else would make me uncomfortable and jealous. She enjoys dancing for dancing, and said it's not anymore than that. I asked her how she'd feel if I grinded with another girl and she said she would not care as long as I know boundaries. I told her something like ""I'm not going to tell you what to do, but if you know I don't like you grinding on others, would you still do it?"" She said ""I think I would, but I'd tell you about it first. But I would hope you'd be open to it."" I told her that I'd need to think about whether or not this is acceptable. She was surprised that I took issue w/ grinding, and she said ""If you have a problem with grinding, then I think you're really going to hate me dancing Bachata."" That statement implied that she doesn't think much of grinding.

Then a bit later, this younger, really good looking guy from the older guy's group started dancing with her. He tried to make a move on her, and she shut him down.

I was obviously happy that she validated my trust in her. She then came over and said ""IDK why some guys get the wrong idea and think it's OK to make a move just b/c I'm dancing on them.""

72,Not the A-hole,"My Fiancé and I just went to a small-town movie theater to go see the new It movie. It was busy when we arrived, and we waited to get our snacks and tickets. A little background my fiancé is in a power wheelchair and we are our 20’s (I’m 27 and she’s 23).

They have assigned seating at this theater and they only have one wheelchair spot and a companion seat next to it. When we asked for the tickets she clicked the touchscreen and she said someone had just bought the companion seat. The manager came over and come to find out it was the teenagers next to us. 

The manager talked to the teenagers, and said they agreed to move down 1 seat and we would have the wheel in spot and the seat next to it. He also said that we could have the ticket for free.

This is where it gets shitty, and I want to know if we have a right to be mad. The teenagers were sitting in the companion spot when we walked in to the screen. I asked if they could move down a seat and they said that “the manager said these are our seat y’all are supposed to use the wheelchair spot.” Obviously there’s no where to sit for me, and I just replied “okay I’ll go talk to guys up front, thanks.”

We went back up front and waited in line for the next cashier. We explained to the new cashier what had happened and I will call him “A” for Asshole. A calls over the manager and I explain again what happened. The manager said he would go talk to the teenagers, and see if they would move down. The manager also said he couldn’t force them to move since they had bought the ticket. 

I’m not gonna lie I was pretty pissed at this point, and I was trying not to get mad I understand it’s Friday night and very busy. I asked if there were any wheelchair spots available for the next 7:00 (30 mins ahead) or the 7:15. He said yes the 7:15 had a spot available. 

We agreed to the 7:15 and this is were I lost it. I said to my Fiancé “what the hell are we gonna do for 45 minutes.” After I said that “A” looked at me and said “Well maybe you should’ve got here earlier, huh?” 

I replied “Dude there’s only 1 wheelchair spot in the whole screening and y’all told us we would have the spot.” A replied “that’s why you should’ve got here earlier.” 

At this point I’m shaking and so is my fiancé. It would be different if the show was sold out BUT there was still 50 seats available. My fiancé said to A “There’s only 1 fucking spot in the screening for a wheelchair and you sold the companion seat.” A then says, “well I’m telling you, either do the 7:15 or I’ll go talk to the teenagers. Which one?” 

I lost my shit. I flipped out and said, “fuck this I’m leaving.” If the Looney Tunes cartoon was illustrating me there was steam rolling out of my ears. We left and I will never go back to this theater. It sucks because the next closest theater is 25 minutes away, and I enjoyed going to that theater.

I told her that I was really hoping for a girl and that although I wouldn’t love our son any less, I’m a little upset that I’ll never have the daddy daughter relationship I always wanted. She said that she doesn’t get to choose the gender of our baby, and that I should be over the moon regardless of our child’s gender. I can see where she’s coming from, but I just can’t share her enthusiasm right now. She’s currently upset at me because of it, but I don’t think it’s an issue that I’m disappointed. I think it’s natural to prefer one gender over the other, even if people don’t admit it.",188,337,0.87
76,Not the A-hole,"Okay so my sister does my hair, and I used to go in once a year to get it cut, cause I couldn’t really afford much else. She always expressed interest in wanting to do my hair and to take pictures of it. 

So in March I decided to go blonde, and when we went over price I was able to afford it as I was making a little bit more money. So I started the process and it’s been going good. She charges $40 and I tip an additionally $20, so $60 (sometimes I tip $40, so $80) which is really cheap as full price would be like $250. She’s previously vented to me on how other people barely tip, and so I’ve asked her on a few different occasions is what I pay enough and she’s always told me I was good. Cool. 

So I got a new job and I’m making about twice as much. Mind you I still don’t make a lot (I’m 20 so I went from minimum wage to a corporate full time job) and I still have to budget. Just gave me enough to get my own apartment and budget carefully. So I go in for my appointment today, spend my usual amount, and she texts me a few hours afterwards telling me I need to tip more. 

So I apologize and offer to send her more money (which I did end up sending her another $40, so $60 tip plus $40 that she usually charges, so I spent $100 total). That’s fine, but it put me tight as I wasn’t budgeting for it. I told me that I understand her feeling awkward but I wish she took advantage of the multiple opportunities she had when I asked her if I was tipping enough. She then says now that I make more I should pay more, but I didn’t really think about it. Mind you she and her fiancé make close to a six didgit income together so it wasn’t like she ever struggled on money. 

I know I got a cheap price, but I always brought her coffee and have advertised for her to multiple people bringing in a little business. Was I TA for not tipping enough before?

EDIT: okay so my sister works at a super high end salon, it’s all over instagram and a lot of people go there to get their hair down. So her prices are normally a lot higher because of the prestige at the salon. She makes a good living there and I’m happy for her, cause she’s able to charge more because she works at that salon and make more money. She’s definitely not scamming any of her other customers, and I’d still recommend her",41,46,0.87
77,Not the A-hole,"For a little backstory, there is a huge age difference between my siblings and I.  We were never really close due to the two of us being from different generations.

For the first time in my life I'm juggling school and work.  It's been hard on me, but I'm doing it to make my dad happy even though I don't see myself ever using the degree.  I go to school until 1:30 and then drive to work to work until 6pm.  From there I go home and do my homework until I go to bed.  Day in.  Day out.  Over and over.  I do nothing but school, work, homework/tv time, sleep.  It's hectic, but I get two days off: the weekend

Work finally gave me my weekends off and I was ecstatic.  After a week of getting screamed at by random callers, I get a weekend.  Two days to myself to relax and destress myself from dealing with people and driving and general business.  Then.. enter my sister.

She saw the fact that I had a weekend off as an opening to visit.  It was my first weekend off and she wanted to come in.  This means that I had to clean house to her specifications on very short notice.  Sweep, mop, dust, change the cat litter in the box, etc so she wouldn't complain to our dad about the housekeeping.  Which is fine.  I played with her daughter and entertained them all weekend, including getting dragged out and to events I didn't really want to go to because I was bone tired.  

Rules while she's in: no calling my mom that I call to check on every night during the visit (we have separate mothers and she gets jealous I'm in contact with mine), no video games that her precious child can't play, no movies we don't watch together.  Which is alright.  I get wanting to spend time together with the family. And I take solice in the fact that she usually doesn't come that often.

Then.. come next weekend.  Surprise visit, child in tow.  This time no call, no warning, no nothing.  I'm relaxing and trying to finish some leftover work stuff when she knocks on my door.  

Then..the next.  She crashes a birthday party (at a bar) and brings the kid into said bar(around 5-7 years old).  People (rightfully) complained

And last weekend she just has to visit again because she felt bad she didn't ""spend enough time"" with me last time.

And around half an hour ago.  I just got a call letting me know she and her entire family of five are an hour away from the house and to have it ready for them

I voiced to my dad(who I still live with due to his advancing age)that she was literally driving me insane.  Dad called me selfish and said I should be happy to have a sister who wants to spend so much time with me and was very angry that I was complaining about his daughter coming to visit us.  He wished that she would come every day and that I should feel the same.  When I tried to explain it from my point of view, he said that I wasn't going to do anything those two days anyway and that I should be glad I had something to do.

So... Is dad right?  I'm I being unreasonable for not wanting to entertain my family on my days off?",43,120,0.96

80,Not the A-hole,"Just as the header says, I told my best friend a few months ago he can no longer be the officiant for my wedding. 

A year ago we asked my best friend to be the officiant for our wedding. Prior to this, he's been going through a rough patch with his long time girlfriend breaking up with him and hes been stressed out with family issues and work (he's a lawyer). Anyways, since asking him to be in the officiant, he's found himself getting into multiple fights with people and he's often getting kicked out of bars. He picks verbal fights with random people and hes been causing public commotions over the smallest things. Essentially, imo he's been pretty emotionally unstable. Worst of all, it's even worse when he drinks, which he partakes in often. 

My fiancee brought up her concerns way back, but I continued to push for him because I know he's a good dude who's going through a rough patch. Last straw came back in March, when my fiancee had a heart to heart with him. We went away for the weekend with a bunch of friends, and he essentially promised her he wouldn't drink hard liquor and get drunk to show her how serious he was about being the officiant. Instead, he got smashed and the rest is history. 

I told him we had to go with someone else, which killed me to do, but I honestly felt like I had no choice. Anyways, he's been taking it pretty hard, which is more amplified when he drinks. Recently he told me I was being an ass for not giving him another chance, but what other options did I have.

81,Not the A-hole,"So here is just the jist of things:

I took time off on Friday (requested 2 weeks before), and automatically had the day off for labor day, so I had a 4 day weekend. I went on my first backpacking trip with my sister, her gang of friends, and my one friend for my birthday weekend. I went down with my friend because he has a car and I don't. We had an amazing weekend, and was returning from the mountains on Monday.

On this same Monday, which is labor day, his car breaks down, and I am 3 hours away from where I live/work. At this point, I was freaking out about getting to work. My friend calls his boss and tells him he may not get to work the next day, because all of the repair shops were closed for labor day. His boss was understanding and gave him the time off.

I decided to do the same, and texted my boss the situation and said I could make it into work most likely by noon. She was not happy at all, and texted back saying I already requested Friday off, and that she would be out of the office Tuesday. It wasn't like I wanted a free extra day on Tuesday, I was stranded. I am always honest and make it to work consistently so I have no reason to lie.

I then decide to call her and explain that I am stranded where we are and before I could explain how expensive it would be for me to lyft/uber back in time for work, she said she did not care and that this was not her problem and that I need to figure out how to get to work on time. Almost in tears, I said I was sorry and said I would make it to work.

I didn't know what to do, it would cost me more than I work in a day to lyft or uber to get to work the next day and I don't have a car. I called my parents, told them I was  desperate and needed to be at work on time. They live 2 hours away, and came to get me. I found out that my dad had taken time off of work just to pick me up late that evening. I felt so terrible.

My boss later texts me that night saying whenever I make it to work to let her know, and we would discuss this issue on Wednesday.

It was already too late, my parents already got me and took me to the train station, and I showed up at work super early Tuesday, as I didnt want to chance being late. I texted my boss letting her know I came early and she later texted saying if I wanted to stay longer for overtime or if I wanted to leave early I could.

By Wednedsay, I was already wanting to quit my job, and she never ended up speaking with me, so I still have not told her I want to quit or how much work/stress it took me to get to work on Tuesday.

82,Not the A-hole,"So I live two houses down from an elementary school (I know I know my mistake) and now that school is in session, we have to deal with the traffic of after school pick up. It’s only been 3 days but already I’ve had people park in front of my house, leave the car there for 10-15 minutes, and go pick up their kid(s). My issues with this are as follows:

1- my dog goes crazy when she sees them. Any time someone looks like they might be approaching our house, she alerts us like a good guard dog should. I don’t want to discourage this because, as I said, she is a guard/alert dog. 

2- there is very little space for cars to fit on the side of the road which means they park on my lawn and are ruining the grass. We have been working on regrowing the grass and having cars drive through it kind of ruins our progress. 

3- ALL SUMMER LONG we had to deal with the noise and inconvenience of construction as they built an entire parking lot to deal with the shit show that is parent pick up. They literally built a giant parking lot at an elementary school so that there would be less chaos. 

4- And I fully admit this is petty... I feel like this is cheating. Everyone else waits in an orderly line to get their turn to cycle through to pick up their child. But they’ve decided they’re going to park near the school in a non-designated area to make things easier for themselves. 

So tell me AITA? I’m considering putting up a sign that says “no after school pick-up parking” or something like that but I don’t know if that makes me a jerk.

TLDR at the bottom! 

Hello, all! It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! 

My fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. 

Surprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.

The phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

Less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.

She sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

For days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

My fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

TLDR: We are eloping, bitches!

85,Not the A-hole,"My wife was married briefly to a guy for about 9 months about 4 years ago. He turned out to be a criminal and a drug addict (all of which he hid from her) and committed three felonies (some big time thefts) and got thrown in prison right before she filed for divorce. He is currently serving an 18 year sentence with chance of parole.  He also has a very lengthy criminal record spanning decades.

I live in a community property state and just recently learned any debt obtained while married is 50/50 split upon divorce even if the debt is in only one of the spouse's name.  Everything was in his name when they were married and he ran up all their credit cards, etc and didn't tell her anything.  He also has to pay substantial restitution for what he did.

I feel it is possible upon his release, he may instigate some legal action against my wife because she divorced him and cut all contact with him shortly after he got thrown in prison.  I fear if he does this, it is possible any judgements against her will also become my responsibility since we are married now but I'm no lawyer.

My wife didn't bring anything into the marriage but I have substantial holdings, a home, etc. that I do not want this felon coming after so I told my wife I think it wise to speak to a lawyer and see what could this felon possibly do to us financially upon his being paroled and what we can do to protect our now shared assets.  

I have no idea what kind of debt this felon racked up during their short marriage but I do not want any part of it.  I have already had to deal with some other things regarding this asshole and I'm not going to let him touch what I have worked my whole life to build up.  Legally, I think it is at least possible, though unlikely, he may have some sort of case against my wife for money and any judgement against her could negatively affect me and my two boys (as well as her two kids).

My wife is upset that I brought this up and thinks I'm overreacting but I do not want to bet everything I have worked for on what I or she thinks this felon may or may not have the legal right to do.  Neither of us are lawyers and I don't want to just sit around and wait for things to happen to us, I want to be prepared for possibilities.

To clarify real quick, I'm a hairstylist, and a mom of a two year old. I normally have no problem with children's haircuts, but this was one that really worked on my nerves.

So this kid was 6, he sits down in my chair to get his haircut. Well while I was talking to his mom about how to cut it, this child jumps put of the chair, runs around to the back where I'm standing, PUSHES ME, and literally stomps on the foot pump of my chair. Which could cause it to break and I cant just get another chair. So I acted without thinking and looked this child in the eyes and said in my scary mom voice ""what do you think you're doing?? You do not have the right to push me out of the way and pump up my chair like it's your own. Do you have the money to pay for a new chair when this one breaks because I don't think you do. You need to go around and sit back down""...

90,Not the A-hole,"We’re going back some years now, to my senior year of high school. The gist is that I lied to my parents about going to prom, lied to get money from them to afford it, and broke explicit rules of the household, and I’m wondering if I was wrong to do so and if I should feel remorseful. 

More background: I am a transman and came out at 15 after hospitalization for mental health reasons. My parents were and are... well. Interesting parents. The full context could fill several posts but of note, after I came out, she started policing my appearance by throwing out or destroying clothing she deemed too masculine (including most of my pants), refused to allow me to cut my hair and *charged* me 50$ for getting a haircut behind her back (hair length before the cut was below my ass, after it was a little above my jaw, I was 17), performed body checks to ensure I shaved everywhere (and yes I do mean everywhere. She made me strip down to Adam’s robe and show her my shaved genitals from 15 on). That’s only a few examples. 

When junior year came around, my mom started gushing about the upcoming prom and how I must be so excited. Not wanting to wear a dress and be photographed more than necessary, I said I didn’t want to go. It was one thing I was able to be firm on— possibly because she was hoping for senior prom? I don’t know, but on this front she didn’t push much. 

I had a bit of a support network through my school— mostly the guidance counselor, some administration and my friends. I was able to scrimp, save, sell my stuff and beg for money from my parents to rent a tux and buy myself a ticket. 

I lied to my mother saying I was just going to spend the night with other students that had opted out of prom and then go to the after prom to hang out with friends and enjoy the experience. So I went to prom in a tux, had a blast, took pictures with friends, did it up. I regret zero seconds of that night. I changed back into girl mode before my mother came to pick me up from the after prom 5am the next morning. 

My downfall was Facebook, where multiple pictures of me were posted to the school website. My mother tore into me. Grounded me and became all the more controlling. Now, I had been feeling just fine about it despite having lied, “stole” money from her, and betrayed her and ruined her chance to take part in a rite of passage... until today. The topic of prom came up in a discussion with several coworkers, and several expressed outright disgust with me for my behavior and lack of remorse and empathy for my parents and extended family (as they would have been able to take before prom pictures as well, apparently.) One coworker (who is friends with my mother) said I should apologize. 

I snapped that “it‘s in the past, you can judge my choices on your own time, and this conversation is over.”

Now though I’m starting to doubt if I really am the selfish one here. It’s one thing for my mother to say it. Another for a group of five otherwise reasonable adults to agree with her.

Here is where my wife and I are having a disagreement. She doesn’t want to mention the cameras at all because if something happens she wants to catch them in the act. So do I, but I also want to *mention* that the nanny will be taped (but obviously not disclose where the cameras are) as a precaution to help prevent anything from happening at all. I don’t see the problem here, but my wife is dead set on wanting to “catch her in the act” of something happens. But why do that if you can take an extra step to help nothing happening at all? I believe that the nanny being aware that she is recorded will help her refrain from rough treatment of our daughter in the event that she’s having one of those “bad days” nannies like to talk about after they are caught.

Sometimes it goes bad, like my grandma turned off her hearing aid so she wouldn't be bothered by the baby crying. But other times it goes fine, and we've got a trusted new sitter.

My BIL and SIL came to visit and wanted to babysit, so we tried the test. They didn't even have the baby for 2 minutes before coming to fetch me for help. I figured that meant they failed for now and just aren't ready to babysit a newborn yet, but we can try again when baby is older.

My BIL ended up heading home early, alone, saying he needed to work. Like a month later my SIL asked my husband why we didn't let them babysit. He told her about the test, and she got mad. SIL then said that we actually failed THEIR test, and that they had counted how many questions we asked them about themselves during the visit, and the answer was zero, so that was why BIL left.

I was thrown- I was sure I'd asked them about their flight, their jobs, a wedding they'd attended that we missed because of the baby- all the usual polite small talk. But we're exhausted, so it's totally possible I didn't. But even so...maybe cut the tired new parents some slack?

97,Not the A-hole,"I was walking to work this morning, and I passed by a convertible that had a soft top, with a clear plastic sun roof on top. All the windows were shut and the convertible top was closed too. I saw a big dog in there, a big hairy dog. Sorry I don't know dog breeds.

The dog was panting really hard, and I was worried, it was like 85 farenheit outside of the car, and I figured the sunroof was making it act like a greenhouse, it was probably way hotter inside. I touched the roof and it was hot as hell.

I looked around and gave a yell ""Who's car is this with the dog"" and couldn't find the owner. So I tried to carefully peel the convertible top down for a few minutes but it wasn't budging. I took out my pocketknife and slit the roof open in a big L shape and as soon as I did that, hot air was rushing out. 

I thought it was worth it to save a dog; car softtops are replaceable. And the dog was very lethargic looking, just laying there panting for air. 

I took my water bottle from my backpack and started giving the dog water, when some dude came walking fast down the street at me, cussing me out. I tried to explain real fast that there was a dog in there, and he said that it was his damn car and his damn dog. All this happened when he was coming towards me. There was something about the way he was yelling and the look on his face, and the aggressive way he was coming towards me that scared the hell out of me. 

I can't explain it completely, but I had a really strong gut feeling that I'd get beat on if he reached me. I'm a small chick, my dad used to have a temper, and I know what it looks like when someone is coming at you with bad intentions. And I know how little chance I stood if I was right. 

So I booked it, and ran the last few blocks to work, which is in a secured building. And only slowed down once the door was locked behind me.

I told my office mates what had happened, and they were kind of questioning me about whether I could have tried harder to find the owner, called 911 instead, not ran when I did.

When she did pass away I was surprised she hadn’t written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn’t go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

Since I wasn’t there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. 

When I got the ring I didn’t examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It’s value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. 

Now, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it’s fair. I didn’t ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?

I didn’t tell anyone. The jeweler mentioned it to my Aunt and it got around to the rest of the family.",1496,20025,0.95
99,Not the A-hole,"AITA... My middle sister and I have never gotten along great but always managed to be mostly civil between arguments, I’m the youngest of 3. I live in the same town as our eldest sister and mom but middle sister lives a few hours away. Six and a half years ago my sister got mad at me for calling her out after she visited the family in town and brought a horrible stomach virus that she gave to everyone. My two kids (at the time 3 and 8) were sick and unable to eat for days. The younger threw up so much she burst blood vessels in her eyes! Upon hearing everyone got sick she was unapologetic and even rude about being called out for her part in it. Shortly after, just as I was going through a separation, she decided to cut me out. Wouldn’t answer calls and texts, unfriended and blocked me on Facebook... right when I needed the support of my family the most. Now here we are all this time later and we haven’t spoken a single word or seen each other since. My mom recently told me that my sisters eldest child was diagnosed with autism (high functioning) and I should “get over whatever was going on between us” because she needs the support of her family. I kindly refused and don’t think I owe her any support in her time of need when that’s exactly what I needed when she cut me out of her life. When we were younger I was always told to “be the bigger person” and move on from all our arguments even if I wasn’t at fault. As an adult I don’t feel like I should have to give in to that anymore and stand my ground for once. Am I being unreasonable?",38,133,0.93

101,Not the A-hole,"So about a week ago my nephew had a baseball game, he's a typical 11 year old who's into Fortnite, minecraft, pewdiepie,and whatever else is popular at the time. His team gets blown out pretty badly, but he's in pretty high spirits afterwards despite that.

So I come up after the game and he's having a good time doing little dances and other 11 year old things with his friends, when he sees me coming over and starts busting my balls like all cocky teenagers who think they're hot shit do. He's acting like he doesn't know me, calling me since weird dude, etc.

Eventually he's like ""Uncle OP, high five!"" and I go to give him a high five and he pulls it back at the last second, does a dab and appropriately tells me to ""get dabbed on!"" This is where I had a ""perfect comeback"" and I lean in and tell him ""Dabbing is for winners."" Him and his dad, who is my brother, have the same reaction and start laughing, telling me ""that's messed up!"" but they seem to be taking it in stride.

A little bit later my sister in law comes up to me, furious, and tells me what I said was completely unacceptable to say that to him after his team had lost so thoroughly, how he's probably super upset that said that, how I could destroy his confidence, and other typical soccer mom stuff. I have to see them again this weekend, and I'm on the fence if should apologize or not. So AITA for giving my nephew a little shit?",38,82,0.91

104,,"First post.

My dad texted me a link to a Q&A on Quora yesterday.  Essentially, the question asked if there was a more elite group than the Navy SEALs that even Navy SEALs wouldn't want to face in combat.  The answer was ""daughters,"" creating an elaborate metaphor that (IMO) painted ""daughters"" as manipulative, combative, and people to be feared.  Phrases included ""most devious and masters at psychological warfare"" and ""have a diabolical effect on any man.""  I told him it felt a bit misogynistic to cast all daughters (and therefore all women) as ""mercenaries"" with this narrative that had a very sarcastic/negative tone.   

He got defensive and responded that it was meant to honor the relationship between fathers and daughters and said I ""read too much into it.""  He also commented, ""I guess I need to adapt a PC tone when I communicate with you.""  I kinda kinda feel like TA since I believe he was *trying* to send me a nice message about the power of father-daughter relationships.  On the other hand, I *really* felt compelled to explain how that metaphor was sexist and offensive to me.  I   
 tried to keep the tone light, but my response wasn't well received.  We reconciled in the end and he agreed to ""do better.""  But, AITA for calling my dad sexist over a nice gesture?

Edit: I think y’all confirmed what I feared. I overreacted and owe him an apology. I will do so in the morning. I stand by my opinion of the piece (the sexism is subtle, but apparent to me). However, my timing, approach, and disregard for his well-meaning intentions were crappy.",46,46,0.84
105,Asshole,"This is going to sound really petty, and maybe it is really petty, so please tell me if I'd be TA for this.

My sister is a couple years older than I, we're both in our late 20s. Our parents raised us in a low/middle income environment, so we didn't come from much growing up. We both got jobs in the careers we studied for, found suitable partners who also have good work. Her husband is a software developer like her. Like us, they've lived in a condo for years and been saving money for a home. I've never asked how much they make and vice versa but it's always been obvious they must make a bit more, now I know it's A LOT more.

My sister and I have always split our parents' Christmas, birthday, and all else presents. If we buy a $500 gift for example (like jewelry), we split it $250 each, sometimes it's a lot on my end but I don't mind because our parents are wonderful. It's worth mentioning that I always do all of the work as well - idea, buying, packaging gift, she just sends the money.

Earlier this year, my sister and her fiance purchased a home in the city for $4 million with a down payment of over 500k ... meanwhile my husband and I are still trying to save for a down payment that's WAY less than that.

While of course I was incredibly happy for them, helped them move in, bought them a new home present, etc., it obviously shocked myself (and everyone in our family) to the core. This is a couple who has denied coming out to dinner because they ""don't have enough money"" so knowing they can afford a home like that and the down payment is absolutely crazy.

Anyways, fast forward to now and our mom's birthday is coming up.. My sister messages me asking what we should get this year and I just don't feel comfortable anymore doing this, splitting on the cost like we're equals.

I know we're equal to our parents, but IMO it just seems weird now asking me to do all the work and pay half when my sister knows I'm making so much less than her. Not to mention that now that everyone knows they're millionaires, she could do some of her own work and buy her own gifts?

WIBTA if I asked my sister to break this tradition? It's been years but I think my parents would understand, especially because I've heard plenty of members in our family whispering / talking about how much money my sister and her fiance make and why they acted like they didn't before type thing (nothing terrible).

TL;DR: Found out my sister is a millionaire, I no longer want to continue splitting on the tradition of buying our parents gifts together because it makes me feel uncomfortable, am I being petty?",233,437,0.94
106,Everyone Sucks,"I recently moved into my dorm for college and I've made some friends on my floor. One of them being a guy that I got really close to. He confessed to me that he's gay, but is still very much in the closet. He said I'm the only one on campus that knows the truth. He recently started dating another girl on our floor. I asked him about it and he said that he had no romantic or sexual feelings for her and that she made the first move and he just went along with it. They've been together for a week, but already are using boyfriend/girlfriend. She has no idea that he's gay and he said he has no plan to tell her. He told me that they've only made out so far, but he ""was totally soft"" the whole time. I asked him what happens when stuff gets more intense he said he'll fake it or say he's nervous or something. He said he plans on just waiting until she breaks up with him. I told him he should break up with her, but he said he's not going to. I feel like she should know that her boyfriend is gay, but I don't want to betray my friend's trust. So, WIBTA if I told her that her boyfriend is actually gay?

107,Not the A-hole,"So I was at work recently, and while I was at work my roommate Deanna let my dog out and she got hit by a car. The vet bills ended up totalling close to $5000. 

Money has already been very tight for me, and I originally moved in to this place to save money as it was too expensive to live on my own. I’m a university student going into my last year, and I have absolutely no financial support from my family.

Deanna’s boyfriend Cameron (also a roommate) offered to front the vet bills for me, which I am obviously forever grateful for. I told him I would pay him back, however the more I think about it, the more conflicted I get on the whole situation.

1.	Deanna didn’t apologize or offer to help out with costs.
2.	We live in a rental house in which Deanna and Cameron don’t pay any rent as they over charge myself and the other two roommates. 
3.	The day my dog came home she had to be crated while I was at work (to avoid playing with the cats as she was not allowed to be physical at the time). When I left, she started barking, and Cameron absolutely went off on me completely out of the blue because she woke him up half an hour early. 
4.	He has now been holding the vet bills over my head, and it’s only been two weeks. When he went off on me, I called him out for being out of line, and he was making ridiculous demands Ann’s insulting me while capping it off with “when are you going to pay me back for the vet”.
5.	I’m having to uproot my whole life to work more and take a lesser course load to make ends meet because of this.

If it was me who carelessly let one of their animals out, and they got hit by a car, I would be apologizing non-stop and offering to help out in anyway.

So would I be an asshole if I paid half the vet bills and told him to collect the rest from his girlfriend?

Alternatively would I be an asshole to tell him to kick rocks and I’ll pay him when I’m done school (so I can graduate on time)?

Edit: more context on whether she was trying to help care for the dog. She claims that a door to door salesman was trying to force his way inside and the dog got out. However, Deanna is quite deceitful and I believe it’s more likely that she carelessly opened the door or left it open.

I take care of my dog, and I allow the roommates to walk her if I can’t, but in those cases I always let them know and/or ask for extra help.

108,Not the A-hole,"My mom has been guilt tripping me about me only letting my 7 year old son stay with her on average one weekend per month. We also come to her house for dinner one seperate day per month and usually some sort of holiday or birthday occurs which equals another 1-2 days of seeing her. 

She's stated that she believes I should ""split the weekends"" with her. I think this is utterly ridiculous.  I like seeing my son on the weekends too. She also is not satisfied with keeping him for a few hours during the day or with us doing an outing as a family. It MUST be him only and overnight at least, shes usually mad if she doesn't get him Friday-Sunday night.

109,Asshole,"This happened about a year ago but it’s still something that bothers me. My bf of 4 years passed away last June. I loved him more than anything and still don’t see myself ever being with anyone ever again. 

But the circumstances of us getting together was not great. He actually cheated on his gf of over 2 years with me. At the time I had no idea he had a gf and we slept together after meeting at a bar and he told me the next day. I was sad and felt awful and told him I didn’t want to see him again. He broke up with his gf that day and for 6 months did anything and everything to prove himself to me. He really wore me down and I fell in love with him.

When he passed it was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. I couldn’t get out of bed for months and I still struggle to even do daily tasks without him. 

It took us about a month to finally have his funeral. But a few days before I got a message on Facebook from his ex. She wanted to know if she was welcome to come. I was polite but told her I didn’t think it was appropriate and I didn’t know if I could handle it. She just said ok. 

The day of the funeral she showed up anyway. When I saw her I have no clue why but I lost it. I asked her what gave her the nerve and she started yelling at me. She called me a home wrecker and a monster and I was making his death all about me. It got nasty pretty quick and it took my BFs cousin and brother escorting her out and making sure she left to make everyone calm down. 

After having a lot of time to sit and think I realized I was probably too harsh but what she said to me made me consider otherwise. I still have no clue if I was wrong in that situation. I don’t think my BF would have wanted me to stop his ex from getting closure but he also wouldn’t want me to feel uncomfortable in a situation I was already suffering in...

He pisses everywhere in the bathroom that we have to share (unless I want to walk a long ways) and it’s driving me nuts. He doesn’t clean it up either. I walk into the bathroom and step in his pee at least once a week. He always says when I bring it up that sometimes he gets up in the middle of the night to pee and that it’s normal for guys to pee on the floor or seat even in the day and I can’t possibly get mad at him for doing it in the night. I told him I thought this was ridiculous and he said because I’m a woman I wouldn’t have any idea. 

Now he seems furious at me for even bringing it up and the problem is still not fixed. I’m sorry, but I think it’s disgusting. He counters when I say this that saying that my losing hair is disgusting (like just hair out of my head around the place, I can’t always catch it but if I see a hair I throw it away) but he never complains about the hair so neither should I about the urine.

However when my wife got pregnant she started talking about how she wanted a home birth and how she has a friend who did it and her friend recommended it.

112,Asshole,"Hi all. I'm aware of the rule against relationship posts but this is about a specific disagreement so I hope it's okay.

Two years ago I made the worst decision of my life, drank too much at a party and fooled around with a neighbor of ours. No sex, but close to it. He tried his luck after that, but me and my fiance put a stop to it. My now-fiance nearly left me, it took a lot of effort on my part to win his trust back and thankfully we're still together. One of his conditions was I needed to cut all communication with this person, which is very fair and I've done, until now.

This neighbor lives at the top of our steep hill. He rides his bike down it to do his errands. I was sitting near the window yesterday when I hear that gravel scraping sound, and looked up in time to see our neighbor coming down the hill wipe out on his bike come over the handlebars and tumble hard about 15 feet, stopping about 2 houses up from us on the ground. 

He turned over and pulled himself to the curb quickly, so I knew he was ok, but his arm was visibly broken and he had a cut on his chin. I watched and waited in the window and no one came out of their house to help him, so I opened the door and called to him and told him to come over. 

He managed to make it to the step, and I asked him if he was alright and told him I'd call an ambulance. He said he'd call a friend to take him to the hospital instead and asked if I had a cloth and water, so I told him he could wait on a kitchen chair in the house while I got what he needed and his drive came. I helped him to a chair and spent a few minutes trying to help him pick pebbles out of his knee when my fiance came home from the store.

He was angry. He took the glass of water from our neighbor and kicked him out, and told me to leave with him. I tried explaining what happened and it only made him more angry. His view is that I seen that the neighbor was conscious and aware, that he was healthy enough to turn down an ambulance so it wasn't necessary he needed my help. He then said that it's not my duty to help the guy, and that my promise to him should have been more important than wanting to help the neighbor with a not life threatening injury. He was also mad that I let him in, when we have chairs on the porch outside I could have sat him on.

He's not as hostile anymore, but still won't speak to me normally. He tells me that he feels like I prioritized this guy over my promise to him, and said that if he ever cheated on me and I decided to forgive him, he would never take a chance on losing me so he could help the other woman ""with an ouchie."" For what it's worth, my fiance is absolutely wonderful, patient and understanding. He never sets ultimatums or gets mad at me aside from this issue.

I see his point. He wasn't that injured, he had a broken arm and a cut, and walked fine. I was honestly just trying to be helpful and didn't think about it. I don't know if I'm the asshole here, or just messed up.",104,81,0.83
113,Not the A-hole,"A few years back a buddy of mine is throwing his Dirty Thirty. The plan is to pre-drink at his place, head to the bar/club where we have reservations and then back to their place for chillin'. There's about a dozen of us going, some married couples, some dating couples and 3 single guys, myself included. We all get annihilated.

About 8 of us cab back to the house and after 15 mins of basically not doing anything I say, alright, what about the hot tub? Unanimous nah, but I ask the homeowner/birthday boy if it's ok if I still go and he says it's fine.

I go upstairs to grab a towel and get changed when I realise I have no suit and the boxers I'm wearing would get ruined, they were really nice fabric. So, in my drunken state I say fuck it, no one else is going in so I'll just go nude. I can hear everyone else has gone down to the basement as I walk out to the hot tub in the back yard.

Flash forward 10 mins when I hear the sliding door open and see everyone now wearing bathing suits... Oh shit. 

As they're approaching the hot tub I say, ""Uhh hey guys? I didn't think anyone else was coming so I'm uhh, kinda naked in here..."" 
They all laugh and think I'm joking. 
""No. Seriously. I'm naked right now. Can you guys turn around while I get out and get my towel?""
They continue to think I'm joking and proceed to get in: 1 married couple, 1 married woman whose husband went home after the bar, 1 dating couple and 1 of the other single guys.
Immediately I curl up, knees together, hands on my lap to hide my shame.

Flash forward another 10 mins or so when the woman of the dating couple now has it in her head that I'm lying and is her new mission to prove I'm not naked, which I adamantally assure her many times I am and wish to fuck I wasn't. Before I can react, she hops off her boyfriends lap and reaching into mine and grabs my quite actually naked penis.

The look on her face clearly lets everyone know, yes, I am indeed not wearing a suit.

After a bit of disgust from the party for me to get out, they realise I can't leave the tub without them seeing me. Everyone gets out and leaves me wishing this was a hot tub time machine. After I'm able to get dressed, I call a cab and go home. 

A few weeks go by before the hot tub owner confesses to me that everyone is super pissed at me for what I did at the party. That after I left he had to stop the dating couples boyfriend from wanting to kicking my ass and that after the lone married woman's husband found out, he wanted to kick my ass. Even he himself was pissed at me for being nude in his hot tub.

In my eyes: 
- I was not expecting anyone else to be in there with me.
- Before they came in I tried to avoid the situation which was not heeded.
- Once everyone was in the hot tub, I literally turtled to make the best of a bad situation.

115,No A-holes here,"I'm a divorced father.  I pay for a 3 bedroom apartment.  For years, my son had 1 room, I had another, and the 3rd room was storage for all my divorce junk.  I eventually met someone, we began dating.  However, we were an unusual couple -- she's in her 20s and I'm in my 40s.  She has social anxiety, so she was VERY nervous about anyone knowing we were dating.  She feared being mocked or people making ageist comments.  After about a year she became more comfortable, and she brought me to her work.  One of her co-workers was positively wonderful and non-judgmental.  She hugged me, asked us to hang out for a meal, and was generally nice.  This simple gesture of kindness propelled her from co-worker to my girl's best friend.

Or, only friend.  My gf is so socially nervous that she has an extremely difficult time making friends.  So this girl was IT.  They did a lot of stuff together.

When this girl announced that she had to move out of the area because she couldn't afford a place, I did not like that.  My girlfriend was about to lose her only friend, and was freaking out about it.  So I offered to clear out my 3rd room, and charge this girl minimal rent.  This got me in trouble with the landlord, because I had no idea that I had to clear this with him.  But he was cool, because he raised the rent.  Blah.  Whatever.  It worked out.

Fast forward 2 years. This girl has been contributing $400/month rent, in the middle of Silicon Valley.  And she has become a HUGE DICK to my girlfriend.  She rolls her eyes when my girl is nervous.  When she wants a smoke break out on the porch she will ask my gf to leave the area so she can smoke in peace.  She talks shit about my girl to her co-workers -- the only saving grace here is that my girlfriend quit the job a while ago.  I recently sat down with my ""roommate"" to talk about this.  It turns out, my girlfriend just exasperates this girl.  She's *done* with the nerves and the anxiety and all that.

I've spent the last couple of months consoling my gf because she's lost her only friend.  She is starting to not want to come around.  She says it's uncomfortable to be in the apartment now, and the tension makes her feel like she's going to puke.

Well... the roommate is not on a lease.  She pays monthly.  The moment I kick her out, she's going to be on her worst behavior, and she's probably going to have to leave the area entirely.  She's going to be quite upset.  She'll accuse me of kicking out a perfectly good tenant because of an overbearing girlfriend.

I don't want to run afoul of any tenant laws.  I'm not the landlord, but this girl is here only by my hand.  I'm not sure if I have the authority to kick her out, but I want to try.  Will I be the asshole?  And if I am the asshole, am I the ""violated laws"" kind of asshole or the ""only douchebags kick someone out over a girlfriend"" kind of asshole?

**EDIT:** Some helpful info that I've learned in the past few hours, for anyone still reading.  First, I've talked with a friend who is a landlord (but is not MY landlord) and he agrees with people here that I need to give her 60 days notice, but he also said that she can appeal that.  He urged me to give **90** days notice, because that length of time usually is so long that the courts will adhere to it, not allow appeals, etc.  I'm not in a rush, so I think I will do 90 days.  I agree with everyone that *I become the asshole* if I try to kick her out without notice.

Second thing: *I have no idea what she is, in terms of tenancy.*  I was on a lease for a year, and now pay month-to-month (and have for about 8 years).  She came to live here *and I didn't tell my landlord* because I had no idea I was supposed to do so.  He found out and got mad, but then he got to meet her, and was completely placated by charging extra rent.  He has her name on a form that lists the people living in my apartment (it also has my son's name) but other than that she has signed no lease, no contract.

Third thing: I collect her rent and made the agreement with her about when to pay and use of shared spaces, etc.  This was done over text messages, as we sat with each other.  We could have talked, but the idea was to have an agreement quickly put into ""writing.""  It was very low-tech and almost certainly has no legal authority, but it was an agreement that we could both refer to.

The point is, I do not know what her legal tenancy is, but my landlord has her name, I collect her rent, and I hashed out our living arrangement.

Oh, also, a fourth thing: my girlfriend doesn't live here.  She has her own place.  She used to come over 2 or 3 nights a week.  She now comes over 1 night/week, tops.",88,244,0.93
116,Not the A-hole,"I commissioned a piece of work from an artist through IG a few months ago. It’s for my boyfriends birthday and it’s one of his favorite artists. I paid a $400 fee to have him even start the project and will be paying the rest of the money once it’s finished. 
About a month ago I got a message from the artist with a photo of the work, which was about 1/2 done but was looking completely off what I had described for the piece.
I mentioned it to him (by sending a screenshot of the original message) and he apologized, saying he had been so busy and accidentally mixed up some projects. He said no problem, it’d be easy to restart.
He recently sent me a photo of the finished piece, and it’s still not what I asked for!
I feel weird when I think about telling him it’s wrong again and trying to get him to correct it. But I don’t want to pay for a piece that I didn’t ask for. I WANT his work but I want it to be what I requested.

I didn’t mention previously that he ALREADY sent me the work without sending me a photo of the final draft. I really appreciate everyone taking time to respond and help me out. I’ll live with whatever ends up happening and eventually I will be able to laugh at all the road bumps.

FINAL UPDATE:
A few people are curious about how this played out. [his final solution to the issue](https://imgur.com/a/iEhL1TM) He’s offering to make me the originally planned piece for no extra cost, but is about to go do a few shows, so there’s no timeline expectations. Not holding my breath but I’ll be pleasantly surprised if he makes the original idea eventually.",194,1289,0.97

She seemed to take offense, saying I only like her for her looks. My reply was that yeah I approached her for her looks but continued talking because I enjoyed her company. I really don't see the issue. You're lying if you tell me the reason you took interest in someone wasn't because you're attracted to them.

118,Not the A-hole,"I went out to eat a sushi place that instead of ordering food, a conveyor belt brings around small sushi plates to all tables, when you see one you like- grab one, eat, and put it in a plate dispenser also at your table. You are charged by the plate.

We rarely interacted with a server except for seating, and bringing the paper check to us and both were separate people. There is even an tablet like device at your table that you can use to order drinks, special roll, miso soup, and signal for the check. I did order a miso soup and it was brought out by the secondary belt without a human direct to the table.

Our bill was ~65 dollars, and I tipped 5 about a 7.7%

I personally have always had a peeve that if I can tell you whom is our server is, I generally tip less because I don't know who I am tipping or for what/who. Though I have not used this rule in many years due to rarely eating out or having a dedicated server which I tip always between 15-20%. My wife said I was jerk for our tip afterwards which surprised me.

119,Everyone Sucks,"Me and my gf both smoke a lot of weed. But shes home more hours of the day and I feel like she smokes a lot more than me. But I am the one to pay for the weed everytime, as i make more money.

Normally we get normal marijuana bud from our dealer but sometimes we get a vape cartridge too. Much more powerful and convenient to smoke. So when we get a cart, it usually only lasts a few days. I feel like since I smoke way less, I could make a cart of my own last way way longer.

So what I did was I picked up a quarter ounce of bud and a cartridge. I want to let my gf smoke out of the quarter while I keep the cart hidden for myself. I would not smoke out of the quarter except when we smoke together which isn't that often due to our work schedules.

I feel like an ass for hiding it from her but I'd also feel like an ass telling her that I got the cart for myself and I dont want to share. So what's the less ass thing to do?",67,29,0.83
120,Not the A-hole,"My bf has been meditating regularly lately and apparently has decided it would be a great thing for me to do too. Two days ago he asked me to meditate instead of redditing, and I said no. I was relaxing already and enjoying it. 

At this point he decides to just keep pushing me to meditate with him. I start getting annoyed that he won't accept my no. He starts bartering. He'll clean the bathroom if I meditate. I say he could clean it anyway. I'm finally so fed up with him pushing that I angrily agree and we sit and listen to an annoying meditation video. 

Fast forward to this morning. I get home from work and he says he wants to talk about it. How it is obvious that his feelings don't matter, that I disregarded how important it was to him and that he put a lot of thought into thinking I would enjoy meditation. Maybe I would, but I don't appreciate being basically forced to do it and then being told that I was childish because I didn't care that it was important to him.

I said ""i'm 5'11, and you're almost shorter then me"", and he got pissed. He had offered to buy me a drink,but just took it when the bartender brought it, and left me there.

So I got pissed, since he was cute, and things were going well I thought, and went over to my friends. instead of backing me up they defended HIM and said ""you never fuck with a mans's height"", and that I was being rude. One dude even said I was being entitled for still wanting to talk and have that drink, but maybe I'll own that one. A big maybe though.

122,Not the A-hole,"So I have been renting an Airbnb apartment for five weeks and I am coming up on the end of my reservation. I was *NOT* told when booking that because they’re trying to sell the property, they would have people randomly coming to see it.

 I really hate confrontation so at first I just passively let them visit until finally, one showed up without any notice. I was pretty furious. I texted my host letting him know I didn’t want *anyone* coming for the duration of my stay. He called me later saying he understood and wouldn’t have anyone else come visit when I am home. I caught him and once again clarified that I don’t want anyone coming *ever*. Not just when I am not home. I have a small kitten with me and I don’t want her getting out. We left it at that.

Two weeks go by and it was fine, but today I woke up to him saying people will be coming to visit today *and* tomorrow and I immediately texted back as soon as I woke up that under no circumstances were they to come visit since I had let him know I didn’t want anymore visits two weeks prior.

He hasn’t gotten back to me and I think it’s a tactic to still have me let people in but I am not budging.

WIBTA if I locked the door from the inside (chain lock) and didn’t let them come in?

EDIT: I contacted airbnb and they said I am
completely within my legal rights to refuse entry to the property. The only time someone would be allowed in is if the host *requests* to come fix something that I have told them is broken, and even then I can still say no.",187,2751,0.97

124,No A-holes here,"This is a relatively short 'Am I The Asshole' query, mostly because my spouse and I disagree on the appropriate way to handle door to door salesmen. That is, the people who go door to door to try and sell house siding, windows, bug removal services and so forth.

&#x200B;

My take on the situation is thus: I don't have unannounced visitors. Everyone who knows me or wants to come visit my family realizes they must call ahead of time, since I do have foster children coming through and its my responsibility to keep them safe. When someone rings the doorbell and I wasn't expecting a visitor, nine times out of ten it is someone trying to sell me things.

&#x200B;

I am not interested. I have never been interested in my decades of owning a house. There is nothing that could be sold to me on my front door that I would happily spend time going over while my children are going crazy without supervision. In addition, I'm either home after work - so I'm already tired - or it's my day off. After a first few years of this I started keeping a box of cheap water bottles near the door, so I usually grab one on my way past if it's a hot day.

&#x200B;

I'll open the door, verify it's a sales-person, hand them a bottle of water and say that I'm not interested after initial introductions. If they continue to talk, I'll close the door without further word and go about my day. I'm not here to waste their time, and I'm certainly not going to let them waste my time. I get they have a job to do, I try to be polite as I can, and I'll even give them water to help cool them down on their way to the next house.

&#x200B;

But I'm not interested.

&#x200B;

My spouse, on the other hand, has berated me constantly about coming off as a cold hearted asshole. That I should stand out in the hundred plus degree heat or the negative ten degree chill and let them talk at me while I continually say that I'm not interested, I don't care about their pamphlets, and I don't want a quote or a call back. My point is, again: It's a waste of time for them and me, and frankly they are better off moving on with my best wishes (And a bottle of water on hot days). If they've got a quota to meet then they're burning time with me. It's being cruel to be kind.

At that point, my emotions got the better of me, and I said ""well when you say it like that, yes."" Then I left.

127,Asshole,"thraway for obv reasons

I grew up with my parents putting their used TP in the trash because we never bought toilet paper, we just used paper towels and since they are so thick, we'd trash em, so naturally I've always kept a small trash can beside my toilet.

Recently, I have moved in with my best friend into a dorm at uni, we have one bathroom and as you can probably already tell, this is where the problem starts.

My friend is absolutely disgusted by my tp habits and its the number 1 thing that we fight about daily. I try to understand the mentality of putting tp in the garbage 'gross' but its just so normal to me. I have a special can that I use to throw it out so that it conceals the smell, but its just the idea of it being in the washroom that pisses him off. He goes around telling people about what I do as a joke, people laugh, and whenever I ask him why he does it, he tells me to ""chill, its just a joke"". If its so funny, and not something he takes serious, why should I stop then?

My parents and his parents are really tight, and since we are better off then his family, we helped pay his tuition and chipped in a little extra so that he can live on campus.

Im 100% certain he would be complaining more if we didn't help him out financially.

AITA for putting used TP in the trash? The thing is, im fully prepared to stop even if hes being a real jerk about telling people about my habits. I honestly dont see how gross it is, but like i said im fully prepared to stop if it truly is THAT disgusting. It really does feel like second nature to me, so sorry if I seem really oblivious.

**Update**\- based off of how grossed out the majority of people have reacted to my habit, I can see im the asshole LOL,I just wanted to add that I wasnt trying to justify why I should keep on doing it, I just was wondering if it was that gross.. which i guess I can see must be really freaking disgusting.

129,No A-holes here,"Throwaway because I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole in the situation.

I dated ""Sara"" from 2014 to 2016 (just under 2 years total). Looking back on it, she was emotionally abusive, and absolutely manipulative. To keep things short: she treated me poorly and I was a doormat. I learned a ton from that experience, and have since reflected on that relationship as a period where I emerged with serious personal growth and  much more self respect.

The relationship ended when she cheated on me. She broke up with me, and I literally never saw her again. Immediately after the breakup, I blocked her on EVERYTHING, deleted pictures, etc. The relationship was a mess and that's how I decided to move on. I literally haven't even seen a picture of her since the day we broke up. 

So, fast forward to today, 3+ years since we broke up. I get a call from an unknown number. Normally I wouldn't answer, but I'm waiting to hear back from some job applications, so answered. To my surprise, it was Sara's mom. 

I was confused, but politely asked her why she was contacting me. She goes on to inform me that Sara was killed in a car accident a few days prior, and that she was letting me know. She said that Sara's funeral would be in a few days and told me where it is being held. 

I told her that I am so sorry for her loss. I offered my condolences, but told her I wouldn't be attending the funeral. She got very upset and asked me why. I told her that our relationship didn't end well, and that it felt inappropriate overall. 

Her mom got increasingly upset, and said that she was hoping I'd say a few words at her funeral. I was shocked. I asked if she knew why we had broken up. Apparently, Sara had told her family that I had gotten a job elsewhere and we ended things amicably, and that she thought we remained in touch. I informed her that we broke up because she had cheated on me, and that I hadn't spoken to her in years. I kept trying to end the call, but she was very upset and I felt horrible; she had just lost her daughter. I was very uncomfortable and said something I shouldn't have. After a minute or two more of back and forth, I said ""Look, I didn't have anything nice to say about her when she was alive, and I don't have anything nice to say about her now. I won't be attending."" 

I realize how insensitive that was, but I didn't know how else to convey what I was feeling. I'm not happy she's dead, I'd never wish that on anyone. But the fact of the matter is, her death didn't make me feel good or bad. It has no impact on my life at all. 

I've been getting messages from some of her friends (who I also haven't spoken to in years) because apparently her mom is now telling people I'm shit-talking her dead daughter. They aren't part of my social circle so there's really no backlash, but it didn't feel great to read their messages. I absolutely won't be going to the funeral, but I'm wondering if I should reach out and apologize to her mom.",710,5203,0.97

131,Not the A-hole,"I feel like a bad friend. 

A close friend called me last night, asked if I could hang out with him, that he needed me. He came over to my office and we talked out on the balcony for a long while. 


He was very quiet at first, but then expressed through tears that he was in a very dire situation financially, that his small business was failing, that he felt like a total failure.


He revealed that his wife can never know about the finances, this happened between them in the past and it would mean the end of the marriage. He can never accept being a failure again to his wife and kids. He has $50 to his name and his wife thinks things are fine.


After trying to understand where he was, he began expressing high degrees in confidence about his business, his frustrations, strengths, problems, etc. And then it came... He just needs $10,000 to make this thing work. Someone to buy into it. 


I felt, used at first. Like, was everything actually said just because he needed $10k? I have $10k to lend, he also knows I do, but it didn't feel right. Were all the emotions genuine? Is this for real, or was this pure manipulation? 


Especially after the last thought, I felt highly judgmental and frustrated with myself. I've never experienced a situation like this before.

After a bit of thought... I said no.


We hung out for another hour. I could tell he was disappointed. The mood was different. I tried to offer my experience with business, marketing, being real with my spouse through good times and hard times. I feel unsure that any of it mattered.  He was looking for a lifeboat, and I let him sink.


My struggle is, if a good friend comes to me, is it my obligation at some level to just be there for them? If $10,000 is the ask, and it's not a large financial strain, and I am the lifeboat, so be it -- no questions asked. But I did ask, I went deeper, I didn't like what I heard or felt, and I told him no.

133,Everyone Sucks,"I am not a morning person. I have been grumpy in the morning my entire life. I do not want to talk about anything important or have any kind of small talk in the morning. I will answer yes or no questions, but that’s about it. My parents know this and we spent mornings together in silence growing up. My husband has known this since we met but refuses to accept it. He is incredibly perky in the morning and wants to talk about anything and everything. We both were working jobs where we set our start times. I purposely get up and out of the house before he’s awake to avoid him and his cheery-ness and prevent any unnecessary fights because I know I’ll be fine in a little bit. 

I’m off today but was woken up at 6:15 by our one year old. Great, that’s when he gets ready for work 😕 So he tries talking to me, I don’t even remember at this point what it was about. But I gave my short answers that he thinks is rude and that warrants a conversation about how I am in the morning. I said something about I’m not a morning person and you’ve known this for four years. But that’s not good enough for him so I get told that I “don’t get to talk to [him] this way.” And he decides this is the time to talk about how I need to change who I am in the morning. So I said “Fuck off and leave” because that is the worst time for me to have any kind of serious conversation. He again told me I don’t get to talk to him that way and has continued texting me all morning from work about how my behavior is unacceptable. And, even though I’ve sent him articles explaining the concept of “not a morning person,” he continues to tell me it’s not okay and needs to change. I think he’s the asshole for not accepting something because it’s different than his ways and telling me I have to change. He thinks I’m as asshole for how I speak to him in the morning. 

So, AITA for telling my husband to “fuck off and leave”?",1447,3633,0.9
134,Asshole,"Sorry for any mistakes and formatting I‘m not speaking english natively and I‘m on mobile currently.

So I‘m on a 3 hour train ride and a woman sat next to me. I‘m listening to my music on almost max volume to not get disturbed by ambient noise of people talking, working and not to hear the baby in the back of the wagon.

The woman who sat next to me asked me if I could turn down the volume of my headphones because she can‘t focus on reading. I said yes sure and turned it down by like 2-3 dots on the iPhone Volume if you know what I mean. 5 min later she asks me if I can turn them down more but I‘m already putting up with ambient noise coming through so I said sorry but no as otherwise I wouldn’t be able to enjoy my music and it’s 2 hours left on the ride.

Here I may have been the asshole but idk, that’s why I‘m here. She asked me if I could move seats to a free seat 4 rows ahead so she can read in peace. I told here no, I paid for reservation and my App put the train as almost fully booked out and there were 2 more stops to go so 100% there would’ve been another person who reserved that free seat later on. 


She told me that it’s rude not consider other people especially because she‘s older and sensitive to „loud“ sounds (I guess she‘s in her mid to late 50). I took my headphones out to see if I’m disturbing others,and literally no one was paying attention. People were talking, watching movies, working etc. 

I told here that there is a special wagon called „Ruhewagen (quiet wagon)“ here in this train and she could‘ve booked a seat there. I specially booked a seat in a part of the train where you have better reception for work etc. and don’t have it keep quiet. 

She told me she didn’t have a reservation so she took the first seat she saw and didn’t want to risk not finding another place to sit, she began looking irritated but until now we were both talking calmly.

I didn’t want to cause a huge scene so I said, tough luck basically put my headphones back on and turned them up to blend out ambient noises again. She looked pissed off until she got off.


I was raised to accommodate other people’s needs and just be aware of my surrounding that’s why I‘m feeling conflicted with what I did but when her attitude changed I just didn’t want to further talk to her so I turned away and turned up my music again.

AITA?

EDIT: I was able to hear people talking on their phone through my music and she wasn‘t complaining about them...

**EDIT 2 PLEASE READ:**

So I get that IATA for playing music at a loud volume and not turning it down right away when she sat down, but as stated above I turned it down to the point I was able to pick up on other people conversations. I‘m not trying to sound entitled or what ever so please do me a favor and help me address this few bullet points to make me handle it better in the future, this are also the points where I think it doesn’t make me TA:

- I paid for a seat in an area where there isn’t much of a problem with reasonable noise levels i.e. talking, watching a movie on low volume without headsets etc. at least that’s what I was experiencing in that situation. It was also super busy.

- When she told me to turn it down I did to 1 bar above the middle of my iPhone volume box to give a reference and she apparently was still annoyed at it. With that volume level I was already able hear everything myself already so what do I do?

- She asked me to move to another seat if she could’ve moved there herself. She didn’t reserve her seat next to me.

- There are designated quiet spots in the train she could’ve went to. Nothing around us apparently annoyed her but my headphones. She was the only one annoyed by them and people around us were noisier by a lot than my headphones could ever be.

At that point what do I do? Do I just take out my headphones to appease that one person? It‘s public transportation after all, I also get mildly irritated sometimes but then I should’ve just taken the car. It was a very busy train ride. 

What would you have done in that situation to avoid being an AH?",632,846,0.89
135,Not the A-hole,"My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. 

Apparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.

I hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.

In the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.
I hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. 

Anyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.
He is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. 

He says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

WIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?

Also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

Edit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
Just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

Fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

This past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.

He's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

I know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

If I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. 

His main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. 

And I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
So far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx

Edit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
Leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",3836,17325,0.9
136,Asshole,"Obviously I can't post the entire story here because of the character limit but I first heard of it almost 6 years ago and ive seen it pop up in various other places from time to time. The story goes that a group of women (the ""large and in charge club"" first clue it's so fake) is eating at the Cheesecake Factory and one of thier doctors comes up to the author and fat shames her by comparing her to his ""beautiful"" wife. Author runs out of the store and out comes a hot muscular waiter with a slice of cheesecake with a heart drawn in chocolate sauce just for her. Yeah, obvious bullshit.

My sister is 17, boy crazy (I'm 21, and know all too well about being buy crazy) but seriously struggles with her weight. My dad tries to get her to eat healthy and exercise, my mom tells her she has her genes and accept who she is. I try not to get involved. 

So anyways my sister shared a pic of the story above on her Instagram with the quote ""who's tryna be like dat wit me? Fuck dat Doctor."" Amazingly, she got like an incredible amount of likes and a decent discussion about how all doctors are evil and several were going to go to Cheesecake Factory and try to find a similar waiter...with lots of pictures of eggplants. 

I couldn't help myself and commented that the story was so fake, doctors aren't evil and thier eggplant thing isn't as clever are inside as she thought. Sister deleted the post which I thought maybe she realized how silly it was. Not even an hour later my mom called screeching at me that I had ruined my sisters day, I can't go on her social media anymore, that I had no idea if the story is fake or not and I can't call out my sister for what she finds inspirational.

Reasons mostly to do with my mother, always tried to get involved in my relationship with husband (wern't married with 1st child), tried to convince me he'd break up with me.
Spread untrue malicious lies about husband, kept trying to get inside my head and make me think I was veing controlled by him. Refused to accept I didn't want her at the birth kept trying to convince me it was his decision and not mine and eventually backed down when I yelled at her, this went on for 4 or 5 months, I ended up starting to ignore calls from her.

She doesn't call or text unless she wants something, only turns up to be a 'show mum' and to get gossip about us. Nothing is discrete with her. 1st pregnancy I asked her to keep hush, everything with her goes on facebook, even private information. She told anyone who'd listen, I had strangers congratulating me in the street and she yelled at me saying she had the right to tell whoever.

Recently had a little get together at our new place for my dad's birthday (2 days after mine, no calls off anyone on my bday, just my dad late at night) house got trashed, cigarette ends thrown all over our drive and neighbours drive. Massive argument followed days later and husband told he wasn't part of the family. He's done so much to help my family to never be thanked or have it thrown back in his face. 

A week or so after, I was getting calls asking for favours from family for husband to drive them places or help with stuff.

She's called the police on me once because she tried to hit me and I dared her to do it again. (She's not the fragile, old lady type. She legit reminds me of that ""country girl"" lady who got tazed by police)

So she's the type that doesn't mind putting her own family in jail if it means she comes out on top.

After she threw my mom out a month or so prior, I pretty much stayed and helped my mom out financially that month, since she was practically living in her car. I'm broke all the time but things are starting to look up...

Only she wants her electric money, even though I haven't used any electricity in the house because I'm always away now, helping my mom get stable.

All my animals have been dead for 5 years- I’m finally at a place where I can financially stable enough to take care of someone new. My fiancé was all for getting a pet at first, but the more serious it got the more she seemed to not be a fan. She makes up weird excuses like “well we can’t just buy a cat if we don’t buy a litter box” (this is a reasonable statement, but after the first time of saying “yeah obviously” she still brings it up often) and “what if it dies?” “What if my pets kill it?” (For reference: we visit her family twice a year, so she sees her pets twice a year. )


So finally yesterday she reveals to me that if we get a cat she would be betraying her family pets. And it wouldn’t be fair to miss her family pets while we have a cat and miss a cat when she is visiting her family pets. I asked her if I could just buy and take care of an animal and she says no she wants it to be ours, not just mine. She wants to wait until her pets at her family’s home pass away and then get a cat.

144,Asshole,"EDIT: title should say CARER. Sorry. 

For backstory, my FIL has Huntington’s Disease (a progressive disease which basically kills off your brain cells.) He’s about 10 years in so he is rapidly getting worse. His coordination is terrible and he often comes close to choking on his food. My MIL is officially listed as his carer which means she gets government payments to look after him but she chooses to also work. However as my FIL gets worse, he is having more frequent accidents. He’s had so many falls over the past year and keeps ending up in hospital with severe injuries. He was in a back brace for six months last year after a fall and recently had another fall in which he split open his face. 

In casual conversation, I simply suggested to my mother in law that she might have to stop working to keep an eye on him before something even more serious happens. Her demeanour changed and she got very defensive saying her life has more meaning than that, and I should mind my own business. She found an excuse to leave and abruptly left our house. She later texted my husband saying that I need to stay out of other people’s business and keep my mouth shut. They haven’t come to visit in 2 weeks..

146,Asshole,"I have been invited to a wedding of a friend (call her Bride) from HS. Bride and I were part of a group of 4 friends who were close. Since HS (we're 33) we've grown apart, but I still consider her a friend, although we only see each other once a year or every couple years. We both follow each other on social media, so I have a general idea of what's going on in her life, and I imagined it was likewise for her. I've seen her a couple times in the last two years, and was not surprised to be invited to her upcoming wedding. I went online to RSVP and discovered I had not been given the option of a plus-one.

I've been dating my boyfriend (call him BF) for more than a year, living with him since November, and he's appeared in several of my IG posts over the past year. We're very serious, and plan to eventually get married ourselves. BF and I also dated for a year in 2011-2012, during which time he and Bride met. When I received the save the date, BF and I both looked forward to attending. 

When I discovered BF wasn't invited, I texted Bride: ""Hi Bride! I've been meaning to message you, because I attempted RSVP-ing earlier this month. However, when I did, I saw that my only option for number in my party is one. BF remembers meeting you years ago and has been looking forward to accompanying me to your wedding since we got the save the date. I know your numbers are tight, but I'm hoping you could find room for him on the guest list!""

Bride: ""Thanks for getting back to me. Fiancee and I need to do some analysis of space and budget constraints. He is at Burning Man and out of reception until next week, so I’ll get back in touch once he is back.""

Me: ""Ok, thank you so much. I know you're already super busy with loads of wedding stuff and the last thing you need is a special accommodation request, so I really appreciate you taking the time to consider it. Have a good rest of your week, talk to you soon!""

Those were all same-day, then 1 week later she sent this: ""Hi *me*, hope you had a nice long weekend! Fiancee and I had a chance to review the numbers and, unfortunately, we aren’t able to accommodate any additional guests. Thanks for your patience while we talked it over and we’re looking forward to celebrating with you in a few short weeks!""

Extra info:
-Wedding is cocktail service only, and ceremony and reception are at same venue
-Of the 4 HS friends, I will be the last to get married, and the other 2 are bringing their spouses. Most other HS acquaintances who may be there are also married
-Bride, BF and I live in the same city where Bride is getting married (we're all American)
-RSVPs were due Sept 1

So now I'm debating whether I should go. I know weddings are expensive and stressful, but I'm hurt and a little offended.

I did all my shopping and it was a little more expensive but I was soo tired and ready to go home. I had a tired 5y/o past bed time and my husband who was in a hurry to go home for the gears (pre-order) release. So when I finished shopping i went to the shortest line which has a person just buying 3items, the cashier was a nice older African American lady (normally I wouldnt really state race as it doesn't matter, but this time it's important for the story) and she was extremely nice to us. as I was checking out, my husband placed the bags in the cart while my son looked at the candy at the front counter behind me, I paid and was ready to go so I said to the lady "" thank you, have a nice night"" and she replied to me ""you too"" and I turned around and called out to my son ""*Peter* (not real name) let's go monkey"" and my son stopped playing with the candy and ran to my cart. This is where I was completely oblivious. I normally call my son monkey, bug, chipmunk, or Taz (Tasmanian devil) so I didn't think anything of it I call him these name as his has ADHD so he's a sweet but over active child but never do I mean it in a mean way or anything nits always with love +my son is 1/4 Spanish 1/4 Mexican 1/2 white, and looks like a brown eyed white boy so really it's nothing racial. when we get to the car my husband says ""wow your such an butthole"" and I'm just confused as to what I did so I ask ""why ?!"" And he said ""that lady was so nice to us and you just offended her so badly"" at this point I was more confused and worried ""wait why??"" My husband: "" you called *Peter* monkey in front of her and she gave you the most dirty offended look ever! Why would you even do that???"" Me a little less confused but now confused for something different I asked ""wait why would she think that's offensive *Peter* isn't black he's Hispanic and yet he looks extremely white?""

148,Not the A-hole,"Me and my grandfather used to have a great relationship until about 2 months ago. He had asked me for some help doing something but would not say what and it was the day before my cake day so u figured why not. 

So he shows up about 3 hours late and in a very bad mood blaming me (he was supposed to be there a 7 and show up at 10) but i was ready. So i grabbed my phone and with him to rapid city so we showed up about noon. So as any teenager would do i asked for a cheap lunch and he said sure, so we went to taco bell and he made me pay for my 2 tacos and he bought his coffee.

he showed up with a sketchy 50 gallon drum and some boulder type rocks in the back of his pickup but i soon find why. So we get to my recently deceased great uncles house and i see it. A 5 foot sink hole had opened in the driveway and i knew immeadiately why i was there. So i spend about 2 hours using the back of a tamping bar to flatten the ground and he sits in the shade sipping a soda since he finished his coffee. So i start unloading the 100+pound boulders off the back of the truck without complaint but he thinks im not working hard or fast enough and states it so i just keep going. I forgot to say this earlier but ive had ibd since i was 3 1/2 and was on prednisone for a number of years so my cartilage is pretty much shot and its hurts to do a lot so im pretty limited but deal with it the best i can. 

So i unload them with a long pry bar and he decides to tell me that his ""friend"" with a skid steer loaded them alot faster and thats why he was late.

Now for the straw that nearly broke my back. The blue drum was half filled with casing cement that was the same ""friends"" leftovers from a project about 1 week earlier and was supposed to be good about an inch down, im no expert but i dont think thats how concrete works. So about 3 hours of chipping at the solid barrel im near the point of tears and my grandfather just keeps getting angrier and whining and id finally had enough (this sort of behavior was recurring from him but id let it go because hes family) so i ask for a ""break"" and go In the house and call my mother because ya know im oficially handicapped and shouldnt have been doing that kind of work in the first place. And she said she was on her way. 

So after about 20 he comes in just screaming at me to get the hell outside or hes not goung to f***ing pay me (i didnt ask to get payed) so i reply that id called my mom and shes coming to get me and that i can barely stand up. And he goes off, big time, i dont want to get into too much because that stuff really hurt.

So about and hour and a half later i go to the end of the drive way to wait for my mom because she said she was close. And he follows me. While im waiting he is standing over me yelling at the top of his lungs how ungrateful i am for all hes given me out of that house. Now mind you i inherited some of it like a 300 savage rifle and my great uncles 55in smart tv.

149,Not the A-hole,"My (male 30ish) older sister (30ish) and I separate countries so we had already planned to spend the end of the year together in my country with her husband and my fiancee.

Even though they've been happy together so far (been together 10 years), she divorced her husband last month; I believed it was the only good decision for her to take as she didn't want kids but he wanted.

However now she is seeing someone else who turns out is more than 20 years older than her (56, so almost same age as our parents). They're not dating; in her words they are friends with benefits. Furthermore it turns out that they've met only a couple of months before she decided to get a divorce.

She hasn't told our parents about him, nor do most of her friends know apparently

Now she wants to visit me for the end of the year together with the new guy and, honestly, the whole situation rubs me the wrong way for some reason. I'm really not looking forward to spending time with a much older guy who might have been the actual reason for her break up. He might have already bought a ticket, but I am not sure.

150,Not the A-hole,"So this is my first time posting and quiet honestly I really don't know if this is going to make me the asshole or not, but here it goes...
For a little back story: my mom and my biological dad have been divorced since I was 4 (I'm 31 now). The whole thing was messy my dad would often expect me to stay wuth my paternal grandparents on weekends he was supposed to have me, usually to take his new girlfriend(my mom's old best friend) to concerts and out on dates and if my grandparents couldn't take me he would just all together just not pick me up. He would often make plans to spend time with me or promise to come and see me, once he lived out of state, that very rarely if ever actually happened. There was always an excuse of why he didn't show or call or write when he was stationed over seas (U.S. Army). 
Through high school and even through my 20s we rarely spoke and when we did he would always turn it back around on me, even when it was his father passing away and me begging him to come out he told me "" quit nagging me, your grandfather and I said our goodbyes a long time ago"" or when I was told that I would have to have a laparoscopic surgery to see if I had cancerous cells and said "" I just can't make it out there, I'm going through my own health issues, and you couldn't even ask"". It's always been me that has tried to work on the relationship, I'm always the one calling him (rarely answers) me texting him (No response for days or weeks). This man forgot my birthday which is on CHRISTMAS(kind of hard to forget), numerous times (never an appology).

Now on the other hand my mom remarried when I was about 9 to a man she had been seeing since I was about 5 years old. A wonderful man, that treated me like I was made of gold. He has always shown me love and went to every band concert, play or any other school production I was tied into. And despite how my biological fathers family treated him he was by my side when I was losing my grandfather (who never had an issue with my step dad) on that side.

The reason I'm asking if I'm the asshole:
I'm getting married very soon, and my plans have always been for my ""step"" dad to walk me down the aisle as I have never have really had a  connection with my bio dad. But most of biodads family have actually said if I don't allow him to walk me down the aisle that I would be an ""ungrateful brat"" and that I just need to ""keep working to fix my relationship with bio dad"" it's too a point where my grandmother (on his side) said she would ""never speak to me again"" and that ""the entire family would disown me"".

So will I be the asshole if I choose to have my ""step"" dad walk me down the aisle?",38,29,0.85
151,Not the A-hole,"I'm 16 and still live at home, my brother is 25 but has the mental capacities of roughly a 6 year old, according to the tests, because of intellectual disabilities. (I don't know 100% what or why, this is just what I've been told by my mom). He lives at home too. 

I love my brother, and I enjoy spending time with him. But my mother refuses to hire a carer for him because 'between us we can handle it'. My mom and I share the chores 50/50, and try to spend roughly the same amount of time with him. 

My mom works from home, so she spends the morning/afternoon with him. When I get home from school I spend the late afternoon/evening with him so she can focus on work. 

I don't mind doing it. But I don't have any spending money, my mom buys the necessities like school books and groceries, but I don't have any money that's just mine, to spend on whatever. 

I told my mom I wanted to find a job for the weekends, she told me that my job is helping her take care of bro. I told her if it's a job then I should get payed for it, and if it's not then i have no obligation to keep doing it. She got very upset. 

We're quite well off, she could absolutely hire a carer, babysitter, daycare type of thing. But because we're family I'm expected to just do it. 

Like I said, I enjoy spending some time with him. But since I've gotten older my days have been school, homework, chores and babysitting. I only really see my friends at school or if they want to come over to my house to hang out with me (and my brother as well). 

My mom is still upset with me for asking, because family is supposed to take care of each other no matter what. Was I an asshole?

Edit: I'll look into in how the laws here work, I'm not from the US.

Edit number two: My mom makes a budget every single month to stick to (yes, including retirement and savings) with every single expense and her income. She does this because I often do groceries or pay from my brothers stuff with her bank card, so I know roughly what to stick to. I'm not just guessing when I say we could afford it.

Edit number 3: Guys seriously, I'll look into options covered by insurance but I'm not from the US. Medicare isn't relevant lol.

152,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few years ago and after seeing a few posts about weddings I’d like an outside opinion.

I’m part of quite a large social circle. As with large circles some people are closer to each other than others but for big things (birthdays, weddings, other celebrations) we all get together. We also try to do BBQs and game nights regularly. A few years back two of the circle got engaged. Let’s call them Jim and Pam. I’m not terribly close to them but was excited for them of course and was looking forward to their wedding. 
Skip to a few months ahead of the wedding and the invites go out. My best friend gets one, my house mate gets one, all of the group gets one except me. I was kind of put out but I know how expensive weddings can be, and I’m not super close to Jim and Pam, so I swallow my pride and get on with life.  Someone must have thought it was weird though because they asked Jim why I wasn’t invited. Jim said I was (I had only just moved in with my housemate so maybe it got lost in the mail?) and gave me a new invite. I noticed that it didn’t mention anything about a reception. The invite only gave info about the ceremony, and the rsvp didn’t have anything about food options like most. It seemed a bit weird so I checked around and it turned out that everyone in the circle had been invited to both the ceremony and reception but I hadn’t. I asked Jim and he told me that they couldn’t afford everyone who went to the ceremony to also attend the reception. I decided to politely decline the invite. In my opinion it’s bad form. Either a person is good enough to invite to the whole event or not. Also, the thought of going to the wedding with my friends only to watch as they go to the reception without me kind of made me sad. I decided to spend the day with other friends instead. 
After the wedding a few people asked where I was and when I explained they seemed to get it. In Australia it’s very weird not to invite someone to one part of the wedding (outside of large cultural weddings). If Jim and Pam were annoyed they never mentioned anything and I still see them with no problem. I guess I’m just curious as to others opinions. So, am I the asshole?

Edit: thanks for your input. A couple of things-

1) I thought ceremony only invites weren’t an Australian thing, but apparently they are. I still don’t like them.

2) Jim and Pam are good people. We’re still friends. They have a kid now.  Super cute!

3) I politely declined because of my own feelings on the invitation. Petty? Probably. But based on replies if I wasn’t a pity invite I was definitely at least a polite invite, which I think means it probably didn’t matter a great deal.

4) if I ever get married I’m eloping.",230,930,0.95

Despite their large number of employees (they have an entire floor to themselves unlike multiple departments in one floor), they are slow. They took about 5 months to process my payroll alone, so the delay in ID cards are not a surprise to us.

154,Not the A-hole,"English is not my native language. A few weeks ago I got a call from my friend at late night asking me to meet him. Apparently he had found out that both of his children weren't his. I was surprised but he showed me the paternity test results, and also his wife confessed that they might not be his(He think he's Infertile). They always had a rocky marriage.

Since then, he hasn't gone back home. I and my friends are helping him with normal stuff. He is currently living at a place owned by me. He contacted a lawyer, it's seems according to the law in our country a father can't ask for a paternity test after marriage. But the lawyer said he could win if they could somehow prove he can't be the father without a paternity test( I think that's just lawyer speak). He is going to get a fertility test. His lawyer also plans to bring in the actual father in court.

The thing is my gf is really close to his wife. She thinks we( his friends) should talk some sense into him. My gf and I went to meet the wife after my friend left. She and their kids were crying( on is 6 yr old, the other is 2). She's also a SAHM. I felt really bad, but I don't know if I should get involved. My friend called his wife and said he will only talk through a lawyer. My gf and the wife knows we are in contact with him, but they don't know that I am housing him. They also don't know that his lawyer contacted the biological father. I am wondering if I am a bad person for not telling them anything, my friend would be really pissed  if I did. AITA?

She said she was waiting for a friend, and we were talking for a bit, then she asked if I wanted to come in and get a drink with her and catch up while she waited. We had 2 drinks each, talked for about 30-40 min about work and life and siblings etc. It was pretty awkward, but I kind of felt a responsibility to know what was going on with her because she had a history of health issues and family issues. I paid for our drinks.

Later on that night, I mentioned to my wife that I ran into her. She was a bit apprehensive about the idea of it, I think some part of her has always hated Katy because Katy kind of was this 'cool' girl compared to her in high school and college, but she didn't suspect anything. I could just tell she didn't like the idea of it. THEN the next morning, she apparently checked our bank statement to see how much we were spending on groceries, and she saw the bar charge. She was mad, really mad, at the idea that we went to a bar. I kept telling her that this wasn't planned, and that I ran into her outside of the bar, but she said she has no idea if I am telling the truth or not, because I 'kept it a secret' until after the fact.

After a few seconds and right before i was going to start chewing it, he told me it was an edible. I panicked, tore it out of my mouth, and threw it out the car window.

He’s pissed at me for how I reacted. I freaked because I usually don’t use weed + have no tolerance, have work early in the morning, and did not expect it to be anything other than a mint. So, AITA?

Early Edit: He was not trying to drug me, he was going to head home and was dropping me off on the way. Got pissed at my ¿over?reaction.

Edit 2: this is the first i’ve seen an overwhelmingly “NTA” response but still getting downvoted to hell in the comments lol. i hear y’all and have a lot to think about.

Final Edit: Y’all have it twisted, my SO is not a bad guy, he gave a heartfelt apology yesterday. There are some tweaks we have to work out in our relationship, consent is ~not~ one of those and from how he said it he regretted it right away which is why it got awkward after.

There is also a well known trap that the highway patrol has set up to catch these lawbreakers which everyone conveniently avoids by exiting the lane a mile and a half before. 

I was talking to my coworkers today about it and told them that what I want to do is block someone from leaving the lane likely guaranteeing the driver a $400 ticket. 

People acted like I had confessed to a murder. There were arguments that I could be preventing someone from seeing a dying relative or some other kind of emergency. I said that it was much more likely that it was just people being entitled assholes.

The other day over casual conversation he started to brag about a couple of different women that ""took him around the world and back"" He is a man in his late 30s and he was getting intimate with women that are in their early 20s. He has been married for over 10 years and his wife is completely unaware of what is going on. I will also add that I know his wife very well and am very friendly with her. I felt obligated to do something about, since I feel as though I am friends with both my close friend and his wife.

I ended up using a google voice phone number to send a text message to his wife from a number she had never received before, the message provided a detail about her that I knew would make her believe it wasn't fraudulent or a ""scammer"" trying to get her attention, then I explained what she needed to do to find out the infidelities that her husband had committed.

My friend of many years has been kicked out, seems to be struggling with what happened and is completely clueless about how his wife found out about what happened and is extremely pissed off about it.

166,Asshole,"Hi! I had gastric bypass surgery two weeks ago. I pay rent and live with my mom and her boyfriend, who moved it recently. He’s a great guy, things are drama free, and there isn’t any underlying tension. Tonight he brought home pizza and I’m really struggling and considering asking them not to have large amounts of fast food/bad food lying out for long periods of time (like overnight) for a few weeks.

My mom’s boyfriend coaches a high school football team, and today he brought home leftovers from a pizza outing (about half of a cheese and half of a pepperoni pizza, the kind from Costco).

For those of you who are unfamiliar with gastric bypass, it’s weight loss surgery and only performed on people who really need it. I got to be morbidly obese due to food addiction. Since starting the process to surgery I stuck to dietary guidelines, and since having the surgery I have been extremely strict sticking to the all liquid post op diet. I’ve lost 21 lbs in two weeks, but it has absolutely not been easy. The surgery has changed my life (and continues to). Before surgery, I could’ve probably put away the entire Costco pizza myself. Not kidding.

It’s really, really hard to have this pizza in the house. I’m ashamed to say that when they were upstairs, I even tore off a piece of cheese and chewed it- and then spit it out because I was so disgusted by myself and refused to give up all the hard work I’d put in. This is the first time I’ve “broken” since surgery. I know it only gets harder, but I’m working hard.

WIBTA if I spoke to my mom about having large amounts of fast food/bad food sitting out in the house for a few weeks? (I feel like she would be more comfortable if I spoke to her rather than her bf directly). They do eat fast food when I’m home, I don’t mind and I just go hang out upstairs in my room- it’s not hard for me because it’s like, being eaten by other people and I can remove myself from the situation. (When I say I don’t mind, I mean I don’t mind emotionally. I’m working on my relationship with food, it’s a process). It’s just different when it’s sitting out there all night.

UPDATE: turns out I didn’t even have to ask! I hadn’t mentioned (didn’t think it was necessary bc it was so long ago and she eats “normally” now) my mother had the same surgery about 20 years ago. I went for a 2 hour walk because it’s one of my “distraction tactics” when I’m having a tough time. 
In the time I was gone- without me even saying anything- my mom had come home, seen the pizza laying out, and talked to her bf about how hard it was for her after her surgery and she had the exact same idea I was asking about here!! He was totally cool with not leaving fast food out. She mentioned it to me when I got home and I’m just thinking about how I’m so lucky to have people around me that support me :) thanks for all of your advice and feedback!

(Also edit: I said when they were upstairs because I thought my mom was home, turns out she wasn’t!)

Edit 2: I feel like there are some misconceptions in the comments? They can eat whatever they want! I do not mind nor would I want to have any say in that. I am NOT saying don’t bring certain food in the house. I am just asking that it not be left out for long periods of time, like all evening and overnight. My reasoning behind it is that it makes it hard for me while I am working on my relationship with food. Rereading everything, I think it would be different if I was asking roommates not to leave food out overnight? Also, I see a lot of people saying I’m just going to fail with my weight loss, but hey, I’m optimistic. If I didn’t have issues with food, I wouldn’t have needed Bariatric surgery. But just because things are still tough doesn’t mean that I won’t get better over time. I feel it’s a process, and (as per my last update) my family around me supports it :)",84,233,0.91
167,Asshole,"I've got peeps on my main account so this  account is pretty much a burner

Background: 1. I'm in high-school and we had a field trip.  Traveled by school buses and it was 'first come first serve' (so basically if you get on the bus last then you get the last seat left. Basically you get to pick your partner''. 

   2. Person X and Y are friends, I am friends with X but Y is somewhat a mutual friend. I don't speak with Y much except for a ""sup"" in the hallways. Me and X love peanut butter (kinda how we connected tbh) and there were plenty of times where I would see X eating peanut butter cookies or other products while chatting with Y (kinda important for later). 

3.The school trip was a hike trail where we go hiking, rock climbing, etc. I had 1 BLT sandwich that I ate during the hike, and 1 PB&J I was going to eat but saved for later. 

What happened:

When it was time to go, I was one of the last few kids back on the bus. We had to wait 5mins because some students were using the bathroom. At the this point there were 4 seats left (not teachers included). I got hungry again and decided to start eating my PB&J since others were starting to eat their final snacks too.

Y enters the bus and the only seat left is the one next to me. She sits down, we smile and say what's up to each other and just do our own thing (we were allowed our phones). I noticed that Y looked a bit bothered so I asked

Me: hey you ok? 

Y: yea, it's just that I'm allergic to peanut butter and yea.. Can you please stop eating that or maybe switch your seat? 

Me: sorry but no, there have been plenty of times X ate peanut butter while chatting right to you and you don't ever seem bothered

Y: but I'm allergic

Me: you aren't the one eating it though. Were you still allergic when X eats PB&Js? 


Y gets upset and asks a nearby teacher for assistance. Y explains that I'm eating something she's allergic too and refusing to move, I explained that she is around X all the time and has no problem when X eats peanut butter. Teacher switches seats with Y but tells me that I should've been the bigger person. I said it wasn't fair for me to either switch my seat or stop eating my food if Y tolerates the same food Y's bestfriend X eats. But the teacher said that I should've kept an open mind and see the bigger issue because I was insensitive about her allergy

My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.

174,Asshole,"AITA- This evening I took my pup across the street to the soccer field to let him run off some energy. We do this fairly often because it’s convenient and our dog is at home for most of the day. I make sure he stays away from the playground and such, and am mindful of kids and people etc. My dog listens fairly well, and generally the playground/soccer field families display neutral attitudes towards the dog, and occasionally kids get psyched and wanna play with him. 

Tonight I took the dog out back first because he always shits after dinner. He didn’t wanna go in the yard, so I assumed he would across the street at the field. We’re minding our own business as the sun is setting and we’re feeling the nice fall breeze through our hair, and Hans (pup) picks a spot to drop a ripe deuce. I anticipated this, and thus had a bag with me and casually worked my way over to pick up like a civilized person. Before I have the chance to bend down, this older man resembling Bill Murray in Caddyshack shouts at me, and then begins approaching me.  He proclaims that dogs aren’t allowed in the park per the sign, and I calmly clarified that I’m taking care of my “shit” and that the sign actually says “Please pick up after your pets.” 

This did not go over well and “Bill” then accused me of being a disgusting person (along with some additional strong language) because children play in the soccer field and that I’m making them roll in dog crap. I responded about how that was unreasonable seeing that I was picking up my dog crap and pointed out that the only children present were kids who were about a football field away in the other direction (at the playground where children play). 

He then proceeded to walk directly toward me and and dialed 911. Here’s his conversation: “I don’t know who to contact, but there’s a lady here and her dog crapped in the park. Yes, she has a bag. Yes, she’s picking it up right now..” I called him an “assjacket” and  said that he should be ashamed of displaying such immature behavior in front of his kids, and then GTFO. 

I walked with purpose down the block, turned up a neighbor’s driveway, and sneaked my way back home by crawling through my neighbor’s backyard because this guy was patrolling the park like Mussolini. The cops never came and he stayed at the park for a long time after I left (I live directly across the street).

I'm 20F, my sister is 23F. Both of my parents (40s) are very invested in the church, at least in public. At home, things are very lenient. We had no real rules, we just attended all the community functions, went to church, interacted with people of the church, et cetera. It was always a family thing: these were our family outings. We never went to restaurants to went to the city, we always kept things closed within the community. Besides that, I think we're similar to most families, our household was ""normal"" if you want to think of it that way.

And until I was 18, things were peachy. It was at this point my sister decided to leave home and cut all ties with all of us except me. She made a friend online and according to my sister, she ""showed her the truth"" and was convinced the church was bad. Nevermind the church never did anything to warrant these thoughts. We were never mistreated or had to do some contrived debased rituals or anything. I really want to stress things are pretty normal.

My sister is trying to convince me to leave the church, too, but I don't want to. In fact, I wish she'd come back so we can be a whole family again. My parents, especially my mother, are taking it very hard. They're lethargic, there's no spark in our family anymore, if you looked up ennui in the dictionary, our family is described pretty well.

Here's where some of the asshole parts come in: the community is being passive aggressive with my parents, particularly my mom. There's some shame involved but she hasn't been excommunicated. That's not really a thing. My mom sought guidance from the church and they've made it clear my mother has failed my sister. My sister's in a homosexual relationship now, has tattoos, et cetera, things the church doesn't really see in that great a light. Why my mom even told anyone this is beyond me.

I feel like eventually, things will be so turbulent that one of two things may happen: my mother may just uproot things with my sister and then we become a family of three, or the church may make it difficult to remain here. We like it here, I like it here, and I wish my sister would come back so our lives can go back to normal.

I don't want to threaten or coerce or blackmail my sister, just talk to her and see if I can get her back into our community.

About 2 months into our marriage, my maid of honor(27f)’s problems with her family became worse and she started staying with us. My partner wasn’t totally ok with it but we both didn’t want her sleeping in her car,  so at first she would stay with other friends on other nights, and with us a few nights a week, but those friends were no longer able to take her after a while, and finally she moved in with us. We assumed she would stay for a couple of months and find her own place.

My friend has a girlfriend who lives about 4 hours away, who comes into town every few weekends and they stay in a hotel together. The girlfriend has a good job and a house. However, their relationship isn’t really stable enough for them to move in together. My friend is extremely depressed and barely takes care of herself, and her girlfriend wants her to improve significantly before they move in together. I understand this. The girlfriend and I have become sort of friends over the past few months, and having lived with my friend and spoken with the girlfriend about her at length, I agree that this is a bad move. The girlfriend wants my friend to go to therapy, and my friend keeps resisting. 

My friend is also chronically ill. She can’t do most jobs, and she was fired from her only part time job a little while back, so she’s unemployed. She pays us rent every month, and she has been looking for work, but not every day and not very ambitiously. AFAIK she has not attempted to get disability. 

My wife and I are exhausted- we work every day, each of us has a full time job and two part time jobs. We feel crowded in our tiny apartment. We are tired of coming home to her on the couch. We can afford care for the dog if she leaves. It has been 6 months and my wife desperately wants her out so we can finally start spending time alone together and have sex without being nervous that she will hear. 

Every time I try to talk to her about developing a plan for her independence, she shuts down. She barely responds to me and looks like she might cry if she tries to. The girlfriend has told me she does the same with her, with the added bonus of lashing out at her emotionally. I am trying to be understanding as I have mental issues of my own, and have been depressed before, but I feel like she just doesn’t want to get better at this point. 

I want her to move out by the end of October. I am pretty certain the girlfriend will not take her and she(my friend) would not do anything about it and would just move into her car on October 31st, and eventually die because she’ll neglect herself, and this is what is killing me about this, but she isn’t my responsibility and it is harming my wife’s mental health(and mine) to continue to have her here.

183,Not the A-hole,"My first post for reddit... created an account to begin here, I suppose.

This will be long.

3 years ago my sister moved in with my wife and I.  We had one child atm, and wanted to have more.  My sister moved in to help us with our baby and us to help her finish her school.  We agreed upon $600 a month for rent and she pays her phone, on my plan.

My mother moved in a year later, almost immediately breaking her hip.  I told her not to worry about money while she recovered.

Later, they both were told that I only needed $400 a month from them since they wanted to save money as well. 

I began having to ask almost every month for a year when they were going to pay rent, specifically my sister.  She stopped telling me if she was going to be late or just not pay rent that month at all.

LONG story, short: my sister went on a nearly month long trip for school, and my mother had to switch jobs. I relied on my disability from the Army and my GI Bill stipend from school for all bills. A clerical error made me two months delayed last semester on payments. I left my sister alone for 3 weeks after she got back before asking about rent. The fight was intense, she was angry that I wouldn't leave her alone about money since it wasn't ""her"" fault that she was two months behind and my mom was 3 months behind on rent. She told me to go out and get a job if we were having money problems. 

That was over 2 months ago.  We had another family-discussion where I told them it was time to start looking at moving out.  I told my mother she was free to stay until even the first of 2020 but my sister would have to go sooner, ""Okay, when do you want her out,"" my mother asked, ""I'm not sure..."" I responded.  They both exploded at me.  My mother later apologized, sort of.

Fast forward to Sept 5th. My mother convinced me to let my sister stay her stay until they could both leave.

My mother had also recently gone back to work, again, after a foot fracture, and my sister had found a new job after getting laid off.

I asked about rent for September and  as told that I should just use common sense and assume that they would be late and respect their difficulties.  I repeated myself, and insisted that they need to tell me if they are going to be late and IF SO, how late because I need to make arrangements since I'm going in for the first of two surgeries next week, so no school, no work for me for a while.

It escalated, I told them they have a responsibility to tell me when they are going to pay rent. My sister walked away, again, and told me to leave her alone.  I stopped her on the stairs, insisting that she didn't need to turn this into another fight and to just speak to me.

I was told to shut up.  I told her she had no reason to speak to me that way (I hate to use the expression like a guy out the 50s) in OUR home.  She told me to shut up again.  I told her she has a month to get out of my home if she cannot respect me.  I am not backing down, this time.

I work from home and probably since the first day we've been together I've been talking about getting a dog so I had some company at home.  It gets pretty lonely living alone and working from home.

Things have been getting pretty serious and we were planning to move in together, but she wouldn't commit and I just renewed my lease through October 2020.  About a week later the exact kind of pup I've been looking for came available at a rescue shelter.  I told her I was going to adopt it, and she FLIPPED.  She said that it was going to affect her long term when we move in together to have another dog around the house.  I decided that my happiness was what mattered.  She was the one who backed off on us living together I've been pretty depressed lately, and I just decided to do it.

Our relationship has not been the same since.  She is really mean to the dog who is the sweetest dog ever.  She is really mean to me.  She will not budge at all if she is slightly inconvenienced by the puppy.  If I have to run home to let the dog out, she flips out.  Note that I allow her dog in my apartment and I've crate trained my puppy so if she allowed me to bring her over it would barely inconvenience her, much less than her dog who she is very irresponsible with.

AITA for getting a puppy that will ultimately impact her when we live together, even though I have taken her dog in?

She claims since she had the dog before we got together that it doesn't count.  Thing is - she's known I wanted to get a puppy since the day we got together.  Only difference is - that I went and did it and adopted without her ""Final"" approval, which TBH was never coming - so I just decided to do it.

I was looking for a little reassurance I wasn't in the wrong and was hoping to show her this post and comments so she could see my side, but I can't do that now :).

I think her intentions weren't to be controlling or an AH.  I think she is just scared how it will impact our relationship.  She has hinted that I will be ""meeting lots of girls"" and won't have time for her now.  I think it mainly boils down in her mind to a little bit of jealousy, losing some of my attention, and also the long term impact it has on her.

my sister is also uncomfortable around him and doesn’t really want to be very close friends with him anymore but doesn’t know how to get out of it. he jumps over lunch tables to talk to her and grabs her when she doesnt know he’s behind her and scares her.  he’s used the r—rd because he thinks he edgy, and it makes me uncomfortable because i was raised knowing the offensive background and taught not to use it.

189,Not the A-hole,"Yesterday was the first day of school for me, and I have all my summer assignments done for each class. My APUSH summer took me a good two days, as first I wrote it online which took a day and then had to write it on paper because he doesn’t accept typed assignments (which it said on the instructions). So, I wrote the assignment on paper in pencil for a good 4-6 hours. The assignment was 8 pages long, and all finished.

So this is where the AITA? comes in. I go to class, we all hand in our summer assignments, and he stops me while putting the assignment in the pile, embarrasses me infront of the class, and says “I can’t accept this, it’s in pencil.” I obviously contest this and say “The instructions never said it had to be in pen”, and then he said “Go sit down and show me the assignment because it does.” So I go show him the assignment and it doesn’t. He still doesn’t accept the assignment and is telling me to rewrite it in Pen. 

I’m honestly completely frustrated, because that assignment was 8 pages long and took me 4-6 hours just to copy down onto paper. Now, I had to do that all over again- a complete waste of my time- just so it’s in pen. I would understand if the assignment said to write it in pen, however it didn’t at all. The only requirements was you couldn’t type the assignment and hand it in printed. So, me being upset I called my mom and asked her to call the school to fix this. She also emails him directly and he says that he tried talking to me after class, but I “refused”. This was a total blatant lie as I actually was the one who confronted him after class, and all he said was “Ok calm down I’ll give you 2 days” like that made any matters better. 

My mom got a call back from the vice principal today and was told I can hand it in the way it is but have to rewrite or type the essay part in pen because he has trouble seeing in pencil. I don’t like this teacher but I feel like I should’ve just rewrote it, because I just feel bad for creating this mess for the principals to deal with. AITA?",112,168,0.94
190,Not the A-hole,"My father recently got a puppy a month ago, about 5 months old for my oldest daughter. He had mentioned to us before he wanted to get her a pet dog because according to him ""it would calm her down ""every kid needs a dog"" ""its the best thing for her"" ""she'll love me for this!"" blah blah... I could go on and on about his convincing speech. I should also mention that he lives with us at the moment and yes he helps with bills. I asked him ""I'm on board if you help watch the puppy and pitch in, it's basically your dog after all.."" He swore up and down he'd help out, by taking it on walks etc. So fast forward, he gets her a cute female cockapoo. My daughter is overjoyed, cuddles and kisses the damn thing constantly. Sometimes we have to pry the dog off her so she can eat and go to sleep. Both my husband and myself got all the essentials out of our own pockets. Dog crate, food, puppy pads, shampoo, treats, brush, lysol and paper towels to clean up the messes...omg the messes..ugh...
Everything good right? Wrong...because lets just say this entire month my father showed his true colors. He refuses to take her out because ""ugh i'm too old for this shit, she's too hyper for me to walk her..."" Me and my husband are the ONLY ones who take her on walks and clean up her poop and pee when she goes indoors. It mostly falls on me because i stay at home while my husband works. I'm the one who feeds her, cleans when she knocks down our trash can. The one who has to get her away from things she tries to eat...the one who needs to be with her at all times because he got a puppy with separation anxiety... and at night she jumps on our bed because if we leave her out in her crate she barks and cries like crazy and no one can sleep. My father sleeps like a rock all night meanwhile i get up at 2 am every night with an alarm to allow the puppy to pee and poo so it doesnt go on our bed. I keep telling myself i'm doing it for my daughter...I'm doing this for her....i'm doing this for her....

Well, today what set me off was that its the first day of school for my daughter. I'm in a rush and getting her stuff when my dad, who was sprawled out on the sofa watching tv yells out ""THE DOG POOED!"" I was holding the door, my daughter already outside, i turn to him and go ""SO CLEAN IT!"" He stared at me in disbelief and starts achingly getting up groaning the entire time. He starts muttering ""I'm going to return this thing..im too old for this shit, you will see"" The thought of him returning the dog, my daughter's dog who she adores more than life itself. I snapped and told him ""YOURE SUCH A LAZY ASSHOLE, YOU REALLY CAN'T PICK UP SHIT FOR ONE DAMN DAY?!"" He goes ""WHERE'S THE WIPES FOR THIS?!"" And i scream back ""YOU HAD A WHOLE MONTH TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE WIPES ARE!"" 
He's now telling people im disrespectful because i yelled at him to clean up ""her daughter's dog"" I'm livid. I'm also tired and regret ever letting him get the dog. Do i even have a right to be this upset?",53,182,0.95

196,Not the A-hole,"About 22 years ago my dad had an affair and got his mistress pregnant. He confessed all to my mom who responded ""take care of your responsibility but I never want to hear about this again."" So my dad did just that- he paid child support and had a relationship with my brother but spoke of it to no one except his attorney, his mother, and sister. He claims  a lapse in judgement and has been faithful and committed to my mom since.

5 years ago I ran into my aunt and Nana having lunch with a teenage boy. They seemed uneasy but asked if I wanted to join them and I really hit it off with Nicholas. He was cool as shit and we had a lot in common even though I was 22 and he was 16. I asked my Nana  how they knew him and she brushed me off. Later that day my dad asked me to meet up and told me that Nicky was my half brother and the whole story. All these years that we thought my dad was working, out of town on business or on a guy's trip he was usually with Nicky. At first I was really angry but then I felt really bad for him and Nicky and told him I wanted to have relationship with my brother. He said ok and seemed happy about it but asked that I not tell my siblings or let my mom know because it would devastate her. I played along for a few years. I was at Nicky's graduation, took him on his senior trip  backpacking in Europe, and helped him move into his college dorm. We're as close as if we grew up together.

I recently got engaged and in planning the wedding decided I wanted Nicky as a groomsmen with my other brothers. I told my dad and he agreed it was time to end the charade and my mom would have to face it. So he told my mom and my mom called me and begged me not to let the family secret out and how that was a hard time for her and she can't face my father's son. I felt bad but I think that my brother is also innocent in this and that my mom needs to be an adult and face reality. So we told my siblings. There have been a lot of emotions over the past few months but my siblings  love Nicky and he's really happy to have brothers and sisters and fits right in. My dad seems relieved to have all his kids together and not to be keeping a secret. My mom spent the entire summer at our beach house and still seems to be in denial.

Her sister (my aunt) says I'm an asshole bc I should've stayed out of it. 2 of my 4 siblings think I'm an asshole for keeping the secret for so long. They think its unfair that I got to make so many memories with Nicky and they didn't get to. One of them is around Nicky's age and is really bummed she didn't know she had a brother so closer to her age. I think they have lots of time to make memories with him now and that I was in a tough place and made a hard decision but that doesn't make me an asshole.

&#x200B;

Just a few edits to clarify some things:

1. My dad hasn't been going behind my mom's back to see Nicky. When I spoke to my mom, she indicated that she knew that my dad had a relationship with him and my dad said that he told her during the ""I don't want to hear about it talk"" that he told her that he couldn't just throw money at the child but not be involved and my mom said she knew he couldn't. While he never said ""I'm going to Nicky's soccer game tonight and won't be home for dinner"" my mom told me sister during a talk a couple months ago that she almost always knew when my dad was with Nicky. 
2. My wedding isn't until next year (next October) and if my mom still hasn't dealt with the situation and feels that she can be part of the day, then we will push it back a little more if we need to. My SO fully supports me in this. I wanted the secret to come out now so that we weren't dealing with it right before the wedding and Nicky wasn't being introduced as our brother at the wedding. That's a total asshole move and never occured to me to do 
3. There have been a lot of comments about me not loving my mom and being callous towards her. This was not my intention. I love my mom. She is wonderful and loving and I don't want to cause her any pain but I also do think that my parents made the wrong decision 22 years ago to keep Nicky a secret and that she's had 22 years to come to terms with his existence. No one sees her as someone to pity. If anything, everyone's respect for my dad has gone down a few notches for being unfaithful, however, my mom had/has a chance to act with grace and compassion and I think that is what most people will see: my dad is the louse and my mom is the saint for staying with him, forgiving him, and being tolerant of Nicky. 
4. I know I talked a lot about my dad being happy and some negative comments made about that. My dad is not overjoyed that my mom is hurting but he is relieved to not be living two lives anymore. Despite his infidelity, he is an upstanding guy and it bothered him to continue lying to his children and he hated sneaking around. 
5. Yes, my sister was 3 months old when my dad confessed the affair. The affair lasted about 6 months and began around a time when my parents were living apart and continued for a couple months after they reunited (they reunited right before my sister was born). Their separation had nothing to do with infidelity or lying.
6. My mother has not been alone at the beach house. My dad has been with her a lot of the time and each of us siblings has visited her. She's also had friends staying with her. 

Also, just because I don't want people to think that my parents have a bad marriage that my mom has suffered through all these years for us kids-they don't. They are loving and affectionate. My dad adores my mother and she adores him. She has told us that she stayed with my dad then because she loves him and that the affair was out of character for him and she didn't believe he would do it again. She does not want a divorce and everyone really is trying to help her through it as much as possible.",1085,9508,0.95
197,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account. 

So hear me out, Me and my wife have being trying for a baby this year. Having kids is something that she’s always wanted and is very adamant about. I work a manual labor job for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes when I get home all I want to do is eat and sleep, may mix a shower in there sometimes. Anyway, so last night  I got home after a 12 hour shift of working in the sun and was ready to crash out and of course it had to be ovulation time. I told my wife how tired I was and that I wasn’t in the mood, she insisted that’d she do all the work and that it’d help me sleep better, ok can’t argue with that. She’s on top riding her heart out and within maybe 2 minutes I fall asleep. She tried to wake me up but I was out. This morning I woke up to a very upset wife, angry that we missed “her most fertile time”. She was crying and said how I must not be attracted to her if I can’t stay awake for five minutes and that I wasn’t serious about having kids with her as well. I kept trying to remind her that I told her I was tired before we even started but she wasn’t listening, then I asked if it was possible that her ovulation was messing with her hormones and she was overreacting, she hasn’t spoken to me since this morning. So AMITA??

Edit 1: my wife and I talk pretty openly about how her hormones during her period and how changes the way she acts and reacts sometimes. Didn’t think this would be different. 

Edit 2: I work long hours at a physically demanding job specifically for her and the baby we’re trying to bring into this world. I want to be able to provide for my family, So her accusing me of not really wanting a baby is ridiculous and she knows it.

UPDATE: me and my wife had a very long conversation over dinner last night and we’ve came to the conclusion that we’re both putting to much stress on ourselves trying to conceive. Luckily I’m in a position at my job where I have a bit more flexibility than others might so I’m going to try to cut back on my hours some and she’s going to try to relax about her fertility and cervical mucus. I showed her some of these comments and we had a good laugh about it, so thank you reddit.",288,594,0.94

199,Not the A-hole,"I know what it sounds like, but hear me out. 

My fiancé and I have been together about 6 years now. He had one dog (K) when we started dating and decided to get another one shortly after (W). 

In the last year and a half W has started to show aggressive tendencies towards K. It started when they were eating or given treats. So we put them in a set feeding schedule and separated them any time they ate. It seemed to work for the most part. 
There was an instance during this time where W got K so bad, he’s now missing a little chunk of his ear and had to get a few stitches on his face. 

We currently live with my fiancé’s family and we all moved to a new house two months ago. On moving day, there was a bad altercation between the two that was harder to break up than usual because we had already moved most of the stuff out of the house. My fiancé had to put himself between the two and got bit. Luckily he didn’t need stitches though. 

The attacks have increased in frequency and in randomness of cause. One time my fiancé thinks it had to do with seeing W lick a crumb off the floor in the kitchen. The one last night was because someone was eating food at the dinner table. They didn’t drop anything or pay attention to the dogs, and W still attacked K. That was the third attack in the last week. 

I strongly believe it is a matter of time before W turns on one of us or one of the cats in the house. I also believe it isn’t safe for K to be around her anymore either. My fiancé did take W to get some bloodwork done and is hoping there is a physical reason for this, but I’m pretty sure we’ve done these tests before and the vet came back with nothing. I asked him what if the bloodwork comes back with no reason for the aggression, and he said he’d find training for her. 

I’ve heard the training thing before, and he never did anything with it. And even if she were “trained” I don’t think the aggression will ever really go away. I could never trust her around small children. I told him all of this, and he just doesn’t seem to take it seriously. 

I flat out told him to get rid of her, and even though he’s considered it before, he’s totally shutting out the idea now. I told him I don’t believe W belongs in a home with other dogs at all, but he doesn’t agree. I also said there’s no world where I would let my future children live in the same house as that dog. He insists she’ll never attack a person because she hasn’t before (like a toddler picking up a piece of food would be different than if K got food in front of W). We haven’t spoke to each other since this conversation earlier today.

tldr - she's involving me in her turns which I think is against the spirit of having a 'turn system' 



So I've (M24)  only just* (*7 weeks) moved in with her (F24) after years of dating and for the first 5 weeks we shared the task of cooking every night.

I thought this was great as I just accepted that I would always be expected to help/lead the cooking every day and it was just another thing to be done, just as it would be if I was living alone.

2 weeks ago my gf turned to me and said she'd like to start taking turns on dinner because she was really tired and didn't want to do it that day.
Ok, cool no problems that's fair enough. One week of turns with no dramas.

This week however, I've noticed I'm always asked to help out with dinner and she's been somewhat pouty and 'stroppy' (not massively but enough to demonstrate that she feels like it's not fair I didn't immediately offer) about the fact I don't jump up and help out when it's her turn. 

If it's my turn, I cook and clean without asking for help and cleaning up after because if it's my turn to cook that is what I believe should be done and it's really beginning to grate on me that she is involving me in what I see as her responsibility.

209,Not the A-hole,"I have been with my Fiancee for almost 3 years. I told her about a year ago that I have a savings certificate with an amount in the hundreds of thousands. Simply because I proposed and figured I would let her know that we will be able to buy a house together when we were ready. Which is the sole purpose of the account. 

Now that I have told her she asks me at least once a month to show it to her because she likes looking at large sums of money.  I don't have it visible on my app or online account because I don't want to see it and be tempted to use it for other things. So I had my bank take it off there. 

She doesn't really know how to keep things quiet so she will probably tell all of her friends how much is in it and I don't want them to know. Also she has been pushing me to get her as a power of attorney (PoA) on my accounts. I'm starting to believe that is because she would be able to access that account. 

Now she is pissed off because I won't show it to her or get the PoA. So AITA for not wanting to show it off to her.

Edit: I really appreciate all of the comments and advice people have given me. I will take them to heart. And as I have commented. I have set a time that both of us are free to discuss this issue more in depth. I will make another edit once we have that conversation. Which will be this weekend.

Update: We have officially sat down and discussed all options. We discussed keeping finances apart from the conversations with friends and family. She agreed after some more in depth co conversations regarding that. We moved on to the topic of PoAs. She stated she doesnt want access to that account. She could care less. She just wants on for in case if accidents or illnesses we can continue paying Bill's out of the others account. (PoAs for both of us) We looked at different types and explored different avenues with them. We will be researching further to see if it is something we really need/want. We discussed the account itself in more depth. I.e what it is going to be used for more specific amount in there and what I am willing to use for the house and what needs to be left alone. I showed the last tax document I had on it and that was fine for her. She said the reason she wanted to view it. Was 1. Wanted to see a price range of houses and when it would be available to use for that. 2. She has been lied to about money like that in the past from an ex boyfriend. 3. She has never seen an account with that much in it and was just excited regarding it. The final thing we talked about was a prenup. Went over why I might want one. She told me that if I would feel more comfortable with the marriage if I got one she would have no issues with it. That it is money that I worked for and I can do whatever I please with it. (Side note: she jokingly said we better have a hell of a honeymoon) 
There was more we talked about but not going into full detail. Overall it was worthwhile to have that sitdown. 

Also showed her all the comments on this post and she laughed at how many people told me to GTFO but she could see where they were coming from.

210,Not the A-hole,"I charge 2000$ for a typical wedding day. For close family members I charge them 1000$, so 50% discount. Friends of mine who are the groom and bride, asked me to lower it to 700$. I said I can't and I'll happily give them the family rate though, so 1000$. They said it's still too much, so they asked me how they can have it at 700$ by telling me I don't have to cull and edit the images; just give them the unedited files, they'll do it themselves. I said I can't, 'cause that's not how I work and the post-production is half of what my work is and that If I do that it wouldn't bring me any satisfaction or make me grow as a professional.

By the way, a few months ago, for that same bride and groom, I photographed their engagement ceremony for free as a gift 'cause we're good friends. About 5-6 hours of work including editing.

Sometimes later, the couple told a a mutual friend of ours how they're dissapointed in me and our friendship that I declined their offer of 700$. I never told our friends about that deal gone bad.

Apparently, bride&groom are dissapointed 'cause 2 years ago when I started getting into wedding photography, I said I'd photograph their wedding for free and she said ""no no i'll pay you"". I said that 'cause I didn't think I'd take the job seriously like nowadays.

According to that mutual friend of ours, now there's a little bit of tension between us (bride&groom and me). Then that friend wants me to give them a surprise prewedding photoshoot to win back their friendship. The bride and groom didn't ask for anything of me. I never felt or thought I lost their friendship, they still invited me to their wedding as a guest. I told that mutual friend, well I don't really feel that tension and it was business and nothing personal regarding their wedding photography meeting with me.

211,Not the A-hole,"I work on the office management team at a quickly growing office in a large city. We have two employee fridges that are meant to service 230 people - clearly, not a working ratio. We have a policy that all food in these fridges must be labeled with a name and date, but people are terrible about following it. This leads to food piling up in the fridge, as people forget about it, and because it isn't labeled, we have no way of knowing how long it has been in there and when it should be tossed. I have straight up found a whole avocado with MOLD on it, which I didn't even know was possible. We have tried pretty much everything to get people to label their food - there are huge signs on the fridges noting the labeling policy, we've sent emails, in person requests. Nothing. And the problem is only getting worse as our office grows.

So, fed up, I decided to try something new. In the past, we've given days worth of notice for cleaning out the fridge, and people make a mad dash at the last minute to pull their food out and label it, instead of labeling it in the first place. Not this time. I send a quick message on our in office messaging system letting people know we'd be cleaning in half an hour, and anything not labeled was going. True to my word, I was ruthless. I saved all dishware and put in the dishwasher, but everything not labeled, even if I could tell it had been put in just that day, gone.

Predictably, this went over like a lead balloon. Come lunch time, there were a fair amount of people (maybe 20) who approached me, angry that their food had been thrown away and that they would have to buy lunch. They felt their privacy was violated because I opened up lunch bags to see what was inside, and tossed them. They felt the company should pay for their lunch. I basically turned each of them away, stating that this was our policy, it's been on the fridge, the food should have been labeled. Since this, our fridges have looked WAY better, and almost everything is labeled! But there are definitely members of the office who still give me the stink eye.

I started to feel a little bad, though, because I supposed I could have spared the food that I could tell was brand new, and just left a stern note on it. But I feared this would cause people to not take it seriously, and to just keep ignoring it.

So, AITA for enacting The Purge on our fridges?

EDIT: I have been cleaning the fridge once a week for about a month now. Additionally, the rule about food needing to be labeled or it will be thrown away is not new. I personally think that waiting till after lunch is basically giving people a free pass to break the rule for the sake of being kind. It's gotten to the point, with 230 people and 2 fridges, that there is not enough room at times for everyone to store their food. It seems unfair to me to let people continue to get away with it.

EDIT 2: I stated earlier that cleaning the fridge is not my job. I think I misspoke a bit out of frustration. I assumed that most people understood the general responsibilities of office management. My boss has asked me to take fridge cleanliness under greater consideration as the office grow. What I mean is that I am not a janitor, and I have other things to do than clean out the fridge for 2 hours every Friday because people can't be bothered to follow the policy. If people label their food, cleaning the fridge becomes as easy as poking my head in, and tossing everything that is over 2 weeks old.

216,Asshole,"To start off: I do have a partner. We've been dating for almost one and a half years, but we are not planning on getting married anytime soon.

  


We've talked about marriage, and we've both agreed that we want to get married some day, but we want to wait a few years.

  


Here's my ""problem"" (if you can even call it that): I want a ring. Not a wedding ring, not an engagement ring, not a promise ring - I don't even want my partner to buy said ring, I merely want to *have* a ring.

  


I really like the look and feel of rings, and so I've been thinking about buying myself one for quite some time. I had one earlier, but I lost it and now I kinda miss having one.

  


Thing is... I hate having rings on my right hand, and I don't think they look good on any other finger than the ringfinger. So it would look like I'm engaged/married.

  


I haven't asked my partner about it, because A: I feel like I shouldn't have to ask permission to wear jewlery, and B: I'm worried what my partner would think. Like, is it an asshole move? Would it be weird to ask? Is it asshole-y to everyone around me that would get the impression that I am to be wed?

  


Am I just overthinking this? Because I feel some people might take offence and feel deceived. I remember hearing about a single girl wearing a ring on her left ring finger to make men stop flirting with her and people called her a bitch, but that might have been in a movie or something so maybe it's not a good example.

  


Thing is, I want to know if it's a faux pas or not.

  


Tl;dr

I want to buy myself a ring to wear on my left ring finger, but I'm not engaged or married. WIBTE if I did?



EDIT: Thanks for all the replies! I realized that, yeah, I am TAH. I decided to ask my partner about it after this realization, and when I did they basically said ""you do you boo"". Digging deeper into my partner's feelings about it, they eventually told me. Our conversation as I can remember it:

Me: you still haven't told me how you *actually* feel about it

Partner: does it matter? You clearly want that ring

Me: yeah, but I want to know that you're ok with it first

Partner: look, *I* don't care about it, but others might. Next time we see my parents you'll have to explain it. Next time you see any of your friends, or my friends. For a LONG time, every time you see someone you haven't seen since before you got that ring you'll have to explain that 'nah, I'm not married, I just got a weird need to wear my ring on THIS particular finger'

Me: you think it's weird, then

Partner: that's what you took away from it?


After that we basically argued for a little while, they're right obviously. It's too much of a hassle to have to explain to everyone and just like a few of you mentioned it would put a weird pressure on my partner to propose. I think they felt it that way too, that this was some passive aggressive way to get them to propose, which is not at all what I wanted.

I've apologized profusely and they've forgiven me. I won't be buying a ring, and if I do I'll suck it up and wear it on my right hand.

Thanks for all the advice, and for letting me know I was in the wrong. I guess I really needed a self-awareness check.

221,No A-holes here,"So I have [anomic aphasia](https://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-definitions/) and finding words on the spot during a conversation is quite difficult for me. Sometimes I get made fun of for stuttering, other times people assume I'm not all mentally there, and frequently I just sound stupid. And nobody knows what aphasia is without a google search.

This is frustrating because I know that I'm not actually stupid, and I've noticed that with people who have english as a second language, they get far more leeway with being able to pause during sentences, correct themselves mid-sentence and using slightly off-grammar and word choice.

My mother is a Kenyan native who grew up with english as her third language (Other two: Kiswahili and Kikuyu). My first language is English; I know conversational Kiswahili, yet I adopted a generic American accent to fit in better at school. After growing up hearing nothing but my mother's voice, I could easily replicate her accent. It would take a little practice since I'm surrounded by Americans, but generally whenever I visit Kenya, I adopt the local accent anyway to put villagers at ease.

222,No A-holes here,"So this happened a while ago, but I was recently reminded of it.

As some context, I’m Chinese, and in our culture, a lot of times when you meet an older person in an informal context, you call them your big sis/ bro/ aunt/ uncle/ etc. 

My parents were sitting with a bunch of people at church and introduced me to a little girl (around 2-3 years old) sitting at the table. They cheerily introduced me to her and asked her to call me big sister. I am 25 years old, so I laughed it off and said “oh it’s okay, you can call me auntie, I’m a bit old to be your sister!” 

The room got really quiet and my parents said “No, you’re an older sister.” They then quickly turned back to their friends and changed the subject. Later my mom pulled me aside and said that the little girl was a daughter of a couple who conceived in their 50s, and my comment touched a nerve regarding their fertility and lost years of being a parent.

I thought it was a bit ridiculous that they were offended because I AM old enough to be the little girl’s mother/ aunt and the fact that they had a child in their later years doesn’t change this. I also didn’t know the parents of this girl either so my comment wasn’t made out of carelessness or maliciousness.

Anyway, recently we had a “bring your kid to work” day and a lady at my office, who is obviously in her 60s, brought a child (8-9 years) with her. I thought it was her grandson, but because  we never talked about her personal life before and because of this previous incident, I decided to ask her if this was her son. Cue a lot of teasing from the other people in the office for making such an “obvious” mistake.

Due to some of her own behaviors, and his better lawyers, it's looking like she'll get very little from the divorce and was ordered separate and needed a place to live. She has a very young daughter and I suspect might be pregnant (with her husband's kid, but I think she might want to get an abortion so I've not brought it up). I own a house with more than enough space, so I was happy to open my house to her. I told her to stay as long as she needed and I'll help with my niece no problem. 

It's been a few months now, and it was going well, but recently I just feel like I want my own space back. She's rarely underfoot and they keep to their own area of the house, and she cleans up after herself, cooks for me occasionally, so no problems there. But I just am a little tired of living with a child and my sister and I just want to get on with my normal life. She is also still in contact with her husband, so every once and a while I have to listen to her argue with him which makes me feel anxious in my own home. She also works from home very often so sometimes I just feel like I can't do what I want to do because I know she's there.

227,No A-holes here,"My boyfriend (32) and I, (F,30) have been living together for around 3 years. He is going back to college at the end of the month to finish his Masters degree that he never was able to complete before we got together. 

I work a really good job that I love and for the most part, have been supporting us anyway, although he does contribute. Maybe like 20-25% of everything. This doesn't bother me at all, I'm happy to pay more as I earn more. Now he's going back to college for a year and won't be earning any money. The only reason he is going back he says, is because I can afford to support us for the year but honestly, I really don't see why I have to. We're not married (don't believe in it) and I really don't want kids, so it's not like eventually i'll have to support a family. I like money and sleep. I'm selfish, so sue me.

AITA for not wanting to support him for a year? I'm pretty certain his parents would love to have him home for a year, but ofcourse at 32 I can understand why he wouldn't want to do that. This is a non-starter conversation for him. He says if he were to move back in with them, that we may as well break up. I wish he would have spoken to me about it before he quit his job otherwise I'd have said that I don't agree with it, would have suggested why not doing it part time so you could still work etc.

I feel like i'm being taken advantage of. I broke up with my ex because I was supporting him 100% and I resented it after a while. It will literally drive me insane knowing that he's not getting up for work, and is running up the utility bills because he's going to be home all day. He'll be in college some days but will be home most of the time working on whatever it is he needs to do.

Edit: so it's pretty equal on whether I am the a-hole or not, but from responses (thank you, whatever you said) I clearly need to clarify a few things.

1. There was only ever a fleeting conversation when we were over at his parents and he said out of the blue, ""I'm thinking of finishing my masters"" his parents were so excited about it, and as it turns out, and they have retired with pretty substantial wealth, and have paid for him to go back to school. I found this out after calling them to voice my concerns. 

2. For those picking up on that 'I like money', I've been independent from my direct family since I was 17. I've been poor. REALLY poor. Making soup out tomato ketchup and hot water poor. Everything I have done has been so I can make my life as I want it. I work freelance and I'm really good at it, I'm not going to apologise for that. Also means that I have no back up if something was to happen to me, so my savings are for if/when that happens. 

3. My bf and I have had a conversation since I posted about this. I felt it was important. He still stands by if he was to go to his parents that we should break up. What I meant by him moving back to them for the year, that was when someone here said we would see each other when we could. His parents are closer to school and where we are is like 1.5 hours away. He's too proud for that though. 

4. Sure, whether he goes or stays my rent will be the same, but I'm not getting that 20-25% from which I've been able to save with my income. 

5. His masters is in something to do with English literature, and the job that he just quit, for all I knew he loved it. Now he's quit to do a (in my eyes) pointless masters? No. If it was medical school or engineering or a good job where he NEEDED a masters, I'd probably be more on board with it.

6. He suffers from anxiety, and will only ever do anything he would be able to do. Which means no part time job.

7. If we'd have actually talked and decided on this new path together, I would have no bones about it. But the arrogance and flippant nature of his attitude that I would foot the bill for a year has really upset and angered me. We're committed to each other and he pulls this on me? No.",422,1214,0.96

233,No A-holes here,"**Edit:** since everyone is focusing on my annoyance at her choice of dates and not the ACTUAL issue which is my vacation time, let me be clear: sure, I am slightly annoyed they want to have their wedding at around the same time as mine, but I would NEVER actually say that to them, or anyone other than my fiance (who agrees with me). The real issue is that I get exactly 10 days of vacation time per year, all of which are already accounted for in 2020. This is the reason why I can't attend the wedding if they choose to have it in 2020. And no I am not shortening my trip that is already planned with my dying father.

&#x200B;

In mid-July my fiance proposed to me. We had been together for 4.5 years at that point and everyone in his family had been telling him for years to put a ring on it (I'm 30F and he's 31M). His family has been so excited for us and have been really involved with the wedding planning. Our date has been set since the day we got engaged for October 3, 2020, and everyone in his/my family has been aware of this. We already have our venue/photographer/catering/wedding cake booked.

My fiance and I live on the East Coast, his family lives on the West Coast, and my family lives in the Mid-West. We're going to have the wedding in his hometown because 90% of the guest list is his huge family, and it will be easier for us to travel to them rather than have all of them travel to get to our wedding. I have a very small family (just my mom and dad, no siblings or cousins or anything).

After we planned all of this, we learned that my dad has cancer. At this point we are not sure if he is going to be alive on my wedding date, which I'm really sad about. I don't get home much to see him because travel is expensive and I only get 2 weeks off per year, so I see my family once every two years (my fiance and I do a weeklong vacation just the two of us each year, and then alternate seeing his family/my family every other year with our other week of vacation).

We've decided that for 2020, we are going to spend one week with my mom and dad in the winter, so I can see my dad, and then use our second week of vacation time for our wedding. We are postponing our honeymoon until 2021.

Well, two weeks ago my fiance's youngest brother proposed to his girlfriend of 10 months (they're 24M and 23F). I was texting her shortly after they got engaged and asked her when she was thinking of doing the wedding and her response was ""not really sure, we don't have any set plans and I want time to plan and save up and make sure it's perfect, but maybe Fall 2020.""

My heart kind of sank because Fall 2020 is when I am getting married. Not trying to be a bridezilla or anything and tell her she can't get married next Fall, but to be honest I'd definitely be kind of annoyed. Especially since my fiance and I have been together for way longer, and we've had Fall 2020 planned before they even got engaged.

The other thing is that if they get married in 2020, we definitely will not be able to attend their wedding since we've already allocated all of our vacation time to our wedding/visiting my dad. I told my fiance we should tell his brother that if they have their wedding next year we wont be able to attend, so he could consider that when choosing a date, but he disagrees and says we should just wait for them to pick a date and if it happens to be in 2020 let them know we can't go. He doesn't want them to think we are trying to tell them when they can or can't have their wedding.

235,Not the A-hole,"I recently took a trip to South Korea with my girlfriend. One of the highlights of the trip was the DMZ tour we took. On that tour, one of the places they take you is this train station that is supposed to be used for relations between North and South Korea. In practice it is mostly for show, but it is a symbol of reunification.

At this train station, they have a stamp you can get that says the name of the station and Pyongyang, like a ticket between the two locations. Our guide explained no train actually goes to Pyongyang, but it is like a wish for the future. We were told by the guide that we should absolutely not put this stamp in our passports because it could cause problems with immigration officers in both Korea and the USA in particular. There is also a sign next to the stamps telling you not to stamp your passports or currency.

So on arrival in Korea, my girlfriend was upset because they do not stamp your passports on entry/exit. Instead you get a little paper ticket. She has a fresh passport and likes to collect stamps from the places she's been, so she wanted to put the train station stamp in her passport. I said, for the reasons explained above, that she shouldn't do it. She pressed the issue, but I was holding our passports and ultimately refused to give her the passport. Instead, we put the stamp on our itinerary booklet which we have kept as a kind of keepsake.

Additional info:

* We have gotten novelty stamps in our passports before (at Machu Picchu) but I don't think it's the same because the government doesn't care if you go to Peru.

* There was a second stamp that said the train station name and some stuff in Korean I can't read, but it was with the other stamp with the sign that said not to put it in your passport. She asked about only doing this one but I still didn't give her the passport.

* We saw other people putting the stamp in their passport, but I they weren't from the USA (which has banned travel to North Korea), and I don't think other people breaking the rules means it's ok for us to do it.

On the one hand it's not my passport, but on the other hand we always travel together and I would be very upset if we ever got held up by immigration agents over the stamp, potentially missing a flight or generally just being inconvenienced. 

So AITA for not letting her put the stamp in her passport?

**-----EDIT-----**

While I appreciate everyone's feedback, to the people calling my girlfriend dumb, immature, etc. I would like to state that she is none of these things. She was mainly pushing for the stamp with the station name that I described in the additional info, which is probably less risky than the one that says Pyongyang in English. However, because we were still told not to put it in the passport, the minor argument happened. She's a lovely person so please be kind whatever your verdict.",175,622,0.94

Today is my work from home day, and before my sister left I took her house key. She went to school, came back around 12:20, and asked me to let her in. I pretended not to hear her. She said I was being immature. I said she could come back inside at 3:15. She said she couldn't get lunch now and I said ""not my problem, should have thought of it sooner"". She stomped off and I called the school about 20 minutes ago, and the confirmed my sister came back after lunch. AITA? Not for the making her go to school part but the taking her key so she couldn't get lunch part?

251,Not the A-hole,"I (24f) live with my girlfriend (25). My brother, Tom, (18) recently moved in with us. He's starting at university this week and doesn't pay rent yet but says that once his student finance comes through or he gets a job he'll begin to contribute 1/3 of the rent/bills/food each month.

Tom has a few friends from university who come over, which I don't mind. All his friends live with roommates or their parents so me and my girlfriend not really giving a shit about what they do so long as it doesn't get them arrested is often seen as a welcome reprieve.

However, Tom has this one friend, Jack, who is here a lot. Jack is about 19 and cannot seem to get over the fact that myself and my girlfriend are lesbians.

Whenever we kiss we can feel Jack staring (even if it's just a quick peck before one of us goes to work), one time he actually whistled, and then yesterday I was cooking dinner when my girlfriend arrived home and hugged me from behind and we heard Jack say ""oh, dinner and a show"".

Tom has told Jack to knock it off when he heard him but it seems to have had a somewhat limited effect.

Then this morning we were eating breakfast (me, Tom, Jack and my girlfriend were all there) and I accidentally spilled some orange juice down my neck and onto my chest. I asked my girlfriend to pass me a napkin, and after I've wiped it off and gone back to eating I saw Jack with a weird look on his face and heard Tom say under his breath ""didn't need that image"".

I asked Tom for help clearing stuff away, and once the other 2 were gone I asked him what he meant earlier and he, obviously embarrassed and mildly disgusted, said Jack had made a dumb joke. I asked him what the joke was and he didn't want to tell me. I asked him again, and he said that Jack had said something about my girlfriend licking the juice off me.

I felt as disgusted as Tom looked, and after both boys went out for the day, I told my girlfriend what Tom had told me. She was as grossed out as I was.

I texted Tom saying ""see Jack when you like, but don't bring him here again. That wasn't the first time he's been gross about me and my girlfriend and that little juice joke of his hit my limit"".

Tom says that the text had come up while he was showing Jack something on his phone, and Jack is now mad at Tom for telling me what Jack said this morning. Jack also says that he liked going to the flat and hates hanging around his house, so he doesn't want to be banned.

Tom says that he respects it's my place but he'll be paying rent, too, soon, which makes it both of ours. He says if Jack really makes us uncomfortable then he'll figure something out but by texting him I've caused an issue with Jack, and I need to treat him and his friends like adults, not tell him who he can and can't see.

252,Not the A-hole,"I'm currently in high school and last Halloween I found out two things: my dad had been smoking at work on and off for ten years and my mom was cheating on my dad by texting nudes to other people. But here's the catch: my mom didn't know that I found out what she was doing. So my dad told me I had to keep it a secret.

At first I couldn't believe it. I am raised in a very family centered church and the thought of something like this happening to my family wasn't something I fathomed. I couldn't find comfort in anybody because I was worried it would somehow find it's way that back to my mother that I knew.

I was very hurt. My dad disclosed more info by saying she did it before 10 years ago and he would smoke to help with his anxiety (he got diagnosed and is now on medication to help.  Been clean for almost 10 months). My mom lying to my family for the majority of my life hurt so much. I was so scared my family was going to fall apart.

Surprisingly, it didnt. My parents were able to work it out and in March, my mother found out that I knew. I was at an audition while they were fighting, so I had to wait an hour by myself because my parents were too busy fighting to answer the phone. When I came home that night, my mother said she understood if I never trusted her again. 

I haven't been able to and it's been 8 months. Every few weeks she yells at me for treating her like trash and every time I just have to accept it because I don't trust or respect her much anymore.

So, AITA for not forgiving my mom for cheating on my dad?

Edit: my mom also lied to our church about the cheating and that is something that hits a little too close to me. She was the one that raised me to follow and believe in the church and it feels like she's a hypocrite for not following it herself.",249,784,0.96
253,Asshole,"For background: Ive been living with my roommate in a 2 bd 2 bth for 1 month now. Before we moved in we discussed my boyfriend and I did say he would be spending the night some nights. She accepted it.

Ok. So, yesterday my roommate texted me and asked me if my boyfriend spending the weekend with me is going to be a weekly thing, I said yes. She proceeded to tell me her issues with that and due to “past roommates” she doesn’t feel comfortable with him spending the nights with me on the weekend because she wants to fully relax on the weekend but “cant” because theres a man in the apartment (She didn’t go into full detail about what happened with her past roomies) 

The problem is, Im a full time student, and my boyfriend works full time Mon-Fri, and we both live an hour away from each other. So obviously, Friday night- Sunday afternoon is an ideal situation for us to spend time together. 

I don’t want to compromise with her because there really isn’t any comprising that can be done besides, “don’t bring him over every week,” which I don’t feel comfortable with, since I am paying rent, and I am a grown woman.

Granted, as a woman, I can understand her uncomfortableness at a certain degree, like if my boyfriend was just roaming around the apartment. Using our stuff, or being in the common areas, but he’s NOT. 

My boyfriend stays in my room the whole time he stays with me, unless he uses my bathroom which is right across my room so its a 2 second walk outside my room. My boyfriend doesn’t go in the kitchen what so ever, or anywhere besides my bedroom. The only time my roommate has seen my boyfriend was when she was moving her things in the beginning of the month, so he could introduce himself. Im also very courteous of her as we are very quiet in my room, we have tried everything to do to accommodate to her.

So, AITA for not accepting her compromise and her point of view? 

TLDR; roomie feels uncomfortable with boyfriend spending weekend with me in my bedroom but shes never seen him, or heard him, his “presence,” makes her uncomfortable.",1250,2043,0.91
254,Asshole,"Ok so I know I should probably let this go, I don't need the money but the principle of it annoys me.

I have run a softball team for 10+ years now and we always have new people join the team, every season I front the team registration and everyone pays me their portion based on how many people are playing.

This year we had a new player, they agreed to pay, and at several games kept saying sorry I forgot to pay you send me an email to remind me. They made no objection to paying their share.

But by the end of the season everyone had paid me but this person, meaning effectively with their 72 dollars outstanding the season has ended and I've paid 144 to play for the season while this person paid zero and everyone else paid 72.

I've sent several emails and a text message to the person asking to be paid and it's all been ignored.

Now I know what this person does for a living, and it took me all of 10 seconds to find them on LinkedIn and see where they work. We work in the same industry and I know this person is easily making a 6 figure salary. Their ability to pay is not in question. (Neither is my ability to absorb the cost)

WIBTA if I used some of my contacts to reach out to their boss and feign concern for them by saying hey, I've been trying to get a hold of C for a couple of weeks as they owe me for our softball fees, but they have not been responding and I want to make sure they are ok and have not had something happen?

I'm 99% sure they just don't want to pay me but this might shame them into it.

255,Asshole,"I had to work two part-time jobs to pay for school. That set me back even further because I didn't have time to do any meaningful internships or volunteering so I had to hustle for a long time before making it and I did it without any connections. It was like every college student that I went to school with did not have a job. Their parents supported them financially in one way or another.
I decided to fund a scholarship at my alma mater. The requirements aren't too much except that the award can only go to students working more than 20 hours a week. I funded four scholarships covering a year's tuition plus expenses and it's been available since Fall 2019 and not one person has gotten it because every person who applied for it doesn't work.
The school administration asked that I drop the work requirement because it's preventing ""needy"" students from continuing their education (and because so many students are applying for it), but if you cannot afford school and you don't want to work to off-set the costs then I think you're just being lazy. No, college doesn't require someone to be studying 50 hours a week and college is not a right. It's not lost on me that a lot of students who do receive financial aid ended up dropping out anyways so I want the award to go to someone who shows that determination.",59,36,0.78

257,Not the A-hole,"I discovered a new favorite lunch restaurant. I visited about 8x over 3-4 weeks but on my last visit I bit into a piece of metal. (Salad place, Subway style) I showed the staff and didn't finish my food. They only sort of shrugged it off and did a brief ""sorry.""  Ok, probably too dismissive but really what can they do now.

I left and posted the photo of the metial piece on their Tripadvisor page with a brief, factual comment about the experience. 1/5 stars. Metal in food is a no no. This is their only 1 star out of 500+ ratings. 

I returned after a month to try it again and decided one bad experience may not be an honest reflection of their quality. The staff were acting strangely and then apologized and offered to give me my meal for free. I declined the free meal but they refused my $10, after I insisted and they refused, I stuffed it in the tip jar on the counter in front of them. (Just a tad more than my order total).  I don't want freebies. I ordered the food and am happy to pay for it. The complaint was genuine, I didn't want them to think I was just trying to get freebies.

Upon leaving they stood in front of the door and starting asking me about my Tripadvisor review. I affirmed it was me (we are responsible for our words, even if online), and they started saying how their boss was angry and yelled at them and they really need me to take it down. It was uncomfortable because I didnt just agree and I wouldn't say what they wanted to hear, i.e. that I would just do it. I slipped by and left.

259,Not the A-hole,"I (f) own a piercing and tattoo studio and take pride in doing things properly. For those of you who don't know, piercing guns are generally very very bad. Although most people say ""I had mine done with a gun and they are fine"", it's still a poor way of piercing as a gun forces the jewellery through the lobe causing trauma to the skin, meaning that, if you decide not to have the piercing anymore, the holes are less likely to heal and the scars will be more thick and visible. Also, you cannot properly sterilise a piercing gun, and they break/get stuck often. It's also easier to pierce with needles as you can be 100% sure of where the hole is going to go. Because of this, I always pierce with needles and make sure my staff do too. 

My sister is 18 and has a 5 month old baby girl. I love my sister and my niece to death but my sister was insisting on piercing her daughter's ears, and assumed I would do it. In my studio, we don't pierce babies because of the chances of the piercings being uneven when they grow up, and simply because as the owner I don't think it's fair to pierce someone who cannot give their consent to the procedure. There's also the added issues of babies not knowing it's bad to play with new piercings, the risk of them falling asleep on the piercing and hurting it, and I've also heard of parents not cleaning the piercings properly because they're ""worried about hurting the baby"". I told my sister, when she asked when she could bring my niece in, that I would not do it. 

She said that if I don't, she'll go to Claire's and get them done there. I thought she was just trying to goad me into doing it to be honest, so I rolled my eyes and that was it (we've had chats before about why piercing at Claire's is bad). The next day she messaged saying she was in the mall and she was serious, and I have ten minutes to say I'll do it.

I ignored her, so she called me, we had a small fight in which she insisted I do it, or Claire's does, so I eventually agreed. 

She brought my niece into my studio, and I pierced her ears. It was actually quite a smooth process but my niece obviously cried. My sister actually paid me, which surprised me, and then she left, happy she got what she wanted. 

I feel awful, and unprofessional. This was a couple of weeks ago and the piercings are healing well.

I have a friend who, when we go out to eat, always gets a free water cup and then fills it with soda. I do not think that this is a big deal, but I do think it's sleazy. We're not broke kids; we're both in our 30s, have decent jobs and could totally afford a small soda. In addition to being cheap, he generally has a ""fuck the man, they can afford to lose 2 cents"" attitude.

One day at Chipotle, as he was filling his water cup with Sprite, I yelled, ""hey man, that's Sprite not water!"". It was like a record scratched in the restaurant. Everyone went silent.

262,Asshole,"My fiancé (m21) and I(m21) live with his parents and sister in their home with our 6mo old daughter. We had a place of our own but some unexpected medical surprises due to my pregnancy made it impossible for us to afford rent so his parents were nice enough to let us move into their basement, which has been converted into a one bed/one bath apartment for as much as we can pay each month. Other than rent we're treated as family and therefore spend a great deal of time together.

I've had severe Celiac's Disease since I was 12. I discovered this after having to be hospitalized due to severe dehydration because of the vomiting and diarrhea brought on by eating gluten products. I don't eat anything with gluten anymore because of how rich it makes me. My fiancé's parents and sister (18) know this and support me in my efforts to remain healthy. I can't work right now because there would be no one to watch the baby and I fell last year and tore my ACL which pays me disability while I'm getting back to normal. With my disability I purchase all of our personal items (condoms, food and drink treats, diapers, formula, baby things) but his mom is the primary grocery shopper. I give her a little of my disability money in efforts to keep my presence in the home respectful. His mother is kind enough to buy and cook many things I can safely eat, therefore modifying her entire family's diet to a certain extend. However, no one has complained and in fact my FSIL and FFIL have both enthusiastically embraced it, having seen positive health changes.

But I would never force my diet on anyone and would support my family if they wanted to eat more gluten products. They choose not to eat like that anymore.

My FSIL's 18th birthday was a couple days ago. FMIL is an amazing baker and she always bakes beautiful, home-made birthday cakes. FSIL requested chocolate on chocolate so FMIL made a triple layer scratch chocolate cake with homemade chocolate cream cheese frosting, complete with little pink rosettes. It was beautiful. I couldn't wait to eat it.

FMIL informed me that the cake had been made with gluten products. This means I couldn't eat any of it. I was very upset and asked her why she didn't make it so everyone could enjoy it. I pointed out that she makes an amazing gluten-free chocolate cake that FSIL raved about because she made it last month for my own birthday. I told her I realize I don't control her or what she does but she's never had a problem being inclusive before and I explained that I was really hurt. In the end we couldn't come to any sort of stalemate and I went back to the basement apartment with the baby while everyone ate and enjoyed the amazing cake. I know this wasn't my day so I shouldn't even complain but literally every other meal or treat FMIL has made since my fiancé and I moved in six months ago has been all-inclusive. And they all seem to really enjoy the positive effects the diet is having on them.

AITA?

ETA: FSIL didn't request a regular cake. Actually what she said was ""that cake you made for Shireen's birthday will be good.""

ETA 2: I accept that I am definitely an asshole here. My behavior was unacceptable and childish. Apologies have already been made and everyone is okay with each other now. We're moving on to new things now, my family and I. I think my FFIL is upset because FMIL bought Great Value brand peanuts instead of Planters, lol.

264,Not the A-hole," 

First post here.

So please give advice, but be respectful....

We (37M) and wife (35F) and kid (2F) are hosting my wife's ""Z"" (28F) sister and won't clean. I really like all my wife's family, but Z made a big action recently that really spoke to me as the type of person she is.

So, backstory, Me and my wife recently moved to a new city; Z came to stay about 2 weeks after the move in. My wife's family is huge (I am a single child); not the first member that had stayed with us for an extended period of time. They typically help and are very courteous. I was under the impression that ""Z"" was coming out to help us and take a little break from life.

Additionally, I am generally the person who makes food for my family; as I enjoy cooking, so I have literally covered Z's costs and prepared the majority of her food. I have asked that she help out with household chores; and Z has complied with varying degrees. I have had to ask her or my wife directly for her to clean up after herself. I though we got a good place, but with contsant coaching and reminding (Z is 28F).

Today, I lost it. We have two dogs, not a new development for Z, and there was a dog poo-bomb that was dropped in the house.

Z took notice of said poo-bomb, decided to ignore it, and let it sit for 4 hours while my wife and I working full time come home to this shit-tas-tropy.

Z casually said, they are not my dogs.

I asked why she didn't help out the house, oh my mom (who does not live here) supports me. (They have a brother who drops off a dog now and then at her permanent home)

Should a 28F be expected to take initiative and help a house that they are living in?

Am I the Ass Hole? for wanting her out?

265,Not the A-hole,"So my sister got married 8 years ago, and did a regular facebook update ""Happy anniv to my hubby"" etc etc. I liked the post and went about my day not thinking anything of it, I mean its just an 8th wedding anniversary, not a 1st, not a 10th or 50th.  The next day I got a message saying that I was out of order not to congratulate her on it. I pretty much immediately said sorry that she was hurt by that but I just didn't consider an 8th wedding anniversary an important one that requires a message of congratulations and then went about being interested about what she did for it etc. Apparently that was a big mistake, since she cited ""all the other friends who responded to her facebook post"" and how she thinks it's sad that her friends did but she didn't hear from her family (I'm the only one she's taking it out on though).

Now firstly I checked the fb post, the responses from her friends were just 'congratulations', a pretty typical not emotive response to a fb post of such calibre.   
Now I actually make quite an effort with my sister, I help her out a lot with technical things, give her advice, have been a shoulder to cry on, make a huge effort with her son. I would argue that out of everyone of our family I make the most effort, and it's rarely reciprocated but hey. What rubbed me up the wrong way was despite me mentioning that is it worth her getting that upset saying it's sad that it seems like I don't care when if anything I can show her that my day to day actions should prove that if anything I care quite a bit and not congratulating on an 8th wedding anniv shouldn't suddenly mean I don't. 

After listing all the things that I do do for her her only response: ""Well (step parents) got us a card"". It really annoyed me that she completely ignored everything I said in my defence of my character and I simply said ""So you're only caring about the material then?""  
She then responded with ""Goodbye""

I haven't heard from her in a month. Now my sister can get quite volatile and have arguments with anyone and everyone and goes through phases of not speaking to people due to some way they have offended her, I felt resolute in that I was just going to wait for her to say she was being ridiculous but it's been a while now and I don't think I can concede to her again like I so often do.

It wasn't an amazing job, but it was within his industry (sound engineering) and it had potential for promotion later down the line. He was able to go on gigs and be involved with venues to a certain extent, which is what he really wants to do, but it's extremely normal to start off in the warehouses. Anyway, he's taken a lot of sick days in the past month. I'd say around four or five? Mostly for things I'd consider fairly minor - headaches, a cold. One of those days was because I was in the hospital, so I won't hold that against him. But the rest? I feel like he should definitely be going into work on those days. I've told him as such. But I don't actually know how sick he is? In the past I've had absolutely debilitating migraines/cluster headaches that have left me bedbound, so I know that they can be serious. But he's been risking his income! We're not rich, we don't have a lot of money. He already owes me approximately £500 for bills and rent this past month, and we need his income.

274,No A-holes here,"My son is 15 and he's always been a sensitive kid, but things have gotten really hard since he's started high school. He doesn't seem to have many close friends, but he joined the football team this year (after participating in a summer program with most of the same kids), so I thought that would be great for him, because my experience with playing team sports was always that I became basically brothers with my team.

Unfortunately, since joining things seem to have gotten even worse. He says that the other boys bully him and he gets extremely upset about it on at least a weekly basis.

I have always tried to comfort him and offer him advice/tell him that bullies aren't worth his time, but recently the team held a fundraiser where I helped out and I got to see the dynamics of my son with the other kids. And as far as I could see, none of it was bullying. It seemed like all the boys were giving each other shit equally, and none of them seemed like they had any sort of a specific problem with my son. He didn't talk much, but he was kind of smiling and going along with it, so I don't think any of the other boys knew he was taking their teasing to heart.

I thought maybe they were being nice to him because I and other parents were around, but as soon as we got in the car he broke down in tears and said ""See? They all hate me"" and went on for some time.

I didn't really know how to respond, so I sort of was just sympathetic without committing to anything, but now I'm wondering how to handle this. My honest opinion is that I think my son needs to toughen up- in my whole life, this has just been my experience of how men tend to act, especially in groups. They show brotherhood through giving each other shit but then always being there when things are bad. But I don't know how to say that to him in a helpful way besides trying to point out specifically examples of how they were all treating each other the same way. 

WIBTA if I tried to tell him that he's overreacting and taking things too personally, and that nobody is trying to bully him?

Edit:

1. Thanks for all the advice. I will be talking to my wife and showing her this post, and I think after that we will probably reach out to his pediatrician to educate ourselves on the options for therapy before we talk to him. There have been a lot of really good comments about how to present it to him as an option without making him feel like we think he's mentally ill or needs to be fixed, so I appreciate that.

2. Many people have asked if I was the one who forced football on him. I did not, he's always loved watching and playing sports and it was his idea and decision to join this team. He hasn't said anything about wanting to quit to get away from these kids, and I don't plan to bring that up unless he does it himself.

3. A lot of people have commented on my use of the phrase ""toughen up"" and insisted that not all groups of men act this way, and that it is an outdated and toxic way of interacting. I understand that that phrase may not be the best, and may alienate him from me, so I won't use that. But while I appreciate that perspective and I am working on how I will word the conversation with him, I don't think that it is the right answer to just affirm that these kids are mean and that he is right to feel hurt by their words. I recognize that he may never enjoy these types of friendships, and I will encourage him to try and bond with other groups that communicate in a way that he is more comfortable with, but I think it is very important that he realizes that these boys are not trying to bully him. He's going to encounter guys doing this his whole life, and at some point he has to learn not to take take things so personally. I get that if he does have anxiety or something like that then it is easier said than done. Maybe ""toughen up"" wasn't the right way to say it, really all I meant by it though was that he needs to realize that ribbing doesn't mean people dislike him. Even if it isn't the friendships he seeks out or how he prefers to interact, when it happens he needs to learn how to appreciate the intention behind it and let it go, not take it so deeply to heart.

Edit 2:

4. I have no idea if he has depression, autism, ADHD, RSD, or any of the other millions of things that have been suggested on here. I tend to doubt it because there's never really been anything in his life that has made consider anything like that before, and I have no interest in trying to diagnose him or rule things out myself based on descriptions from reddit or wikipedia. The only thing that sounds even remotely like him is anxiety, because he's always been a bit cautious in new situations or when he's unsure of something. But in general he tends to figure things out quickly, and he's always seemed to have plenty of confidence once he's settled in. Of course that's just my perspective and I could be missing things.

My cousin’s daughter Hanna is 8. Ever since she was 4-5, I’ve suspected that she’s on the spectrum. She’s quite intelligent, but lacks basic social skills. She’s never played well with other kids, and has meltdowns when her routines are disrupted. Recently, Hanna’s issues have been getting worse. After she uses the toilet, she refuses to clean herself, and makes her mom do it. She doesn’t shower on her own anymore. 

My cousin is very Catholic, and mental health is a taboo in our culture. She prays to God every day to make her daughter better, but afaik hasn’t done anything towards finding someone in the real world that can help Hanna. 

WIBTA if I told my cousin that I think her daughter is on the spectrum, and that I think she should get therapy?

I’m hesitant because
a.) it’s possible that Hanna’s already in therapy and my cousin is just keeping mum about it
b.) I’m not a qualified mental health professional, and I don’t want to do an armchair diagnosis
c.) it doesn’t feel like it’s my business, as I am not Hanna’s parent

EDIT: Thank you for the judgement and advice! I’m definitely going to talk to my cousin about Hanna. As many commenters suggested, I’m not even going to mention the word “autism” when I talk to Hanna’s parents. I’ll bring up the idea of counseling for Hanna to become more socially adjusted.

Around the time I had first started college I was living in a dorm and had a single room. There were a few other people in my suite and we all shared a bathroom. About a month into starting school I became extremely sick with a mystery illness (intestinal problems--nothing contagious) and was in an out of the hospital for what ended up being the rest of the school year. Right around the time I first got sick I was told to drink a few gallons of the fluid they make you drink in preparation for colonoscopies. The doctor told me to be near a bathroom at all times while taking it and I decided it would be best for everyone in the suite if I just went to my mom's house (she lived not too far away from campus) for the weekend to take the medication. A few hours into me starting to drink the fluid I got a text from one of my suitemates asking if I was in the dorm. I responded that I was not and didn't hear anything back, so I assumed nothing was wrong.

When I went back to school on Monday I realized my alarm had been going off all weekend. I immediately felt horrific and take full responsibility for how much of an asshole I had been that weekend (I had been using a new alarm and had ZERO idea it would continue to go off if no one was there to disable it.) I sent a long apology text to the person who had messaged me and asked to please let me know if something like that ever happened again. I also offered to take everyone out in the suite for coffee/lunch as an apology. The person said it was fine and declined my offer. After that incident my life became a nightmare in the suite. At all hours of the night the person would stand out front of my door and have loud phone conversations, would close doors in my face if they saw me walking towards our suite, and just was overall quite nasty to me. 

About 7 months later I wake up one morning to a very nasty text from the person complaining that they had heard my alarm go off that morning. I thought about the text for a while before responding and basically decided on telling them that if this had been a recurring problem they had failed to communicate with me at all and that every single person in the suite had it within their power to either let me know personally, or take it up with the RA. I mentioned how they had been extremely loud at odd hours as well, but that if I had had a problem with it I would have brought it up promptly instead of letting it get to the point of needing to explode.

I still feel extremely bad and wonder if there was anything I could've done better. I mean, hearing someone else's alarm is extremely annoying and of course I would also snap if it kept happening. At the same time, the person had not even once told me it was going on. I also hadn't told anyone about my medical history, but that's also a significant portion of the story and without it I see how I look like a tremendous asshole.",25,62,0.9

282,Not the A-hole,"My bf and I are in our early 20's, dating for over 2 years.

He met her, twice his age, from an internship years back. She became a pretty reliable confidant to him. He respects her and she cares about his general well being (perhaps a very loose mother/son type of scenario). She is also very fun, open + lively so age isn't a noticeable issue. 

Every so often they get together to catch up. I met her and shes very kind to me. I never had an issue with her or the meetups. 

Their meet ups are usually in a restaurant for dinner/drinks. I knew they planned on meeting again soon so I asked if it was still on. He confirmed but followed it by casually mentioning that this time instead of a restaurant she invited him over to her place so that they could use her hot tub. He mentioned that they planned on getting take out and may smoke some weed, which was extra surprising since they have never done that together before(to my knowledge).

I was baffled at this and how he said it so nonchalantly. I told him that this scenario sounded just like a porn. He scoffed at the idea of it and rolled his eyes without further addressing it.

Once alone, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Along with the double standard of how he would react if I was in that scenario with an older Male friend. 

He said he doesnt understand why I am so uncomfortable with him seeing her. I reiterated that solely based on facts, the scenario sounds unplatonic. He kept repeating that of course nothing was going to happen.

Despite never once having an issue with this friend, I do not believe I am in the wrong for being bothered by it. Perhaps I am feeling more upset that he is blatantly refusing to see the issue from my perspective and is simply making me feel like I am feeling this way over absolutely nothing. It should be known that he has said in the past that he thinks she is pretty fuckable a few times (we are open with those thoughts and I didn't care when he said this at the time but obviously my stance has changed). 

He reminded me that she had invited both of us once before and that I would be invited to this if I was available. He also said it wasnt different from what he goes through when I go to the bars with my friends and surrounded by guys who want to fuck me. But that he trusts me to not do anything that would hurt us and that he would also abide to that.

He seemed mad that I was making this whole thing into an issue...but really if he had just acknowledged my feelings and perhaps offered to change NOT cancel plans, it would have been fine. However he canceled the hot tub for dinner so that I would put this to rest/not be in a foul mood. Yet he still acts cold like I did something wrong.

Unsure what to feel. Partly wish I never brought it up past the conversation where he told me.

283,Not the A-hole,"This happened a few months ago, but has been eating away at me since. Also, sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.

Anyway, my friend and I (along with 2 other roommates) were living in my parents’ rental house. They usually have a strict “no pets” rule, but she had a cat and was in need of a new place to live so they made an exception. They made an agreement with her that she could keep the cat as it didn’t cause any issues between us and our other roommates.

Fast forward a few months and the cat has been an absolute nightmare, it bit people with no provocation, got into everything, and she never cleaned it’s litter box. We tried to get her to do something to control it, but she never changed anything. It caused so many problems that my other roommates moved out and my parents decided to give her an ultimatum, she could stay and get rid of the cat, or keep the cat and leave (giving her a month to find somewhere new). 

My parents asked me not to tell her since it was between them and her, and so I didn’t. I haven’t heard from her since it happened, but she has since moved out and told our mutual friend that I’m a bitch because I didn’t tell her. Even though it was between her and my parents, not her and I.

284,Not the A-hole,"My mom wanted to assist in my wedding planning but when it came to the invites it got a little messy. My [21F] mom [51F] wanted to invite her Aunt [70F] and Uncle [70M] (my great aunt and uncle) to the wedding without telling me. She did a lot without telling me or asking me, including the “theme” of the wedding or where we went to eat afterwards. That was another issue though, just wanted to give insight to the situation.

It’s not that I hate my family, I don’t necessarily care for them in particular because of how they have treated her in the past and how they are very rude/passive aggressive to everyone they pretend to tolerate. On top of that, my great aunt likes to gossip/spread rumors and never keeps her mouth shut, which is the main reason why I can’t stand her especially, out of the two.

My mom brought it to my attention a few days before the wedding that our Aunt and Uncle would get mad if they weren’t invited and they they at least needed to know. I was slightly surprised that I even needed to tell someone that they couldn’t go, due to the fact that they weren’t on the list of very specific invites I gave my mom in the first place. She just decided to do whatever she wanted and let anyone know she felt necessary without regard for my private list.

Unfortunately, my now-husband and I already got married on the 31st of August. My mom seemed frustrated that I didn’t want them at the ceremony nor the reception. She told me that I’d have to tell them and that it was my responsibility to do so when I never even wanted them to know OR go, in the first place. She won’t admit it to my face that she invited them without telling me but thankfully, they didn’t show up. 

Now here’s the part that bothers me the most. I wanted to post my wedding photos on Facebook (that I only have to see how all my family is doing) for other family members to see. My mom insists that we wait until November (she planned a Vegas trip for my husband and I as a gift) to tell anyone/everyone that I got married and make it seem as if we got married in Vegas, again trying to control everything. 

I don’t want to change the history - MY HISTORY,  of how I got married just to spare the feelings of two people who never cared to know me or see me in my life. I feel as though I should be able to post/share/exclaim to the world that I got married and it’s pretty bullshit that she is trying to control everything. What should I do Reddit? AITA?

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. It's been awesome and we have talked about taking the next steps into engagement and marriage. I'm pumped, he's great. The engagement is at least several months off.   
 This last weekend we were visiting his mom, she's quite the character, has been married 5 times, they have a tumultuous relationship. She and I were talking and she asked if I'd seen the ring yet, immediately my heart \~fluttered\~ a little bit, because omg he already got the ring!! How exciting!! I was like no and I wouldn't want to!! I wouldn't want to spoil the moment of seeing it for the first time when he gives it to me.  She goes on to say that she's surprised I haven't come across it already in his house somewhere and that he's had it in his possession for around 3 years- when he picked it up from her safety deposit box when he was getting ready to propose to his previous girlfriend.  My heart sank a bit, he and his previous girlfriend were together on and off for 6 years and it's a bit of a tender spot for me, because they have so much history, ya know? I knew that he had almost proposed to his ex, but it had fallen apart. I did not know he was planning on using the same ring he had originally intended for her.  His mother goes on to say that it's her ring from her first marriage and that she loved that ring the most and that I will love it, and that this ring is so special to her, referring to it as a family heirloom. Bf was born during her second marriage so this ring isn't remotely tied to him?? I do not know if I am being too sensitive but I do not really want this ring because to me, he once intended this for someone else, I feel I would be reminded of his ex whenever I looked at this ring. Plus it is not like it a true family heirloom passed down from a great grandmother or something, it is just his mom's (who he is very hot and cold with) first marriage ring. He has very sufficient funds to afford a new ring, and I have told him before that I wouldn't care if it was a ring from pandora. It isn't about how expensive the ring is or how big it is, but something about this random ring from his mom that he was going to use for his ex makes it all feel... so much less special and intimate?  After leaving his mom's I asked one of our mutual friends to ask him discreetly if he was planning on using his mom's ring and he told her he was.  WIBTA if I told him in the nicest way possible that I don't want that ring? I just want something special and meaningful. I don't know if I'm making a bigger deal about this than I should be.

I have a son on the autism spectrum and he gets very upset when rules and norms are not followed. He is extremely rule oriented. 

When the couple arrived, the woman had on a foot brace (like the big plastic boot). Our family rule is no shoes in the house, but obviously I had no problem with her wearing the brace. 

My son, however, couldn’t reconcile that this shoe was allowed in the house and others were not and got very angry and worked up. 

I asked the woman to take the boot off. She said she really wasn’t supposed to until she was lying down in bed. I explained it would only be for a few hours until he goes to sleep but she said she really needed to wear it and her husband backed her up on this. 

I told them it was take it off or leave. They left. 

They were very upset with me, saying I was being unreasonable and it was now too late to find an Airbnb or call anyone else.

I feel I was justified to ask them to leave because of how inconsiderate they were of my son. 

My husband thinks we could’ve reached an amicable solution and feels I overreacted. I think the least she could’ve done when we let her stay overnight with no notice for free was to remove the brace.

290,Asshole,"Many years ago, I used to teach karate classes to kids age 4 through about 14. The way I taught the classes varied greatly based on the average age in the group.

Aside from learning the sport of a martial art the class also instills values such as responsibility. 

For my older classes, say ages 10 and up, one expectation I had of them was to use the restroom before they come to class.  It’s a simple thing to remember to do and it helps avoid disruptions.  However, I am not such a hard ass that I wouldn’t let a kid use the bathroom in the middle of class if they really needed to. 

The rule was if you do need to go to the restroom in the middle of class you can go, but when you come back the whole class will do jumping jacks in your honor.  Bear in mind, they’re going to do the jumping jacks one way or the other.  But, by dedicating this round to you maybe you (and everyone else) will be reminded to go to the restroom before class next time. It’s honestly all in good fun and was always “enforced” with a somewhat playful wagging of the finger.  Again, exercise is part of the class so it’s not like we weren’t going to do them anyway.  As martial arts instructors go, I was a bit of a softy to be perfectly honest. 

I had never, ever had a problem with this policy from any child or parent before. But one night after class I got an email from a parent saying that her child was “forced” to urinate on himself during my class. I was genuinely very confused and asked what the heck she was talking about. 

She said her son was so afraid of the punishment and what the other kids would think of him if they had to do jumping jacks on his behalf that he held it until he couldn’t hold it anymore, wet himself, and continued the class with wet pants. (I didn’t notice that his pants were wet, mostly because I don’t look at young boys crotches all that much, but also the jacket part of their uniform sort of covers that area anyway.). He was 11 or 12 years old, by the way. 

This is the part where I question my assholery; I basically told her that if her son was not mature enough to both remember the rule and/or be willing to accept the very benign consequence of forgetting the rule that he was perhaps not quite ready for the class.  

Holding it until he wet himself was entirely unnecessary.  I get that he may have seen it as a bigger deal than it was but at his age he should be able to reconcile the fact that the other kids would be mildly annoyed by him for a total of 30 seconds...the whole point of the class is to grow as a person and learn to deal with that type of thing with humility. 

Anyway, they did not come back to the class.  I guess they decided I was too cruel, or perhaps they agreed he wasn’t ready (I believe it was the former).  I may have prevented him from ever achieving his greatest potential as a martial artist, but somehow I doubt it.

Some days I see just one, some days the other, some days both of them, and they usually work out separately but talk during the breaks. Now, these girls look very similar - same height, same body time, same hair color, same complexion and very similar outfits so from across the room they look almost the same to me and I am usually unsure about the identity until we are standing much closer, and then we always say hi and exchange a polite smile, or a nod or something.

So today I said hi to one of the girls, and later the other one walked into the gym. A few moments later I said hi to her as well, but the girl pointed out that we already said hi to each other earlier. The other girl was within earshot and I said - *Oh, sorry yeah, I often mistake you for your friend, you look really similar* (my tone was also polite). The girls were *not* happy, they both made annoyed faces, I could tell they were upset, and the first one went ""*umm I don't think so*"" and the other one looked at the first one and had an expression on her face that I think meant *""ummm she wishes"".* I apologized for my mistake, but they just left and THEN the guy behind me said *Yeah dude, that's not the right way to talk to ladies...*

Right out of graduation, she took a high paying job at a tech company, and makes around 140k. I could have chosen the same path, but I instead decided my passion was teaching, and have been working as a high school teacher the past three years. It always seemed to bother my girlfriend, but it's becoming a bigger issue in the relationship.

For the past few months, when we meet other people, she acts visibly annoyed when they ask about my career, and quickly tries to change the subject. She also gets upset about paying for rent at our place, even though I make only 39k and she makes 140k. She says that I should be paying half, it not most of the rent, (I assume she includes the ""if not most"" b/c she grew up in a very traditional household, and her parents both fit the traditional gender roles, but I'm not 100% sure why she says ""if not most""). I try to pay for dinner and groceries and do all the household chores to make up for the fact I don't make as much money, but she still complains about having to pay most of the bills.

Finally, last night I talked to her about this, and we got into a huge fight. She called me selfish for working as a school teacher, when I could easily quit my job and get a job as a software engineer that pays 90k-110k right now, especially in the area where we live. She says I don't have the money to buy her gifts or provide for her, (this isn't as bad as it sounds, we've discuseed this before, her love language is gift-giving. She used to buy me gifts all the time, and I would try to reciprocate through acts of service, because I obviously dont have as much disposable income as her. I'm still paying down student loans), She said that it really bothers her that I could do all these things that I just don't. She also confirmed my suspicions, that she felt embarassed to be dating a high school teacher, and compared me to all our friends, most of which our making 6 figures or 80k + now. Shes wishes I would realize my potential and do something better for our future family and our finances instead of teaching. However, teaching is my passion. I love knowing that I can make a difference in kid's lives, and inspire them to pursue higher education like my math teacher did for me in high school. (I seriously would not have gone to college were it not for that man investing so much time in me). However, I understand that it might be stressful for my girlfriend to pay all the bills, and she has said that she worries about how our lifestyle might change if she gets pregnant or has a baby, which we have discussed. I just don't know if I should quit my passion, if I'm being selfish, or if she is being shalow. Help!",64,55,0.89

312,Asshole,"My wife (28F) and I (31M) are about to become first time parents. She has been doing all her research and planning to ensure our baby will be safe/secure with the most current safety standards and sleep methods. One thing that has her concerned is my mother and not listening to how my wife wants to raise our child, mostly towards safe sleep techniques, activities, and foods to feed a baby. This has grown to become a big anxiety for her and she has brought it up a few times in the past.

Some more context: we have a dog and my wife is very diligent about ensuring he doesn’t eat foods that are bad for dogs (garlic, onions, artificial sweeteners, etc) while my mother is not as diligent and has fed the dog bad foods repeatedly, usually out of ignorance and not malice. Even after being reminded, she will forget or laugh it off sometimes.

My wife recently asked me to talk to my mother about ensuring she listens to what my wife wants to do for our child. After a lengthy discussion, the reasoning she wants me to explicitly do it is because my wife does not want to damage/ruin her relationship with my mother and since I am her son, it doesn’t matter as much if I do it since she will always love me. 

I stated I would much prefer we have this conversation together with my mother and not just me because my wife is much more diplomatic normally (I am somewhat blunt and direct, AKA mean sometimes) and the two of us together can probably handle it better and show that this is serious to my mother. My wife thinks I am not being helpful and just making it worse for her because she will obviously be the bad cop and I will be the good cop in my mother’s eyes. She continues to be frustrated by this situation and has yet to bring it up again since we discussed this because she knows I won’t just handle it.

So, AITA for not doing what my wife wants and forcing her to be involved with this discussion with my mother?

EDIT 1: Seeing a few posts here regarding this: My wife has yet to ever say she feels disrespected by my mother, though yes you can see that it is an issue. Her reason to have me do it is to not be the bad guy in any way and harm her relationship with my mother. I have no issues with confronting my mother alone, my concern is that solo doing it is not going to hit it home to my mother that this is serious.

EDIT 2: I plan to just take care of it now simply because my wife is concerned and needs my help. I appreciate the honest feedback and plan to try to talk out a ‘game-plan’ for said conversation with my wife before having it.",74,177,0.9

315,Asshole,"I (27/F) started dating my boyfriend, Ted, (38/M) a couple of years ago for the first time. We then broke up for about four months, and started dating again a couple of weeks ago. 


It's my 28th birthday in three weeks, and because Ted and I weren't dating I had been discussing with my girlfriends that it would be nice to go away for the weekend. Just me, my two house mates and a few other close friends. My house mates were actually pushing me to go away because they knew I hadn't had a very nice birthday the year before and wanted me to celebrate properly. My parents have a really lovely place on the beach a couple of hours away, and they had agreed to stay at a friends place so that we could have the place for the weekend. It's not big, just two bedrooms and a pullout couch, which is why I was keeping the event small.


At dinner last night Ted brought up what I would like to do for my birthday. I got really nervous because I knew he would be upset with me for going away. I said that while we were broken up I had talked to the girls about going away for the weekend. He got upset with me because he wanted to spend my birthday with me, which I can definitely understand. Since nothing was technically booked in yet because it's just at my parents place he said that he was sure my friends would understand if I changed plans if it meant we were working on our relationship. I don't really want to disappoint anybody, so I said it all sounded too hard and I just wouldn't do anything for my birthday so that way nobody felt replaced by anybody. Obviously this wasn't the answer he was looking for either, and he's now saying that he's questioning whether we're on the same page to start this relationship again. AITA here?",44,26,0.85

317,Asshole,"So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun. 

Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.

So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",2283,15161,0.94
318,Not the A-hole,"Background:
I’m an adult in my 30s. My parents divorced 3 years ago. The cause of the divorce was my father’s rampant infidelity. We have all had a very hard time with it. 

The Situation:
My dad has found love again, and has decided he wants to get married. Obviously I have a lot of concerns, and I expressed them to him about a month ago after he told me he was engaged. He has since told me he’s going through with the wedding, and I told him I would be there if it’s really what he wanted to do. I gave him three dates that I am not available (due to work conflicts and plans with my husband’s family), and I said if he gave me enough warning I should be able to make a wedding on any other day. I told him I understood if he had to move forward without me because the dates that I’m unavailable may be the only dates my little brothers are available (they’re still in school, while I have a FT job).  

Last week he informed me that he and his girlfriend want to get married on one of the dates I specified as not convenient for me. Not only was it one of the dates that I can’t do, but it’s a week long celebration (even if I could go, spending longer than 36 hours with them would have been a no-go). He says my siblings and the girlfriend’s kid can’t do any other dates, and could I please make the trip. I have no idea why they can’t just push the wedding back to a date more suitable for everybody if they’re so intent on having everybody there. It’s not like either of them wants more kids—they’re in their late 60s. 

I love my dad. I am not excited about him marrying this woman and likely having to endure another divorce because of his infidelity. It took a ton of therapy for me to get to a place where I said I would be at his wedding with a smile on my face. In his defense, i did say that I would understand if he had to get married without me, and I meant that. However, I feel beyond hurt that he’s pressuring me and asking me to change plans with my husband’s family just so he can get married again, especially since I already explained when I’m not available, AND I said he could move forward without me. My dad says I need to support him in this moment and that I need to be more flexible.

320,Not the A-hole,"I had a friend I made online about 2 years ago and most of the time we get along. However, about every month or so he gets annoyed at me when he texts, I read it, and don't get back to him to explain when I'm busy. He says that if he texts me, and I read it, that I'm able to say ""I'm busy, can't talk"", and so if I don't do that he gets really irritated. On the surface it seems fairly reasonable. He says we're good friends so of course I should reply even to let him know I'm busy. If I read a text then it only takes a minute to reply and say so. Not that I have to talk any time he wants but that if I read a message I should say ""I'm busy"" out of politeness. So that's his side of the story. 

But he gets REALLY angry about it. I've been in work and just glanced at my phone and he's asked me what my ""excuse"" is for not replying. He accuses me of not caring or ignoring him on purpose to mess with him. 

Another time, I was in work and made the effort to reply because he was upset about a girl. This time he was angry my reply wasn't thoughtful enough (I just said something like, if she cheated on day one that that's a big red flag and I wouldn't give her any more of my time.) Then, when I got a bit quiet, he accused me of being passive aggressive and pulled up a message from 2017 where I said I was good at keeping people at arms length as ""proof"" that I was being passive aggressive.

Last week it happened again. I was out with my fiancé and we were playing pokemon go, and I saw he'd texted me saying ""having a good day?"" I didn't reply because I was busy and we'd spoken already that day. His response? He texted me again at 4am to say ""not a good time to ignore me"" and said I had ignored that he was feeling very depressed. I said I didn't know he was feeling that way by his message and he said I ought to have known because he told me a day ago. I honestly just hadn't realised that he felt that way in that moment because of the light hearted message. He said ""that's horrible to be honest. You don't give a fuck about me."" (edit: to clarify, when he said he was feeling really down the day before we talked about it in depth - we speak most days) 

My only explanation is that with anyone I know, it's common to not reply if you're busy. I don't feel that I should HAVE to explain that to someone. Whenever I see a message from him on Facebook recently I had to make sure I didn't open Facebook at all for fear he'd get annoyed at me. It's happened so many times. I feel petty in a way to stop being friends with someone over this but it felt controlling and not like a normal argument to have with a friend. I politely told him how I felt and that I care about him but I don't want to be friends anymore because I think it's controlling and it makes me feel like I'm on eggshells permanently.

321,Asshole,"So right off the bat I concede its a bit unscrupulous.  But here's the deal. This guy I loosely know asked me how to sell a really nice couch. I'm in need of one, and since I've dabbled in carpentry he asked me to take a look at it, and give me a price. Seeing the opportunity I maybe sort of lowballed him by about 250, and said I could take it off him. I gave him the money as promised, added an extra ten for the trouble and went home with my couch.

I had friends over, and when I told them how I got the couch some of them were indignant, calling me an asshole who manipulated a guy and scammed him out of money. I figured it was a decent deal. He got decent money, I got the couch I needed for half price. But I wanna check with someone who isn't inside my general social circle.

Plus she has been complaining that our parents don’t love her for not giving her a bigger allowance and for spending more time with my youngest brother.

326,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriends sister was let go from a job several months ago. She was a receptionist at a local company and she could not keep up with the demands of the job or execute tasks as they were needed. Before this position she worked in fashion retail for a larger mall chain clothing store. She was there for several YEARS but only ever got got one promotion to seasonal keyholder. 

She’s been applying to a lot of places and she recently informed me that she used me as a reference and applied for an assistant manager position to the fashion retail company that I work for. We are not as wide spread as the old company she worked for but we’ve opened a lot of brand new stores especially in our region. We sell a mixture of clubby clothes for parties and going out, as well as special occasion dresses for homecoming, prom, and weddings. 

I am the assistant manager at my store and have a good reputation in my company. I’ve been sent to other stores in our district to assist them and retrain the management teams and sales associates so they run better.  
I don’t want to vouch for her because I don’t think she would be a good fit but she’s been looking for a job for MONTHS. I also don’t want her to get upset with me if she was to not get the position but I know she’s not prepared for the workload that the job entails.  

We are in the middle of homecoming season and almost every day is a $15,000 or more day which requires a lot of work from the management teams to accomplish and keep the stores neat and running properly.  Our busy season literally lasts from September to May, because of homecoming season, winter holidays, then prom season.  

WIBTA if I gave my district manager my honest opinion of her capability to handle handle the position, even if I knew it meant she wouldn’t get the job?


EDIT: Hey guys! Thank you guys for giving your honest opinions and giving advice on how to handle the situation. I really appreciate it.  

As a small update today during my shift my district manager came in for a visit and asked about her, as well as the other store she applied to called. I told them both the same thing, that I have never worked with her and did not consent to be a reference for her. 

I wanna address some thing in the comments that have been said or asked multiple times tho:

   1. She was not applying for an entry level position. She applied for a management position with no previous history of management experience, and expected me to vouch for her.  

   2. I have been unemployed before. I know the struggle of not having a job.  I was previously employed by Charlotte Russe, a large female clothing company that went bankrupt and I was out of a job for MONTHS.  The difference here is that she is able to be financially dependent on her family. She lives at home and her parents can help her a lot. I have never had any sort of financial help from my family before. 

   3. I cannot offer her a job at a different level. She did not apply to my store, nor is it my call to do so that is our store managers job, but we wouldn’t have the same store manager as she would be in a different store, but the same district.  

  4. I am not trying to sabotage her or blackball her from the industry.  I have offered MANY times during her unemployment to review her resumes, edit her cover letters, and help her look for positions she’s qualified and suited for and previously she has turned me down. 

  5. I don’t hate her. I will admit for truths sake, we don’t have a wonderful relationship.  We are not close. I understand how the way I worded the original post can make it seem like I was talking down on her or belittling her, I thought her previous work history was an important detail so I added it in. 

  6. I don’t take this job as seriously as y’all think. Yes I made this post because I care about my reputation and I care about my standing i. this company. This is because my job is how I afford college. I am on track to get my masters in Biology, and this job funds that. I want to be able to complete my degree and do what I actually love, thus I care about how I am perceived by my supervisors. 

   7.  I made this post with the explicit permission and support of my boyfriend, who agrees with me that I’m NTA. He also works in an industry where reputation is vital to the pay you receive, and he has seen how hard I’ve worked to get to a point where I can support myself and pay for my education. He does not want to break up with me because I didn’t lie to help his sister get a job. Also he is not my brother? A lot of people are confusing the relationship.

I got a part time job at a cinema and I absolutely loved it and made friends during training and stuff (they hired 10 of us at once) but they kept putting me for super late hours (like until 3am) and I can’t walk home because it’s dangerous, and I can’t get taxis because they are only paying us in two months so I have no money to, nor is that a long time solution anyway.

I asked them if they could put me earlier shifts until I learn how to drive but they said no so I emailed them a resignation letter and they haven’t replied.
I feel enormously guilty because I’ve literally only worked one shift but there’s no way I can get home safely at like 3am (nor is the pay sufficient for that kind of sacrifice)

they didn’t tell us the latest hours would be 3am until after we got hired and right before we signed the contract, and the lady talking me through it just brushed over the “3am availability” part and I sort of just panicked and signed anyway (I’m a lil anxious and stupid sometimes) so I thought I could maybe make it work but.

329,Not the A-hole,"Background: I work in finance. We are required to lock our laptops and/computers when we step away. It’s a behavior which is monitored and can result in a write up because of the personal information that could be accessed on an unlocked workstation. 

My coworker, who we will call Sue, has been in banking long than me (sue=15 years, me=10 years). Shes about 36/37 with 2 elementary school aged children. I’m 30F. 

Story: Sue knows that workstations need to be locked and we have lots of upper level management in our office including our compliance officer and her staff which visits. Sue went to a meeting on the other side of the building. I didn’t realize she stepped away and I walked over to her desk (we are in cubicles) and saw she wasn’t there. My other coworker saw me looking for her and said she Sue stepped out for a bit. I saw her workstation was unlocked so I flipped her screen (alt+ctrl+up arrow) and then locked her computer. This is an easy fix and a common lesson taught in pretty much every level of my company. 

Sue came back 30 minutes or so later and started asking who messed with her screen. I chuckled with my other coworker for about 10 seconds and walked over saying, in a lighthearted tone, “you know, it wouldn’t have happened if you locked your computer”. As I turned into her cube intending to correct it, she swung around in her chair, and said in a demanding tone “you know, you should brush your hair. Now fix it.”

She makes comments like this often which I often brush off but her tone (and probably the frequency of the comment) just got to me. So I walked away and said “maybe you shouldn’t be rude when someone did a harmless prank and was going to fix it.” I turned to walked back to my desk and sat down to which she stormed over, sat *ON* my desk and demanded to have me fix it. After 1 or so minute of this, I told her she should really stop making rude comments and follow company protocol. I fixed her computer and sat back down. Now she’s huffing and puffing and just being passive aggressive since this. 

So AITA for a simple office prank and then reacting the way I did to her comment about my hair? 

Side note: my hair was not messy, I had headphones wrapped around the back of my head which made it look bunched up in a half bun.

ETA: a lot of comments are focused around the environment and relationship. Sue and I have known each other for 10-11 years, I’ve babysat her children before working together, and we now have worked together for 4 years now. She has also played “pranks” involving removing personal items from my desk (personal iPad, phone) while I was in the restroom.

330,Not the A-hole,"For context: I work at a Korean restaurant and while I speak basic Korean, I am Welsh/American.

My bosses go to church regularly and have made plenty of friends through it. They own the only Korean restaurant in my county and their friends will often visit and order food, mostly to chat and catch up.

However, a majority of them refuse to speak to me or order through me even if we are busy. Another thing to note is that they all speak English due to either marrying an American or speaking to their friends spouses- so it’s not a language barrier.

I have made multiple attempts to get them to order but nothing works.

So one day it was just me and one of my bosses at the restaurant and we were busy, and his friends come in. I go up, greet them, and ask what they want when they side eye me and start addressing him. He even told them to order from me but they kept trying to get his attention, so I set the pen down and walk back to the kitchen to prepare our other orders.

We call his wife and she arrives about ten minutes later- ten minutes of them standing at the counter. They order from her and call me rude for leaving them there, so later I explained my side of the story.

I let her know that despite my dad not speaking English when he moved back to England, he still made an effort to order from restaurants or speak to cashiers. I also let her know that if they don’t want to speak to me- either in English or Korean- then I don’t want to serve them at all.

333,No A-holes here,"So my girlfriend thinks I'm the worst kind of person for doing this, but I feel I made the right call here. I was getting groceries last night and in the parking lot, I noticed a small boy ( I'm guessing 2 yrs old) just standing by the shopping cart return. He wasn't crying, but he also didn't look like he was enjoying his situation. He just stood there looking around. I immediately thought ""this kid is for sure lost"".  But instantly, I felt uneasy, and decided against walking over to him, because a man in his 30s taking to a small child in a parking lot could go very bad for me.


See, I've had women (and some men) get aggressive when I'm out with my niece. I've even had instances were people have admitted they assumed I was some pervert after they find out the little girl is my neice. Even then it's very judgmental attitude towards me. I am very much aware men are assumed to have the worst intentions when it comes to kids by many people. So no way was I walking up to some kid I didn't know in a parking lot.


So I sat in my truck and watched this kid (which I know, probably is way creepier) until I saw a woman walking out to her car. I flagged her down and pointed out the kid, saying he seems lost and then I drove away when she took the kid by the hand and led him into the store.

334,Asshole,"Hello AITA Reddit, I'm in a pretty complicated situation. While I am pretty sure that I am already the buttcavity, I'm coming here to explain what's going on in my life because I want the non-biased advice of reddit's most judgemental people to set me straight.

I am Chinese and have been with my Indian boyfriend for about 4 years.

My parents are very overprotective and low-key (sometimes not even hiding it) racist.

I have not been allowed to drive on my own even though I have a driver's license because they claim I get too frustrated and over-emotional (and as a result drive recklessly) whenever they point out tiny mistakes (driving too close to dividers, not driving slowly enough etc.) that I allegedly made while driving that cause them to think I'm too much of an unsafe driver in their eyes. In all honesty, I'm 85% sure they'll never actually let me drive on my own at this rate.

My boyfriend happens to be a lawyer who is stressed out and tired most of the time from work.

As a result of these circumstances it is usually my boyfriend who has to pick me up from my home if we ever want to go anywhere and he has only just now come clean that he feels it is unfair to him. I suggested that I let him go to be with a more normal woman who isn't so controlled by her parents but he seems to not want to entertain that thought (yet).

He invited me to a relative's wedding this week about a month ago and I asked him if he could pick me up for them. He said okay.

Right now it's just a few days before the wedding will be happening and he asked me if I was alright to get into a Grab car he would be calling up for me to pick me up since he's busy. I said my parents wouldn't be okay with it. The he asked me if ""I"" was okay with it. I told him I myself wasn't comfortable with it because I didn't want to get into a stranger's car alone.

We argued about how I would never be independent if I never stood up to my parents and that he was suggesting ways for me to be independent but I just ""didn't want to try"". In the end he gave up and said he would pick me up anyway.

A part of me believes him when he says I don't want to try to be independent from my parents and am therefore a buttcavity because I haven't insisted on breaking up with him for his own good so he can be with a normal girl who can see him anytime she wants. Hell maybe he'd be happier if he was alone.

Another part of me believes that him being stressed out/tired/busy helping out with the wedding doesn't excuse him suddenly wanting me to take a cab alone on short notice when he said he was alright with picking me up a month ago. If I'm going to sneak out of my house to take public transport I'd feel safer in buses and trains where there are more people. I'd want to plan my route out well in advance so nothing goes wrong.

AITA?

336,Asshole,"So, my fiance and I get married in about a year and a half. We have our wedding invite list planned out already and it does not included his oldest, hometown friend Jake.

The problem is Jake is a wild card. The guy is nothing like my fiance; they were buddies growing up, but they are totally different people. To be blunt - Jake is kind of trash. He's not even a nice guy, he's kind of an asshole. Something important to note is Jake assumes he is going to be my fiance's best man. The second we got engaged he texted my fiance ""I can't wait to be your best man!"" Very presumptuous but the guy has zero self-awareness.

The reason we do not want to invite Jake to our wedding is because of the following situations:

* In my opinion, the biggest problem is how he acts with other women. He's the type to flirt incessantly with waitresses or anybody in his immediate view and he think he has ""big game."" In his head, he is smooth and girls like him. In reality, these girls are pretty embarrassed and tend to give us ""help me""-looks. I have never, once witnessed a girl reciprocate any interest in him and frankly, it's because he is creepy. So, our main worry at the wedding is that he will flirt with all of my girl friends and be that ""creepy"" guy at the wedding. I can just picture now people saying ""wow it was a nice wedding but what was up with that one creepy guy hitting on girls left and right who were clearly uninterested?"" That thought terrifies me, lol
* The second issue is the amount he drinks. Jake drinks very heavily and gets so emotional when he drinks. For example, we went up to visit my fiance's friends a couple of months ago and we were all hanging out at someone's house in the early afternoon; no one was drinking except for Jake. He opened up a bottle of vodka and began taking swigs and by 2pm, he was incredibly drunk. Suddenly, we look over and Jake is in tears. He's silently crying ... it was so weird. My fiance's friends ask him what's wrong and he says how much he is going to miss my fiance when he gets married. ???? I'm also sitting in the room when he's saying this! My fiance has been seeing Jake for like once a year for the past 10 or so years. It's nothing new. The point of that example is... how is he going to act at a wedding with an open bar? What if he has a meltdown at the wedding?

My fiance has always felt they have nothing in common, but Jake idolizes my fiance and thinks of him as his best friend. My fiance is such a nice guy and is worried about what not inviting him to the wedding will do to him. Jake's heart will undoubtedly be broken, but this is our wedding we are talking about! I think it's alright to be selfish a little. My fiance agrees with me and thinks the same thing but we still want the opinion of Reddit.",40,60,0.98
337,Asshole,"My sister is 5 years older than me, single, and lives at home. She sounds like a loser, but she’s actually incredibly smart and kind and just going through a rough time. She majored in a STEM field that turned out to to be poorly paying. She’s working on a second degree while working part-time at her old job. Her most recent boyfriend, who we all thought she would marry, left her for someone he met at work. Her boyfriend before that, who we also thought she would marry, broke up with her because his parents wanted him to marry someone from the same cultural background. 

As a teenager I was severely depressed and failing out. When my sister realized how bad I was, she got really involved in my life. I shut everyone out but she forced herself in and pushed me to make decisions that I didn’t necessarily believe in at the time but that helped me avoid the mistakes she made. Now at 23, I’ve followed my sister’s advice on everything from clubs to major to career. She even wrote my resume every year. 

My sister didn’t pick my boyfriend but gave me lots of advice on what to look for. I turned down several guys based in part because of her and I think it saved me a lot of grief. I eventually met a guy who is incredible. He fulfills all of my criteria, makes me happier than I knew I could be, and our friends call us a power couple. Together we make over 300k and are ready to start our lives together. His parents love me and want to buy us a house once we’re married. We’ve literally never argued for more than 10 minutes before this.

I know an engagement or wedding announcement would be really hard on my sister. She has never said anything negative to me, but she’s told our parents that she feels like a failure because she can't help but compare our lives. That broke my heart. Getting married in the near future feels cruel considering everything she did for me when I was depressed. She’s not in the financial state to celebrate with me the way I want either. My boyfriend and I are also young (23 going on 24) and I was already planning to freeze my eggs, so I don’t see a need to rush.

My boyfriend says we need to prioritize our happiness over my sister’s happiness. He says we don’t know when she’ll be better, we don’t know if something will happen to one of our parents, he wants to be on my insurance when he goes to grad school (he could use his parents’ insurance before 26 or private insurance after), he wants to live with me officially (I live at his place unofficially, but because of conservative relatives I officially rent a cheap room near my work) and he wants to spend time married before starting a family (I don't see how a piece of paper changes our relationship).",164,431,0.91
338,Not the A-hole,"My friend andI go to concerts periodically. We always discuss them in advance and agree on the price level we are going for. Always less than $100. 

She lives month to month, rents out a room as AirBNB just to make ends meet and even then sometimes has to postpone paying me for a $75 ticket until something clears. 

So she randomly bought Elton John tickets for $250 each without discussing it with me and then vaguely mentioned it. I liked him 40 years ago but don’t really care to go. I also had to pay $1,000 for the vet last week with an operation looming in a month and $1100 for car repairs. 

So today she said “don’t forget. Elton John is in a week.” And I asked how much were the tickets. $250!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTF?????!!!!!!!

She even paid $420 each so her parents can see him in another city. For a girl that is driving an ancient car and rents out a room, she sure blows money!  I have never even heard her say she likes Elton John. She’s more of a heavy metal fan!

340,Not the A-hole,"For context I'm 18 and was going through intense trauma therapy.

I've had 3 sessions with this particular therapist. The sessions were supposed to be me reliving things that happened to me in hope of recovering from them. So far she has been 10 minutes late to two of the sessions and then the sessions have only lasted around 25 minutes. Each session should last for 50. She has also barely touched on trauma at all, save for giving me some websites to look at, and instead chose to focus on attempting to give me CBT for my depression.

Not only is my depression directly caused by my PTSD and illness but I had CBT for 2 years and it did nothing. I specifically told her at the start that CBT was out of the question and does not work for me.

Every session I've had she acts and sounds super condescending. Talking to me like I don't understand my own mind. Whenever I try to bring up the trauma she just says ""aww, that must have been really difficult. Now should we go back to this?"" In the sort of sing song voice you use to talk to a baby or a dog.

I want to scream at her. I want to slap her. I want to stop her treating people like this. I'm not going to but what I want to do is write to her employer.

341,Not the A-hole,"Some background: 

My brother (30) and I aren’t close. I’m financially stable and my brother is living with our mom bc he lost his job (he would have made more money than me and is the “star” child of the family). He doesn’t make any attempts to better his situation and mooches off of my mom and younger sister. He doesn’t leave the house. He says he lost his job due to the fact that he has depression (diagnosed, currently taking anti depressants).

I get that he has depression so I’ve tried helping him (talking to him, trying to get him out of the house, visited him when he was about to be fired from his job) but it is very clear that all he wants is money and for people to do everything for him. So, I stopped enabling him. 

The point:

My dad is obsessed with getting my brother better—so much that he ignores his other kids who are doing well with their life. He didn’t attend my sister’s college graduation (she worked SO hard) because he wanted to stay at home with my brother.  He doesn’t talk to me for weeks at a time and when he does it’s always about my brother. He never asks how I am doing. 

My birthday was last week and he didn’t call me to wish me happy birthday. I was “whatever” about it until he called me yesterday. I picked up and the first thing he says to me (aggressively) is “Have you talked to your brother?”

The entire conservation was about how I don’t talk to my brother and that I am selfish and that “because I have a stable job” my dad doesn’t need to worry or talk to me anymore about how I am doing. 

My dad told me I’m selfish (because I’m just “the younger, female, less important child that makes less money” than my brother) and need to do more to help my brother. I live over 5 hours away and work 9+ hours a day with an hour commute home. In addition, I don’t want to enable my brother. AITA?",19,63,0.93

344,Asshole,"So me and my band just played our biggest gig yet. It was on the town square of a small city/big town (30-50,000 inhabitants) and we were really proud. It was part of some major town event, and there were vendors and different events and all kinds of stuff, so - big moment.

Basically, our band is a mix between funk tunes and old school metal, we like to mix the two as well. Our opening song is ""Mechanix"" by Megadeth, which, if you don't know is a song about gas station sex, though it's like 300BPM so you can't make the bad words out except for a single ""fuck"". The rest of our songs are relatively ""clean"", though my stage banter isn't.

We ended with a funked-up cover of Master of Puppets, after a few originals. We based it on the live version which includes a fair amount of profanity replacing the actual lyrics, and by this point we were all shirtless from the heat. We finish the song, I wish the crowd a ""good goddamn fucking day"" in pure excitement and we exit the stage basically shaking. It was a magical set.

Then some middle aged person apparently employed there stops us in our tracks and chews us out, I mean really let us have it. She's going on about how this is a ""family event"" and that we were being ""completely inappropriate"" and we shouldn't get paid since all we did was ""prance around half naked and scream F-bombs"". She then brought us to her office-thingy, where a pissed mom gave us basically the same spiel.

Apparently she's going to talk to the organizer tomorrow to get us barred from playing there again for ""inappropriate conduct"", all because we said fuck, and took our shirts off in the heat of the stage lights. I think it's completely ridiculous, but some assistants or whatever sided with her, saying we basically ruined a ""family event"". One which served alcohol and had concert level music mind you.

**So, Am I (and my band) the Assholes for swearing like we always do and playing some mildly raunchy songs? We were literally doing what we always do, and now we're getting shit on for being ""inappropriate"". AITA or should I fight this woman on the issue?**

I brought up some concerns with him about the dog like who is going to take it out, walk it, train it? He plans on leaving it inside a crate while he works and letting it out at the end of the day. He also has 0 plans for training the dog. Hes 19 and told me he doesnt have the time to train it and he doesn't want to spend money on obedience classes. 

I told him it was a bad idea since he doesn't have the time to take care of the animal and train it. It would be cruel to keep it caged up all day. I also told him that dogs are expensive and the german shepard could potentially need vet care in the future. I am worried about a rambunctious untrained german shepard knocking over my grandmother since she is recovering from a broken hip.

Over the summer she shot up in height and as a result got some new found confidence that I’m really proud of, however she also wanted a new wardrobe and although I thought some things were appropriate,  there is a whooollleee other argument about her wanting to show off the top of a thong underneath sweat pants a la all of us in the 90’s. 

Now, I don’t intrinsically have a problem with her wanting to explore her body, styles, and growing sexuality, but I DO have a duty to protect her and make sure that she isn’t doing dumb stuff at her age. I also want her to have a wholesome childhood and for her to have some boundaries about what mom will and won’t let her do. 

I explained to her that she has a beautiful body and I have no problem with her wanting to wear thongs OR show them off, but at this age she is still a minor and I don’t think it’s appropriate. 

She is a good kid, very sassy and smart, but she’s also wise beyond her years and she told me it was okay and she’d just live out her Aaliyah fantasies when she was a little older which I was very grateful for. 

I am thinking over my decision and I’m just not sure if I’m being too harsh on her- we were all young girls once, and her wearing whatever she wears isn’t an indication of anything bad etc, but I also feel like it’s a step too far beyond what I’m comfortable with.

We started dating in high school and we stayed together in uni since we were in the same city, then we broke up a few months after we graduated. If it matters, I broke up with him. This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.


One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex. Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. 


Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.


One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.


I feel like since I'm in the wedding party it's not unfair of me to ask my friends for this favor so I don't feel uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't have asked them if I was just a regular guest.

353,Not the A-hole,"This was from last thanksgiving but I was recently reminded of it, and I’m still wondering where other people stand on this.

After thanksgiving we had a lot of leftovers so we crammed everything into the fridge. Unbeknownst to me or my partner, my MIL decided to put two leftover pies in our oven for storage one of which had a plastic tray. They then left town the next day.

A few days later I went to make some food and preheated the oven, which upon smelling a strange smell discovered the burning pies and now dripping molten plastic all over my oven.

I got quite mad at my MIL for a few reasons, which started an argument with my husband as he defending all these actions:

1. I’ve never heard of using an oven for storing food over multiple days, and I found it bizarre

2. I said that even if that’s normal, she shouldn’t put something that can melt like plastic in an oven ever. To which my husband responded it’s my responsibility to check

3. She should have told me or him that she had put it there because if she was leaving how would we know to look before it went bad?

For whatever reason this turned into a huge argument as I spent the next days scraping and burning off the melted plastic and my husband continued to argue that keeping food in an oven is completely normal behavior and that I should have checked first.

So AITA for having these expectations/beliefs? And for thinking my kitchen will be the way I left it? Is it all my fault for not checking first or did she drop the ball? Honestly I wouldn’t have cared if it just burned food, it was the plastic that made it into a bigger deal.",545,1296,0.96
354,Not the A-hole,"I'm one of the two people in charge of running a body acceptance support group, we hold meetings for free at a community center after closing hours every saturday. We don't have a sign up process, you can just show up, write down your name and sit down to share. We make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... It is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.

At our first August meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call Ashley. There wasn't anything visibly ""wrong"" with Ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (In my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). However, whenever Ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. The first two sessions, I thought it was fine, to each their pace and I didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. Even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.

At our third meeting, Ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly ""wrong"". She dodged every question I directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... She left quickly when we wrapped up and I couldn't speak with her. Other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.

Last saturday's meeting, I approached Ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. Ashley responded saying we weren't very ""nice"", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some ""mumbojumbo"" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. I was getting pretty angry, and I directly asked her why is it that she was here, and I told her if she couldn't give me an answer I'm afraid I would have to kick her out. She didn't answer so I asked her to leave. 

She contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what I did is not justified, and that I shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma. When I tried to explain that I doubted she had any physical defects to begin with, he shut it down saying I'm being an asshole for judging someone as not ""disabled enough"".

362,Not the A-hole,"My core social group consists of myself and four friends. We've all been close for ten years or more. While I’m going to speak bluntly here, I do deeply care about them.

All four of them struggle with anxiety and have done for years. I, fortunately, do not have anxiety or depression and I consider myself extraverted and socially confident. I’m happy to spend most of our designated hang-out nights drinking at one of our flats, but occasionally I would like to go out somewhere, like a pub or a restaurant. But we haven’t hung out outside all year because one or more of them can’t handle it due to their anxiety. 

But for a long time now I’ve noticed I'm their go-to person for even basic things. I’m the one who has to order the pizza, because none of them can handle making the call themselves. I’m the one who has to go to the shop for our beer/wine myself, because they can’t handle being around people that day. If I mention I’m going shopping, I pick up their bread, milk, cigarettes etc. because they can’t handle doing it that day. 

Some of them cancel plans literally an hour or less before the arranged time because their anxiety is acting up, leaving me with no plans on my days off. If I have something important to tell them and I call them, they let their phones ring out and insist on communicating through text, which is awkward if I’m on the move while I need to talk to them. 

The catalyst to the rant is the fact my birthday is this weekend. I want to go to a pub for dinner and some drinks. I asked them, and all four of them said in one way or another that they can’t handle going out, can’t we just drink in the flat like normal? I snapped and text them all ""forget it,"" and now I don't have birthday plans. 

I know they didn’t choose to have anxiety, and maybe I just don’t understand because I don’t suffer from it myself. But I feel like I constantly do things for them and not one of them can bring themselves to come out for one night my birthday.

I ranted about this to my sister but because she also has anxiety, she told me I was being an inconsiderate asshole and that I don't get what they're dealing with.

363,Not the A-hole,"Hi, first post here so I'm sorry if I do anything wrong. Here's my dilemma:

I have a chronic illness. After having gone through multiple treatments, the only one that finally worked was one that I have to pick up at my local hospital's pharmacy once a month. The hospital pharmacy isn't a regular one and it only dispenses very serious medications, so it is assumed that everyone there is chronically ill in some shape or form and most people are way older than me (I'm in my early twenties). 

Today, I went to pick up my medication. It's never a fun time because it takes a long time and, again, I have to take an afternoon off work and that means I'm losing income so I'm always a bit grumpy even if I'm used to it at this point. I was just scrolling on my phone trying to kill time when I saw, from the corner of my eye, an elderly guy get up and walk towards this man in a wheelchair holding out his ticket (it's what signals your place in line). The guy spoke really loudly and said ""since these young ladies won't let either the elderly or the disabled cut in front of them, I'll give you my ticket."". I didn't say anything, really, because I was just surprised and everyone in the waiting room was looking either at me or at the only other young woman in the room. I don't know about the other girl, but I wasn't even the first in line or anything, I guess we just looked like the youngest and maybe the healthiest there? We're ALL chronically ill here and disabled in some way, shape or form, so it never occurred to me to let someone else cut in line in a place like this. The guy in the wheelchair refused the offer and said he could wait like everybody else before I could even get the words together to say anything so I never did and neither did the other girl, but the old man kept mumbling under his breath about us. 


AITA here? Truth be told, if I was to give my place in line to those who looked sicker or older I would be the last one there 95% of the time but frankly... I felt like an asshole for not taking initiative here after the older guy said what he did. Am I?",18,40,0.92

Last time this happened things got awkward because she tried to force herself into the group by just showing up without asking if she can join, and my friends told her that they didn’t want her joining because they didn’t want too many people in the group.  This turned into a bunch of drama that forced me to quit the group which was embarrassing because my friends knew that I only quit because she made me.  I rejoined the group because I just happened to be there when they started a new campaign.  I literally had no idea that they were going to play DnD.  They asked if I wanted to join, and now my wife wants to join too.

The thing is, one of her friends plays DnD.  She could play with him if she wants to play so badly, but she says that she wants to feel accepted by my friends.  They do accept her.  It’s just that things got awkward last time, and she thinks that 2 of my friends hate her, so she hates them, and whenever she’s around them, there’s always an uncomfortable vibe in the room.  My 2 friends and her never say a single word to each other.  I don’t like it.  The rest of my friends are really nice to her and talk to her though.

If she wants to feel accepted by my friends, there are game nights where we don’t play DnD.  She’s always welcome to join those, and if she really wants to play DnD, then she could play DnD with her friend, but she never asks her friend to play.  The only time she ever brings up wanting to play DnD is when I’m playing it.  


Plus, if she did join the group, then we’d have to wait for her to get out of work a lot.  DnD night can’t change because of everyone’s availability.  On those nights, she gets out of work at 7-8 PM.  The group likes to start DnD by 7 PM at the latest, but preferably much earlier, and they’re trying to start even earlier since college started back up, so if she joined, then we’d have to wait for her every time.",258,584,0.95

My dad passed away 13 years ago and my mom never wanted to marry again, even tho she has many admirers and has been proposed many times.., she lives in my hometown 1 hour away

I work all week, even weekends I use to put everything in order and work on growing the biss, whatever free time I have I use to see my Gf,

My mom comes visit almost every week or 2, and stays here for the weekend, 
When she is here she wants me to stop working and take her shopping and take her out to eat
And just be with her,and she doesn't like me to see my Gf when she is here bc ""I can see her whenever I want, and she is not always here""

The past week, she had 3 days off at work, so she came to stay almost the entire week, and this weekend she wanted to come again, 
I told her I had to finish some important stuff, but that she could come so she wouldn't stay alone at home, and when I finish we could go to have dinner

She thinks I can do whatever I want at work bc ""I'm the boss"" so I can just leave and stop worrying, even though I've told her many times it's in fact the opposite

She started crying and told me i never have time for her, and that she doesn't want to interfere with my life anymore and to stop worrying about her, and now she is not answering her phone since yesterday

As we were talking she mentioned her granddaughter, whom she had brought up in a small handful of talks before, had been particularly tired after starting school and had been pretty upfront about it(a trait I had noticed before in a previous conversation).  
So I told my coworker, ""it sounds to me like she might be an introvert"".  I was immediately met with a look of disdain(?) and told to ""keep those sort of thoughts to myself"".  I asked for clarification, got an I would know X better than you(totally valid point i have no real issue with as she is correct) but followed that with ""there's no way she's an introvert(clarifying that she did not fear something worse than what I actually said).  I kind of just sat there for another minute getting some disapproving glances.  When asked if we could talk more so I could understand what happened she refused so I chose to leave.
I guess I'm really asking, is there some sort of negative image around introverts I'm not aware of?  Especially among older individuals, as I have little frame of reference for back then and I'm confused why I got such a visceral reaction? Am i the Asshole?

""Let's fuck but don't tell my girlfriend about it.""

I honestly can't tolerate cheating, so I devised a plan. I pretended to be interested and tried to pry out some information about him that might reveal his identity. After a few mins of 'sexy' talk, I managed to get his phone number.

I quickly saved that prick's number and checked if it is registered to any of my social apps (Telegram, Viber, Snapchat). Sure enough, it was. I then messaged his girlfriend our Omegle convo and told him about his secret escapades on this site, It felt good though.

She replied in an hour or so, but her reaction was quite the opposite of what I expected. She's blaming me for seducing her bf (even though it is clear in the screen grab I sent that HE started it) and even threatened to publicly shame me on FB. I keep on explaining to her that I only want to warn her of his prick bf, but she won't listen.

That's not all, even her friends AND her stupid bf joined the fight. They've been messaging and cyberbullying me nonstop since the incident. My friends too reacted harshly and told me it's wrong for me to destroy somebody else's relationship.

Honestly  if a stranger tried to warn me of my partner's  shady actions, I would look into it and try to find out the truth myself. Of course I don't trust this stranger, but I would start to doubt my partner, especially if this said stranger included some proofs. I'd rather know the truth than stay ignorant my whole life.  


And I think the reason why this guy made me so angry to come up with this plan is, I just got out of a relationship. My partner cheated. I guess I thought of her gf's feelings more than my creepy actions. I apologize.",33,47,0.84

381,Asshole,"I work for a medium sized company. My job position is quite busy and there is a lot to get through every day, but we make it work. I have been there for three years. 

In April we hired a new person to the department. She seems to be capable enough, although I have noticed from April that she has taken about a dozen sick days on top of her paid vacation which she took this summer. At first I figured it was no big deal, as people get sick and I didn't know what she was going through, but over time I began to notice a pattern. She almost always takes Monday off, usually when we are going to be slammed with a whole bunch of work. She comes in on Tuesday looking unwell in the morning, but by lunch time she has made a miracle recovery. The other times she took Friday off, which usually aren't as busy as Mondays.

On Monday morning I got to work, and as is often the case, she had called in saying she had a fever. This Monday was going to be particularly brutal because it was the end of the quarter and we could have really used her help. I worked for twelve hours and we barely finished our work inside of the department, and when I got to my car that evening I noticed she had texted me in the morning:

>Hey! I'm going to take a mental health day today. Do you mind doing [task that takes between 30 minutes and an hour] for me? Thanks!

I was just disgusted at this point because of all of the late days I had to work, she was at the center of so many of them. Maybe she was sick before, but I frankly didn't believe it any more and figured she was just taking more ""mental health days."" 

I told my boss what she texted me and he responded that he'd handle it in the morning. Well, first thing the next morning, she comes in looking on the verge of death as is her usual act, and he calls her into his office. Apparently he told her that he knew about her mental health days and that he was fed up with her playing hooky because she knew we were going to be busy. 

After that she gave up the sick act and began loudly complaining about me to everyone in the office. At lunch time she was waiting for me at the door to the cafeteria and confronted me about how shitty what I did was, so I simply responded that she shouldn't pass her work onto other people because she was too lazy to come in. She got visibly furious and embarrassingly yelled ""MENTAL. HEALTH. DAY."" in front of everyone at me, then went back upstairs.

I don't know what people think about this because nobody really wants to step in the crap that's in the middle of our office, but I'm getting a lot of sideways looks. I don't feel like the asshole here but I could be wrong.",303,276,0.86

384,Not the A-hole,"(Background: This happened a few months ago between myself; Corey; Maria and Katrina (names changed). We are all 27; and Katrina, Maria and myself grew up together. I am more introverted and shy compared to Maria and Katrina - and that's how they met Corey - through clubbing and partying. Last thing to note, is my name is Emma Smith (again, names changed -but my actual name is a similar common/popular name in our town. There are more than one person with my name here.)

I met Corey at Maria's birthday dinner and we exchanged facebook details at the end of the night. The next day we began talking and Corey sent me a message stating that we seemed to run with most of the same people. He then asked me if I knew the ""other"" Emma Smith. I didn't - so I said as much. Corey then proceeds to tell me all these things about Emma Smith; who Maria and Katrina HATE with a passion and I quickly realise he's talking about me when he mentions that Emma is a ""childcare worker who thinks she's actually making a difference when all she does is change asses for a living"". Nice. Cliff notes are that these women have been going around telling their clubbing circle that I am a loser who does ""nothing with her life"" because I don't ""club/party/drink/have lots of sex"". They regard my life as 'boring' and 'useless' and that I am a 'waste of space'. Not that I need to make excuses for myself - but I have (diagnosed) bad anxiety and depression. Drinking/clubbing/partying just makes me feel so much worse after I do it, and I don't enjoy it at all. I also need an emotional relationship for sex - I don't feel comfortable with hookups - unlike Katrina and Maria; but I never talk about their lifestyle or say anything outside of ""be safe/text me when you get home"". 

This is where I'm not sure if I'm the jerk or not. The one thing I did unintentionally - was answer our friends' questions on why I had defriended/blocked/refused to see Maria and Katrina. I asked them not to pick sides, stuck to the facts and was honest about my 'explosion' (which they told our friends I randomly lost my shit for no reason at them) and all of them immediately defriended them upon hearing. 

 I easily admit that I exploded at these women, called them a bunch of names, and screenshotted a conversation where Katrina had admitted to cheating on her long term fiance with several other guys and sent that to her fiance. I accept that I suck here - but the end result is that he left Katrina and Katrina has appeared several times on my doorstep begging to talk; saying she needs my support - and I shut the door everytime. Recently I've had Maria turn up on my doorstep saying ""I caused Katrina to develop depression"" and that  I ""completely overreacted and need to apologise now because they've lost everything and it's all my fault"". I feel guilty as fuck - but I also don't want to just apologise or let them back in - so am I overreacting and my life is just a waste""?",341,2689,0.95

But, he is still a good friend of mine who I see frequently. A few months ago, Alvin and I bonded over this specific brand of seltzer. So, every once and awhile I will pick up a bottle for him if I know I am going over his house or he will be coming over mine. They are only $0.99 so I always saw it as a really casual thing.

Mom said it's totally up to me, but reminded me that when she remarried she invited my dad and stepmom.

The reason I don't want to invite my stepmom is I'm a lesbian, marrying a woman, and my stepmom is homophobic.

Dad says it's just how she was raised, but I was raised in a homophobic environment too (mom and dad have since reevaluated some stuff and become a lot more accepting but it took some work). Then he said it's a generational thing but she's only 15 years older than me and technically we're from the same generation.

I'm also inviting my stepdad to the wedding with mom. I feel like if it was just my birth parents who were invited I'd get away with it but to invite both parents, and stepdad but not stepmom would definitely cause drama.

Truthfully, I don't want my stepmom there. At all. She's insanely homophobic but it's also important to me that both my dads are there and IDK if my birth dad will still go if I tell him that stepmom can't come, and I'd be putting him in a really awkward situation.

Ironically, she also does not spend a single cent on the cats she adopted. We have 6 cats now already, and I am the one feeding and cleaning after them when my daugher is outside saving the day.

The only thing is, is the amount of arguments and toxicity in the friendship, Don’t get me wrong when we were good we were so so good, but when it got bad it got very bad. Fast forward to two years out of high school and we’re still getting in the same kind of arguments, but she lost someone very close to her half way through last year, I was her support person along with a few others but I found it very hard to always be there for her as we were still getting into the same arguments as we always have been. She always struggled when we had a third person in our group.Coming to this year she’s really struggling dealing with grief and I was doing my best to support her but I constantly getting told by her that my support isn’t enough and “it’s okay I can’t talk to ..., she understands” .

I love my mother more than anything and there is no bias involved towards my sister. I wanted my mother to find a good man she loves and when she did I encouraged her to get a child with him.

I was 20 when my sister was born. Her father sadly died few years after that and I was super glad that my mother still had my sister because I couldnt be there for her as much as I wanted to.

Now I never had a ""real"" relationship with my sister. I live rather far away so I just visit a few times a year, send gifts on special occasions etc.
I think that's why I dont really feel anything towards her. I wish her all the best and wouldn't ever wrong her, but I dont love her. I probably dont even like her. My mother on the other hand really, really wants us to have this amazing bond of big sister-little sister that love each other and so on. I feel terrible because I simply dont feel anything. I am closer in age to my mother than I am to my sister. I simply cant see how with this age gap and distance we can have a dream relationship. But I never said anything to my mother and always act like I love my sister and would do anything for her.

But I really want to spend time with my mother alone. My sister is 6 now, she is very social and doesnt really have an issue with staying with relatives or a baby sitter besides not having my moms attention. Still the only time we spent just the two of us when I visited is when she was asleep.

Now I got invited to a ceremony for top 500 apprentices in our region where I'll get a certificate and it's generally to honor the best of this year. I can bring two guests, so I decided to invite my mother and my bf. At first my mother was looking for someone to babysit my sister, but then she got this ""amazing"" idea that she can just give my sister a sick note for school (she is 6) and take her to the event as well since ""children surely dont count towards te 2 guests per person limit"". I really dont want my sister to be there. She is a kid and she doesnt know how to behave properly and needs all the attention there is. It's not her fault, but I want this to be about me for once and not about ""Look what your sister accomplished"".

Also I am moving to a new flat soon and my mother offered to help me, but now she also wants to have my sister there even though we will be working on the flat all the time and I really dont see how painting and taking care of a child so that she doesnt do anything bad with said paint, glue etc is a good idea.

I feel like an asshole that I dont want to have my sister at the ceremony and think about declining the invitation, look for an excuse for my mother and not going alltogether.

408,Asshole,"I have a young coworker (22). He took a ""promotion"" at this small business that we work at. Basically it's doing the same job he was doing plus more at a salaried rate. The owner snookered him by offering him what sounded like a lot of money but he's making less money because he's working more hours. Plus there is a legal minimum wage for salaried workers and he's being shorted by 7K a year. So he's being paid less money for more work. If that's not bad enough, the owner throws his ""raise"" in his face everytime he messes up.


I hate working there and am actively looking for another position because if they'll do him dirty like that then they'll do me worse because I don't socialize with them outside of work so I'm not considered one of them. I won't tell him because that runs the risk of his saying that I told him that he was being ripped off and I'll be out of a job.

410,Asshole,"I've known my best friend Lisa since middle school and we attended one year of college together before I transferred. We stayed super close through all four years of college though because my new school was in the same city. We've had what feels like thousands sleepovers, dinner dates, movie nights and heart-to-hearts that have cemented our bond as each other's oldest friends.

But for how close we are, we have always hung out one-on-one because she gets SUPER weird around my other friends. With just me, she’s normal and fun and a mostly mellow girl with a big laugh that I love. She doesn’t drink and has anxiety but that doesn’t stop her from meeting new people and being chatted up by strangers all the time because she's very fashionable and has a unique/interesting career. Generally, she's just a cool and normal girl.

But with my other groups of friends, specifically in nighttime settings, she acts VERY weird and is a lock to ruin the vibe. She’ll get quiet and when asked getting-to-know-you questions, she’ll mumble her response or answer while looking only at me (wtf?). She'll make awkward jokes that border on being rude and laugh REALLY loudly over random things that no one else finds funny. For example, at one of my birthday celebrations at a beach house, she wouldn't talk to anyone but me, declined to partake in playing volleyball, and when one of my friends bopped the ball into the window of the AirBnB and cracked it, Lisa laughed SO loudly for about five minutes straight. I knew my friends were miffed because while we were all kind of stressed and trying to evaluate the damage, there Lisa was, sitting by herself laughing nonstop. 

She’ll also isolate one word or phrase from someone’s story that sounds funny to her (and just her) and laugh about that forever. This is stuff she doesn't do one-on-one!! And lastly, because she doesn’t drink, she is not the kind of friend you can leave unattended over the course of the night.

So long story short, I didn’t invite her to my 12-person bachelorette. I did invite some girls I don't know as well and she was devastated. She said that I’m her oldest friend and that she had always looked forward to being with me during all the milestones of my life. She also said I am prioritizing having a ""good drinking crew"" over our 16 years of friendship, which did hit me hard.

But I just want to have a fun bachelorette where I'm not constantly watching out for her and stressing about whether she is happy, or if she is offending anyone by being standoffish and ignoring their attempts to make conversation.

Some of my friends have said that this is harsh and they’d be heartbroken to be left out of such a big event. But I personally have no intentions of changing my mind because shitty as it sounds, I’ve been through this before, and I know group activities are just more fun without her there.

411,Not the A-hole,"I don’t own a car, so for the past 7 years I’ve used my city transit system on a daily basis to get around. Overall, my experience has been good.  But every few months, I encounter a situation where I’m waiting at a stop, clearly visible, and the bus that’s supposed to pick me up doesn’t stop, and blows right past me. In all of these circumstances, there’s been no “out of order” signs, and the bus doesn’t appear full.

Every time (and I mean every time, without exception) this has happened, I am on the phone with the manager of the city bus line within a minute or less, reporting the incident. I give as much detail as possible (description of the driver, bus #, etc.) and am always friendly. If I had to estimate, I’d guess that I’ve probably complained about 20-25 times over the course of the past 7 years of using the bus line. I’ve never confronted any of the bus drivers, though a couple of them, the next time they picked me up, gave me a very dirty scowl, implying they got in some deep shit over my complaint.

Some of my friends (who are sometimes with me when it happens) discourage me from doing it, saying things like, “Just let it go,” or “Let’s just wait for the next bus,”, or imply that it’s shitty of me to risk getting a low-wage bus driver fired over a single incident.

413,Not the A-hole,"A little back story:

At the beginning of September my manager/ store owner showed me the schedule for the month of September which is unusual. Typically she sends an email to the staff about a week prior to the following month asking about availability, however this month she forgot or something. Anyway, on the first of September (A date I knew I was working because it was on the schedule for August) my manager told me that I was scheduled for the 13th. I told her I would have to check and see if I could work but wasn’t sure. 

The next day I email her saying that I had a previous engagement for that day so I would be unavailable to work. She tells me that I have to work because none of the other staff (one other girl) was also busy. After a lot of back and forth I told her in no uncertain terms that I was unavailable to work on the 13th. This morning I get an email from her saying that she has decided to terminate me and that I need to tell her where I want my final paycheck sent. 

Now where my decision comes. In my state (California) when an employer terminates an employee the employer has to give them their final check immediately after termination. In her email she stated that she is going to send me my check on the 15th after I asked if I could pick it up today. The labor law (which I don’t think that my employers are aware of) in California also states that for every day that my employer doesn’t have a check for me, they owe me one days wage (which for me is roughly 90 dollars a day and will add up to 1k by the time they say they’re going to pay me). It is also worth mentioning that my employer is around 65-70 years old, and although this thousand dollar penalty wouldn’t destroy them or cause them them to starve, the labor board filing suit against them may shut down their business.

In my experience with my employer, they have typically treated me with fairness and are usually reasonable (although there is the odd occurrence), however they were particularly nasty when we were talking through email the other night, and I know they have been less than fair with some of my co-workers who had to fight to get paid minimum wage.

415,Everyone Sucks,"Throwaway because my boyfriend will tease me for posting this to reddit 

So, basically as the title suggests, I’m one of those people who slows down when someone is tailgating me. Not really slowing down just taking my foot of the gas and re-adjusting my speed to make sure I’m going exactly the speed limit. Only in instances where I can do so without feeling in danger but at the same time feel they are being super aggressive. 

One instance was on a road that is 50 mph with regular passing zones but times in between where there is only one lane. I was driving in an area where it was currently one lane, as someone speeds up down the road till they are inches away from my bumper. I got annoyed, and took my foot off the gas to gradually go back down to the speed limit instead of my normal 5 over. The driver stays on my number and when we get to a passing zone continues to stay right on me without passing. I slow down even more and they continue to tailgate me and I see them in the mirror getting visibly angry.  The passing zone ends and as the double line is ending they try to pass me. I speed up so they can’t do so since I would have to drive off the road in order for them to be able to by. The other driver is definitely seething at this point, so I just decide to pull over. They pass me, flip me the bird, and all is well again.

I thought that the situation was not a big deal but my boyfriend said I am a dick for slowing down even though I am going exactly the speed limit.

So, AITA for slowing down for tailgaters, or this tailgater specifically?

Edit: Okay I’m kind of a dick which I felt I had coming. I felt as if he would have hit me if I didn’t speed up when the lane was ending, but I slow down when I’m being tailgated half for safety half being passive aggressive.

418,No A-holes here,"I’m (24M) starting my first job teaching at a High School this week. I’m pretty stressed, with it being my first year teaching and all. My parents have been kind enough to let me stay at their house rent-free since I graduated, and it’s perfect since they live in the same town of the school I’m working at. I’m super grateful, but my dad made a request that seemed crazy to me.

At the start of this week, he informed me that one of his old friend’s mother just passed away, and they’re holding the funeral near our town. My dad offered our place for his old friend and his family to stay at while they attend the service. But it’s going to be his WHOLE family - 18 people. My parents keep a fairly big house, with 6 bedrooms in all, but this is going to be wall-to-wall cramped with people no matter which way you look at it.

So the night before my first day on the job, the entire house is going to be swarmed with people taking up every bed and couch. My dad offered up my bed as well, and when I asked him where I would be sleeping for the night, he told me that I would just have to share a bed with my mom (my dad will be out of town during this time). When I told him that I did not want to give up my bed the day before an already stressful first day of work, he called me unreasonable and said “It’s really not that big of a deal.”

At first I told him that 18 people is way too many, and maybe the family should consider splitting a hotel for a couple of them. My dad said no way to that. My mom (who is mostly on my side in the matter) offered to sleep on the floor while I get the bed, but that would make me feel way too guilty. And if I opted for the floor it’s guaranteed I’m not going to get a good night’s sleep for the day ahead. I’m considering just getting a motel room, but it seems like an unnecessary cost, plus all of my stuff is at the house, so I’d be more or less living out of my car for the night if I did that.

I really appreciate my parents for letting me crash with them, but I’m also incredibly upset over this arrangement. Is it truly unreasonable for me to really REALLY not want to sleep in the same bed as my mom when I’m 24 goddamn years old and I have to start my first job the next day? AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: 

I wanted to do a quick update on the situation. Thank you, everyone, for your input - truly.

After reviewing all of the comments I’ve done self-reflection and realized that I am the asshole in this situation. I think the stress from my first full-time job really hit home, compounded with the way in which my dad delivered the news so nonchalantly (earning the ire of my mom as well when it came to light that he would be out of town while this chaos ensued).

Without going into details about where I live, the price for a motel, even for one night, would be waaaaay outside my budget. Even the 1-star murder-holes. I should’ve looked it up before even posting this.

I really needed to reexamine my own maturity about sleeping in the same bed as my mom and figure my priorities out. It wasn’t as much that I was so against sleeping in the same bed as my mom, as I had a feeling of being betrayed by my dad for the situation. I totally get that it’s unfortunate timing that couldn’t be helped, but my feelings were clouding my judgement.

Thank you to the people that understand what it’s like to live with parents as an adult. I contribute towards my stay by keeping up the yard, cleaning, cooking, and other errands. I assure you that once I’m able to, I’ll get my own place, but it’s hard to do on a teacher’s salary.

And thanks for people wishing me luck on my first day! Hopefully I’ll still get a good night’s sleep tonight in a full bed with my mom.",184,182,0.96

OK I won't beat arround the bush. I hate my SIL. She is a very shallow and mean. She is still very much stuck in the high school bully phase. Imagine a girl that loves causing problems and being in the spot light  plus always being the victim and there you got my SIL. 

I never make her feel unwelcome or exclude her. After they started dating I voiced my concerns but was met with deaf ears. So I just let it be and ignored her. At their wedding I was seated by the toilette entrance away from imedeate family etc. 

I decided that I would let go the grudges and simply treat her like a guest more. 

Strike one was when she appeared with a white cocktail dress to the wedding. It's okay I am annoyed but it's my day so whatever. 

Strike two was her complaining about everything and making snarky remarks how her wedding was so much better than mine. 

But the straw that broke the camels back was her blowing up on an idea we ""stole"". For their wedding she had a huge wedding cake with a color transition (pink to lilac), that was chocolate strawberry filling. My cake also had a color transition but it was from orange to sunsetpink and the filling was the same as that is literally the only cake I like. She threw a full blown crying fit accusing me of wanting to upstage her. The drama git so big (SIL kept bringing out petty things from the past) that I had my husband's uncle and cousins literally throw her out. (edit : she was literally lashing out stomping arround like a little kid. You couldn't talk to her like a normal human being) 

My brother is furious with me and said that I should have just checked with them if we wanted to use the same cake idea and that I was just looking for a reason to treat SIL badly. My mom said that throwing her out was over the top that I should just have asked her to leave and my dad doenst give a fuck.

420,Everyone Sucks,"I am older brother of a pair of twin sisters, 14 and 10. Every week our parents would give us some money for snacks in addition to pocket money, which 3 of us were to share. It would be put into a jar in the living room and we are free to take from it.


My sisters would usually take all the money immediately and buy snacks for themselves, hiding them from me. After a while I complained to my parents about it and they set a rule that snacks should also be kept in the living room cabinet. It was then they started buying snacks I dislike, like seaweed BBQ flavored crackers and potato chips. Since I wouldn't eat them, they still ended up eating most of the snacks. I would say that I don't mind since I am older and things like that but no, I do mind when it becomes a common routine for my sisters.


So I took the money from the jar first this week and bought a load of durian puffs. I like durian puffs but my sisters hate them. They got angry at me and said that I stink up the whole cabinet of durian smell, even their stash got affected. They complained to our parents about it and they are calling me an immature brat. Why is it that they can do it and I cant? So sick of letting the girls having their way just because they are the younger and majority of us, I just want to enjoy some durian puffs myself, not like I buy them all the time, just this once.

UPDATE: For those confused about ""14 and 10"" age I meant that I am 14 and my sisters are 11, I phrased it wrongly and also forgotten their birthday passed.


Also, we were not supposed to ""split"" the money into 3 as our parents want us to buy snacks together. As the elder one I was also supposed to give more to my younger sisters. So we kind of ended up 2 vs 1 most of the times.",50,239,0.94

424,Not the A-hole,"I recently took some engagement photos for an old highschool friend. Photography is a hobby of mine, and they liked the photos I had put up on social media. I have always been fond of her, and her fiance is awesome, so I gladly offered to do portraits for them free of charge.

Scheduling issues and environmental problems resulted in us going out on three separate shoots. While this wasn't ideal, and took more of my time than I would have liked, I was okay with it because I genuinely enjoy the hobby and it wasn't anyone's fault that we had to reshoot. I also appreciated the practice, as I've toyed with the idea of turning the hobby into a profession.

When we finally finished with the portraits, which they were pleased with, they expressed that they'd like for me to take some photos at the wedding. I was outwardly and vocally apprehensive, as that is a huge responsibility that I have never held, and wasn't entirely certain I could take. They calmed my nerves by saying they were only wanting a few group portraits of various groups like the groomsmen and bridesmaids. I agreed on the condition that these planned portraits were all to be expected, and that I wouldn't need to try and capture lovingly candid moments during the reception or ceremony. I did mention that if I found myself with the opportunity to take an amazing candid picture, I would take it, but I didn't feel comfortable with that responsibility. There was also no mention of payment, though again, I enjoy the hobby and they are friends.


I am admittedly nervous, but found comfort in the idea that I'd only be expected to take a handful of large, simple group photos.


Today I received an email from the bride-to-be, with a breakdown of the photos they are wanting to have taken. These plans include not only a much larger number of group and family portraits than expected, but also a note that I will arrive early to photograph the groom getting prepared. Additionally, she has asked if I will take photos during the Ceremony, something I explicitly said I wouldn't be comfortable with.

The wedding is in a little over a month, and with these new expectations and requests, my already existing nervousness and apprehension around photographing the wedding have increased 10 fold. I am very much considering backing out, though I am worried that A. I'd be letting down a good friend, and B. With only a month until the wedding, I'm unsure of how likely they are to vet and book another photographer in time.

If I did this as a profession and were getting paid for it, I'd gladly suck it up and do my job, but photography is something I do for fun and for likes on facebook. This has quickly become not fun.

So my partner and I have majority custody of my step daughter. Her father sees her a few nights a week and usually has her over night. Cool, she loves him and we want to support her having a good connection with her dad.

A while ago he began a second job at night. He gets paid cash and doesnt declare it. Because of this new job he now has less time to spend with his daughter. A few months ago he majorly cut back on his declared day job and upped the cash in hand stuff.  He sees his daughter even less, his declared income dropped a tonne. This drop has lowered his child support substantially. We are a single income family of 5 (3 kiddos). He now has a new house, new car. He claims he is doing this for his daughters benefit. (She will get the house etc) however he just got back from a 5 week vacation without her. We had her the whole time.

I am fed up. I feel like we are free child care for him and he just barely sees his own daughter. Even when he does have her she is back in a few hours at most. It breaks my heart because this girl is dying to see him and she gets so excited for the tiny tidbit he gives. He gets to be super dad for the brief window she sees him as hes cashed up and then she comes back to reality. I spoke to him saying that it wasnt right and he should do the right thing.

SO and I met in highschool. Were together for 10 years, married for 5 of those 10. No kids. We purchased a home during said marriage. He and I both work, always kept our finances separate, and split all expenses down the middle. His best friend has rented a room in our house since the home was purchased and best friend pays rent each month, albeit a very low amount of rent. But if you work for the tax man, that last sentence is not true and idk what you're talking about.

Fast forward to the marriage breakdown-- We couldn't work out our differences. My lawyer said this is the least contentious separation she has had in a while. We managed to all live under the same roof for 5 months while we prepped the house to sell it. I didn't want share space with him and his bestie anymore so I opted to rent a room from an internet stranger. I still come and go unannounced to grab stuff.

So, we're both rational beings... until... he texted me while I was at work asking if he could bring a love interest to the house. I'm pissed/ticked/angry/furious and have yet to respond bc I can't conjure a kind response. Most of my friends suggest I am overreacting.

I have been dating and I am glad to hear he is too. We will always be a big part of each other's history. I just can't fathom how he could even ask if he can Netflix and chill using the account his ex-wife pays for in the house his ex-wife still pays (essentially half) for.

429,Asshole,"A while back, my neighbors had some stuff that they didn't want on the sidewalk. I asked my daughter if she wanted to check it out, she said no. I took a few things, including a doll in a wicker stroller; it looked [just like this, but without the top](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Baby-Carriage-Buggy-Antique-Doll-Wicker-Stroller-Pram-Victorian-Canopy-Convertib-/401402804139). I was originally going to give the doll and stroller to a *different* friend for her daughter, but when I inspected the doll it was in very poor condition. My daughter came over while I was looking at it, and after I decided to toss the doll, she put the cat in the stroller. The cat settled in the stroller, and I jokingly said ""Look like it's the cat's stroller now.""

I'm a hobbyist photographer, and ended up doing a photoshoot with the cat in the stroller. I got a handful of offers from other photographers to buy the stroller for their own baby photo shoots, but I always declined. The cat would sleep in it sometimes (along with the many other places in the house the cat can sleep in), and my daughter would try to push the cat along in the stroller. When I told her I didn't want her to because I didn't want the metal wheels to damage the wood floor, she attached felt to the wheels so she could do it without damaging the floor. I told her I wished she wouldn't alter my things without asking, she said she thought it was a family item since it belongs to the cat; the felt later fell off of its own accord.

One day, I was visiting my friend in question, showing some pictures to her and her daughter, when the picture of the cat in the stroller came up, and she said she really liked the stroller. I'm close with this family, and consider her daughter like a niece, so I told her she could have it, since she is still young enough to play with dolls. When it later came up with my daughter, she was upset because *she* really wanted the stroller, and should have had the right to first refusal. I told her I would get her a new, better one, she said that I should make that offer to my niece. I didn't want to, because I wanted to keep my word to my niece (my daughter declined my offer of getting her a different stroller). Some time after giving the stroller to my niece, I found out that her mom had another friend visiting (also a photographer), and made an offer to my niece to ""buy"" the stroller in favor of a new stroller to my niece, and my niece accepted and exchanged the stroller.

 I (M17) was putting my shoes on and getting ready to go walk the dog. The guy then asked me if I could come around the stove and help him lift. I was like sure I guess so I went around on one end. Now this repair man barely speaks any English, and I saw  my dad helping him to take the stove out of the stove compartment, and remembered how he barely gave him any directions (to my dad). So I was just waiting for a physical sign (feeling the weight of the stove, him grunting or smthing...) to start lifting the stove back into place. He undid one of the metal mini scaffold thingis holding the stove so I felt more weight on my arms. I thought that meant we had to start lifting so I pulled up. I'm not sure if that threw the stove off balance , or if he started pulling up and we pulled unevenly, but it resulted in the stove crashing into the expensive black marble countertop right across from the stove. A huge chunk of marble just snapped off, smashing into the wooden floor. I tried slowing down it's fall but there was no stopping it. 

So then my dad and the worker are both depositing claims, with the worker explicitly stating several times that it was all my fault. My dad got pissed at me for maybe causing it (plus I was wearing socks not shoes) but then he told me that the repair guy wasn't allowed to use me for his job (me being underage and all+what he was using was super unsafe). Idk who is gonna end up paying for it (it's probably gonna cost a shit ton, it's like a 5 by 3 polished slab), and I feel super bad, but my parents are telling me im not liable. So basically ye fuck me

TLTR: Basically the repair man asked me to help put a super heavy stove back into it's compartment, it fell and broke of a big chunk of our marble table and now I feel rly bad.",32,177,0.95
436,Asshole,"A client of mine bought this bottle for me as a thank you gift. I went out of town and my friend who is house sitting for me, decided to drink it without asking and just said that they will replace it later.

AITA for being upset? 

WIBTA for saying that I wont have them house sitting for me in the future?

438,Everyone Sucks,"We have been friends for almost 20 years. My baby shower is going to be next month and I don't want to invite her. I know she won't pay attention to her kids, she is incredibly loud and obnoxious in situations like that because she loves attention and will go out of her way to make sure she is the center of attention, every gift I get will be compared to items she already has for her kids, and she won't really know anyone else there so she will make it difficult to socialize with all of my other friends and with mine and my fiance's family that will be coming. On top of that a couple of people that I do want there (including my fiance) dislike her and would prefer she did not come. I have no good excuse to give her and she is the type that won't take me telling her all of this well. She will get very offended, act like I'm making her behavior up, claim she would never do any of that, and then do exactly that. We have been friends for a very long time but I don't want her to ruin my baby shower. An example of the last time I allowed her to be present for something during my pregnancy is below.

She wanted to come to an ultrasound with me and I allowed it once. She brought both of her kids but refused to watch them or try to entertain them so they were either crying or whining while sitting in a chair the whole time while she talked about her family drama or compared her ultrasounds to mine and made it hard to focus on the fact that I was at my anatomy ultrasound, which is actually pretty important. At one point she picked up her one year old and held him in front of my face so I couldn't see the screen while the tech was trying to let me see my baby's face and she kept telling him to attack me, playfully of course but that wasn't the time or place for that and she's fully aware as she got angry with her mom for even making jokes during her ultrasounds. The ultrasound tech seemed annoyed and stopped talking me through the ultrasound and abruptly ended it. I don't even blame the tech. My friend was being awful.

She made that ultrasound miserable. It was the most important and last one of my pregnancy and she knows that. I had already mentioned to her the theme for the baby shower before the ultrasound incident so she already knows I am having one. I am strongly considering telling everyone that no pictures on social media are allowed at the baby shower and lying to her to avoid conflict. My fiancee's mother and my mother are throwing the shower for me and neither of them want her there either but said if I want her there they will invite her. 

So, WIBTA if I lied to her and told her it was immediate family only so I could get away with not inviting her?

Edit:
I think what I have decided to do is just have the baby shower actually be family only. It was going to be 95% family anyway and have a separate dinner party with just friends where she will be invited because it won't be a big deal if she ruins a dinner party and I won't run the risk of her and my family arguing if someone tells her to stop making everything about her. Baby shower will be kept off social media regardless at my fiance's request as he does not want our child to have any social media presence whatsoever.",162,814,0.96

441,Not the A-hole,"I have 2 dogs that I walk 3 times a day. I always pick up after them. Also I live in a neighborhood with a HoA.

So I've had 2 neighbors come to me saying they don't want me walking my dogs on the sidewalk by their house. The first neighbor I explained that isn't going to happen. It's a public sidewalk and I always pick up after them. He explained that they damage his yard with their pee. Though I understand, I doubt it's my dogs that are causing such a problem since they barely go near his yard. If they do, it's on the outer side of the sidewalk and not their yard. Anyways, we came to an understanding after I said it's unrealistic for me to go around his house and if I did it for him I'd have to do it for every house in the neighborhood. At that point I'd only be walking in the street when I go outside and I'd be damned if I'm denied walking my dogs in my own neighborhood. We understood and there was no problem. 

Fast forward to today when another neighbor drove up to me yelling that she doesn't want my dogs to go near her yard. Again, not on her yard but the portion near her mailbox. She explained that she has a dog that will go in their yard if she smells another dogs poop or piss. Asked her why that's my problem that her dog isn't trained as she wants. She than said the poop gets into her lawn mower to which I explained I pick up after my dogs each time. If other pet owners don't pick up after their dog she should talk to them. She than said I should have my dogs go in the lot where there is no house (they never built a house there) and walk in the street when I come to her house.

I asked her what does she expect me to do. Am I to carry my dogs in my hands until I reach that lot to make them go? She said her dogs are trained to go on command to which I said great, than you should train your dog to not go in your yard when she smells other dogs. Continued saying there is no way I'm walking in the street at your house which has a blind turn. Cars speed in and out of the neighborhood and I'm not endangering my dogs for her.

End the conversation by saying I'm not trying to be disrespectful but I am not going to carry my dogs to that lot, they are already trained to go on the grass when they are outside, I am not walking in the street when there is a public sidewalk and if you want dogs to not go in your yard you should talk to the people who don't pick up after their dog or live in a neighborhood that doesn't allow pets but in the meantime I will try to rush when I'm at your house but if my dogs go, there isn't anything I can do but pick it up as I've always done.

&#x200B;

I'm going to continue what I normally do but am I the asshole here? I figure as long as I pick up after my dogs each time, that it's a public road and they aren't the ones damaging her yard than I should be good, but maybe I'm wrong.",64,113,0.9
442,Not the A-hole,"EDIT UPDATE:
We met up for a beer yesterday and all is well. I’ll accept that I could have went about things better.  Some of you read better than others.



On mobile so I’ll try to keep it short.

My wife and I had friends over the other day (two couples).  We had dinner which was kind of like a thanksgiving style dinner and were hanging out when there’s a knock on the door.  My friend’s wife had invited a friend of hers over.  Nobody asked my wife or myself if it’s ok for her to have somebody come to our house.

I had (quietly) asked my friend, “who the hell is that?”  He just said, “that’s [wife’s name] friend.” As if to say, “take it up with her.”

So I said, “damn that’s really cool to invite somebody over to eat our food and not ask, that’s bullshit.”   Nobody else heard this exchange.

I went to my room for a second and vented to my wife.  Upon returning to the kitchen I hear my friend saying something while walking back into the house. (He was talking to somebody out back) “Well Nicker87 is already pissed off so let’s go.”

I asked to speak with him to express why I’m upset and to say I’m not mad AT them.  I think he expected things to go further because he says, “fine let’s go out front.”   We do,  I tell him why I’m upset.  I have valuables, I have kids,  I don’t want random ppl coming to my house unless I say it’s OK.  He chuckles (as if to not take me seriously) and says I was more mad at the situation than I should be and they’ll leave.  I explained im not kicking anybody out but if they want to leave then that’s their prerogative.  They left.

I feel like I’m in the right, but I’ve been feeling bad all day and this is just replaying in my
mind.  Did I over react?  Am I wrong for asking this of them?

TL;DR friend invited somebody to my home without checking with me,  I made mention to it.  Idk if I’m an asshole over it.",159,586,0.97

Info: this reaction was out of character for him, he's never had signs of chronic anxiety so I wasn't gaslighting him. The trees aren't dead, they are healthy but we have been losing limbs all summer due to IMO, woodpeckers, carpenter ants, and ash bore beetles. Xcel energy has evaluated the transformer poles and limbs near the lines and have put us on a fix it waiting list for the past 3 months, I'm waiting impatiently. He is the one who arranged the head of his bed by the window so he could sketch the backyard during the day, he slept at the foot of his bed last night. It was his first day of 7th grade today so back to school jitters may have played a role here.

445,Not the A-hole,"This junior has been at the firm for just over a year at this point, whilst working on my current client for about 3 weeks and despite consistent support and mentoring they've failed to turn in work and anything that they do turn in is work completed by others or of extremely poor quality. I had set up a meeting between myself, the junior and their direct manager/mentor, their counselling partner also agreed to sit in alongside HR. By no means was this meeting intended to be us slating the junior or intending to fire him, I had set it up with the full intention of understanding the reasoning behind the junior's lack of work and effort and if there was anything we could do additionally to support them. I personally had alot of issues at home when I first started which significantly affected my work and the firm went above and beyond to support me so I wanted to provide the same opportunity for this junior.


About 30 minutes from the meeting, the junior sends an email to us stating ""My brother has suddenly passed away and I will not be available for the coming few days."" We of course reach out and send our condolences and messages of support, however at this point the HR manager in attendance looks very annoyed and simply states that this all seems far too convenient. So after a little bit of discussion and investigation we note that whenever he has had exams, performance reviews or work deadlines coming up he is suddenly afflicted with personal bereavement.


Our firm is extremely lenient with compassionate/bereavement leave however in cases where we feel this is being abused we can directly ask for proof, this can be anything from an obituary, funeral programme or death certificate. I searched for obituaries and funeral programmes online to see if anything was coming up in the brother's name (I did this a few days after we were notified of the ""death""). Once I couldn't find anything and discussed with HR about requesting proof, I did exactly that. I emailed the junior with all relevant staff CC'ed in requesting some degree of proof for their bereavement.


The junior responded in a very attacking manner stating they shouldn't have to provide proof and I was being extremely disrespectful, they decided to CC in all of the other juniors. This issue has left people quite divided on how it has been handled with some saying I was wrong and should always give someone the benefit of the doubt in these situations whilst others have agreed with my methods and stated that abusing the leave policy to get out of work responsibility should be punished.


AITA in this situation? I get it's a highly sensitive topic but the junior's actions have caused many issues for people he has worked alongside. I've of course made this post as vague as possible and changed some details around for privacy sake.",155,428,0.97

447,Asshole,"So I recently saw a post that described an issue similar to the one my girlfriend and I are having right now, so I figured I'd share.

For context, I'm a guy who tries my best to keep it pretty clean. Thankfully I'm not naturally very hairy, and regularly shave my arms, legs, chest, and armpits (partly due to personal preference, and partly the result of habits I developed when I swam in college).

I also just cannot stand body hair on women. Sorry if that statement makes me an asshole, but I just can't get over it. Yes I understand women can do what they want with their bodies, and I respect their decision if they choose not to shave. But no amount of posturing is going to sway me on this one (and I think most guys would admit to feeling the same if you put a gun to their head). So I feel that if I keep myself clean shaven, I'd have more of a leg to stand on if I were to ask a woman to do the same. 

Anywho my girlfriend and I have recently arrived at that stage where we are living together and are comfortable being disgusting around each other (shitting while the other's brushing their teeth, etc.). She's also stopped shaving her armpits as frequently, which has really gotten on my nerves. I politely told her that this is an issue for me, and asked if she would shave more often. She replied by saying that it's 2019, and that women shouldn't be stigmatized for having body hair. 

Yea I suppose she's right, but it still bothers me, so I am refusing to shave my ass/around my asshole until she relents, which has in turn really gotten on her nerves. She thinks I'm an asshole, but I'm merely trying to get her to see things from my perspective.",955,1639,0.84

I’m floored, and my fiancée also admits she has never given second thought to any of the nicknames I call the girls including this one. I told my fiancée if she has an issue with it, she has my number and is more than welcome to call me and tell me her thoughts, something which she will not ever do.

M) who has a hobby of chopping wood, and chainsawing wood into small enough potions to chop.  We live in a residential neighborhood with modest sized homes (2-3 bedroom, post WW2 Sears kit homes if you know what those are) so the properties are spaced comfortably enough but the lawn space isn't massive.  This neighbor has been chopping wood for 2-3 hours more days out of the week than not and frequently uses his chainsaw for hours on end mostly on the weekends AND before the hours of 9am. I looked up the local regulations for noise on weekends and it does indeed state that noise from machinery, loud vehicles, etc. is prohibited at least on Sundays before 9am. Wanna sleep in on the weekends? Haha, not in my neighborhood.

Of note, years past when other family was living in my house one family member finally lost it on this neighbor and yelled at him and I believe the noise stopped for a while or at least lessened.  Over the past summer I overheard one of my newer neighbors lose their mind on him on a Sunday afternoon with a waterfall of expletives peppered into statements like ""I would like to have one dinner with my family on a weekend without you ruining it with all of this racket."" 

So why haven't I confronted him? Yeah I know I should.  I'm not good with confrontation, but honestly if two 40-50ish year old men yelling at him doesn't curb the behavior I'm not sure how a 20s something bookish woman is going to do anything about it.  I'm not afraid of him physically or anything, he seems fairly grandfatherly.  Possibly that's why I feel like the asshole for wanting to take away his seemingly favorite hobby as he nears the end of his time.  I'm just at my wits end though because it sounds like I live next to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

So would I be the asshole for calling the police every time he breaks noise curfew and for prolonged periods of chainsaw noise? Getting back to the panic - he got a full load of logs today and has been unloading them all afternoon.  There is a full pile about 10 meters from my dining room window.

I accept all judgement.

Update: I called around to get more information and I can report noise complaints from sun up to sun down.  Better than that though - the district will plan to cite him for litter in his yard so hopefully that will curb his behavior.

My job responsibilities are more or less to make sure the ship floats and ensure everything is a well lubricated selling machine on top of running regular store operations including keeping track of in store inventory and a few operational things. 

On the 29th of August we received a pair of $170 wireless earbuds into our inventory and when I checked inventory this morning they where missing. When something gets stolen or goes missing what will subsequently happen is everyone on shift the day they went missing gets charged out evenly for the cost of the product. This is about a $40 value that will be charged out of our commissions statement so obviously I wanted to research it due to it being a decent chunk of money. 

My somewhat new coworker recently got a pair of these exact same earbuds within the last few days. I asked him where he ended up getting his pair and he said he bought them on Amazon because they where cheaper than what we sold them for at our store location. He also conveniently has done our accessory portion of inventory for the past 3/4 days we’ve been open. Every day he did inventory they where marked here until today when I did inventory, so combined with the fact he just “bought” a brand new pair it seemed a bit suspicious to me. 

My question is AITA if I ask him to physically show me his order confirmation to make sure he did purchase them through Amazon? 

I just want to make sure I’m not coming across as a toxic or unreasonable manager like some of the horror stories I see on Reddit.

Edit: Employee confessed to “borrowing them until mine came in from amazon” after I politely asked him to send me a SS of his order so we could eliminate him as a suspect(per suggestion from my boss and a few of you on here). 

He understood my position and why I was requesting it and obliged with little to no pushback and initially sent me a SS that showed an order but did not show the date ordered so I was still slightly suspicious because he could’ve bought them after my initial question asking where he got his pair to cover up the fact that he stole them. After asking him if it’d be okay for him to show me the date they where ordered when he came in to work he called me and confessed. 

This was all around a very difficult situation for me as I’m usually somewhat of an over accommodating person and I don’t deal very well with conflict and coming down on people nor do I like stepping on toes/being suspicious but Luckily my higher ups get to make the decision now regarding what happens going forward since I relayed the info onto them.

What I really want to do this year is take my new car (I just bought a mazda mx5 that's been my dream car for a while) and take a road trip around America. I'd use one week of vacation days plus the week of Christmas break. 

My parents told me they want me to come by; my sister had a baby and they want me to meet her. But my sister and I don't have a great relationship, haven't for a while, and IDK if she'd even want me there. I think this might be another time of my parents trying to push us together when neither of us want it.

My boyfriend doesn't want me to go off alone for the holidays, they are really important to him and he doesn't get how I don't feel the same.

471,Not the A-hole,"My sister is newly a single mom, and since she works a lot to provide for her two young kids, my parents volunteered to take on the vast majority of childcare responsibilities. I've expressed concern about the long-term sustainability of this arrangement; it seems to disproportionately place responsibility for the kids on my parents (6 nights/week). Still, they are willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to take care of their grandkids, which is admirable but does not seem happy or healthy for them. 

Here's the thing: recently, I've been asked to help as well. My parents are getting tired and need a night off each week. I'd love to help out occasionally on weekends, but they're asking me to help every Wednesday, which is not convenient for my work schedule. I gently but firmly said I could maybe help once a month, but otherwise that is not a practical setup for me. Their words say ""that's fine"" but I can tell by their tone of voice they're upset/disappointed that I don't want to take on a bigger role. AITA for not being more accommodating?

472,Not the A-hole,"Okay, so my future husband and i are getting married in about a month, intimate wedding overseas. FH has a very dear friend Rob, who we both love and has been FH's best friend since they were very young. 

He had been dating a girl for several years, who I never really cared for, there is a significant maturity/age gap between us, and I have never felt the need to be her friend, but I've always been friendly. About a month ago, she broke up with Rob because she wanted to see other people. Since they broke up, she has been taking advantage of him financially (going on a trip they had scheduled to DC on her own instead of paying him back for the ticket, living in their house rent-free until she finds her own place, calling him to help her take care of \[their\] dog she is keeping in the breakup etc.)  
So FH and I have been encouraging Rob to stop communicating with her, calling him out when he bends over backwards for her etc. However last week, we found out that he hasn't gotten a refund for the plane ticket he bought her to go to our wedding... and that she's still planning on coming. 

  
FH called Rob out about how she is being incredibly disrespectful toward him to think that she would be welcome to come, despite their breakup, (he'll be paying for most of it, since she doesn't have money). Rob ended up telling FH ""you have to tell her she can't come"". (worth noting that FH also does not consider ex-gf a friend, especially not now).  
I don't want to put that on FH, he has so much going on with work etc, so I'm thinking of sending a text to her that says something along the lines of ""Hi ex-gf, Rob mentioned you were still planning on coming to our wedding, however it would cause a lot of tension and I do not want that on our wedding day. I cannot stop you from coming to \[country\] but it comes across as selfish and disrespectful to Rob if you were to go on this trip.""

He replied ""It doesn't mean dumb cunt it mean's dumb person"", I've learnt a tiny bit of Chinese so I told him what dumb person was in Chinese and said how what he said was a worse and was a swear word. He said ""how many Chinese people do you know?"", I said ""probably more than 10"", then he said, ""well whose the one who went to china? I'm right, it means dumb person"".

475,Not the A-hole,"This is my first post in this sub. 

My FIL is mostly OK, but he has moments where I want to shove a pencil in my eye just to get away from him. 

The dilemma I'm facing is that he wants to move in with us (me, my husband and two toddlers). He lived with us for a year about three years ago and it was a disaster. He is quite a bit older — he is 82 — and he had reached the point where it wasn't safe for him to drive anymore. Taking the keys away was difficult for everyone and he was, to some extent, justifiably awful to us over it. Eventually, the nastiness got too much for my pregnant self and we asked him to move into an ALF.

I should stress that my FIL is — under normal circumstances — a nice man. He has generously supported us (he bought us a car and put a down payment on our house). He helps us out financially when we need it and never once has he asked us to repay him. My own father is pretty much JUSTNO, so he is the only parental figure my husband and I have in our lives (both of our mothers have passed away).

He is just so annoying. As I was walking down the aisle at my wedding, he decided to start singing the theme song to the Miss America pageant. At our reception, he tried to stand up and sing a song he wrote for us — and no, he can't sing. He is always coming up with cockamamie schemes to make money and is always trying to finagle us into helping his cause. He has a myriad of health concerns. AND HE IS SO DAMN LOUD. He can't hear, refuses to get hearing aids, and keeps the volume of his television up to 100. His room would be right next to our toddlers' and I'm worried he will keep them awake. I feel like I'd be taking care of three children — And there is a reason my husband and I stopped at two kids. 

Honestly, he is just so exhausting. 

BUT.

I was raised to take care of my elders. My children adore him. It would save us $2,000 a month, which would allow us to no longer live paycheck to paycheck. And he is so old and his health is slowly declining. I don't know how much time he has left and I'm worried I'm taking away his time with my kids and husband.

My husband says the ball is in my court. I feel like I'd be the asshole to put my feelings above the financial security of my family, not to mention the last few years of his life may be spent in an AFL — it's a nice facility, but he is lonely. His girlfriend just moved to another facility. She has Alzheimer's and doesn't really remember him much anymore. 

My life would be much easier if he stayed in the ALF. I don't want him to live with us. But I can tell my husband really wants him to move back in, and my FIL wants it just as desperately.

We also are raising C religion-neutral (is that the right word?).

Anyways, so some of the advice she gave fiance pertained to spanking. She said that we should GET A FUCKING PADDLE. Those were her exact words, mind you.

Fiance knew that this was horseshit and asked my mother what she was thinking, and that even though she was raised in a different time and place, that she should acknowledge that spanking isn't good for C.

My mother just cussed us out and I kid you not, she ran out of the room and slammed the door.

She’s also handy in the garden and cooks us dinner every night. 

We are both disabled after a car accident a few years ago and although we are mobile we are always in pain. On top of that we both work so all in all my daughter being at home (she has no desire to look for a job) is working out as a blessing for us at the moment as she provides a measure of security. 

We decided to charge the 22 year old rent a few months ago, just a couple hundred quid, nothing overly cruel. We have 2 houses, one we all live in and another we have on rent, but the money that we are charging her is going into the general household pot since both girls have expensive tastes and so grocery bills and electricity bills are high. The money from our 2nd home on rent goes into savings.

My 22 year old doesn’t have a problem at all with paying the rent, and both girls are close, both with each other and us.

They consider themselves luck for only having to have four. (Ages 10-1yo) 

So Laura is SAHM and I work nights, when I get off I'll help her a few times a week. Going with them to the park, took the boys to a local renaissance fair so Laura would have time to herself with the baby, laser tag, etc. I enjoy doing these things and they've often said that they think of me as their Aunt, it means a lot to me because I don't have children. 

The oldest boy is starting middle school at a slightly younger age and came to me for advise, I'm proud of everything he said but asked why he didn't have this talk with his mother and he said that she was more preoccupied with the baby girl.

Later in the day Laura and I are relaxing and I tell her the boys issues and advice I gave and she was irritated and asked why he didn't have that moment with her, I reiterated what he said and told that it's understandable that a baby need a bit more of her time. She was visibly hurt and asked me to be completely honest with what I thought about her having multiple children. I was honest and told her I fould it selfish, she had three perfectly healthy boys in hopes that one would be a girl, she could have adopted and instead her husband works two jobs fifty hour weeks to support them but I also know that it was his choice to do this as well. She was fuming, told me I would never understand unless I was mother, and that she could never love a foster or adopted kid as much as her own, this made me cry because I'm foster kid that aged out of the system and she's aware of it. She called me as asshole for that and told me to leave.

It's been about a week and she's called me multiple time and left voicemail apologizing saying that she really needs the help with the boys. I feel like an asshole, I love them and I'm happy they we're born and feel like shit if I implyed otherwise but I'm hurt that I wasn't cared for a child and that there are so many others that won't have the chance because of that mindset.

L: I need you to honest with me right know, do you think I should have stuck to having children?

For reference, he almost never wants to have sex and we have tried alarms,talking about it, etc. He masturbates 3/4 times a week and we recently talked about him cutting down to once a week to see if it improves his libido towards me.

I left for work,forgot something and came back in. He was still in the shower which is unusual for him, so I guess I spied on him. i listened outside the door and heard the literal fap noise and bursted in. I was just home. I wanted to have sex. Damn this stings.

Sooo am I the asshole for interrupting him I guess.


Edited for more info: Weve been having open communication about this for more than six months. He has been continuously masturbating instead of having sex. I am very sex positive and believe masturbating is normal and healthy. After trying a multitude of ways to improve his desire to have sex, this was brought up last week as a possible thing to try, logic being that he is releasing his sexual energy without me and so doesnt feel the need to have sex when we are together. It feels like we just had this discussion and already he is going back on his word and not trying. I do feel terribly guilty about bursting in now. This issue is making me crazy.

Second edit. He has no performance issues when we have sex. He gets hard and finishes in an ordinary manner and time. As far as I know, he has no sexual trauma in his past, nor any strange fetishes. I am quite certain about both of those facts.",174,416,0.86

My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate.

The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman.

I started working in the first one about a year ago when I got out of school. He had a woman doing all the management for the second one but after a huge argument she left and I had to replace her (FYI, I don't have any training in that field at all). So for the past 6 months I am in charge of everything. Sales, marketing, customer service and managing the rooms. I'm his only office worker (he is responsible for the construction sites) and having to manage two companies at a time has been very stressful in the last few months. As you can imagine, when you have so many things to keep an eye on you tend to make some mistakes. And when I make them, even if they're little, I get absolutely destroyed with words. I'm not saying he's an asshole for yelling at me because let's face it, almost every boss is strict, that's how the world works and I'm not expecting to have a nice and understanding boss in my next job. Still, being called an idiot is not fun, especially when you're doing your best to keep your fathers company afloat.

Now here's the thing, as a father he is actually great, he was always there for me, even after losing custody over 10 years ago when my parents divorced. You could say maybe he is doing all the yelling and inducing stress to help me become a man, and I respect that. But I can only endure it this much, I'm fresh out of school after all.

He never tells me this personally but what I've heard is that he always talks about how he couldn't keep going without me, that he had to close the company if I were to quit suddenly. That's why I've already told him that I will probably quit soon and that he should start looking for someone to replace me, but so far he has not made an effort to look for new employees.

I can't keep up this level of stress much longer, It's making me physically and emotionally weak. Selling tiles is something I could imagine doing, but I absolutely hate the other job. WIBTA if I quit the job, risking the company?

497,No A-holes here,"My daughter is 12, and just started her last year of middle school. Already even though she's only been in school for a week and a half, we're having an issue that we had last year as well.

I prepare all of my daughter's lunches, or I will prep several ingredients for things and she can sort of assemble her own lunch. They're healthy, nutritious, and never made up of things she doesn't like. But towards the end of last year and now she has been basically throwing a fit once a week about how she's tired of having her own lunch and she wants to buy lunch. I looked into the school's lunch program, and while it's not as good as a homemade meal, her school has many lunch programs you can sign your kid up for including one that is pretty dang diverse and healthy. I told her I was fine with signing her up for the lunch program if she'd like.

Nope. She wants to have some extra money so she can buy junk and she claims that there is a huge culture of trading food and no one wants hers and she feels left out when everyone else has pizza. The school has little separate kiosks for junk food that are open at various points in the week, and I know if I gave her money for the whole week, she'd just eat that stuff or get candy from the school shop. I told her if she wants a little extra money she can do some more around the house, then use that for pizza or something once or twice a week, but that if she does that \*we probably won't go out as a family for fast food on the weekends (not that we do much now already). She'd still be free to eat whatever snacks she buys, go out to eat with friends (which I usually pay for so she doesn't spend her own money to be social), etc. No go.

She gets money for grade improvements or anytime she learns a new skill, and she also has a ""snack allowance"" if she goes to the store with her mother or me, where basically in exchange for being useful at the grocery store, she has a set amount of money out of the grocery budget for the week just for snacks for herself. We do ""tax"" unhealthy snacks a bit more so she doesn't blow it all on candy or something. Point is, she COULD use her own money though I still wouldn't allow it daily.

I also asked my older child who went to the same middle school and was there with her for his last year and her first if he's ever noticed any bullying of her about this stuff. I don't trust him to be observant enough to know if she's being bullied, but he said no one cares what other people are eating and he doesn't know of anyone getting bullied for snacks. He also mentioned that when he was there, if she had a problem with someone, she came to him and she never mentioned anything about snacks. Of course, that was only the first year, and she started complaining the second year so who knows.

\*It's also worth noting that my daughter does not LIKE fast food for the most part, and so this is very socially motivated for her and not food motivated for her. Since she is younger than her peers, we are careful to not indulge in peer pressure requests too freely as she is VERY susceptible to it and this is the primary issue, not what specifically she is eating (though yes, I do not want her eating fast food for lunch every day and don't think she's old enough to have total reign there).

Her mother disagrees with me and is worried I'm going to give her an eating disorder, but I feel like if the only eating disorder I give my kid is one where she know how to make healthy, nutritious meals, then I'm fine with that. Even if she pushes back and eats unhealthily in college or something, at least she'll have good habits and the know how to get it back if she needs. AITA?

**Edit:** a lot of focus on the ""tax"" at the grocery store. First, it's not an actual tax, which is why I put it in quotation marks. It's more like, we say ""you can get approximately $X worth of snacks while we're here, but if it's only candy/processed food, then you can only spend ($X-$5) or whatever. Or if she comes back with only a a tub of ice cream, a giant bag of candy and a giant bag of chips, we might tell her to put one back and not eat it all in one sitting, and next time we go shopping, just grab her some healthier stuff we know she likes. We don't even give her any money in these scenarios, nor make it an exact amount she can spend and certainly don't make her count it back to us or take the money back as an actual tax.

* We live in the snowy upper midwest and he only gets to drive it 3-4 months if the weather is good
* We are about to have a baby and while he has a winter car, the sports car will now sit in storage until many many years down the road
* He's mentioned selling it before but always pulls away from it

I've never pressured him before to sell it but with so much on the way it would be nice to have an extra 5k in the bank or going towards the hospital bills. I don't want to be that wife, but I can't ignore that I've thought about asking him.

Edit: To clarify, I would never demand my husband sell the car or give him an ultimatum. The only reason aside from the obvious I thought about bringing it up before is because he had brought it up on his own unprompted.

I ask in what way is it a security risk - no answer besides ""just leave"". I insist for an actual reason ans the bouncer grabs me by arm and chucks me to floor, I get up continue asking ""what the hell?"". The bouncer starts pushing me away so I just ended up leaving.

I’d normally just get their address and courier it to them but these guests were kinda dickish so I’m thinking about just giving it away. They ignored all contact from me since booking (it’s a remotely managed property) and left feedback that made it sound like the property has a whole lot of rubbish outside to the extent they said they couldn’t get out of their car (there were two pieces of wood left by our builder leaning against the house totally out of the way).

If this was during a reasonable hour then I'd be better with it but this is literally midnight to 3am (not for all 3 hours but starts any time in this window). This keeps me awake when I have to work morning shifts and get to work for 5am most days, so I really need to be able to sleep through the night, which she knows, and even with earplugs they still managed to wake me.

I tried wearing earplugs, then headphones, neither worked, so I've asked them to keep it down more than once. Last night they were being exceptionally loud and when I asked them to keep it down, she insisted that I couldn't hear anything. I took out my phone and bluetooth speaker, put the speaker in a bookshelf that is up against our shared wall, and played whatever songs I could think of to ruin the mood.

The songs included, but were not limited to:

* *I Just Had Sex* and *Finest Girl* by Lonely Island
* *Bananaphone*
* *We Should Definitely Not Have Sex Right Now* from Crazy Ex Girlfriend
* *Always Look on the Bright Side of Life*

And a few others.

I thought we'd be able to laugh it off because they were jokey songs that I picked, clearly for a laugh, and I figured she'd see the funny side but then she said the thing about me not having to be a dick about it and now I feel like a dick.

512,Not the A-hole,"So, my fiancé’s father came from a family that is very well off. They owned a production company and my fiancé’s mom would occasionally get his fathers inherited portion of profits. My fiancé struggles because he is a Type I diabetic. It was recommended he get an insulin pump 6 years ago, but he could not afford it, so he has been correcting his blood sugar for 10 years manually and has been hospitalized several times. Currently both his mom and sister are furious with me because I put an insulin pump on our registry. His mom was embarrassed because the family saw it and wanted to pitch in to get him a pump. She put the kibosh on it and told the family she already had plans in place to get him one, but she has been dragging her feet for over a year on it. Now that she had us remove it from the registry, the communication has dried up again. I’m furious and want to add it back to the registry. 

We recently found out that his younger sister has been living a life of luxury in her beach front apt and that was the reason his mom couldn’t afford to help him (it’s also the reason he had to drop out of college). His sister uses her anxiety as a reason to not get a job and stays home drinking and smoking all day. Last year my fiancé’s family sold their production company and everyone was going to get one final payout and it was over. My fiancé’s mom called him and told him she would like him and his sister to have security in case something happened to her so she wanted to buy a house here and put it in his and his sister's name. Upon hearing this plan, his sister came to visit us under the guise she needed to get away from her controlling boyfriend. This was the first time I ever met her and we opened her home to her, said she was welcome to stay as long as she needed, etc. She stayed for a week and found any excuse to prove to her mom that she could not live with her brother in a huge elaborate attempt to throw him under the bus so their mom would not use the money on a house here but instead continue to use it on her. She even went as far as to ask my fiancé to not call his mom and ask if he needed help getting insulin, but when they went out to dinner his sister straight up had a debit card to their mom's bank account. In the end his mom pulled the plug on the house. 

This week his sister told their mom that the rehab facilities here in the US just don’t work for her and that she needed to go to this outpatient facility in Thailand. She called my fiancé tonight to tell him and to get his support and honestly he was just heartbroken. He has been trying to get help with an insulin pump so he doesn’t have to feel sick all the time and she gets to go to Thailand on a whim. So now his mom is using what she deemed both of their inheritance to pay for his sister to go.

514,Asshole,"I've (M24) been with my girlfriend (F25) for almost 8 years (practically married, I know) and we have lived together for 5 years. After my graduation I landed a full time job in IT at an Oil & Gas firm.

My girlfriend is working at a supermarket part time and due to non-guaranteed hours her pay fluctuates quite dramatically from time to time.

My girlfriend graduated in this year in 2019 with a Master's Degree and hated it every single part of it. So as a result, I encouraged her to go back to (community) college and pursue a 2 year course in an Arts subject because I think she's honest to god talented, it was a subject that she really enjoyed in high school and she would love to make a career in it.

As I earn significantly more than her, other people have been questioning her as to why I am not giving her money to help her live. We have discussed this and I told her that I am not willing to give her money except under the circumstances that the money is lent as a loan to be paid back, if we needed to buy groceries (no loan) or if she was running low this month and needed money for seeing friends etc (again no loan but to clarify the money given wouldn't be very much only enough to cover the experience for that day such as dinner with friends and transport back). 

To alleviate some of her money issues, I have suggested her getting a student loan which she would be entitled to and this could potentially sort out her money issues entirely. However I have had some push back from her because she ""doesn't like the thought of owing all that money back"". In our country the student loan would be deducted from our paycheck only if we were earning over a certain amount per annum, if we earn under that amount or circumstances change and we earn under that threshold then we do not need to pay that back until our per annum pay is over that threshold. I explained this to her and said that even if she earned a penny over the threshold the deductions are so small and her standard of life would still be higher because her annual pay would still be 5x what she is making now. But regardless she instead said to me that if the situation were reversed, she would give me money no questions asked if I was in her situation.

After she said that, I felt guilty because I was the one to suggest her going back to college to pursue an alternative career path which caused her to be in this situation anyway and also because we've been together for so long, it's like we're married together and I wouldn't have anyone else but her. But again I feel that I worked for my paycheck and I should be entitled to it regardless of what other people may think.

&#x200B;

TL;DR We've been a couple for almost 8 years and living together for 5 years. Girlfriend is going back to community college and has only ever worked part time at a super market. I work full time in IT and now the expectation is there for me to provide for her by giving her money IF she was running low on funds for that month.",262,344,0.91
515,Not the A-hole,"Greetings,

So about 7 months ago my boyfriend and I had a fight wherein he went to stay with his mum for about a week as a result. I cant even remember what the fight was about, basically just an accumulation of little annoyances that resulted in an explosion. Equal parts my fault and his. His mother had to come pick him up from my place (no licence) after finding out it was because of a fight. 

I would say she has hated me ever since. Due to this occurrence, the following has resulted:

1) MIL bans me from going to her home (used to visit every second weekend for ~family dinners~)
2) BIL and BIL's gf block me on social media
3) Cousin I have never met blocks me on social media
4) MIL told boyfriend that she had to go to counseling because she heard us fight once when we were at her house
5) MIL tells boyfriend that his child siblings are 'scarred' from hearing us bicker
6) MIL tries to contact MY mother about it (mum does not reply nor care)
7) MIL tried to make bf block me and my number

My boyfriend moved back in with me after the week he stayed at his mother's and we have been together ever since no problems. Our relationship is in no way unhealthy.

This all left me quite shook, and I never anticipated being told I was the reason for someone going to therapy.  So obviously I was even more taken aback when maybe two months max. after this all happened she told my partner that she would love to see 'us' over for family dinner (with family that all still have me blocked on social media). She knows that I know what she said about me. She has since invited us over a few more times, most times do not fit in with our work etc. My bf has gone a few times by himself because I cannot fathom sitting with them all and acting like nothing ever happened.

 AITA for not 'forgiving and forgetting' as she has seamlessly done? I feel like I am being pressured to do so but I also feel like I would die of uncomfortable-ness.

EDIT: (For clarity, in one of my responses below).
MIL spread the news like wildfire (told essentially whole family we had broken up before she even picked him up). bf told me he had family members calling him that he hadn't spoken to in ages asking if he was okay. It was all overwhelming for him too, and he spent most of his time at her house spending time out of the house. The only reason bf went there was because that's the only place he could really go to get space. His relationship with his mother is iffy.

EDIT 2 - ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: (just a bit more info) 
I am 19, he is 21, it's our first serious relationship. He doesn't have his licence but works full-time, and he works near-ish to his mothers house. It wasn't his intention to be there that long, and he was essentially bullied the whole time by his family for things like being on his phone. It's a bit of a drive and I also work full time so I couldnt get him or anything. He came back as soon as he practically could and we have been together ever since, and he has made very very little contact with them, and is embarrassed. It was a cumulation of other small fights/annoyances, but for us personally it was a good learning curve and we have been great since.",43,106,0.93

517,Asshole,"I feel as if I have gotten myself in quite a pickle here. Quick run down goes as follows. Sisters husband is in jail for hit and run (to make matters worse, he was also driving on a revoked license). Hitting someone’s motorcycle and drove off is what it entailed. 

Now, none of my family is speaking to him. My sister at the moment doesn’t want to deal with him (the reason he was driving on a revoked is due to DUI). From my understanding he has been clean for quite some time. 

Basically I felt bad. After she had told me he felt bad but she did not want to speak with him. We were civil and friendly towards each other, and I believe everyone should have someone to speak too. 

What I thought would turn into a one time thing, has turned into a few day a week ordeal. Of just....talking. Talking about whatever and about life in general. He would ask about my sister frequently, and my attempts to get her to speak to him have failed so far. They have spoken but she is still so angry with him. 

Well we’ve been talking very often. My mother recently confronted me. And says it’s not appropriate what I am doing. Even though it really is just friendly talk. Although our talks have been becoming more frequent.

I had nothing against them being together, but I told him about some of the red flags I had learned about and why I ended up not pursuing a romantic relationship with her. Him and I are very similar when it comes to what we want out of a relationship, and I knew those red flags would be really bad for him, too. I didn't want him to get as far as I did only to get hurt like I did.

523,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because my wife follows my ac.

Backstory, my wife and I have been together for 10 years, since high school, married for 2. My wife's a lawyer and an engineer. She works corporate and does law as a side job. She also has a BA in psychology.

This week we hosted a party at our home since we had found out we're expecting. And everything was cool up until we started talking about our careers. Adding to the backstory, one of the couples that was there was a girl both my wife and I graduated with in high school and her recent boyfriend. She also went to the same college my wife and I did (I'm also an engineer) and she's a chemical engineer. Now my wife is very humble. She's the smartest person I know, I mean she got into law school at 20 y/o, and she's also one of the most mentally insecure. She usually says people have her overrated and she almost never tells people that she has a lot of diplomas (which, she went to law school and did her engineering degree at the same time). Point is we were all talking about how we used to be in high school versus now and let's call her R (the ChemE) started talking about how my wife wasn't really very responsible in HS. Which is true, she wasn't. She had a terrible GPA and she usually skipped classes. But in college she changed, clearly. And ok. But then she started pushing on how everyone saw my wife as stupid when we were in HS, and that even she thought that my wife was very stupid, and how ""making yourself study every day could work for anyone"". She then continued by saying that my wife did Industrial engineering, which is the easiest engi discipline, which is why she could've done what she did and how ChemE was way harder. By how I saw it, she was downplaying my wife's achievement with her new partner because he was celebrating my wife at one point, asking how she did it and that it must be nice being as smart as her. Everyone was quiet and even my wife looked uncomfortable. I asked R where has her high GPA's and ""very high IQ"" gotten her. Everyone stayed quiet and she didn't answer. So I was very blunt and asked R to leave. Everyone became tense and after a few words, she did leave. After she left, the others left as well and now my wife is angry with me for kicking her out of the house, saying I'm an asshole for embarrassing us for stupid comments and that I over reacted. But I could clearly see she was hurt by it. 

AITA?

EDIT: To those wondering about my wife's timeline — 

First of all, we're not in the US. We have unis that go by trimester.

Our high school GPA is irrelevant and the fact she skipped classes as well. Her HS grades were only important for her first degree and she went to a private college, which where we're from is completely normal getting into. People with good grades go to our main public college, that used to be very cheap ($55/credit). The rest go to the private ones ($180-200/credit). She did her psych major in 2 years by trimester at said private uni. Afterwards she got into law school at 20, had a GPA of 3.88 from the psych bachelor and an LSAT of 155. In the US, that is a terrible LSAT. Here, it is very high. The median here is 144. The cost for law here is also usually $300-400/credit and when she was in law school it was $150-200/credit. After her first year at law, she didn't love it completely to actually dedicate her complete career to it but she didn't want to quit and she liked what I was doing so she enrolled at my uni as well, paying for it with the grad loans that offered a max of 20K per year. The law degree where she was doing it was 92 credits for 3 years and she had already finished 31 after her first year. She had basic courses from past bachelor's so engineering here is 4 yr term, so she went in with about a year and a halves worth of classes/credits. She did engineering by trimester as well and law at the same time, taking about 18 credits in total between law and engineering, per semester, studying summers as well, taking usually 6 classes between both. She ended up finishing engi in 3 years and a summer, and law in 4. Graduated at 24 with both degrees. I lived all of her achievements with her and I'm proud of her, immensely. She was even featured in our local newspaper when she had the swearing ceremony as a lawyer. Can't wait to tell her everyone thought I was lying! lol

EDIT2: Well, I received my judgement and I thank you all. I showed the doubtful comments to my wife and she chuckled, a genuine that's-funny chuckle. Thank you, Redditors, for deviating the conversation and now my wife isn't even mad at me. And thank you, for reminding my beautiful wife she's a beast. I truly hope more of you get on the successful side of life, doubting clear achievements of people you don't even know is just so weird. Obviously, since after commenting none of those who were so sure I was lying returned and no actual questions were asked. Just a weird experience. Nevertheless, peace, Redditors!

529,Not the A-hole,"First and hopefully last time I post here. I go to a church with my family on Sundays. I'm no longer religious but I go anyways since there would be a fall out with my family if they find out. The pastor is nice and so is everyone else, but I've been hurt enough by religion that I just keep to myself.

There was a religious camping retreat announced and while past me would have went in a heartbeat, I don't want to do more than I have to do in church so I kept quiet. The pastor asked me whether I wanted to go. I told him I would think about it but I had no answer for now. He would talk to my father about it. I didn't want to tell him no immediately cause it would make me sound rude.

There was a meeting held on the camp and what to prepare. Note that because I'm not baptized (nor do I want to), I wasn't allowed to participate in the meeting. No big deal, I just left and went to go on reddit on my phone.

I was told by my mother that the pastor paid for my slot on the retreat, and asked when I can get my stuff ready. I was blindsighted by this because I didn't give the pastor the go ahead to add me in. I was added in without my permission and someone made the decision to do it for me (I'm 18 as well, so it stings a bit how I apparently can't make my own decisions). The pastor cannot refund the money for the trip, so now I'm stuck (its this weekend).

So, would I be the asshole if I tell my pastor that I don't want to go on the trip? (I'm trying to see if I can pay him back for the money he used if I can). I was added in without my permission and this is a trip where I don't want to go and don't have the heart to participate in.",12,42,0.92
530,Not the A-hole,"For those that want it, Ill be doing an optional background segment in the comments for our living situation.

So first issue is first. Our roommate was gone for a week staying at her friend's. Well one day she shows back up at the apartment but with company, her out of town sister. No heads up, no communication. My fiancee and myself didn't even know who the hell was staying at our place the first night, we just heard two voices in our roommates room. We found out it was the sister the next day. The sister has been with us now for 3-4 days and we have no clue when she is leaving. Which the sister's presence is not a big deal. We like her well enough. Just don't like the lack of courtesy in communication and also the apparent entitlement that our roommate has over the spare bedroom. I just feel like if we had my fiancee's brother show up unannounced and put him in the guest bedroom days on end without telling our roommate any details, well she would be pissed.

Second issue, our roommate has gotten this fancy dog monitor device with an HD camera and 2 way audio system built in. The user can interact with it at any time and place via their cell phone. It even dispenses treats and auto activates the camera/alerts the owner whenever the dog barks or walks near the camera. It has a person alert function too if a person walks near the camera. She can turn it on at any time from her phone. She originally got the camera device for her own bedroom to monitor the dog where she used to keep him. That's fine, her private room... her space... But now she has randomly taken to leaving the dog out in the living room and moved her fancy dog camera in there. Which means she can pick up video and audio in the living room at random. Which I know she is not intentionally trying to spy on us and just wants to keep an eye on her dog. None the less, it's creepy. I'm getting some serious big brother vibes.

So with all these issues, WIBTA if I decide to broach these issues with our roommate  in a firm but respectful way. Until I can talk to her, I plan on just unplugging her Orwellian dog camera when I am in the living room and she is gone. As far as the situation with her sister goes, I don't want to have the conversation while the sister is still there as I don't want the sister to feel awkward or like her presence is causing tension. But after the sister leaves, I plan on saying something. Am I right to do so on these issues?",23,53,0.88

So I am a professional makeup artist, and I pride myself on my philanthropy. And this one hits home as I am an abuse survivor. So let’s get to this story.

Firstly...I am barely even acquainted with this person that messaged me, asking for help with freshening up their look after leaving an abusive partner. Now I am also pregnant with twins and am about to pop...like...any day. So on those grounds, I would like to decline because I do have my hands sort of full.

Secondly they didn’t mention pay, but I feel like they’re buttering me up by saying things like “I know you have your hands full but....”, or “I admire you for all of your weight loss before you got pregnant, and I just want to feel beautiful”. They also threw in that they works with a very active sex positive association within my city and would love to set up lessons for any LGBTQ members that may benefit (that’s something close to my heart and I always always ALWAYS post about body positivity on my Instagram and loving who you are) But they would want to be selfish and focus on themselves first....but then brought up that it is for a party and they want two different looks done.

 This is where I start to feel like the asshole. Is it proper to charge someone in their situation??  I have worked with large institutions before doing makeup for cancer survivors/burn victims/etc...but they supply makeup, or at least pay for the kit fees. They also are up front about it and ask “what would you charge”. 

I wouldn’t charge her for my time but would charge for a kit fee as I am self employed and being an MUA is tough. A lot of girls out there would probably do it for free, and I don’t want that thrown in my face.

 I (26M) work at a care center that is open 24 hours. I am a student and work part-time, usually scheduled on Friday or Saturday nights. Myself and the other part time employees are sometimes called in whenever a full-timer needs to call off for whatever reasons. I have filled in the past when I can. 

One of my coworkers, let’s call her Anna, is a friend and though she does not work in the same position as me (about one notch higher but not my boss or supervisor), she sometimes fills in when no one else can. 

We had plans this past Saturday morning to go to a festival in the afternoon and eat/drink/hang out but Friday night we had this text conversation at about 9PM at night:

Anna: “Can you cover first shift tomorrow? The person working 2nd shift had a family emergency and the person working 1st shift had to call off. I am going to take 2nd shift.”

Me: “Uhhhh I’d honestly rather not. My sleep schedule is super messed up because I just worked third and I had plans to do a lot of school work tomorrow. Also, I guess that means no festival?”

Anna: “So are you taking first shift then?” 

Me: “Sorry I can’t”

Anna: “Can you do 2nd?”

Me: “I was planning on getting a lot of school work done tomorrow. I am really behind on my coursework because I just added a class. It was even a stretch for me to go to the festival for a bit. This is pretty last minute. So I am sorry but I can’t. Why did (person’s name) call off without finding a replacement first? Isn’t that policy?” 

Anna: “Well no one else can work it so if (person with emergency) isn’t back in time I am working a 16 hour shift. Literally picking up call offs and working the weekends are what people in your position are for. I already worked over 40 hours this week, I get that you have work to do but there is no reasons you can’t pick up 1st tomorrow. If you change your mind, contact me.”

Me: “I’ve picked up shifts before so it’s not like I never pick one up when I can. There are many people in my position who hardly work even scheduled shifts let alone that. As I explained, I am in fact not free, and you are overstepping your bounds by insisting I am. Because I work thirds I am conditioned to go to bed at like 4am and I can’t just reverse that with this short notice. Please do not guilt trip me. It is not my fault that you would have to work longer. You didn’t have to agree to do the shift in the first place.” 

My belief is basically that it was unprofessional for her to badger me about taking the shift when I already said no. That is where the conversation should have ended. She is not my boss and has no right to question what I have going on. I understand that she is feeling overworked, but I feel like that is not my problem. I really didn’t like how I was treated, especially since the other people in my position don’t have to put up with that bullshit when they turn down a shift. AITA?",79,454,0.96
535,No A-holes here,"so my girlfriend likes to to braless, I do not care as it's her body and she can do what she wants. 

one minor issue I have is that you can always see her nipples through her shirts, it's not always ""formal"" and I always feel like we get looked at when we go out to eat. 
she also gets annoyed when people stare at her but then refuses to do anything about it.
she also tells me way after its happend so I cant confront the people doing it. 
because her shirts are white it sometimes looks like she is going topless and she has had to borrow my jumper on rainy days as her tops can automatically go see through. 

I've suggested tops that are slightly thicker or singlets but she always refuses as she does not want me controlling her body.

last night I suggested she wear singlets as it's been raining a bunch and I hate giving up my jumper to cover her boobs and she got shity with me and told me to stop controlling her body and let her wear what she wants to wear.

536,Asshole,"So, I have shared custody of my son and he stays with his mom for a week and then he comes back to me for a week. I had him for three weeks in a row, because I was taking him on vacation, and then he just went to his moms for a week and returned to me today. To my surprise, he had an earring in. It was a diamond style earring in his right ear.

His mom didn’t walk him up to the house or anything, she just sent him up to the house and drove off. I called her immediately and told her that I wasn’t OK with it and that she should’ve discussed it with me before doing it. She told me that it’s the same thing as me taking him to get his haircut without her permission which I have done before. I don’t feel like it’s the same thing because a haircut is a normal thing that a kid should get on a regular basis and an earring is not a normal thing for an eight-year-old boy to have and it’s a change to the body. A haircut is not a change to the body.

Him and his mom were telling me that he asked for it and that it was his idea, but I’m not sure about that. He’s never expressed any kind of interesting that before. I feel like she was the one pushing it.

I told my son that he’s not going to keep it in. I removed it immediately. I don’t want him to go to school with it in. I told my son that it was wrong of his mom to do that without consulting me first. He seemed upset but not too terribly upset. I feel like he just didn’t want to deal with his mom‘s reaction to it coming out since she paid to get it done. The idea of it just didn’t sit well with me. He’s just an 8 year old kid.

They were initially quiet but that changed this weekend. For the past three nights they've been stomping around, dropping into the ground and blasting music. I knocked on their door to ask them to keep it down. No one answered the door but the music got turned down. I stood there for a few minutes, heard one come to the door and stand there. So I walked away. As soon as I entered my apartment, the stomping began again. Repeat this for the last 3 nights until about 1 am each night. Each time I knocked, no one answered. Finally today, day 4, I met another neighbor on the way out and mentioned the noise. His fiance is 7 months pregnant. He was close to calling the cops as well. So when it hit around 8 PM, the noises started again.  I couldn't take it anymore. I went to their door and pounded on it. ""Keep it down or I'll call the cops"". After this they finally answered, yelling at me that I'm making noise pounding on their door and the last 3 days have been ""just walking around"". I explain they've been loud and I've been trying to talk them. ""You can't tell me what do in my own crib."" So I said ""fuck you. I'm calling the cops."" He said ""Fuck you. Bored ass mother fucker. Got nothing to do ass."" as I walked away and  he shut his door. So true to my word I called the cops. When they arrived, I mentioned the 3 attempts to talk to them and the neighbors complaint as well. They told us to call them directly the next time they are keeping us awake. Then went to talk to them. I haven't heard much noise from them since but I kinda feel torn. Was that the wrong move? Am I the asshole here? I'm paranoid they may retaliate.

I live far enough from the coast that I don't need to evacuate my home - however I have an aunt and uncle and two cousins (both adult females) who live very close to the beach and will likely need to evacuate soon. My uncle called me and asked if his family could come and stay with me. Ordinarily I would say yes, of course - here is the problem. One of my cousins, who I will call Dorie (heh), has a very poorly behaved dog. In the past she made no effort whatsoever to control its behavior. The last time the family visited my home for a party, they brought the dog, and he proceeded to destroy a brand new and very expensive chair. She laughed and did nothing, and only after weeks of arguing she agreed to pay for the chair.

&#x200B;

Given that I really don't like this dog, I asked my uncle what was the plan for him? He said he would bring him, of course. I asked if it was possible to bring a crate, and maybe the dog could stay in my garage (he would be safe there), but Dorie heard me suggest this (I was on speakerphone) and flipped out and said it was cruel. She said that she would watch the dog and make sure it was well behaved the whole time it was at the house and said she had been taking him to obedience training since the chair incident (I haven't seen the dog since then to know if his behavior is any different).

In full disclosure, I know that I am pretty much their last resort before going to a shelter (there is a pet friendly one). But Dorie and my aunt cried on the phone that I was being heartless.

Now, my daughter has a best friend who is a fantastic kid, they’ve been good friends for a few years now, which I’m glad for. It seemed like her friends kept changing every year, so the stability of one solid, good friend has been happily welcomed. But the problem is the friend’s mother.

I explained that we do are not Christian and do not celebrate Christmas. When *Pippa heard about Santa, she had asked me if it was true that a man named Santa flew around giving presents to Christian children. I said no, but that it’s a lovely story that doesn’t hurt anyone to believe and she mustn’t spoil it for others. I acknowledge that it’s very young to be asking a child to keep secrets, but I saw no reason to lie to her. 

*Lucy’s mother was very angry and said I was wrong to tell *Pippa the truth. She said I should have said Santa was real for Christian children. I said again that I saw no reason to lie to my child and that I did my best, but that ultimately it’s not my responsibility to maintain others’ illusions. *Lucy’s mom and I never really spoke after that, and she wouldn’t let *Lucy and *Pippa play.

They have been dating for like 8 months and basically she decided to move in with us. Beth still has her own place that she pays for but she sleeps at our house like 90% of the time. My roommate and Beth are fine, we don’t fight much except for this one issue. 

We share the one bathroom. The layout is weird first off. Once you open the door to the bathroom there is a sink and a place to put dirty towels. Then there’s another door with the shower and toilet.

Here’s the issue. I’m a guy and I pee a lot. I’m on ADD meds that make me pee a lot, like every 45 minutes. So when I use the bathroom I don’t put down the toilet seat. This gets Beth really angry to have to put down and consequently so does my roommate. They keep yelling at me to put the seat down but I refuse.  

I told them this “This is just as much my apartment as yours roommate x. I never agreed to have Beth move in. It just happened. I’m not going to put the lid down just for her in my own home.”

They keep arguing with me but I’m not budging. Am I an asshole for doing this?

I'm 16 and living with my dad and step mom. They have a baby who cries all the time and it's driving me crazy. I have trouble sleeping as is; I have a lot of school stuff to focus on during the day, and I can't do any of that when the house is so noisy.

So I've started going out whenever my step sister is having a fit and I want some quiet. We've got a house way out in the country so some of the best places to go nearby are the forest out back, the old boathouse on the lake (we don't have any boats, the old owners of the house did, but it's a solid building on the lake) The lakeside, the raised hunting stands up some trees in the property, etc.

And I have made the boathouse attic into a study room with a desk and my books, I sometimes sleep in the boathouse or the old covered hunting stand (i sleep well outside, i camped a lot as a kid)

And I recently had a big fight with my dad who said he didn't like it that I was walking out of the house all the time. He accused me of sneaking off to see some boy, which is a totally ridiculous idea; I'm single as anything and too shy to get a guy if I tried.

I told him I was only getting out of there because he and his wife couldn't get their kid to chill; I needed to sleep some how and needed to get my homework and hobbies done. And my dad was pissed off, saying she's not ""his wife"" she's tryna be a mother to me. And we need to stay together as a family, not have me go off to the woods or the boat house when ever it's not convenient. And baby's cry, that's just what they do

But tbh I'm just trying to wait it out till college and do good at school 

AITA for getting out of the house so much?

My mom died under a year ago in a car accident. And now my dad has a new wife and they have a new baby. That's so fast I can't help but think they were involved before my mom passed away. I don't think I'll ever know for sure though. 

All I know is that nobody's ever going to replace my mom, especially not my step mom.

I asked him why he would think that considering we don't really talk at all and this is most we've ever talked in the 6 years that I've dated his sister and that I'm the only photographer at the wedding and editor so the payload is already a lot. I thought it was a kind gesture to low ball my services for 1400, let alone for free.

I told him no I would not do it for free so they decided to move to another local photographer.

So present day, their wedding is in less than a month, to which I'm still attending and my girlfriend's mom calls me and asks me to photograph the wedding again.

What happens almost every single year, is that remember that it is someone's birthday last minute, on the day, and ask me if I have a gift.
In my family, I'm the only one that actually puts a little thought into gifts, and cares for it to be perfect for the person. Since I don't have a job and love being crafty or I do something to give, or, buy something in my range, financially.

The buyer (call him Dan) said he could come up with $15,000 and pay me the rest at the end of the month (Boat was sold Aug 15th). I said that would be fine, but asked if we could still stay until the end of the month, to which he agreed.

The boat is docked at a covered marina, with a monthly rent ($450). In order to transfer the slip into Dans name, he’s have to present registration and insurance. I told him this repeatedly, before and after he bought the boat. I did not want to pay for moorage on a boat I don’t own. He said it wouldn’t be a problem. He did ask how much registration and insurance would be. I told him what I paid, which was next to nothing, and who my insurer was. He said no problem and he’d get right on it.

One week after the sale, Dan called to inform me that the registration was going to be way higher ($1,500). I felt terrible and apologized profusely. I told him that since that was unexpected that we could deal with the $1500 he owed me whenever. He appreciated that and said it was really no problem, just surprising.

Fast forward until the final day of the month. Dan had still not registered nor insured the boat that is now legally released from my name (with docs to prove it). If he doesn’t get it done that day, I’m on the hook for his moorage. He calls me to tell me that I misled him. He couldn’t get insurance because the company I had used didn’t like his lack of boating experience. He said I knew about that requirement and should have warned him of it. He also was still angry from paying a high registration fee and felt he was misled and that I tricked him into buying something he couldn’t afford.

He had been in possession of the boat for 18 days at this point, and we even moved out early because he alluded to the fact he was homeless and needed it. 

The marina has said they can cut me from my lease, but that means he’ll be towed out from the slip. I’d feel terrible if that happened but I feel as if he simply didn’t do his due diligence.

This person has a strong tendency to behave in a way that makes them the center of attention 24/7- IE singing every other song on karaoke nights, speaking at every open mike whether they have something prepared or not, etc. Basically, with that plus the consistent attempts to be friends with me even after I've made it clear I just want to be cordial with them, I just want to be able to enjoy myself for one night without being bombarded by this person's presence.

Issue at hand- another friend in our group (we'll call A) is having a birthday in a couple of weeks, and because they're new to the area and a bit shy, I suggested we celebrate by going to a tabletop board game meetup that is run by a friend of mine (D) that is not in our social group, but has met my ex before (ex made an awkward first impression, to say the least). A third person asked if they can post to our social group's FB page about it so everyone will know, which means Ex will 100% see it and attend, and invariably make it all about them. I really, really don't want to cause drama, but seeing how it was my idea and it's my friend's event, I'd like to spend one night out without my ex. AITA if I'd purposely make it so they weren't informed of the event, even if some of our other mutual friends did know?",11,30,0.94

571,Not the A-hole,"My SO is saying I'm NTA and another friend (unrelated to the story) is telling me that IATA, so I'm looking for some outside opinions on this.

I have a friend, who is an ordinarily good friend of mine, but he grew up with terrible money habits and that has always caused him to be on the lookout for 'deals' when he's buying things. Like I get it, we all want a good deal when buying something, but this guy is fanatical about it. I have been frustrated with him in the past because any time I was ever selling something he was interested in, like a phone or a toy of some sort, he would always ask me for a friendly discount on it.

Recently I decided to sell my motorcycle. Worth noting here that I am in medical school, and consequently spend 50k/year on schooling rather than earning any real income. Money is obviously tight for me and not something I just give away freely at the moment.

I found a buyer for $4,000 for the bike, told my friend, and he told me to hang on for a day because he wanted to run buying it by his wife. He calls me up a day later and asks me if I will sell it to him for $3,400 since we're friends.

Honestly, I'm fed up at this point because he has done this many times to me, and it's doubly frustrating at this point because I earn no money while he has a solid nearly-6 figure job in programming. I told him that him asking me to sell him the bike for $600 less than another guy is like asking me to just hand him $600. In my eyes, there is little to no difference between those scenarios.

My friend became very defensive over it and said providing friends 'friendly prices' is not the same as asking for money. I countered that it results in the same thing - me being $600 poorer at his benefit. My SO agrees, but another friend of mine said that friends should sell things to friends at a better price than they would a stranger. Not that I necessarily agree with that, but I would have been willing to knock off a hundred or so for my friend, but asking for much more than that just irked me.

She would interrupt conversations to tell a 'funny story' that she insists is related. They rarely were. Stories got repeated if 1 person hadn't heard it the first time she told it.  When we were all strictly telling bad jokes around the fire (primarily so she would get the hint to not interject with a story) she told another story but said it's a joke because she's going to use it in an upcoming stand-up routine (she isn't a comedian)

To add to this, she makes random noises and sound effects when she isn't directly telling a story, it's like her brain is working to remember another story but her mouth literally can't stop spewing sonic trash. 

I'm at my ropes end and don't know what to do aside from tell her to please try to be more considerate of others in group conversations or just refuse to ever see her again.

576,Asshole,"English is not my first language so I apologize in advance for any glaring errors.

**Background**: My sister \[17F\] and I \[19M\] go to a prestigious university in a third world country. It's tuition is covered partly by my father (30%) and mostly (70%) by a college fund I created for her myself. Our family is slightly on the more conservative side (as on par with our region). The age of majority in our country is 21.

**Story:** My sister has always been interested in acting & theatre, and hoped she'd double major as a science major when she's in college. My mother, who's slightly conservative, disagreed with that premise completely as she considers the whole industry to be extremely dangerous. As such, my father's financial contribution was made on the condition that her enrollment to the university, and extra-curricular activities, would not involve theatre in any shape or form. My sister agreed, and everyone seemed to be happy with the deal.

A while ago my sister (who goes home with me as she can't legally drive yet) asked me to wait for her a bit longer as she wanted to support a friend who was auditioning for a role in an upcoming drama, and joked that she might audition herself as well. I told her it's alright and even attended her audition myself.

As it's her first time auditioning, she didn't make the final cut for the play. After comforting her while we were on the way home, I told her that if she wants to continue with theatre I'm not going to interfere (as I'm not her parent), but she needs to be upfront about it with our parents. She didn't take this well and threw a tantrum.

Over the past year he hasn't spoken to me beyond one word answers. It really pissed me off after the year marker had passed and nothing had changed. They came over last month and I directly spoke to him. His head stayed down and he said nothing. So I walked away. Afterwards I asked my mom what the hell.

578,Not the A-hole,"I started a book club 5 years ago, and it's been very successful. We have about 45 members total. Since it got off the ground, we've never had fewer than 10 people show for a discussion, but we've had max 30. 

One of the things I am very conscious of is cost. From the beginning, we struck deals with the local indie bookstore, the local library, and a few other places. We also rarely pick a bestseller or new release, so there aren't huge waitlists. Typically the library is able to secure 5 hard copies copies, 3-5 eBook borrows, and of course audiobooks. Most members do end up buying them because they're usually available as paperback -- and the local indie seller gives us a discount, plus Amazon. 

We had our meeting about a week ago, and someone who was pretty new to the group made a comment about how she never buys books. I thought she meant she was a big library patron, but she snorted and calls libraries old-fashioned. I asked how she got the book, and she said ""Well I downloaded it on (whatever site). You can download any book you want.""

I was shocked to hear that, and suggested she get a library card if she can't afford it. She got VERY offended and sniped back ""Uh, I can afford it, but why would I if I don't have to?""

I'm no stranger to how acceptable piracy has become, and there are circumstances where I'll look the other way (places with heavy government censorship, kids whose parents would hurt them for borrow LGBTQ themes). But this is a for-fun book club, and the last thing I'd want to have happen get out there is that members steal the book and the income of hardworking authors just because they can. Most authors are average Joes. We sometimes have authors join us via Skype calls so we can talk to them about the book. Imagine how embarrassing and awful it would be if one of the members told the author they stole the book.

I ended up discussing it with a few long-time members, and we asked her to leave. We tried to be nice, but let her know that stealing wasn't acceptable. She got angry and told us that ""everyone does it"" and that no one said that was a rule of the group, etc. It wasn't a rule because it never crossed out minds. 

She dragged us online. She has turned it into a Social Justice and Class Inequality issue, making comments about how book clubs are always for ""rich, white women"" despite her being white. I want to emphasize that when we announce the book we choose, I always put together a flyer and an email for people giving them all the places they can get the book. This time around, I know for a fact that the book was NOT waitlisted at the library because I always check so I can check in with the group and see if anyone needs a copy. 

She dragged us on FB and NextDoor, as well as Twitter. Some of our group members chimed in to defend us, and a few of them chimed in to take her side.

580,Not enough info,"I know this sounds really racist, but please hear me out.  


So I operate a mental health support group website thingy. Members there can message 'supporters' when they need someone to listen to their problems. I hope you get the idea.  
Recently a lot of people from India have signed up for this site as supporters. This site also features a report feature for abusive behavior. The report rate for long term supporters (excluding Indians) is below 2% and those are usually illegitimate. For newly signed up supporters (excluding Indians) it's way higher at around 22%. However after doing some investigating I found out that for recently signed up supporters from India the report rate is above  70% and for long term supporters from India it's still at 15%. Normally this wouldn't be too big of an issue, these people would just get banned. However a lot of Indians have signed up for this website and already represent about a third of the total supporter user base. I hope you can see how this is a massive issue. Reviewing all the reports becomes difficult when there's so many of them and we can't ban them in a timely fashion anymore.  
I've brought up the idea to some moderators and got an overall negative response and insults thrown my way. There's also another issue of long term supporters leaving because the supporters from India tend to be very vocal and aggressive in ""taking away"" the members from other supporters (There is a queue system in place). While this has brought waiting times down which would be a good thing, it also increased the amount of times a member has to queue as they're not getting the support they asked for (There's also categories). And the Indian supporters in particular tend to be very hostile towards those having selected relationship or lgbtq+ issues as their category and women. 


From my moderators perspective I seem to be in the wrong here, but I don't know how else I could handle the issue and I very much fear for my site to be dying.  So WIBTA?

582,Everyone Sucks,"My wife and I recently had a beautiful baby girl who is now 13 weeks old, we frequently visit her mother who has Parkinsons , and my SIL who lives and takes care of her.

My SIL has 2 dogs, one is about 2 years old, the other is 3, she has had both since they were puppies, and has done nothing to discipline or train them, they are wild, they chew up everything, pee on pee pads around the house as she hardly ever takes them out, jump up on the kitchen table when people are eating... just awful. (My mother in law tries to tell her to do something about them, but she laughs and says they aren't hurting anyone) 

My wife and I love dogs and have one of our own, and in no way blame them for their behaviour.

We were over 2 nights ago, and once again, the dogs were running wild, my wife asked that she put the dogs in the basement while we were there with our baby (they try to go into her diaper bag, her purse ect) SIL got annoyed and said they were fine, I was annoyed as well but said nothing.

We ordered food and put our daughter asleep in her baby chair, with a blanket and and a soother. Once the dogs realized we weren't going to give them any, they started acting up, one ripped the blanket of our daughter, and jumped on her to pull the soother out her mouth and proceeded to chew it up.

My wife and MIL freaked out as he had scratched our daughter, who was also now freaking out, I was so pissed off I yanked the dog as he tried to get away, by the scruff of his neck and did yell at him that what he did was bad, he was shaking. I did feel bad for that. My SIL proceeded to start swearing at me that I have no right to talk to her babies like that, despite what they had done to our daughter, and that it was our fault for leaving the baby in her chair.

I told her she was a garbage dog owner, that these dogs deserve better and that she was lucky I don't report her.  She began crying and telling us to leave, despite my MIL telling us to stay (it's her house FYI) 

I'm so pissed off and feel like it needed to be done, but at the same time, wonder if I was wrong, as it was not my dog.

EDIT: to all the people stating I put my daughter in danger, not once have these dogs ever attacked, that was never a concern for my wife and I, they enjoy chewing on furniture and items but have never even so much as nipped a person, we bring our daughter over every other day, and this is the first time they have gone near her, they didn't attack her, they went for her soother and she got a scratch in the process, as for the people calling my wife an idiot, if you bother to read, I said they TRY to get into her purse and diaper bag, but do not succeed due to my wife hanging them up, they just try to jump at them and bite at them.",91,264,0.94

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

I live with my fiancée and the above mentioned caregiver. My fiancée and caregiver used to do all of the cooking because I never dared to try cooking with my feet. That was until recently. I saw a video on Facebook a few months ago of a young woman cooking a meal successfully with her feet. This inspired me and I’ve gotten quite good at it. This is all 100% sanitary as I wash my feet thoroughly before and throughout the process. 

I invited a couple of friends over for dinner, both of them having had meals with us before. Previously, my caregiver had cooked for us (she’s an awesome cook and loves to cook) when my friends were over. This time, we served dinner and all was well. It was delicious and everyone seemed to enjoy it. My friends turned to my caregiver and said “wow, that was delicious thanks *caregiver*” and my caregiver replied that this meal was all my doing. The look on my friends faces was absolutely horrified as they realized the implications of what that meant. Both of my friends gave me a funny look and left in a hurry.

591,Not the A-hole,"I (28m) had been with my ex (29f) for 3 years and I was planning on proposing to her this winter. We’d always had a very open dialogue about what we saw for ourselves and our futures together, and marriage and children were always apart of that dialogue. We’d had the talk about what we would do in the event of a pregnancy pretty early on in our relationship and she always told me that she would keep the baby, and I was very upfront about my own personal opinion on things like abortion (I’m against) and she told me she felt the same way. 

Then she found out she was pregnant in July. Her doctor sent her in for her first scan and she was already in her second trimester (16 weeks). She was as ecstatic as I was when we first found out, she even bought a onesie to tell me. She was making plans to go back to work to contribute to savings. But once she got the scan she freaked out and everything went downhill from there. After a few days, she told me she needed an abortion. I was devastated honestly, and very caught off guard. She asked me to pay for it since her savings had been pretty depleted in her year off, and I declined. I told her I respect that it’s her choice to get an abortion, but I couldn’t morally contribute to what I saw as the death and dismemberment of my child. She told me that she was sorry and she knew how I felt but she realized she wasn’t ready and couldn’t handle this. She told me she was desperate and it was just as much my responsibility. I refused to bend. She wasn’t able to come up with the money in time needed and she has continuously said that I forced her to be a mother, and has treated it like some sort of violation. I disagree with most of her perspective. 

I wasn’t asking her to get an abortion, so I don’t believe I should be expected to pay for something that is morally wrong to me, and that brings me great emotional anguish. I didn’t ask her not to get the abortion, but I did tell her before I wouldn’t take part in it, and she has always known where I stood on that. I am more than ready to take responsibility for the child we created, that’s what I see as my responsibility. I don’t see it as my responsibility to support and fund a choice that I personally find disgusting. It was her choice yes, but it was also her responsibility. If she wanted the abortion, she should have figure out how to pay for it (selling items, asking friends and family, programs, etc). I didn’t force her into being a mother, she’s making the choice to be a mother. AITA for thinking that it’s not my responsibility to pay to abort a child I wanted?

Edit: There seems to be the assumption that I was financially supporting her. Our finances were separate and we did not live together. She had taken a year off of work to pursue a hobby of hers and was using her savings to support herself. We were planning on making a joint savings account for baby expenses, but never got to that point.

Edit 2: I’d also like to fill in the gaps on my ex’s side. She told me after the first scan that she never expected to be that far along, and that when she was able to see the spine and limbs, it became way too real for her, and she wasn’t ready to be a mother. She said it didn’t really hit her until that moment, and when it did she realized she needed to act fast. Like I said, it was an unexpected 180.

So for the YTA votes, can anyone explain *why* I’m the asshole? You don’t have to change your judgment, but no one has explained why. We both created the pregnancy yes, and the child is my responsibility. Can anyone who judges explain why I’m morally responsible for paying for the termination of a pregnancy I have no rights to?

I went outside and held the receipt to the man. I asked if it was his. He said, “Yeah, we just ate.” I told him to give me my $5 back. He refused and said something like, “We’re just trying to get a place to stay tonight.”

I pointed to the price on the receipt and told him that you can’t spend $25 on fast food with extra meat, ice cream, and plussed-up drinks and then come out and beg for money. The motel next door was only $30 (+fees, I’m sure) for a night. They’d be 5/6 of the way to a hotel if they didn’t blow $25 on fast food. 

He started telling me a sob story about how they’ve been on the road for a while and just needed a good meal. I told him, “then learn how to use a dollar menu.” The woman told him to “just give the money back.” He returned it. 

I went back inside and got my food. The table was still dirty where they left their stuff. When I went back out, I told the guy that if he went back and cleaned off his table, I’d give him the $5. He flatly refused. I think he took offense to me trying to tell him to “earn” his $5, but that’s just my speculation. 

He slung a few minor insults at me (entitled, fascist, selfish) as I got into my car and drove off with $4 of food and my $5 bill back. 

I could understand if they got $8 worth of burgers and fries. I could even understand if they got $20 worth of something that could last a little while, like nuggets. But they got $25 of the most uneconomical food they could get. That’s an unacceptable mentality. AITA for not supporting?

Edit for clarity: I didn’t actually say “go earn the $5 donation by cleaning up the mess you made.” I told him if he cleans up the mess he left inside for the worker’s to clean up, then he can have the money. I didn’t want to support someone who left his mess inside the restaurant like a child. Further edit for clarity: this was a fast food restaurant (cookout). It is up to the patron to bus his own table. It is not up to the workers to clean the tables. There is no waitstaff, and customers know from a young age that they’re supposed to bus their own tables.",162,222,0.89
593,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my friend and I had been friends for about 3 years (ever since 5 grade, we are freshman now) and we insult each other jokingly a lot. So anyway, I keep my chapstick in the same compartment as my feminine products in my bag, and when we were talking, he said my lips were ashy “as hell,” so I went to get some chapstick. I accidentally pulled out a pad, and to the regular person, I would be embarrassed, but since we were so close, I didn’t think twice about it. He started getting really nervous, and refrained from talking to me for the rest of the day. I called him when I got home, and asked him why he didn’t talk to me during the day, and he said that it was really weird that I had pulled out a pad in the middle of our conversation.

594,Not the A-hole,"Trust me, I know how ridiculous the title sounds. Unfortunately, it’s true though. So my friend, Alex, has been dating a girl for probably 4 months now. However, in the past Alex has made a big show of how straight she is.

For example, we took a political quiz in class that was meant to tell us who we should vote for based off our views. One of the questions was “should gay marriage be legal?” Alex checked off the no box and showed me since I’m gay. I was, of course, insulted by it, but ignored her. 

Alex has grown up with very conservative parents, who are highly against gay marriage. I was talking to Alex saying that now since she has a girlfriend, she has to be for gay marriage. She said no, because it’s still against the Bible (she’s highly religious). I was obviously Flabbergasted since she’s bisexual. She justified it by saying that she won’t get married to a girl so it doesn’t count. Apparently it’s okay to date them, but not marry them. 

Although now I’m bothered every time she acts gay, or insists on showing pictures of cute girls. She literally showed me a picture of two gay men at their wedding and said “isn’t it cute?” I’m just upset that she doesn’t even believe in gay marriage yet thinks it’s adorable. She still sees them as sinning.

Well her girlfriend is about to go to college in a new country leading to an inevitable break up. She’s heart broken about it, and constantly complains about it. However, I’m annoyed of hearing about it, because she doesn’t even believe in gay marriage. 

So WIBTA for not caring that she’s getting dumped and not wanting to hear about it? She doesn’t say anything negative about gays, but just doesn’t believe it should marriage should be legal, and still sees it as sinning. I want to tell her that I don’t want to hear about it, but she’s my best friend and I almost feel bad. I’m just annoyed.",43,135,0.92

598,Asshole,"Hi all! 

Earlier this morning, I decided to make my boyfriend and I scrambled eggs for breakfast. This isn’t unusual, we normally switch off who makes breakfast. Normally when one of us makes eggs, we make them plain and just let the individual season the eggs however they would like. 

This past weekend, my boyfriend was out of town and I made myself eggs. I put garlic powder and onion powder in the eggs (while they were cooking) and it was delicious! So much better than grinding some salt on top after they’re already cooked. 

So as I’m making eggs this morning, I decide to do the same...without telling BF. I thought it would be okay because he normally puts the same seasoning in his tuna, so I figured he just likes the flavor. 

After BF is about half way through eating his eggs, I asked him how he liked them. I think he could tell something was different, because he said “why, what did you put in them?”  

I told him, and he stopped eating. He took like two more tiny bites and decided he couldn’t finish. Even though he had already eaten half of the eggs! BF says he could tell the difference the whole time he was eating, he was just trying to be nice and not say anything. 

He asked if I wanted the rest of his eggs. Of course I didn’t! He was just being dramatic! He would have enjoyed them had I not told him that I put additional seasoning in. His reasoning is, “I just like the flavor of eggs”. 

I told him no, I don’t want them....I told him if he didn’t want to eat them, he could feed them to the dogs. (I didn’t think he’d actually do it!). And so, he fed the eggs to the dogs. 

So reddit, I ask...am I the asshole? BF claims I shouldn’t feed people seasonings if they don’t know about it. I should have asked first, and just made plain eggs so I could season them myself afterwards.

Edit: thank you for telling me this could potentially be harmful to my dogs. I should have checked on this before mentioning anything. I am keeping a close eye on them, nothing unusual so far.",60,32,0.75

So this is happening in 2 weeks. Me and about 10 people are going for a road trip to do some fun things. 
I have a 2015 honda civic si, and the weight limit is around 850 pounds for cargo/passengers. 

I once had a full car with a relatively big guy in the back with 2 average adults. He was 6 foot well over 250 pounds. My car would bottom out going over speed bumps. 

My friends now want to put a bigger person in the back with 2 average people. I'm worried about damaging my shocks , and their is a van available so dividing up the people shouldn't be an issue.

600,Not the A-hole,"AITA? My fiance and I don't know or understand wedding etiquette so please tell us if we would be assholes for keeping the date we picked.

My fiance (F22) and I (M23) got engaged after we graduated from school and planned on having our wedding on September 26, 2021 because September 26 is the date we started dating so there's sentimentality behind the date that even if it's on a Sunday which isn't ideal, this is still our dream date. Septemb!er 26, 2020 is a Saturday but we are young and just starting out careers so it would be too close for us to save enough money for the wedding.

My cousin (F28) got engaged before us but both couples haven't confirmed dates or informed each other about the dates. We just finally met up for a family dinner during the long weekend. As soon as we arrived, they announced to us that they picked the date October 9th which is 2 weeks after ours and even put in the deposit already. We told them the date we were planning. My cousin said they would have done it for 2020 but all the Saturdays were locked out and 2021 only had a few Saturdays left so they picked October 9th. She also said 2020 was her older brother's year to get married and implied there should be a courtesy window between weddings.

I later texted my cousin that night and said ""Hey ___. Are you and ___ okay with our wedding dates being so close? We just picked September 26 because that's our anniversary.""

She replied with ""It's not ideal for either couple if dates are so close together. But you and ___ will need to do what's best for guys.""

Why is it not ideal? We literally just don't understand why because we are okay with it being so close. We don't think our family members will compare the weddings. It will only be my dad's side of the family that will overlap which consists of about 15 members including myself.

We don't want to steal their spotlight but we also wanted our wedding date to be September 26. My fiance understands my cousin's side and feels guilty for even wanting the date still. I just want to make my fiancee's dream wedding come true. I know she will give up the date if it really bothered my cousin but I know she will be sad. Any suggestions on how I can make everyone happy? What is the appropriate window between weddings?

601,No A-holes here,"So a little backstory we have been together for 2 and a half years and there has been talk of marriage, she is 25, I am 28.

So obviously we are talking about intense personal shit a lot, kids, family etc we have good communication and rarely reach moments where we dont agree.

Yesterday however she brought up her brother, her brother was a late, unplanned kid and as the chance is higher at later ages he was born with down syndrome, now the likely scenario is, he will survive his parents, as such my girlfriend said she wanted to let him live with us once they died or well if they die before he does and I said absolutely not.

I explained the caretaking involved, the problems involved etc and that there is no way I would allow it especially not once we have kids(We both want kids in a year or two) She flipped, saying I am selfish and so forth.

Now I dont think I am selfish like at all and I think she is basing her brothers care on the hour or two a week she spends with him and doesnt realize what 24 hour care would involve.

So am I the asshole for not being okay with this?

Edit 1: So I get a lot of comments concerning me being a dick for explaining shit to her and that she knows better than I, I figured I had made this clear in the post but apparantly not, her brother was a late child as a result she only experienced him up close as a baby until he was about 3, before she moved out at 18, she did not spend much time with her family during college and since we have been together she goes there about an hour a week with her parents there which she has only done since the past year or so before that it was considerably less. So I know for a fact she hardly knows what it entails, hell I hardly know the full extend of what it entails myself.

Edit 2: I am sorry if some people think I am behaving like a bit of a cold dick but I am not great with emotional expression especially not on the internet, understand that I love my girlfriend and her family very much, including her brother I can simply not see myself being a life-long caretaker in my own home and I certainly wouldnt abandon him or am forcing her to abandon anyone, I know the subject itself may be hard for people to begin with though.

Edit 3: I have noticed some people assume I do not want shit to do with him nor have him near my future kids etc, this is not the case I am merely drawing the line at having him move in, in the future, I am not at all opposed to having him in my life, arranging care for him etc",1421,4827,0.94
602,Not the A-hole,"So we are four 20 year old girls in our first college apartment. As such we are all broke college students and I do not have the extra money to constantly front them for everything. The wireless bill is on my card, the groceries go on my card and literally everything else. One of them still owes me $50 from last weeks grocery trip. The wireless bill is $80 for the first month and $49.99 every month after that. It is only $20, and they will not pay (but they have bought several packs of juul pods since we have moved in). So now we are here where I have texted them saying ""so i am getting pretty sick of constantly chasing people for money so when you pay your part of the bill you can have the password. Sorry but i am at my wits end here"". Please note this after asking for it once and gently reminding them twice because these are my friends and I don't want to end our friendship over wifi issues but am I being an asshole here?

Edit \~ it has been two hours since i texted them and they have not responded but instead left so i am unsure where this is going. It is only two of my roommates that will not pay, thankfully one of my friends is responsible.

2nd Edit \~ For those interested they have finally responded to my text (4hrs later) with a ""how tf were we supposed to know how much the bill was""  and they want to have an apartment sit down so I guess they want to turn this into a huge issue and this friendship may not be salvageable. Also they still have not paid.

3rd Edit \~ So roommate C was the one who asked to have a apartment meeting later but instead she texted this in our group chat "" if you don’t see how what you did today was screwed up then that’s your first issue. i wanted to be civil ab this but you changed the password before letting us know the amounts due. i would rather iron this out now compared to later in the year when we have due dates/homework and suddenly won’t be able to connect because someone’s in a bad mood. if we’re expected to pay for anything then just ask us to pay, we always do. It’s ridiculous being pushed around and wanting us to beg you to share the new passwords whenever you change them.we all invested 25% in the apartment and wifi so we’re all paying for exactly that. we all have the same amount of say in what happens here. if you gave us a monthly date you want the $20 or whatever it is for wifi then you’ll have your money on that date. it doesn’t have to be an issue if you don’t make it one, but if we’re living in sydney’s house with sydney's wifi and sydney's food then i’ll just get my own shit and you can pay 100% for you instead of a four way split"" \*\*copied and pasted this text message as is\*\*

so just to be clear they never pay when asked, technically roommate C still owes me $15 from last year but I obviously have moved past that. They have never paid or helped setting up the wireless so I am unsure what that is about but from this I think its becoming more and more clear that they are not true friends.

4th Edit \~ The two would like to do all groceries individually  which is absolutely fine with me #byesister

5th Edit \~ Roommie C and I had a talk and she said if i couldn't understand that what I did was fucked up then I am just a shitty person. She then said I have ruined our friendship over $20. So i guess this did not have a happy ending

Roommie 1 is on my side, Roomie 2 agrees we were all confused lets move but Roommie 3 aka Roommie C will not just let us all except some blame and move on \*\* if anything else happens i will let you know

6th Edit \~ Roommate C has informed me her overdraft fee will be billed to me so I told her to leave me the hell alone, venmoed her, her money back, and she tells me she doesn't want my money now. Roommate C is clearly a psycho, it makes much more sense now why she attracts such insane men.

Clarification Edit ~ I said we all made mistakes here because sometimes you just need to swallow your pride to preserve a friendship. It is only $20 but its also about the principle. I am supposed to be your friend to please have some respect for my finances as well. 

I told them more than once when the bill was due. They were well aware. Roommate 2 and I both just decided to move on and not dwell because I never went into this with the intention of seriously pissing them off. I literally just need to grab their attention. 

Roommate 2 and I talked that out. Roommate 3/C refused to accept her part in the responsibility of paying on time. She refuses to take even still fully pay. 

They both do have access to the wireless. I am not a bitch. I legitimately just thought if they realized my joke was serious (about no money no wifi) they would just immediately be like oops here is $20. I never thought Roommate C would blow this up. That is the main reason I even wondered if I was the asshole because of her reaction.

Final Edit ~ Roomie C and I have a class together on tuesday/thursdays at 2:30 so I was kinda freaking out worried about if she would still sit in our spot or just sit somewhere else without speaking to me. But she did sit next to me and was just went about like usual. 

After the class she said she was sorry for going overboard and that she missed our happy group dynamics. I agreed and said in the future I won’t be so rash and will try to communicate more clearly. At the end of the day our friendship is worth more than the wireless bill. 

But for those who care Roomie C herself agrees I was not the asshole😂",509,4421,0.96

While I’m not a real party person she is but I decided why not it won’t hurt to go to one. So we went and we pregamed in the hotel went to the club.  Keep in mind while we aren’t dating but are friends we always say that we won’t dance with anyone because we don’t want to leave each other alone. 
   We start dancing and she starts getting some attention from guys. I don’t blame them she’s  very attractive and I don’t mind cause we already have this agreement previously mentioned.

He called her by name so they clearly knew each other and I thought he might be an old friend or co-worker of my girlfriend's. My girlfriend is usually very polite and kind, but instead she turned to the guy and said ""why are you talking to me? I don't even like you!""

I was pretty shocked that my girlfriend was so hostile and the guy seemed taken aback and confused. He said he didn't understand what was wrong and asked my girlfriend if she was okay. My girlfriend yelled at him ""did you not hear me, don't talk to me! Leave!"" And waved him away dismissively.

The guy told me he didn't understand what was going on and he looked genuinely upset and confused. I apologized to him and told my girlfriend ""you can't talk to people like that, you should apologize!"" She told me not to talk to the guy and said we were leaving. I figured I should go with her so I apologized again to the guy and went with my girlfriend.

At first I was mad at her for being so rude, but she explained to me more about that guy, and it turns out that he's a really shitty person. I agree with her that he was probably trying to intimidate her by approaching her like that and hadn't expected her to yell at him. He did the sad nice guy act to manipulate me into feeling bad for him and I fell for it.

I hadn't thought that she had a legitimate reason for telling the guy to leave because her words and gestures seemed very mean girl esque. If she had shown fear I would have assumed she had a serious problem and helped her get the guy to leave. But the way she acted reminded me more of bullying.

My father just started a new job and told me to finance a new laptop under my credit and he will pay for it. They told me not to worry about price and get the one I truly wanted. I picked a computer that had all that I needed and spent weeks researching to make sure I wasn't going overboard and was getting the best bang for my buck.

Well my dad lost his job and my mom started making late payments. I didn't want this on my credit longer so I started paying and paying more than the minimum. But living off of $500 a month, a $100 laptop payment was incredibly stressful and I would often go hungry so that I save my credit.

She also kept reassuring me he was the only one to come over... And then to migrate into my PARENTS bedroom to smoke weed, drink and play video games?? Her excuse was that she was feeling sick, wanted her boyfriend to come over but he wouldn’t come over unless his friends came over but my problem is that she was texting me that night and only told me her boyfriend came over. 

Im extremely hurt. I have anxiety over this type of stuff, I barely let my own friend’s come over to my house is general because my parents are pretty narcissistic and its embarrassing. So for me to trust someone to be in my space without me and then invite people over that I don’t know makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. I also met these friends over the summer and had a great time with them but turns out they hung out at my house, in my parents bedroom without me evening knowing them!! 

I feel kinda bad and I don’t know if I should... I just can’t help but feeling like my privacy has been invaded. AITA??",16,50,0.91
616,No A-holes here,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Please excuse any mistakes, English is not my first language. I should say this happens in a western country so there will be no confusion about culture-related things or whatever.

I (22M) left my hometown 2 years ago to go to med school in a major city about 600 kms (approx. 400 miles) away. My parents are quite wealthy and bought me a 2 bedrooms apartment when I moved here. Now, I know how to clean, cook and do laundry but, like many people, I really hate doing those things.

One year ago, someone from a different university in the same city(20F) contacted me through a mutual friend. She’d heard from that friend that I live alone in a 2 bedrooms apartment and she was curious if she could rent that spare room. Initially I said no because I really enjoyed living alone but then it struck me. I called her back and told her she could have the room rent free if she were to cook for me and do all the cleaning and laundry. I knew her financial situation was not so happy at the time and I was pretty sure she wouldn’t refuse. I was right. She studies too but her major is not very demanding and she has a lot of free time, that’s why this arrangement is possible. 

For the past year the average day looked like this: I wake up, she makes breakfast, then I tell her for dinner I want that and that, then off to our days we go.  She comes home first and by the time I arrive dinner is ready. She does the laundry and cleaning mostly on weekends. I pay the bills entirely and I also provide all the money for buying groceries. One weekend a month, when my parents come visiting, she has to sleep on the couch in the living room because the other bedroom is occupied by my parents. 

Yesterday I was hanging out with some friends and this subject was brought up because one of them is interested in setting up a similar thing for himself. At that point some other guy in our group called us both assholes and sexists. He added that “the fact that you also banged her makes you the biggest asshole I have ever met”. (Indeed, that happened once many months ago. She initiated and I was like “Why not?”. After that it didn’t happen again because I’m not really sexually or romantically attracted to her. What I want to say is that she is not my  ”sex slave” or whatever my friend implied with that statement. 

I should mention that whatever reddit’s judgement might be I will change nothing because I enjoy the current situation too much. Nonetheless, I am genuinely curious what internet strangers think about it…..

619,No A-holes here,"I've been struggling with mental health issues for the better part of a year now, but a couple months ago I met this girl who I have a lot of fun with, she's really cool and quite pretty. I enjoy being around her.

The problem is yesterday we were discussing how I feel lost in life and have a hard time answering ""why"" to existence in general. She proceded to tell me how all I was doing was whimpering and that my problems will be solved if I just go and do something, her argument is basically that I need to act and stop complaining about my lot in life.

After this I decided I didn't want to keep talking to her, so I stood up, apologized and told her it would be better if we spoke another day. I left her house while she kept telling me she didn't want me to go but I basically ignored her. I sent her a text next morning but hasn't answered since.

AITA for not listening to what she wanted to say? Should I really just go out there and stop whimpering? I'm quite confused.

UPDATE (if anyone cares): I spoke to her earlier today, she agreed the way she handled things was immature and not helpful to my situation. I agreed next time I won't run away from my problems, also to hurry up on that psychiatric help.

624,Everyone Sucks,"My wife is 12 weeks pregnant and is having a really rough time with morning sickness. She'll typically throw up about 7-10 times a day despite being on the same medication they give chemo patients. To give some context; this pregnancy is her second - the first pregnancy was slightly better in terms of sickness (only 4-7 spews a day!) but it lasted pretty much the full 9 months.

She is an actual trooper and I'll forever be thankful for what she goes through to bring our beautiful children in to this world. I've made a point of taking up extra slack, doing more chores around the house, more cooking and taking on additional childcare duties to give her a much needed break.

Unfortunately for me, she has a terrible vomiting technique. When she has the need, she'll stand over the toilet, bend over ever so slightly and hit the eject button. The angle she bends down at can conveniently be demonstrated by a rough ASCII diagram:

       ´ཀ`
      /   
     /    |
    |   __|
    |  |  |
    |  |__|

With most of the spews being projectile, needless to say, we end up with an extremely messy toilet area. There is vomit everywhere. On the seat. Under the seat. On the floor around the toilet. The toilet she uses most of the time during the day is located in a small room, about 1.5 meters wide with the toilet in the center. As I type this, both walls on either side are showered in remnants of one particularly violent session. I do not understand the physics of this; all I know is that I am disgusted.

I asked her to clean up after herself but she is resistant. She has always been quite lazy when it comes to cleaning up and is an untidy person; generally happy to live in what I deem to be pretty dirty conditions. From my perspective, this is next level filth and is unacceptable despite her current condition, particularly because it could be resolved with an improved technique.

She says that she doesn't want to get closer to the toilet because it's gross, made more unpleasant because she has to do it so frequently throughout the day. Her position is that cleaning the toilet for her is the least I could do considering she is likely going to have to do this for the next 6 months.

Reddit, you will determine who cleans our toilets post-spews for the next 6 months. The stakes are high. Do not hesitate. Every seconds counts.",1459,4482,0.95
625,Not the A-hole,"This weekend was my birthday, and my Mom has been begging me to come home to celebrate for years. I finally agreed, and she offered to fly me and my girlfriend cross-country.

I'm the oldest of four siblings, and my brother recently came out. He has his first boyfriend and he's very happy. My mother hates the boyfriend though, and made it a point to bring it up to me. There are some valid criticisms, but she's also expressed a distaste with seeing them do any PDA at all (holding hands, leaning on each other, etc.). She's very conservative and considers herself ""Old Fashioned"".

I invited the boyfriend to my birthday dinner and we all had a blast, except my mother. She was silent most of the night, I assumed she was just tired. Near the end of the meal, my girlfriend and I went to the bathroom. I came back to the table before my girlfriend and noticed my Mom was now gone too. On top of that, my brother is sobbing. I asked what was wrong and he said that Mom doesn't approve of him and his boyfriend and told them to ""Stop it right now"" when he rested his head on his partner. My mom eventually came back, didn't say a word, paid for the bill, then just went to the car without saying anything to any of us.

Obviously this ruined my birthday dinner, so the next morning I decided to take out my brother and his boyfriend for lunch. We had originally planned a full family lunch, but I figured that they could use some time away from Mom. I told mom about the plan shift and she became livid immediately, saying that I was excluding her. I asked if she wanted to talk about what happened last night and she said no, so I left. My Mom didn't speak to me for the rest of the trip, except for when I came to her to say goodbye before my flight.

This is the last straw for me. Not only was she terrible to my brother, she also ruined my birthday weekend. My girlfriend honestly wants nothing to do with her anymore. I know that in a couple weeks she's going to pretend like nothing ever happened (she never apologizes, she just waits out the storm in righteous anger). I want to do something though, so I'm thinking about giver her a list of conditions she will have to meet if we are to speak again. These conditions would be:

An apology to me, my brother, and his boyfriend.

Allow a discussion on her actions that night.

She must see a therapist about a potential diagnosis for Narcisstic Personality Disorder and discuss her sessions with me so I have some proof that she's doing it.

Read [this link](http://parrishmiller.com/narcissists.html) I found on /r/raisedbynarcissists and write a report.

This is a lot. My girlfriend thinks I'm going too far, and that accusing her of narcissm will dilute the issue of how she treated my brother. She thinks it would be better to focus just on this one incident, since she might actually apologize but won't if I insult her. Are my demands too much?",29,43,0.91
626,Not the A-hole,"Sorry about the format. I’m on mobile. 

My brother has a 3D printer and it’s really cool but since he prints rather large things, it takes a long time. Our house is rather small so he leaves  his printer in the kitchen which is attached to my and my sisters shared bedroom. My brother’s room is on the other side of the house right next to my parents’ room. 

Last night he got out of work around 6pm and started to print a headlight cap, which would take over 10 hours to print. I went to bed around 11pm because I had to work at 9am the next morning but because of all the noise from the printer, I couldn’t fall asleep no matter how hard I tried. My door was closed and I had one of my pillows over my head but I still could still hear it.  The print was about halfway done at 1am but there was no way I was falling asleep so I paused it and went to bed. 

This morning I woke up and my brother yelled at me that I ruined his print. He said that because it cooled it had risen a bit and when he tried to resume it, the printer couldn’t finish it. My dad said I should’ve just let it finish (it would’ve been done at 5:30am) and that I should buy him new filament for it even though it didn’t use more than $2 worth of it. I’d happily buy him a new spool of filament if he stopped running the printer when I’m trying to sleep. AITA?

Edit: I forgot some useful information: 
-Both my parents and my sister and I have asked my brother on more than one occasion not to print overnight. 
-Our house we live in currently is very small and does not have a garage or a basement but after we move to our actual house the printer is going in the basement. 
-I have already bought an entire spool of filament for his printer so I have more than replaced what was wasted for this print.",46,195,0.95

633,Not the A-hole,"So I've been contemplating if I'm right or wrong, so let's do this.

My brother begged me to cosign a loan to hire a lawyer to get some custody of his kid after his pregnant fiancee walked out. I immediately did it because of the severity of the situation and never heard anything About needing help paying the loan for years. 

He never tried to gain custody though, instead he took the 6 grand to the casino and lost it all. Heard the kid looks like him but he has no ties and she claims it's not his.

4 years ago he moved to Washington State due to legal weed. At some point he asked for help on a payment since he was struggling to make payments on the loan. I not only brought his account to current(3 months behind when I had limiyed funds) but also hooked him up with a job from across the country which he went into and sabotaged by talking about weed. Never hear anything again about needing help paying again.

3 years ago, my wife and I happened across a house that was perfectly priced and sized for us and had an inground pool that we wanted, we've never had credit problems so we apply and are excited due to about to buy a house and get denied due to a low fico from a chargeoff. I was furious that he let it get chargedoff without telling me he didnt make more payments.

So I did contact him pissed off to see what he was doing about the loan, after 2 months of follow-up to see if he handled it yet he calls me an a-hole for asking about this.

After being told that I was the bad person for being mad about this, i told him he was dead to me and is not family because family wouldn't be selfish like that, take advantage of family and have no empathy or remorse about screwing your own blood over.

634,No A-holes here,"Sorry for length, TLDR at end!  This is also my first proper post, so bear with on style and grammar.


Background: My fiancé (F) has a big family, so we are having a reasonably large wedding with plenty of room for all the relatives.

However, a particular aunt and her husband (we'll call them AU) have caused F and his brother (B) a lot of pain in the past.
When F's father passed away AU tried to get a share of a life insurance payout. 
AU thought they were entitled to a share, and made things quite unpleasant until they were told that they were not entitled and then dropped the claim. 

AU also arrived at the wake, after the funeral, asking where the family car was and wanting to see it. As they had been promised it by F's dad before he passed.  This upset F and many other family members, as it was very inappropriate to be talking about what they were getting out of a family bereavement at the funeral. The situation resulted in F telling AU to leave. 

They also claimed that F and B put their grandma into an old people's home because they couldn't be bothered to care for her. F and B visited every home in the area and picked the nicest one, they  invited AU to help them, but weren't taken up on the offer.
F & B both work full time and were unable to care for their grandma any longer, at this point had been doing if for years alongside looking after their terminally ill father. F had been living with grandma up until now and had no help from AU.

AU continually moans to B about not having met me, making things awkward at family events. I have actively avoided them, because I don't trust myself not to tell them what I think of them. 

Fast forward to our wedding plans and I've been told by F that we should invite AU to the full day, just to avoid B having to deal with their spiteful comments. As B still sees them out of loyalty to his father's memory.

I have refused to invite them, they have caused nothing but drama and heartache for the people I love and I don't want to spend such an important day biting my tongue. I'm someone who usually confronts things like this head on and it's stressful for me not to, but I respect F's request not to get involved.
I have tried to compromise and said they can come to the evening, but F keeps saying I'm causing trouble for B by not having them there all day. He says I'm being selfish putting B in this situation.

I feel I'm protecting F and B and ensuring they, and I, have a drama free special day. I feel like B needs to stand up to their bullying if they try and start a row about the invite, as he's put up with it for too long.

TLDR: Aunt and uncle repeatedly cause family upset and money-grab. AITA for not wanting to share our wedding day with them? Even if it means they take it out on fiancés brother?

Throwaway account for anonymity.

Edit: Update: Just want to say thanks for those who gave constructive advice (rather than angry rants). I definitely see now that he has a right to decide about his family and I don't.

636,Not the A-hole,"I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

The ring is cheap. It was £300 and has actually gone down to £180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

I could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for £250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?

639,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) have been in an LDR for almost 3 years now. My boyfriend is Bulgarian and I am American. Due to financial and job constraints, we have been unable to officially close the distance but are planning to have him apply for American visas next year. 

My cousin, Beth (28F), has ALWAYS been very dismissive of my relationship. My family is close and due to our close age, Beth and I were always friends growing up. We are good friends apart from her constantly picking on my relationship and dismissing its validity. She would frequently say things like ""When are you going to get a real boyfriend?"" and often refers to my partner as my mail-order-husband.I have always been very civil but firm on the subject and she knows I dislike when she says things to belittle him or our relationship.

Beth recently got a new boyfriend of her own. She then started lamenting to me about how she now ""understood"" my pain and struggles of being in an LDR. She apologized to all the belittlement and started complaining about her new relationship because it's long distance. How far is her boyfriend, one might ask? Well, he lives 30 minutes away. Neither of them have overly demanding careers that take up a lot of their time, and they go out at least once a week. She frequently stays at his place over the weekend and will drive to work on Monday morning from his apartment.

In her eyes, because they do not live in the exact same city it's an LDR. Now, I hate gatekeeping as much as the next person, but in my eyes it's not an LDR if you can see each other every day of the week and it's a 15 minute drive to meet up half way. Seems pretty normal for a relationship. It takes longer for people in the same city to meet up sometimes, but we live in a rural area with no traffic whatsoever so it doesn't even take the full 30 minutes to get to his place most of the time.

When she kept *accusing me of belittling her struggles with LDR* (oh the irony) I blew up a little. I told her that her relationships ""isn't fucking long distance"" and she still cannot understand a single thing I have to go through being in ""a real LDR"". She called me a gatekeeping bitch. Her younger sister (who I am also good friends with) called me to tell me I shouldn't have made Beth feel so bad when she was trying to be understanding of me. I don't think I'm gatekeeping.

643,Not the A-hole,"My wife an only child. We've been together 13ish years and she's currently pregnant with our 1st child. She is about half way through the pregnancy and it's about that time when the OBGYN can tell you the gender. I wanted to know, my wife didn't. We're not unreasonable with each other so during the last OBGYN appointment the doctor told me and kept it secret from my wife. I've got until January to keep the secret (i'm comfortable with it). 

This situation is complicated because of our mothers. They both want to know. I told my mother I know, but won't tell her because she isn't good at keeping secrets would might use a pronoun when my wife is around. She tried to pry it out of me jokingly, but is ok with waiting to know. If she was better about keeping secrets, I'd have told her. My MIL... i just don't like. She's been toxic to my wife and I on/off for 13 years. From trying to force my wife (then new girlfriend) to dump me, to just treating me like an outsider and being cold or ignoring me. Although this has downgraded to mostly ignoring me since my wife and I got married. 

Anyhow, I simply don't want to reward her with this information. My wife doesn't care if I tell or not but doesn't want to have it spoiled to her. She did mention to her mom early in the pregnancy that I wanted to know the gender so when we hit the 18 week mark MIL inevitably started texting me super friendly (never happens) asking about the gender. Instead of confronting her or something I simply told her that I decided to wait to know as well and all I know is the baby is healthy. 

I did tell my wife's maid of honor and we've been working together on preparing for the birth. This friend is extremely good at keeping secrets so I felt comfortable sharing. Baby is due in January. I suppose there is always a chance for a slip up and for the lie to come out in the open, but it seems unlikely. 

Anyhow, I know this is my MIL's first (and maybe only) grandkid and she has every right to be excited and want to know the gender so she, too, can buy things in preparation. She's been wanting to attend appointments with my wife but my wife isn't interested. I've sent her some pictures, but that's about it.

I took my mother with me last year, we had a great time but I know my wife was disappointed that she couldn’t come but she understood.

I felt so confident in our decision that since I had such a great time last time with my mom I’d invite her to come along again to Paris and she’s been super excited all year. I never would have taken that step unless I knew that we wouldn’t go back on that decision. Oh boy. 

Fast forward to today... I’m chatting with my wife about a conversation she had with a friend of hers and my business trip to Paris was brought up. She suddenly thought “why wasn’t she coming with me to Paris”, and now she wants to go. The event coordinator already has the travel dates in place, the tickets are almost ready to be purchased and I’m literally a day or two away from finalizing all of the travel details.

She said, “well it’s not too late”. ☠️

Now hours later we just had one of those late night “discussions” where I’m told what an asshole
I’m being and how I’m going to just end up alone and lonely. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 

So I’m left with a golden ticket to Willy Wonka and if I take either one I’m going to dissapoint the other. I told my wife this and she’s incredulous that I don’t want to immediately change the plans I’ve held all year because she just changed her mind today. I’m at the point where I’m going to disinvite my mother and just take the two tickets and turn it into extra legroom. 

TLDR: Job sends me to Paris for a weekend and I can bring someone. Wife and I agree last year that she should stay home with our three kids so I invite my Mom. Now a month away from the trip with almost all of the details finalized my wife changed her mind and shes pissed I wont toss my Mom to the curb.

647,Not the A-hole,"Little backstory- I’m a female and basically do everything in my household. My mom works from 6am to 11pm so she’s never home. I clean , sometimes cook, and tidy up the house. My dad works crazy hours and is barely home also. 
My brother is the one leaving the house a mess and never doing his dishes. Recently i’ve gotten sick of it and stopped doing the chores just to see what would. I let my mom know, so I won’t get in trouble lol. The dishes were piled up in the sink almost spilling out. My brother went in there a put a dish right into the sink like he didn’t see the billions of plates and cups in there. I got aggravated and went to wash the dishes before he put more in. I was clearly irritated. He said “why you so mad?” and i said in a calm but stern voice “You know you live here too right? You can wash the dishes, sweep the living room, SOMETHING. You so dependent on women to do everything for you. Are you physically disabled ? No. so you are completely capable of doing house chores. If I wasn’t here this house would be a fucking mess. You’re 4 years older than me! You need to grow up already and stop acting like only women can do dishes, cook, and other house shit.” He got pissed at me and told me I was being a bitch and left. As he was leaving I said “can you at least take the trash out that’s the only thing your good for in this house” 
I don’t feel bad but was I too harsh ??

Edit1: Yes I have talked to him about cleaning before this whole incident. He doesn’t take me serious cause he sees me as his baby sister.  My parents are barely home (come home late at night) so they never see the mess before I clean it and i’m not going to let my parents come home to a dirty ass house. 
Also I don’t clean everyday. The only things I do daily is dishes and cleaning up the sink area of course. The other house chores are done weekly or bi-weekly.",107,277,0.94

So I after she left I noticed she left the house key and the door unlocked and that infuriated me because she was willing to risk the fact that someone random dude could just walk into hour house while we sleep.

So I locked the front door and the garage door. The next morning I woke up to like 10 missed calls and texts from my sister demanding me to unlock the door. So I called her back and when she picked up she started screaming at me, calling me asshole and every other name in the book. 

She said she had to sleep at her friend's house and that our mom now knows she snuck out last night. My mom grounded her for 2 weeks and my sister gives me death glares.

651,Not the A-hole,"Ok so it sounds bad but let me explain. About 4 months ago we had a birthday party for one of my friends. We partied at my place and everyone brought some drinks. I don’t really drink to begin with so all the stuff that my friends had brought over sort of stayed how it was. Fast forward a couple months I was cleaning out some of the old bottles of jack Daniels, Hennessy, fireball etc when I cam across a bottle of vodka. It was unopened so I put it in my freezer. Fast forward another month and I mention the bottle at work and one of my friends recognized it as his. I told him to come get it which he never did. Again fast forward to last week I was playing rainbow 6 siege with some friends and made a drinking game out of it. Again not being a big drinker I didn’t have anything and was about to remain sober when I remembered the vodka. So I drank about half the bottle that night and passed out. Yesterday we did the same game and again I drank the vodka. The owner of the bottle played with us that night and got upset saying I owed him a new bottle. I told him sure no problem until he told me this bottle was about $80. He said that he got it as a gift from his roommate and brought it over to my house about 4 months prior and left it. As I said before I did remind him I had it although I admit I never specifically asked if I could have it. AITA!?",116,202,0.94
652,Not the A-hole,"Background is my partner and I have a fairly small duplex and we sublet a room to a current student. I know her from spending a month together on a school trip almost 7 years ago, not much of a friendship beyond that other than social media. She moved in a month ago and otherwise is a pretty good roommate. Goes to bed at 12 typically and leaves for school by 8:30am. Basically my partner’s and I’s schedule as well.

Last week the roommate’s boyfriend drove up from the state below for a pit stop on the way to the state above for a backpacking trip. They picked up a friend from the airport and off the bf and friend went. Roommate stayed here for school but went to pick them up Saturday at the end of their trail. They arrive home tonight at 11:45pm. No heads up text or concern expressed until roommate comes into room to let me know they will be shuffling about making meals, taking showers and doing laundry. Tomorrow is Monday. Tomorrow I work 10 hours. Tomorrow is coming in 8 hours from now for me. 

I asked her if laundry could wait until tomorrow. She says that the friend is leaving on a plane soon and that’s why they need to do the laundry now. Meaning some guy I don’t know is doing his laundry here at an indecent hour because what? Do they not make washers and dryers where he is from? Are the clothes he’s wearing not appropriate for a trip home? Our washer/dryer is not quiet. It’s within 5 feet of my bedroom door and ten feet from me. If I couldn’t hear it I wouldn’t care. I can’t close my door because I have 3 animals that come in and out as needed.

I just don’t get why: 1. As far as I’m concerned a random guy needs to do his laundry at my home before going home to his home where’s there probably a washer and dryer within a mile. And 2. Why if they were planning this the whole time, that there wasn’t a polite heads up with the understanding that this is inconvenient and confirming it’s chill to do.

 I know that I have to own up to my consequence. so I've been giving lacy 100$ a week while she is pregnant to help pay for things she might need and I plan on figuring out how much I need to pay once the baby is born. 

I plan on never being in the baby's life and only paying child support. lacy agrees with this and has a tight enough family support that she is fine with being a singe mum. 

my family/friends found out about it and are incredibly pissed I'm not owning up to my actions and being a dad so I'm currently being shat on by almost everyone I know.

654,No A-holes here,"So my fiancé and I have been together for close to 7 years.  We’re both in our early twenties. We’ve been engaged for 2 years now, wedding is next summer. 

Recently I moved in with her in a new town.  To make it easier to pay bills since we are doing everything 50/50,  she suggested we combine accounts to make it easier to pay bills.  She had brought this up a while ago, and I said no, which she reluctantly accepted. Now that we’re living together, she wants to even more than before.  

When she brought it up today on the phone, I said no again, but this time she got mad about it.  She said she doesn’t want to get shafted by paying more than me or vise versa, which I understand. She also is mad I don’t trust her with the combined account.  I told her I would think about it. 

She called back later, and I suggested we just split in the expenses up, like I’ll pay groceries and utilities, she pays rent and WiFi. We would keep track of what we spent. Whoever pays less will just transfer the other the difference at the end of the month. She thought that was too much work.  

Next I suggested a joint credit card to pay the expenses.  At the end of the month, we would each pay half of the of the card bill.  She accepted that, but she was still mad because I don’t trust her. 

It’s not that I don’t trust her, but anything can happen, especially since we just started living together.  I don’t foresee this not working out, but if it doesn’t I don’t want to lose my savings. 


More background: 
Financially, I have a lot more saved, Close to 15K.  She has been living on her own for longer than me(I just moved out of my parents house) so she has maybe $1000 in her account.

657,Everyone Sucks,"I went to a good friends housewarming party. I brought with me a somewhat ""fancy"" bottle of cabernet that cost around $80. Not the fanciest maybe but I don't usually ball out that much on wine. 

The party was going well and I noticed my wine had been opened and half had been drunk. Somebody told me they were enjoying it and started laughing uproariously. She told me to ask the host why. 

Confused, I did so, I found her and she was very drunk. She told me my wine was a hit but I was mortified to find out that her and a few others were using my wine (along with others) for making ""wine enemas"". 

I thought it was a joke but she was completely serious and took me to to the 2nd bathroom where a few people were gathered, wasted, with enema kits or whatever (I don't know the right word...) and a bunch of towels on the floor. Somebody was in the shower, pants off, laughing and the other people were encouraging her to ""hold it in!"" 

I was absolutely aghast. I asked her to clarify if she had used my wine for an enema and she had. 

I stormed back out to the kitchen, grabbed my bottle, and left the party. I was furious for my wine to be used in this way. 

I got an angry text the next day that it was ""impolite"" to take back a housewarming gift especially when the wine was already opened. I have since heard from other friends that I over-reacted, that it's not my business how people enjoy wine I gifted them, and even some people saying that wine enemas are becoming common and that I shouldn't be so judgmental. I don't know what to think. I find a wine enema disgusting but at least use cheap wine if you have to? 

I don't know.

Was I wrong to take my wine back when it was being used for enemas?

660,Not the A-hole,"So my friend had planned to have his birthday party at one of his favorite clubs last night. The club was a really upscale place and overall really really nice. So he invited me and I of course wanted to go. So I called him a few days before the party and asked if there was a dress code, seeing as it was a fancy place.  He said it wasn't the kind of place to wear a tuxedo but to wear your best clothes. 

I don't have an actual suit and I couldn't just go out and buy one so when I went I wore a grey button up shirt with a matching tie, black slacks, and black loafers which I had buffed to a high shine.  So I got to the party and got in and everything. The first thing my friend asked me when he saw me was: ""do you have a suit?"" I told him I didn't have a suit and tried to wish him a happy birthday.  He just said: ""I guess you look nice enough"" and then he walked away.  I was taken aback.  

This ""friend"" has been acting weird towards me the past few months but since he invited me I thought I'd go anyway, (he's been cold and distant lately) but after what he said, I felt flat out insulted.  I left the gift I had brought with a pile of gifts on a table and then I just quietly left.  I found what he had said to be really hurtful. I felt like crying when I was walking out to my car.

661,Not the A-hole,"I asked one of my best friends to be a bridesman in my upcoming wedding. The discussion regarding his outfit came up almost immediately. He seemed  stoked about dressing up and asked about ideas for the dresses. I was a little taken aback by this because I never really considered having him in a dress at my wedding. Keep in mind he is gay, but he’s never dressed in a feminine way. He has been very adamant about matching the other bridesmaids. I cant stop thinking about how that would look and what shoes he would wear and all that. I almost feel bad about worrying about how my family or my husbands family will be judging him at our wedding. I know I shouldn’t care what people think about it. AITA for wanting him to wear a suit? Or should I just let him wear the dress and say screw it? Its almost 2020 for fucks sake.

Edit: I want a male friend of mine to be one of my bridesmaids, I think that term is bridesman. 

We always talks about breaking gender norms and social constructs. I feel like a hypocrite saying he can’t wear a dress. Ultimately I know its my choice. He also wants to wear heels and I do agree that any other shoes would look off, but I don’t want him falling or getting hurt.",162,565,0.95
662,Not the A-hole,"I’m reflecting on what happened earlier today, but I still feel upset and need to process what happened. I’m a Canadian and we’re often stereotyped to be nice. I’ve lived here all my life and that’s generally true. However, today was the first time I had been treated so poorly by other Canadians. 

It’s a long weekend in Canada so I expected things to be busy but I had some friends out of town visiting and wanted to take them to the aquarium. I knew parking would be hard to find but not impossible. So we circled around the park once and on the second loop, there were some people in a truck about to leave, so I rolled down my window to confirm. They said they were leaving but it would take some time because they were strapping something in the back of their trunk. So I very considerately pulled off to the side and signalled to indicate I was waiting for the spot. The parking lot lanes were wide enough to accommodate two cars and it was a one way, so the cars behind me could easily pass by while I waited for the parked car to leave. 

I have never felt this uncomfortable while waiting. The car directly behind me refuses to go around, and is in the middle of the lane which causes a huge line up behind me, and some people start honking for me to move. But I knew if I left, I would probably be circling the parking lot again. My friend urged me to stay because I wasn’t blocking the way and had left room for cars to go around me. The people behind me get more and more angry, and more honking ensued. I was already waiting 2 mins at this point, and didn’t want to give up. Eventually the car behind me goes around me (with more than enough space). Then as all the cars pass me, several honked at me while one car furiously gave me the middle finger as they drove by and car started recording me while smirking and giving me the thumbs up. I was too shocked that these people were so mean to even react. This would have never happened if we weren’t behind car doors. In the end I waited about 5-10 mins for the truck to leave but I felt nervous those angry drivers would come back and key my car. On my way into the aquarium, I noticed it was happening to other drivers too but not to my extent. Just the honking and refusal to go around. At this point, I felt pretty upset and didn’t even enjoy the aquarium. 

So was I an asshole for waiting for the parking spot? Or should I have kept going and circling the parking lot? I just couldn’t believe how people behave when they’re behind the wheel. 

TLDR; I was waiting for a parking spot but drivers behind me was pressuring me to go even though I left space for them to pass. Am I an asshole for not moving?",59,100,0.92

664,Asshole,"Hey guys. I’ve never made a Reddit post and I’m not exactly sure what I’m hoping to achieve here. This is obviously a throwaway account because I don’t want this coming back to me later and complicating issues even further with my spouse. 

So here’s the story. I’ve been married for 9 months to the love of my life, after an 8 year long relationship. Everything about our marriage is great except for this huge issue which I feel is breaking us apart more quickly than I imagined possible. 

My spouse is overweight. I don’t mean a few pounds - I’m talking easily 50-70 lbs above where they were when we met. It’s been gradual but for about a year or so it’s turned into this huge issue where I just don’t feel sexual attraction anymore. I’m in love, this person is my life, and I can’t picture not being together ever. 

But over the past year, sex has been an issue. I literally can’t keep an erection long enough to sustain intercourse. I can masturbate without any erectile issues, and often do (picturing the body I fell in love with), but it’s been clawing at us. Every few weeks, I get home to a toxic grumpy atmosphere where I have to walk on eggshells to avoid an inevitable fight that always breaks out. 

I had never actually spoken my mind about this because weight is a big issue that eats at my spouse’s self-esteem and I felt I’d just be piling on more hurt to a sensitive topic. My spouse has tried every single diet in the world but they never stick. I am partly at fault because I don’t have great eating or exercising habits either. But whenever I summed up the courage to say something, another “ok tomorrow I’m starting another diet” speech came up and I just thought “ok maybe this time it’ll work and I won’t have to do this”. 

We actually achieved some weight loss (and renewed sex life!) for the wedding and honeymoon, but both the weight loss and the sex drive were short lived. Now we’re back to the toxic setup we’ve had for about a year. 

Today everything blew up. I was accused of not wanting sex, of not caring about the relationship, of being uncaring. 

To which, finally, I said the dreaded words. It’s been 12 hours and my spouse is still crying in bed, and I feel like the biggest piece of shit in the world. I can’t move the conversation forward. I have tried my best to be reassuring that weight or looks have no bearing on my feelings of love, or my desire to build a life or family together - this is purely about sex. 

We’re under 30, no kids, making good income, great family and friends, active socially etc so everything else is fantastic. And all I want is to have a happier, healthier marriage but I can’t keep an erection and it’s destroying us. 

Am I the asshole for not being sexually attracted to my spouse this early in our marriage? Am I the asshole for saying it so bluntly, or for not having said it sooner?",115,79,0.79
665,Not the A-hole,"Hi, I've been weighing this decision for a while and while it probably would cause some conflict, I keep imagining the sweet satisfactory moment that would make this worth it.

So my parents bought me a Logitech G Pro Wireless, a $150 gaming mouse. I was there when they bought it so I have proof they actually purchased it and it exists. However, that was over a month ago, and they still are hiding it somewhere in the house and have been continuously, for the entirety of the last month or so, using it as leverage to get whatever they want from me. 

My idea for some petty ""revenge"" is to just get a part-time job at a fast food restaurant, and purchase the mouse for myself, leaving my parents with a $150 device that they would never use. The return policy is long over, so they would have 0 chance of getting a refund.

In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. 


My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women.

My dad and I have loved ""The Dark Crystal"" for ages. It's our favourite to watch since I was a little kid and has been ""our movie"" forever.

About a year ago or so, Netflix announced the greatest thing since sliced bread: ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance"", a prequel tv show for the original movie and I was over the moon excited. I added it to ""My List"" immediately and was even excited enough to regularly manually search for it on Netflix to check for a release date.

Fastforward to this friday. It's release day and im super excited *but* I have to play in a softball tournament. 

I asked him multiple times in the days before and literally right before I had left to not watch it without me so that we could watch it together.

Its now Sunday night and im back from the tournament, my dad is passed out in his chair in the usual fashion and on the tv screen is the very last end card for the final episode of ""Age of Resistance""

675,Not the A-hole,"I'm the result of a one night stand and my dad was never a presence in my life. My mom remarried and that man became my father. They had kids together and we were a big, blended family. Two years ago I got engaged. Around that time my bio-dad got back in contact. He apologized, explained why he was gone. I understood his reasons. He was a drunk, on drugs, living on couches then. He wasn't ready or in a position to be a father and I believe him when he said he was too far gone to get right for me. Leaving was the best thing he could have done because it opened the door for me to have a stable life. We'll call Bio-Dad: Mike.

I let Mike in on a low-contact basis. We'd meet for lunch or dinner once a month. I didn't want to meet his family, wife and daughters, which I guess makes them my half-sisters. I didn't tell him I was engaged but I forgot to take my ring off so he found out. Somehow he got the idea he'd walk me down the aisle. I told him my (step) dad would be doing it. Mike got upset and started offering ""alternatives"". Maybe he could walk me halfway, or both him and my stepdad could take an arm. Then he suggested I make everyone happy and have my grandpa walk me. I told him I was uncomfortable with his emotions and needed a break. I cut him off. For six months he stayed gone but then he started sending me letters about himself, photos of his life, his family and whatnot. 

One day about three months ago he brought his 13 and 16 year old daughters to my place of work to meet me. I asked them all to leave and went to my manager's office until they left. More recently he showed up at my house with the daughters, his wife, and his parents. I asked them to leave and told Mike that I wasn't interested in knowing him. I didn't want him or his family in my life. He insisted I should at least try to know ""my sisters"". I told him I wasn't interested. I had a family, siblings, grandparents, and his family was not part of it. I told him to fuck off. He asked me about my wedding. I scoffed and asked if he seriously still thought he was invited. He asked me about walking me down the aisle. He was crying. I told him I wished he had never contacted me and that he should just leave me alone. He left but he couldn't stop contacting me so I got a restraining order against him.

Some of my friends have been in the know and I've been honest with them. They told me I took it too far with the legal blocking and I should try empathy. He gave me up so I could have a better life but it didn't mean he didn't love me. Apparently because he made a hard choice he has a right to know me now that he's turned it around. I know he doesn't have a ""right"" to me but do I have some kind of moral and emotional obligation to honor his sacrifice of me by letting him in?

677,Not the A-hole,"Background, me: I'm Latina but look white. I would dare say I'm not racist. I was raised to be aware of racism & actively try to avoid perpetuating it. I welcome advice when my words/actions are wrong, especially regarding racism b/c that is something I never want to contribute to.

Background, dog: Before being rescued he was kept in a crate for the first year of his life. As a result he's terrified of *everything*. He's a bit racist b/c the man who abused him was black so he’s extra afraid of black people. I've been trying to desensitize him, a long process that began with daily trips to the dog park & sitting outside so he can see people aren't evil. He's been making progress so I started taking him to a dog-friendly bar; he's still scared but he’s getting used to it & lets people pet him sometimes. Also he has never been aggressive at all, even towards black people. His fear reaction is to run away/hide & the worst thing he's ever done is pee.

Last night we went to said bar. The bouncer & a guy we’ll call Mark asked me about my dog b/c they saw how scared he was. I told them he’s a rescue etc. & they loved him. I sat down & Mark joined me & we talked mainly about my dog. Mark is from India, so not black, but I explained that my dog is a little more afraid of people of color & why (this isn't something I typically share but he asked). Mark said that's horrible & continued to try to befriend my dog, which he did after \~10 min.

Later a group asked if they could pet my dog. I said yes but warned that he's scared & might hide. A white guy pet him without him pulling away & rejoined the group. Then a black guy we'll call John tried but he pulled away & hid. John was determined so he bent down & started talking. He point-blank asked why he let the white guy pet him but wouldn't let him. Again, I don’t usually share this, but he asked me straight up so I said ""Well, unfortunately he's a little bit more scared of black people b/c the man that abused him was black. It's something I'm really trying to work on with him so I'm glad you're still here trying to pet him."" John laughed & said ""Let me give you some advice: Never say that to a black person. Ever."" I apologized immediately & said I wasn't trying to be rude/offensive, but he kept saying the same thing. I apologized again & he just kept laughing & said it was nice to meet me & I said the same. He returned to his group & I saw him whisper to another black guy & they gave me a look & laughed. They left shortly after.

Mark wasn’t listening but could tell something happened, so I explained. I feel like a complete asshole b/c I know I offended John. Mark said I wasn’t offensive/racist at all, so that’s reassuring, but I can't shake the feeling that I fucked up & now John & his friends think *I'm* racist. AITA? I could ask my friends, but I don't want to put them in a position of being a spokesperson for all black people so I'm taking to Reddit. AITA?",217,795,0.94
678,No A-holes here,"My grandmother passed late June, but we didn’t have her service until this past weekend. She was baptist and attended church near her house, which is where we had the service, officiated by the current head pastor there. 

The pastor talked about my grandmother maybe 30% of the time, and the rest of the time he preached a fire-and-brimstone, “gods way is the only way, accept him or go to hell” sermon, shouting a lot of the time. I felt this was entirely inappropriate, it was my grandmother’s memorial service, and this man, who didn’t even know her well, used her death as a way to preach his opinion to her grieving family. A lot of my family isn’t even Christian, they’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, so he told them repeatedly they’re going to burn in Hell with Satan while they cried over their dead relative. 

The whole thing made me sick, and I really want to message him and tell him I didn’t appreciate that message at the service. I wanted to say something directly after the service, but my family was around and I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. The church is tiny and doesn’t even have a website, so this is the only way I’m aware of to reach the pastor. Should I just let it go? Would it be a major dick move to message him since I didn’t say anything directly after? A few relatives also didn’t enjoy his service, but many did. WIBTA if I said something?",345,2905,0.96

685,Not the A-hole,"My friend Jake just visited me in my city (he used to live here). A week and a half later he texts me saying he has an appt so he’s coming back, but instead of just coming the day for that appt he wants to spend another week at my place in my guest room. I say okay.

I played a real “host” on his last visit; washed sheets/deep cleaned the apartment etc, cooked us a couple meals and the rest went out with him to restaurants, clubs, etc. 

It was fun but very draining, I’m someone who needs a lot of alone time to recharge whereas he’s the opposite. I figured whatever, I won’t be seeing him for a while afterwards so I didn’t mind much. 

However, coming back less than two weeks later and expecting the same experience to me was not reasonable. He gave me two days notice for this trip. 

A few days in on this trip and I’ve gone out to eat with him a couple times but mostly opted to cook for myself, and told him he can buy something at the store downstairs, order in or go out, whatever. I’ve hung out with him a little but retreated to my room quite a bit (we’re both on summer break from uni, so no normal schedules, lots of free time). I don’t mention when I’m going to run errands because I don’t want the company. 

He’s confused when he realizes I’ve left even to go to the bank or whatever, and didn’t invite him along/tell him. Jake also said it’s weird I need so much alone time and putting a damper on this trip, and kind of shitty of me to want to eat alone sometimes, retreat to my room, not want to go out as much. I get it but that’s how I am and being a guest for two weeks out of a month in my home, he shouldn’t be complaining. I told him if he wants to go out while here to try and hit up our other friends more (although I think most are away on vacation/visiting families). AITA? 

tl;dr my friend is in town for a week, the second time this month. This time I am not playing as much of a “host” role, i’m letting him fend for himself with meals and i’m not wanting to go out/hang out as much, also spending a lot of time in my room. Friend says it’s a damper on his trip, insulting I don’t want to spend all my time with him even though I have so much free time and I could. AITA?",18,32,0.97
686,Not the A-hole,"So I work as a housekeeper at a hotel.  Recently everybody has been getting sick, injuries are common, which will be relevant later on. 

I've been having issues with one of my managers. She's not my direct manager anymore, and is now a general manager for all of the back of house.  I did have issues in the beginning, and got written up a couple of times for inappropriate callouts, but since then haven't had any issues with attendance. 

There are three different incidents that I would bring up to HR. Since she's not directly my boss, Kate wouldn't normally be involved in any of them. The first was I was having really bad anxiety that was making it hard to function, at work or otherwise, so I asked to talk to my main manager, who I'll call Rob about it. 

Then Kate, came upstairs, and asked what was going on. I explained, and she began to berate me. She told me quite harshly that she knew I was having a hard time but that didn't mean I got to skip work. I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to get out of work, I just wanted help, and she just repeated that I was expected to be at work. I was also sobbing at this point because I felt so low and so alone, and it hurt to be reprimanded for trying to come forward for help especially since our work constantly encourages us to do so. 

The second incident was I called out sick. I asked Rob if I needed a doctors note but he said I didn't. I had sick time, and my voice was gone so it was clear I was actually sick, and a lot of my coworkers have been getting sick too. Kate called me later, well after work hours, to tell me how hard me calling out was on everybody and to ask if I would be at work tomorrow. I said I would be, and she reiterated that me not being there was a hardship. 

The third incident happened yesterday. I hurt my back and had to leave work early to go to the doctor. I've been injured here before, but I've followed every worker's comp rule to the T. I've had doctors notes for everything, and followed all my restrictions. Well, Kate came upstairs to help Rob with the paper work for workers comp, and told me I was faking in every way except directly accusing me. She told me I didn't look like I was in pain, and that she didn't want to accuse me of being a liar but that I needed to look into my heart and decide if I truly couldn't make it through the day. I said I would try, but I really was in so much pain (It literally hurt me to take a deep breath), and she snapped at me and said that no I already said I couldn't do it so I shouldn't and to just go to the doctor. 

I was talking to my friend about it who's also called out sick and been injured recently, and also has been written up for improper callouts, and Katie hasn't said a word to her about it. I asked a couple of other people about it and they said she didn't say anything to them either. So I wonder if I should go to HR since apparently I've been singled out. WIBTA?",34,59,0.91

Anyway my girlfriend was cleaning the house today. She started early in the morning and I wasn’t awake when she started. Today is my day off so I would really like to relax, I slept in today until 11am. I expected to wake up peacefully but not really I heard the vacuum very loudly but I just decided to ignore it. I put some headphones on and that was it. My girlfriend is coming in and out of the room to clean and I notice she is looking annoyed. Well she walks in one last time and is all angy with me, and she starts complaining that she’s busting her has cleaning the whole house and that I don’t have the decency to lift a finger to help her. Well I got really mad at that and I told her this is my day off and I simply want to enjoy it but instead I wake up to the vacuum running and now my girlfriend nagging me. I told her she could’ve ASKED me if she want help but it’s not my response lability. She got even more pissed and then left the house and now my mood is absolutely ruined.

688,Asshole,"To start off, my boyfriend and I are very much home bodies. The difference between us is that while I do enjoy being at home, I still love to travel and experience new things. My boyfriend doesn’t see the point as much and prefers to do things inexpensive and not far from home.

I’ve been planning a trip to Europe with two of our close friends for the past couple months and we were planning to go for 20 days (Portugal, Spain, France, Netherlands). My boyfriend has been hesitant about it since the start due to him not liking travel as much, but I was confident I could convince him. I usually take on the role of planner for our group so he wouldn’t really have to do anything except come along for the ride.

Today I find out that ok he agrees to come but he will only come for two weeks. He says he doesn’t like being out of his normal routine for very long. I was upset by this because for me (someone who likes to travel), this seems like the most amazing trip and we would have such an awesome time with our two close friends. Another reason I was upset is because our other two friends going are a couple and I don’t want to have to spend a week (Portugal and Spain) being a third wheel. 

I am already spending an extra two weeks in Madrid solo traveling before our group trip starts and I just really want my boyfriend to come for the full 3 weeks. I have even offered to pay his portion for the extra week so we could enjoy that time together but he said that would be worse than him just not going the third week at all. In my mind, if he’s already agreeing to 14 days, what’s so bad about staying an extra 6 especially when I’ve said how important the trip is to me (I’ve been wanting to go to Europe for the past 4 years and finally have enough money) and offering to pay.

AITA for being upset by this? I’m trying to see his side but I feel like this would be such a fun experience and I want to do it with him in its entirety.

UPDATE: Seems I’m the asshole. Going to apologize for how pushy I’ve been and work on planning a great two weeks for while he is there. Thanks everyone for the honesty.",89,467,0.94

I was pissed that she lied about having a crisis and haven’t talked to her since. She should have known well in advance when her niece’s prom was and she could have told me she was unable to come to the wedding if she really wanted to take pictures. And to top it off, it cost 50 bucks per person for dinner. She rsvp’d for herself and a guest so that’s $100 bucks I could have saved.  She didn’t send a card or even offer to pay for her dinner.

696,Not the A-hole,"So a little background on my life. I'm currently 27 and am working two part-time jobs as a Lyft driver & daytime clerk. I live in an expensive housing complex, as well. Recently, about one month ago, I started to work evening shifts a few nights a week at a mid to upscale restaurant to get a little extra cash. The money hasn't been consistent at all, but on some days it's okay, so it makes it worth sticking around.

&#x200B;

Usually, everyone keeps their tips that are left in cash as that has been the company's policy. However, two weeks ago, one co-worker named Sally shared a tip 50/50 because I helped clear the tables before and after. Since then, we've been good friends and help each other all the time now. Now and then, other workers do the same, and there haven't been any problems. It works out well for us both because splitting usually makes money more consistent.    However, last week, I lavish customer left my table a massive tip of \~$14,000 in cash after eating. This amount honestly shook me to the core that night because it was the most money I've ever received at one time. At the time, I had been feeling generous and gave the cooks that night $2000 to share among themselves. However, Sally happened to be sick that night and took the day off, so she wasn't there. I felt slightly wrong and promised her $1500. I also gave other staffed workers promises for gift cards.

The issue is, she at first wanted more because of our split system, but I told her she wasn't even helping me that day, but I'd be willing to give her $2500 only to be fair. However, since then she's become more demanding. So just a few days ago, I told her that the money has been spent and refused to give her anything. I then also handed out all the gift cards to other workers while she was there(even ones not working that night), which didn't make her happy. While this isn't entirely true, I did spend around $5000 on a new tv, iPhone, gaming system, headphones, & computer.

&#x200B;

Now she refuses to talk with me saying I'm a mean person. I see that it's my money which I need for bills so I shouldn't have to pay any of it? Am overreacting here?  


Edit 1: Not sure if it matters, but I do indeed normally split with her 50/50 even on days we both aren't in because the other takes the day off/sick.",92,149,0.79

698,Not the A-hole,"So my fiance and I have began seriously planning for our wedding, which we are hoping to have next September 2020. 

My fiance who we'll call Rick has only one real dealbreaker, he does not want my oldest sister's husband who we'll call Danny at our wedding because Rick does not approve of what Danny does for a living. I don't know if I should say what Danny does, but let's just say that if you've traveled through an American airport, you've probably seen people at the security check who do Danny's job. Danny is a supervisor for this organization, which Rick thinks is full of ""power trippers and perverts"". I am not a big fan of Danny's employers either but I recognize that they serve a necessary function and that he isn't to blame for any ridiculousness that frustrates me. And what really pains me about this is that Danny has never been anything but kind and helpful to us in every way. Danny knows how much Rick hates what he does for a living, but Danny has accepted that there will always be some genuine hostility and has still tried to be civil with Rick. 

I told Rick that he's being ridiculous and that it would be weird to invite my sister but leave Danny out. I even pointed out that there are certain people being invited to our wedding who also work jobs that Rick doesn't approve of, though in a nongovernmental context. Rick then told me if I tell him who those people are he'd ban them too. Rick also offered to drive over to our sister's home and tell Danny in person that he is not to come to the wedding, but I told Rick he should stop and think before he does something like that.

AITA here? I understand Rick has his views and his opinions, and that they're just as valid as mine when it comes to the wedding planning. Right now the planning has stalled because Rick is standing his ground on this issue, but I can't help but think he's being especially unreasonable.",213,315,0.94

I was upset when we started talking about her going abroad for a semester and leaving our university.

When I first heard her say this I didn't believe her as she had never said anything like this before and it was completely out of the blue.

So when I have the TV at a different volume, my sister starts breathing heavily and demands I turn it back it a multiple of 5.

This may seem like she does have anxiety but when it happens with my parents there, they hand the remote over to her and she puts the volume back, and (sometimes) changes what we are all watching. This seems to me like she is faking it just to watch her programmes and that she thinks she can guilt trip me into changing the channel.

AITA?",74,70,0.85
705,Not the A-hole,"The title is very oversimplified so let me explain. Hang in there, because it's going to be a long explanation.

Up until my parents got divorced, we had a great relationship with my moms side of the family. They'd come visit at least 4 times a year and we always went to my grandmother's house in Florida over spring break. Seeing them was always my favorite part of the year and there was never any issues with it.

Now, when my parents got divorced my mom decided she didn't want me and my siblings to have any communication with her side if the family. She sent a lot of angry, untrue emails about my dad to her side of the family, but they took my dad's side. My dad thought she was just angry because of that and would let up on it soon enough (she's known to make bad, rash decisions when upset). Keeping that in mind, he allowed her to put it in the divorce contract with the assumption the it would be dropped after a few weeks.

It's been almost 9 years and I miss my family. I haven't seen any of my mother's side, including my grandparents, for almost a decade. But recently, my dad took us on a vacation to Florida. I am almost at the age where the divorce contract will have no legal hold over me, so I went to visit my grandmother (she lived nearby).

I've never been given a straight answer as to why I'm not allowed to see them. My mother told me once that I wasn't allowed to see her sister because she was ""a heroin addict"" (totally not true) and that my grandma ""called me a bitch"" (also not true and definitely not a reason to ex-communicate your family), so I've always been confused and thought that this rule was ridiculous. My mom refuses to tell me the real reason why and I'm beginning to believe she doesn't actually have a substantial one. I've never had a bad experience with anyone from her side, and I feel like that that it's my desicion to make, especially seeing as it's basically to the point where I don't have to follow the contract anyway.

When we got back she asked if I'd seen them and I said yes (I didn't want to lie to her) and she went ballistic. I understand that I went against her wishes, and I get that it wasn't cool, but there was no reasoning behind why I couldn't. As I said before she's always changed the subject in a way that leads me to believe that she doesn't actually have a reason and it's just so she feels like she has power over me. So AITA?

Note: I've brought up changing the agreement on multiple occasions but always get shut down. I'm never given the chance to explain my side. I never fought it too much because it would mean I'd have to fight her in court, which I really don't want to do. She has a knack for cutting off contact with people who she gets angry at, especially if they didn't do anything wrong (ex. my step-siblings that aren't allowed at her house) and going to court would definitely be cause to cut me off. She's still my mother and I want to be able to see her.",22,92,0.93

Whenever I have something he doesn't like, he constantly insults me and my parents have had arguments with ME over responding to him. I'm better than him when it comes to fighting but he fights like a weasel, basically just kicking, hitting, scratching and pulling hair. Whenever we do get into fights, he goes for my glasses first and I have lost many pairs thanks to him(at least 5). He has called me gay boy countless times, which really gets on my nerves because I know he gets it from my former friendship (I don't have anything against gay people). Another thing that happens when we fight is that he goes for my genitals and starts grabbing at and pulling them. He's also tried to get into my room when it's locked and, when I'm out, he goes snooping around to try and find stuff and I'm sick of it. He's also a pervert who, when I've had my dressing gown on, has actively tries to look at my genitals by looking under it and has also lifted it up to try to see them.

There's also been incidences in the past: When I was 2 and he was 4, I refused to wear a plastic building hat which was broken and he shoved me down the stairs. He's also shoved me down the stairs for something else but I can't remember what. He also almost broke my nose when he wasn't allowed to watch tv as I was watching 17-18 Newcastle vs Liverpool (the one with the Coutinho wonder goal). He's also a pervert as I was masturbating one day and he walked in as I ahem...

I'm also having surgery tomorrow morning on my two big toes and, over the past month since I've had my appointment, whenever I walk up the stairs, he's actively tries to rip both of the wounds open by slamming his hands into them.

I'm bringing all of this up as, last Friday, I was walking to the pub with my parents and younger brother and I made the comment to my mum. She said that I would be free to do it but what if he puts me in his will? She also said that, once she and my dad die, who's going to take care of him as she has to take care of my Uncle who's her older brother and first born. For reference, my mum is the youngest of three. Her brother, my uncle, is first born. I'm the middle child in my family, with an older and younger brother. So she mentioned that she has to take care of my uncle, which is when I mention to her that my younger brother could always take care of my older brother. She said that my decision is my decision in response.

So Reddit, WIBTA for going NC with my brother when I move out?

I rolled down my window, called him over, and asked him if he was *Claire and Rob's* tenant. I changed the names to see if he'd lie. He said yes, he was their tenant and off he went, back through their backyard gate and presumably inside.

715,Not the A-hole,"My sister has BPD and had whatever they’re calling a psychotic break now a couple months ago. She treated her husband terribly, and acted out when he told her he wanted a divorce. She acted like a demented child in an attempt to get her way and now the rest of the family is cleaning up her mess. She was in the hospital for a week then went to live at a treatment center where she will be for a while. She didn’t want to go and was basically forced. I’ve been really over her bullshit for a long time. My opinion is: mentally ill or not, abuse is abuse and she’s incredibly abusive and manipulative. I’m also angry that she’s “unable” to hear any negative feelings from anyone because she can’t handle it right now.

She has two young children that me and my mom are caring for. Her husband is around doing his part but works a lot. 

Last week my grandma fell and broke her hip. She’s in the hospital and will need to spend a while in a rehab center. On top of taking care of my niece and nephew I am also handling grandma. I picked out a rehab center and have everything set up. Well, apparently my mom told my sister about what’s going on. Last night I started getting texts from my sister (who I haven’t spoken to since her tantrum) asking why grandma is going to the rehab I picked out (because of a review she read online) saying she thinks she should go to this other one (45 minutes away). Then I get a call from my mom saying she got similar messages. My mom actually had the NERVE to say “maybe we should look into it so everyone agrees.”

Excuse me, WHAT?! Everyone completely agreed with what I had arraigned and it made the most sense (insurance, location, qualifications) and then someone who 1. will take no part in facilitating this or visiting grandma 2. is too crazy to take accountability for her own actions but apparently can take accountability for grandma? voices her opinion and we’re supposed to listen to it? I put in all that effort to make plans on top of everything else I’m doing, and she looks stuff up on her phone and we’re supposed to care?

Yeah, how about she come home and at least take care of her OWN kids and maybe I’d be willing to hear it but considering the circumstances I’m PISSED. I feel like you don’t get to have it both ways. Are you out of your mind right now or not? You can’t act like an adult and need to let other people handle your business while you get yourself together? Okay then stay in your lane. 

I told my mom if she chose to change our plans because of my sister, I would walk away from this entire situation. And I mean it. There has to be boundaries somewhere. My mom said I’m forcing her to disregard my sisters wishes even though it’s her grandma too because she can’t do all of this alone. I said, okay then bring her home and you guys can do it together? You can’t do that? Okay then, the people handling it call the shots.

Am I the asshole?",140,570,0.94
716,Asshole,"Now Im very anti bullying and into being compassionate, but! 

My sister is beginning to annoy the hell out of me. She perpetually complains about being single but does nothing to make any effort to meet guys.

She's not on social media, only goes to work and back home. On weekends she'll go to the movies with my parents or to the spa.

Since my wife and I live nearby we ask her to come chill with us and our friends (who she knows) on Fridays but she never ever does.

Last night there was a nice get together with lots of my single guy friends and I told her to come. She refused to because there was a woman who she has a disagreement with 5 years ago. Now I know this woman well, she's didn't give a rat's ass about my sister and will never try to avoid her because it's been so long and such a minor thing.

I'd understand if my sister had social anxiety or preferred online dating etc. But neither apply to her.

She's just very very lazy and hates putting effort into anything and/or changing up her routine.

My mom has two sisters who are very similar and they both are 45+ and still single.

I keep trying to break her out of her routine and meet ppl, yet she's too lazy to try.

Yesterday I got so annoyed I told her, this is why you're still single after all these years and you will probably be single for the rest of your life.

Btw nothing is wrong with being single it's just that she complains non stop about not finding good men.

Anyway, she got extremely mad and cussed me out, telling me I was a major asshole and I can't tell her what to do, she can make her own choices etc.

717,Not the A-hole," I'm a 19 year old guy living at my parents' house over the summer and at my college campus the rest of the time. I've never really needed to learn how to drive because we have a fairly cheap city bus in my hometown, which I used to get to high school. Well, now I'm going to college, and I have no mode of transportation except for the city bus. That's not a problem for me, because my job is on campus and we have a free shuttle downtown, which is where my doctor's office is. In the summer, when I live with my parents, I walk to my job, which I not only don't mind, I love doing.

But lately, I've been getting a lot of pressure to learn how to drive. I'll put my family's argument/side of the story here. They say that I'm 19, it's high time to learn, even though I don't necessarily need a car to get places. It's a useful skill, and better to learn sooner than later, because I won't be in the situation I am right now (not needing a car) forever.

I guess it's time for my side of things. So... there's something I didn't say in the first bit. I'm disabled. Not physically, mentally. I hate listing my diagnoses, so I'll just say the ones relevant as to why I feel it would be unsafe for me to drive. I have PTSD, and I get flashbacks randomly a lot, which can impair normal functions. My reasoning is that, if I get a bad flashback and I'm driving a car, I could cause an accident. And probably my most relevant diagnosis, and the one you might judge me for, is schizophrenia. I'm medicated, but even medicated, I have a very weak grip on reality. I have debilitating hallucinations. I've experienced them in cars before, as a passenger, and those are severe enough that I can only imagine how bad it would be for me to be the one driving. 

I really do feel like the asshole in this situation. I feel like I'm being a disappointment, and everyone in my family is angry at me because of it. They don't understand how severe my situation is. What do you all think?

TL;DR: My family wants me to drive so I can get around, and I'm refusing to learn because I feel my disabilities will cause me to be a danger to myself and others on the road.

718,Asshole,"My friends have been lying to each other about how they feel toward themselves for a long time now. Many use me as their confidant and tell me about their issues with one another and then return to our social gatherings as if nothing is wrong. After a while the unrest and infighting has grown to the point where we often don't see certain members of our circle as they need time to recover from associating with someone else.

When they had an issue with me, they made it public that they had an issue with me. I addressed their issues with me and adjusted how I carry myself so that they no longer have said issues. It has lead to them liking me more than how they like one another and some confiding in me.

6 years later, I have had enough of the infighting and made public to all of them the info they provided to me in a large diatribe calling each of them out on their bullshit. To which point all of them, including the confidants, did the equivalent of ""fuck you. You don't know me"" and blocked me.

So far, only one person, the friend I have known for the longest, has unblocked me apologizing for their reaction and they want to remain friends. They also want to rebuild the circle starting with me and another person we both trust.

My question is, Was I an asshole for airing their dirty laundry in the same way they did to me? If I used a softer handling, they would have swept it under the carpet with the 6 years of dust already under there. I understand that the truth hurts and lying is sometimes a safer option to keep friendships. But I refuse to lie to others because I'd rather have no friends than a bunch of fake ones.",17,47,0.8

725,Asshole,"Last year I was best man at my friend's wedding, where I gave a speech.

Unfortunately, my friend's marriage did not work out and they were divorced within 4 months.

Fast forward a few more months, and my friend is engaged (again) and set to marry someone new.

They will be hosting the wedding the same place as his last one, and inviting many of the same people who came last year.

I am best man again.

WIBTA if I gave the exact same speech as last year? (only replacing the name of the bride)

My friend has a good sense of humour, so he would probably take it in stride, but I've been told by some that what I'm doing is insensitive.

 

UPDATE: After reading through the many replies, I see how my actions might make me TA.

However, I feel like I did not provide enough context in my original post.

Many assumed that my friend's new fiancée has no relation to his ex-wife, but this is not the case.

His new fiancée was also present at his last wedding as one of his ex-wife's bridesmaids (funnily enough, she was also the one that caught the bouquet). But this is besides the point.

I brought up my idea with the both of them yesterday, and while they both found it a bit amusing, they suggested that I could reference the previous marriage (as a small joke), but would prefer that i wrote something new for them (which I will now do).

By popular suggestion, I will start the speech with ""Welcome back!"", but everything after will be new stuff. Thanks Reddit.",347,1952,0.97

729,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: best friend of almost 18 years ended our friendship the weekend that she was moving to Colorado and “starting her new life”. This was primarily because she said our values weren’t the same anymore & that I “wasn’t at the same spot” that she was essentially. She didn’t even think to bring this up until the Sunday prior to her going away party when I drunkenly texted her how much I love & appreciated her and our long lasting friendship... so we talk & I call her out for basically saying that she’s ending our friendship because I still have good friends from our hometown. She states that my friends shouldn’t be asking how she’s doing because “they’re not my friends” I say “they’re being nice? What’s wrong with that?” Anyways, after going back & forth I decide this isn’t worth it and that maybe we really don’t share the same values anymore so I tell her that I hope CO is everything & more for her and that I’m upset with how this ended but that I’ll always be around to listen if she ever needed it. Turns out a couple weeks after we ended things her cat got really sick (I truly didn’t think much of the cat but sad to see that her time was here & they had to let her go) she then reaches out to me saying “I know you probably don’t want to hear from me and you don’t HAVE to respond but no one gets how this feels except you”.... I didn’t respond because well, frankly I hated that she used that line when she had been promoting all of her other friends for “being HER people” and all this other petty shit so I just  didn’t respond ? Then she angrily texts me a day later saying how fucked up it was for me to not comfort her and I’m just ? I sat on this thought for awhile because all of my friends & even siblings said I wasn’t wrong for not answering when she acted out the way she did after we finished things. So for everyone who read up to this point, AITA?

EDIT: after reading through all the replies I see where the YTA responses are coming from. I truly did struggle with wanting to respond out of pure instinct to run to her side but stood back and thought about what I would do in a situation like hers? Our initial “breakup” was very hard on me. It made me second guess all of my friendships (new and old) because well if my BEST friend of almost 18 years could end it so abruptly then what’s stopping all of my other friendships? There were a lot of aspects I glazed over in our friendship & from how my life has turned since she got out of it- it’s gotten a lot better. She blocked me on all social media the day after I didn’t respond & she sent that followup text and my friends unfollowed her. (not my doing- they did it themselves out of loyalty to me) so I truly have no idea if she ended up succeeding in Colorado or how it’s going but I hope for her own happiness and leap of blind faith she is.",59,369,0.94
730,Asshole,"I’m sitting outside in my car writing this, currently waiting for my girlfriend to get out of church. 
As of the past couple weeks I’ve decided to go to this Catholic Church with my girlfriend, while having nothing against Catholicism it’s just not for me. I vocalized to my girlfriend that I’m not interested but I still manage to go with her. No harm done in attending.
Which brings us to today, I again told her how I felt and suggested different churches, and she just didn’t agree because she grew up on Catholicism. We go inside the church and it’s apparent I’m not in a good mood, but still participating. 
Everyone stands up, as to I didn’t feel like standing so I continued to sit. Then my girlfriend tells me if I don’t want to respect the church, to leave.

731,No A-holes here,"I’ve been attending a con this weekend and staying with some friends at a hotel. One friend that I’ll call Jack is one of the nicest people I’ve met. I’m not super close to him but Jack is known in his circle of friends to be one of the most loyal and generous people. 

This is my first time at the con and before it started, Jack said one of the rules is to shower “at least once a day”. And I’m thinking this is common sense (yeah I know this common sense is hard for a lot of con goers), and I honestly think he does shower every day because when he leaves the hotel room in the morning his hair is wet. 

But man, Jack stinks. I don’t know how else I’d describe it other than he emits a nightmare cocktail of scents. I’m not sure some of these scents have been discovered yet. This funk can be detected whenever he’s around and it’s unbearable. 

I’m not sure there’s a nice way to tell him. I’m not sure if it’s my place (like I said, not super close to him). I’m a pretty nice guy in person so I would try to go out of my way to do it in the nicest way possible, but yeah, would I be the asshole if I told Jack he smells?",122,375,0.96

733,No A-holes here,"My wife and I have been together for close to 10 years. For the majority of that time she has made more money than me. When we moved in together we split rent and utilities 50/50 and would usually split the bill when we went out to eat, or she or I would treat with about the same frequency.

When we got married we created a joint savings and and joint checking account. All of our bills and college loans get paid out of the joint checking. we also both contribute to the savings account to someday put a down payment on a house. We no longer split everything 50/50 and instead now contribute to these two accounts based on the percentage of what we take home. What ever is left from those contributions becomes our own pocket money that we can do what ever we want with.

Like I said for most of our relationship she has made more so splitting 50/50 could be argued affected me more. a similar argument could be made when we started doing by percentage of what we make. This never really bothered me as I thought it still made sense and while I am by no means wealthy I still usually had enough fun money that I didn't really feel an issue.

About 2 years ago my wife left her job to pursue something less lucrative and was now making less than me. We figured that we would continue to do things they way we had been and both still contribute to checking and saving based on percentage but we did have to change the percentage a little.

At this point I always have more money kicking around than she, she isn't hurting too much but I know sometimes she feels a pinch of not having more pocket money whereas I usually don't. She has never expressed an issue but it often feels like it is lying beneath the surface that I should be contributing or sharing more or that I could be doing more when she feels pinched for pocket money. 80-90% of the time we go out to eat I cover the bill, the remainder of times we go out either being we split or every now and then she will treat. Health insurance is also taken out of my check and I am the only one currently contributing to a retirement fund. 

I put extra money I have into a completely separate savings account mainly as an emergency fund type thing and she has expressed frustration about this in the past that I have my own saving account. She has her own as well however I don't think she contributes much if anything to it. My thinking is that I created this saving account out of my leftover percentage and while yes technically everything is ""ours"" this is a small pot of money that I feel is mine to determine what we do it and having money sitting around not doing anything gives me a sense of security.

I'll note that we do not own a house or have children and if we did my guess is that our current set up would change drastically. I supported her leaving her job and at this point I believe we have a system that is fair but I do sometimes feel guilty about it.

734,No A-holes here,"My husband Joe and I have been married for a few years. He has a teenage son, Jack, with his ex-wife Kim. Joe and I have a great relationship with Jack, who lives with us half of the time, and we are civil with Kim. 

For a couple of years now, Jack has been into a sport that I am also into, and last year he decided to train in that sport seriously. He has been doing very well so as a reward and to encourage him further I decided that for his birthday this month, I would buy him an important ‘equipment’ used in our sport. He has always wanted to own one himself and if things go well it will be with him for the next ten years so I know he will be very happy with it. 

Yesterday Kim called me and told me what gift she will be getting Jack (we do this now to avoid getting him the same gift, which has happened before). I told her that I got Jack the equipment for our sport. She was quiet for a while and then asked me if I could get another gift for Jack’s birthday and just give him the equipment in October.

Kim said that she knows Jack will absolutely love my gift, so if he gets my gift and her gift at the same time, her gift will be upstaged by mine and all of Jack’s attention will be on my gift. She said she has been saving for Jack’s gift for a while so she would like to see him be happy and thrilled about her gift, and that is not likely to happen if Jack receives our gifts at the same time. 

I understand where Kim is coming from, but to me it doesn't seem right to treat giving gifts to Jack as a competition for his attention or affections that we have to resort to ‘taking turns’.

736,Not the A-hole,"I'll try and keep it as neutral as possible. 

My son is almost a year old. My daughter is 2. My in laws live 20-30 minutes away from our house. They have 6 grandchildren with our son being the youngest. They are very involved with my nieces and nephews (aged 1-5), collecting my nephews from school at least once a week and looking after them overnight. What I'm getting at is that they are confident grandparents who are great with our nephews. The 5 year old particularly loves them to bits and they love him right back.

They dont see our kids that often. We invite them to breakfast or suggest meet ups rather than them suggesting. They have babysat our kids twice. 

The first time was at our place. We were gone 2 hours to a resteraunt down the road for my birthday. It was my suggestion to get MIL and FIL to babysit. They didnt change the babys nappy when he was upset and put him to sleep on the floor in a blanket rather than using his cot in his room (which has a monitor but I'm not sure they knew how to use it to be fair) or rather than using the pack n play which was in the same room next to the chair they sat on (albeit not set up).

This made me uncomfortable but I still wanted to go ahead for them to babysit the following week for our anniversary. My partner spoke to them about changing the baby and not waiting for us. They said they didnt want to change the baby because it might upset him more. 

The next babysitting session was at their house where they have lots of toys and games and where they host our 2 nephews weekly. I talked MIL through my sons change bag and she replied that she knew what she was doing. 

We had multiple messages while we were gone (2 1/2 hours this time) that the baby was crying. We came home as soon as we could (server messed up our meal and didnt put the ticket in - typical!) To find a sobbing baby. The baby was again in a wet diaper and in laws thought baby was crying due to teething so gave him HALF the dose of pain meds. They said they were too scared to give him the full dose as he is ""so small"" ( hes not - the pain med dose is set on age anyway and he was not preemie). 

I am not comfortable given these 2 incidents getting them to babysit again because 
1 - they didnt change my son either time he needed it
2 - they were scared to give him the correct dose of pain meds and I dont know how they would cope were there a more serious issue. 

My partner suggested I post here to see if I am being unreasonable so - AITA?

737,Not the A-hole,"So my sister is married and although their marriage is kind of rocky, that's not why I suggested she join the app.  She has a hard time making friends because she can be a little socially awkward and dramatic, and she was telling me one day how she felt sad she didn't have any friends.  She would probably consider me her only friend...besides my mom.  Anyway, I remembered a dating app that also can be used to find friends... female friends.  I suggested it not thinking she would actually download it.  Well anyway, fast forward to last night and I get a text from her husband with a picture of the description of the app as a dating app and him saying that my sister downloaded it because of me.  I said yes, and that it was merely for her to make friends.  I also found a description of the app where it has the three modes listed, one specifically for finding potential friends, so I sent it to him.

He responds back that he's going to go join a different dating app to find friends too, obviously meaning women.  At this same time, I am getting texts from my sister telling me thanks for telling her to download the app because now her husband won't talk to her and before that was yelling at her.  Apparently he also left the house.  He said he's not stupid and knows why people join apps like that and it's not to find friends.  I was seriously so confused by his reaction and that he couldn't understand my intention was to just help her connect with female friends she could hang out with, again, I didn't even think she'd download the app in the first place.  My sister continued to text me mean things, saying I've ruined her whole weekend.  I apologized and said it was not my intention for him to get upset and I obviously wasn't encouraging her to cheat.  I also texted him that I would never encourage her to cheat nor do I think she would ever cheat on her own anyway.  So am I the asshole for suggesting she download the app to find female friends?

Edit:  To clarify, it is the Bumble app which can be used as both dating and finding friends.  When I asked my sister if she had set up a profile, she said she had and put it on FRIEND mode.

He spends the majority of his free time in his bedroom, smoking pot and playing games on his PC. About twenty hours a week is spent outside of this setting, either working at the fast food restaurant he's employed at or shopping for junk food at the grocery. He doesn't help clean, do laundry, cook, or complete any other chores around the household. And while I know this shouldn't have any bearing on the situation, he started identifying as a woman about eight months ago. Aside from growing out his hair and occasionally wearing dresses, I've yet to see him attempt to do anything else that would be considered feminine (ie. wear makeup, shower more frequently, etc.) The reason I bring this up is because it makes my mom uncomfortable to be around, but she's a very timid person that tries her best to avoid conflict. All this in mind, I gave up years ago on trying to convince my brother to strive for something more, or to seek financial independence from our mom. It doesn't help that she enables him too, but that's a different story.

A few days ago I stopped by my mom's home to drop off a lawnmower I'd had paid someone to repair for her. We were sitting in the kitchen, talking, when my little brother walked in to grab a drink out of the fridge. I made a comment out loud that now that the lawnmower was fixed, maybe he could start doing some yard work tomorrow. Cue him immediately blowing up on me, asking why I always had to start shit when I visited.

I started yelling back, eventually telling him that he was a freeloading mooch that uses his transgender persona as a ploy to gain sympathy from strangers. At this point we were both in each other's faces, and my mom threatened to call the police unless I left, which I did.

I talked to my mom on the phone yesterday and she said my little brother was still very upset about our fight.

I just started college as a freshman at an art school and they gave us the option to join dorms that had our interests and find people to live with who are like us. Our dorm is like an apartment, with two rooms that two people share. The rooms are a bit small but the living room is a big empty space with a couch and a sad little table. 

Me and 2 other girls got put into this dorm for gamers and then we had a guy as our 4th so they had to switch us for this last girl very quickly. She's nothing like us, which wouldn't be an issue if she wasn't how she is. 

The first issue that I had with her was the fact that she had the heat on in the dorm, but she got a heater for herself and that got worked out. 
The school has a wall in each dorm that they specifically let us draw on, it's strange but I like it. The 3 of us are illustration majors while this girl is a photography major. We started drawing on our wall and this girl made a fit about it, saying how we didn't ask if she'd be okay with it. 

She had a 'meeting' with us where she complained that we made the living room a 'gaming room' because my roommate brought her monitor out and plugged in my switch and we played super smash bros one night. It was super fun to me

This girl has had friends over but complains when I have mine over, and I heard her talking to her friends about us. I have a class with one of her friends and he just kinda gives me weird looks the whole time. When me and my roommate were walking, her friends were sitting on a bench talking and when we walked by they all stoped talking and gave us weird looks again. 

She's vegan, and yesterday sent a long message about how when we make meat we need to clean extremely well for her in the kitchen and stuff, which I understand but it was just so annoying how she she wrote it. 

Well, last night I bought a fluffy black rug for the living room in our dorm. I thought it would look nice because of the big empty space. This girl went OFF. she said black is ugly and hides dirt, and I should have consulted everyone when getting a rug. I got this rug because me and the two other roommates went to Target and she didn't wanna come with, and when we saw rugs we thought it would be cool to get one for the living room. When I was out, I picked one up with everyone's happiness in mind. I told her ""nobody consulted me over the dish soap"" and left. That was probably a bad thing to say but I was mad and sad.

She sent me a long text this morning about how I'm nasty for the soap and the black rug and immature and all these things. I'm just hurt honestly, but maybe I'm the asshole and she's reasonable.

Am I the asshole?

Update: I walked into the living room yesterday to the rug rolled up in a ball, so I just decided to put it in a corner as I didn't want to cause more drama. I sent her a message apologising and asking if we could talk like adults and she's been blatantly ignoring me and being very friendly in our roommate group chat as well as to the others in general. It's hard to just let this go as it makes me feel like trash. I genuinely miss living alone.

Edit: I emailed the RA for my floor and he and i talked about the issues I was having, hopefully we'll have a dorm meeting with an RA to help and if she wants there's an option for her to move to a different dorm

744,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Looking to get other people’s opinions because I am at a loss as to what to do. 

My bf and I are in university and they often run a couple weekend trips throughout the semester. One of these trips is this beach trip that he and I look forward to every year. There’s this really cool arcade we like to go in that area and it’s really the only time we get to go because the trip is about 2 hours for us. And plus it’s like only $5 to go because they provide transportation to and from the beach. 

However this beach trip lands on the same day as this family party. Now, as far as I can tell, there is no reason for this party happening. No birthday, nothing. It’s just like a giant get together. My extended family has this horrible habit of turning everything into a tradition and passive-aggressively guilting you if you don’t want to participate every year. 

Originally I had sort of agreed that I would go with a “I think I’ll be free,” not realizing the date for the party. And then when I found out, I told my mom that I wouldn’t be able to go because that’s when my bf and I would be going on this beach trip (although we hadn’t paid the $5 fee yet; we were going to do that this week). My mom basically said that she would be “disappointed” if I didn’t go. 

WIBTA if I went on a beach trip with my bf instead of going to this family party?

Update: My mom and I talked about the situation more. We figured out a compromise that would allow me to go to the beach with my bf while being able to go the party. Sorry if this seemed like a validation post.",19,33,0.82
745,Not the A-hole,"This is kind of petty, but it’s a hot topic in my family at the moment. Thought I’d get the internet to weigh in. 

My father is a groundskeeper at a school with a pool. The other day while cleaning, he found an egg near the pool. We’re pretty sure it’s a duck egg because the pool attracts ducks, but we can’t be completely sure. He brought the egg home. 

My mother went “hey! An egg!” And baked it into a brownie slice. My mother makes good brownie slices, so everyone else seems cool with eating it. However, I do not feel cool with eating it because I don’t know where that egg came from. My mother has taken it as an insult to her cooking decisions. 

The brownie was baked for like 45min so I’m pretty sure the egg will be more or less sterilised in there, but I can’t get over the idea of eating the random egg. What if it had been out there for a while? What if it was fertilised? 

AITA for wanting to eat the random egg brownie? Do I need to just accept the random egg and eat it? Am I justified?

The brownie is currently cooling overnight for dinner tomorrow, so there’s about 18 hours to influence my decisions.

UPDATE: thank you to everyone who weighed in. You convinced all of my family not to eat the mystery egg brownie except for my mother. She is a bit mad but is happy to have the whole thing to herself.",186,642,0.94

753,Asshole,"Gf (39F) and I (35M) have been together for about a year and a half. We live apart and spend nights together when we can. Unfortunately, we end up spending most nights apart. We have both said we don't like this. However, being busy professionals, we deal with it.

GF got a new job in the spring as a project manager for a shipping association. She's been putting together industry events, organizing tours for various ships, etc. These events almost always occur away from our home city. Some of them are quite far away (travel by plane), but others have been in driving distance (around an hour).

On the occasion that the event has been closer, I've asked if she could consider staying at home or if I could drive up and stay with her. She's always refused. Her reasoning is that she's going to be way too busy with work, and will just be crashing at the hotel (or place she's staying).

Recently, an event she was organising came up in our city. Two weeks before it, she let me know that she would be staying at the event site. I asked her why, as the city transit goes there, and all together we're talking maybe 30-35 minutes door to door. I got the usual response. I asked if I could come and stay with her, she said no. I dug further and asked about the plans in the evening. The first night she says she'll be working late setting up, but then her portion will finish, so she doesnt need to worry about tear down. I ask her why is she staying there for an additional two nights, then? It comes out there are social events those nights. Events I'm not invited to. I say fine, doesn't feel great, but then can she please just come back home after the parties rather than stay at the site? She says no, she has to be back at the event in the mornings.

I got upset.

I pointed out it takes longer for me to get to work from her apartment than it would for her to get to the event, and yet I do this all the time. I pointed out that none of this is a reason I couldn't come stay with her. I pointed out she could just leave the social portion before it was 2AM and get a good night's sleep if she wanted. I pointed out we dont spend that much time together as is. I pointed out I am NEVER (not an exaggeration) invited to anything to do with her new job, when I am very conscientious to invite her to everything in the hopes she'll make it.

Her response was to question why I can't just support her, and that this is what she feels she needs to be successful. I told her I would like to support her but these decisions seem less about work and more about socializing and convenience and they don't make me feel valued in the relationship. I told her she needs to be more open to compromise.

So, in an effort not to vent to family and friends, I ask you Reddit, AITA? Should I just support her and her planning, or am I right to feel unimportant and ask for compromise?",35,55,0.86

They left to go to the living room but my sister came back shortly to get her makeup bag. I asked her when she was leaving(she mentioned earlier that she was going out with friends). She said she was waiting on her other friend to pick her and Tyler up and then they'd leave.

767,Not the A-hole,"I recently got a pretty large tattoo on my forearm of a pair of Japanese Okame and Hyottoko masks that were in my great grandmothers room. I fucking love the way they turned out and I even loved the tattoo artist so much I decided I'm going to go back in a few weeks to get another tattoo. The next tattoo is going to be another original idea, something that has to do with my epilepsy. I was diagnosed with complex partial seizures when I was nine years old and have really struggled to live a normal life so I really fell in love with this idea.

My boyfriend came with me to get the tattoo, and although he had been thinking of getting something for himself he had absolutely no idea what he wanted or where. Not to mention he had a budget of only around $100. I was telling him over and over that he should just wait and really think about it because 1. it's permanent (duh) and 2. he literally has all the time in the world to think of something. He was asking the artist questions the entire time I was getting my tattoo like how much would this cost, and does he have any sketches of this so the guy kept having to take breaks to answer and explain. We ended up leaving without him getting a tattoo.

The past few days since then he has been non-stop sending me things that he is ""seriously considering"" getting tattooed. And they are all completely different from each other. He is searching for something to get without letting it come to him naturally. I know it isn't for me to decide what he gets on his body, but isn't it my responsibility to tell him when he isn't making a logical decision? I have tried to send him things for inspiration and asking him about what's important to him to help him decide but I still don't get what the rush is.

Anyway, after telling my boyfriend about the tattoo I'm getting for epilepsy awareness he tells me how much he really loves that idea and design. A couple hours later, he tells me he thinks he's decided on a tattoo and it's for his mom's lupus. When he described it it was basically the same idea as my tattoo. The color for epilepsy awareness is even the same as the lupus ribbon! Don't get me wrong I love the idea of him getting a family tattoo, but if he gets this tattoo I don't think I can get mine anymore, which was going to be really important to me. Honestly I think he is still only picking this idea because he hasn't thought of anything better, because his mother is actually really religious and against tattoos. After creating the image of the tattoo I want in my head I really see it looking great and would love to get it, but I just don't think I can have almost the same tattoo as my boyfriend that pretty much stole my idea.

I just finished my bachelor’s degree early and put myself through school with scholarships.

Last fall, we began noticing that Julie didn’t seem to really enjoy being around Joe whenever we were out. She would seem to actively avoid him, talk to our other male friends frequently, and get pretty touchy with them. She kissed one of our friends one night out, but nothing was ever said to her as no one else saw and it was just so bizarre. Shortly after this, my friend Sam (23F) and I found out from Julie that she had cheated on Joe (one night stand) shortly after they had moved to our city with someone we didn’t know, but deeply regretted it and felt guilty about it. At this point, Sam and I were debating having an intervention with Julie/Joe as it seemed she didn’t want to be tied down by him, but we didn’t want to butt into their relationship, and she seemed regretful of the cheating. 

Shortly after all this, we got quite busy with school, and drunk Julie seemed to calm down. She did start hanging around a guy who isn’t in our friend group and we somewhat suspect she was cheating on Joe with him (saw them grabbing coffee, hanging out), but we have no concrete evidence that anything occurred between them. He seemed cold to her last month when we were all at a party together, so if anything was happening, we suspect it’s over now.

So for the past 8ish months, everything has seemed great with Julie and Joe. They’re excited about their wedding, and Julie wasn’t getting nearly as touchy or doing anything suspect at the few parties we’ve had. Then this past weekend, we were all at a house party, and Julie got quite drunk. She was very touchy and complimentary towards the friend she had kissed in the fall (“Wow, you’re so attractive ____”). After this, while sitting at a table, Sam saw Julie put her foot on another of our friends lap and rub his crotch area with her foot for a while- all while sitting at the table next to her fiancée. Later on, that friend who she was touching had his arm around Julie, Joe saw and got upset. They had an argument where she apologized repeatedly, and then the rest of the night they were in separate rooms. 

My friend Sam and I are very apprehensive about what to do next. It’s not our business, but we feel as though Joe, who were not great friends with, should know what’s going on.

My grandma looks at two shirts with me and she wants to buy them for me as a special gift so we head towards the tills.

One till is a brunette girl with a semi long line of six to seven people, the second till behind her as only one person being rung through. Naturally we go to the second till (especially since the sooner I can get my grandmother out of the line the better). 

Suddenly the cashier at the till tells us we have to first line up at the semi long line then we can be redirected here. Not a big deal and fair right?

So we start walking around to the line and two people walk right up to her till (they were not in the first line!) straight from the back of the store, and she starts running them through. Before anyone asks no it was not some members only till or you had to have below 5 items till or something, it was a regular till. 

I'm pretty annoyed to see that she for absolutely no reason is sending us to the longer line while two more people just walk up and are getting rung through. I ask her why we have to wait in the long line while literally three more people just get to keep walking up no wait at all and just get through. And she just ignores me.

You'd think if you were to let anyone go through a shorter line you would let a 79 year old go through and not just some random fully able bodied people?

I‘ve never worn makeup for other special occasions even as a bridesmaid for other weddings (albeit where the bride was less of a “bridezilla.”) I don’t own any makeup products as I find it extremely uncomfortable both physically and in a self-concious way.

On occassion she can be pretty forgetful and one of my main points of contention with this involves the house keys. As an example, she will often forget her key at home when she leaves the house (door locks behind us when exiting) and call me to let her in. This is usually not a problem and I've only had to go out of my way to do this a couple of times. 


The issue this post is about has happened a few times over the last year. She will come home and  leave her keys hanging on the outside of the front door. I exclusively use the back door and would not notice this at all. This basically has left the door accessible over 24 hours each time (after she gets home, overnight, all day the next day until she gets home at night and realises she left the key in the door). Everytime this happens I let her know it's unsafe and not to do it again and she laughs it off apologetically.


This came to a head when I was home and another friend of mine was coming over for dinner and was able to let themselves in. I had a minor panic before I realised it was my friend but my concerns about a stranger letting themselves in were now heightened. I took the key now that I was aware and let her know again. She came home later that night and asked me to let her in after laughing it off but acknowledged it was her bad.


Since words haven't worked I've had the following idea: Out of concern I have started using the front door. WIBTA if the next time I find a key left outside the door I bring it inside and not let my housemate in when she calls. I'd just let her sit outside and be mad. She has the option of calling our property manager for the spare key. Id consider letting her back in before that happens as to not inconvenience the property manager. My goal is to just be an inconvenient dick to get the message across. Now yes, she would be mad, but she understands that I am unhappy with the safety issue and it wouldn't ruin our relationship. 


Any other suggestions are welcome if this is too assholish.",24,30,0.95
779,Not the A-hole,"This has been weighing on my husband and I for a few months. 2 years ago, we went to a local breeder and got a puppy. She's been a big part of our lives and we love her so much. She’s had health issues over the past couple of years but nothing we couldn't manage- we had a dog walker come three times per week as well to help with minor separation anxiety while we work. Six months ago we had our first child. A few months after that, we found out that our 2 year old dog is in stage 2 kidney failure and based on imaging, it's a fatal prognosis. Our vet said we had anywhere from a few months to two years depending on how fast it progresses. Luckily, it doesn't seem to be moving as fast as feared. 

Unfortunately, with a new baby and both working full-time, we do not have the time or the resources for long-term care for our dog. She needs regular vet check ups, expensive food, 3-4 medications per day, the occasional emergency visit from her nausea, and is partially incontinent. She would also need a dog walker every work day due to not being able to hold it all day. She has good days and bad days, as to be expected. We don't have a lot of time off at our jobs and we used almost all of it for the birth of our child. 

After spending $2000 in the past three months and 10+ vet appts, we ultimately realized this is not something that we can do long term so worked with our vets office to find a medical foster home in our community that would be willing to take her. It's a retired older couple with a dog of the same breed who have more land, are home all day, and can give her the medical care that she needs. 

We love our dog and want her to spend the remainder of her days happy and getting the most from her life that she can. We have been forced to crate her while we work due to her accidents and having a baby that's crawling. We want her to live the remaining year or so of her life the best she can. We feel like assholes though because it feels like we didn't do enough for her. So, AITA?",56,51,0.88

781,Not the A-hole,"We (SO and I) got invited to a wedding a while ago. It's in two weeks. We RSVP'd yes, arranged for a sitter, bought a gift - in other words, we're all set to go.

A week ago we get an e-mail (mass e-mail sent to all guests) from the bride and groom announcing there will be no phones allowed at the wedding. We will have to check them before the ceremony, and we'll get them back after the reception when we leave. Phones will be 100% secure and they'll take responsibility for their safety. Bride and groom don't want phones at their wedding because they don't want people taking pics/video and posting to social media before they do, and without their approval.

Neither I nor SO are big social media people. We each have only one account (the one mostly old people use - ahem), and SO never checks his, and I opened mine only a year ago. Posting pics of the wedding isn't something we'd do (and the bride and groom know this).

The problem is this: I can't check my phone. Firstly, I use it for work and it has confidential information on it that I have an obligation to safeguard, and secondly, while I am not a doctor, I do get emergency calls that I have to be available to answer. Also, we need to have a way for the sitter to communicate with us while we're at the wedding in case of an emergency. SO has no problem leaving his phone at home or in the car, but I have to have mine with me.

I think my options are: (1) sneak the phone in, leave it on silent, and check it when no one will see me; (2) e-mail the bride and groom and explain my situation, promise not to take any pics/video and to keep my phone out of sight, and ask if they'll consider making an exception; or (3) not go. I don't like any of them, and I think choosing any of them would make me TA.

Help!

EDIT: I should have added a fourth option, which would be going to the wedding, being honest about having the phone, then refusing to check it. Which, I think, would definitely make me TA. Or maybe not?

EDIT No. 2: A number for the venue/an emergency number outside the venue isn't an option for me. Outside of business hours, work emergencies come directly to my cellphone, which clients call directly. There is no way to get an emergency number to everyone who might need to reach me.",274,422,0.96

783,Not the A-hole,"My sister home schools her children because she's very religious and doesn't like the kids exposed to secular stuff she thinks is evil.  They also aren't allowed to watch TV or movies, except for VeggieTales DVDs and stuff like that.

Their oldest kid, let's call him Jaden, had to stay with my parents a couple of evenings when my sister had to work night shifts and they couldn't arrange a sitter. I came to visit and my parents had him watching Monster Squad.  I mentioned that my sister probably wouldn't appreciate this, but my dad loved the movie when he was a kid and says it wouldn't do him any harm - he doesn't really approve of how those kids are being raised.  Jaden was fascinated with the movie, never having seen anything like that, and after the movie he kept talking about monsters, especially the Wolf Man.  He asked me if I had ever heard of werewolves, and I said yeah, and I knew all kinds of stuff about them.

I told him there were two kinds, that there were people who are turned into them by being bitten by one, and some people are born werewolves.  He asked if there were baby werewolves, and I said no, that they turn into werewolves when they get to be about his age.  Here's where I really screwed up, I don't know how I got the idea, but I told him that when people turn into werewolves they can tell because they start growing hair on their privates.  I thought he'd think it was funny (he rolled on the floor laughing at the ""wolfman has nards"" part) but he apparently just absorbed the knowledge.

I had mostly forgotten about it until a few months later I got a call from my mother.  Dad apparently told Jaden not to tell his mom about the movie they watched, and he hadn't, but then he started freaking out and telling my sister and her husband they needed to tie him up at night because he was becoming a werewolf, and he finally broke down and told them he knew he was becoming a werewolf because he was getting hair ""down there."" 

Now my sister is saying Jaden can't be around me or my parents, since they let him watch that movie, and my sister said I'm a pervert because I talked about privates with a kid, she won't even talk to me.  My mom is super mad at me and blaming me for her not getting to be around her grandkids.

Am I the asshole here?  It was just a dumb joke and if they didn't shelter their kid so much and let him have a normal upbringing he would have realized I was joking. I don't think it's fair for my mom to blame me for my sister's reaction, it was dad who put on that movie and I even told them at the time I didn't think my sister would like that.",137,460,0.97
784,Everyone Sucks,"So, just a little bit of a backstory here.  I live in a pretty quiet area with my wife and two kids.  It's usually a nice area with great people around except for this one house a few rows over.  I am typing this on a phone and English is my first language so feel free to criticize my writing.

Anyways, this is the first weekend that my wife and I haven't had our kids in a while.  The grandparents took them for a two night stay.  Needless to say, the wife and I were pretty ecstatic to be... alone...  Well starting around 8am that neighbor a few rows over decided to start playing country music extremely loudly.  This isn't exactly a rare occurrence and so I didn't think much of it.  We're in the South so theres plenty of people who'll work on trucks or do yard work with some music playing over speakers.  It'll last for a couple of hours and die down.

At noon, this dude is still blaring his music.  The wife and I are a bit tired of hearing the bass reverberating through our house so we decide to escape for lunch.  We hit up a pizzeria and then a soda shop for dessert.  All in all it was a pretty good outing.  Sadly, after making it home at 3pm, this guy is still playing his country music and now has some friends over.

This has been going on all day so at 7pm I decided that I've had enough.  Maybe I'm just a jerk, an asshole or the neighbor broke me down, but I snapped.  I pulled out a sound system set it up in the backyard and pointed straight as the neighbor.  All that was left was to decided what a country music loving, good ol' southern boy would hate to listen to.

Pink Fong's Baby Shark and Animal Songs seemed like a good choice.

So yeah, for the past hour I've been blasting Baby Shark and other kid songs in the direction of my neighbor.  Am I the asshole?

Edit:  one thing that I didn't clarify earlier is that the neighbor playing the country music is shady to say the least.  In the nearly two years I've lived here, the cops have been at the house at least half a dozen times.  I did not discuss the volume of his music with him directly because I have an aversion to being stabbed.

Edit numero 2:  I did clear my actions with my fellow direct neighbors before starting just as a courtesy of those near me.  They are also fed up with the country playing house.  We've turned it into a bit of a game at this point.  Per popular requests, I've played Barbie Girl, Call Me Maybe, some Infected Mushrooms songs, some Cradle of Filth songs, and VeggieTales.",24,47,0.94
785,Not the A-hole,"I have two sons (ages 20 and 17) from my first marriage and two daughters (4 and 3) from my second. There is obviously a significant age gap between the kids. Despite that, my sons have been pretty good brothers and the girls adore them.

However, my husband has noticed that my older son (V) calls the girls his sisters and the other (O) uses the term ""half-sister."" He wants O to stop this and just call them his sisters, because it's ""too confusing"" or ""cheapening their relationship."" 

When it was very casually brought up, O said that it's just a habit, not anything out of hate. He also mentioned that it's important to him that the girls understand their father is not *his* father (they've asked why my sons call their dad by his first name, for example). It's particularly sensitive as my sons' father died unexpectedly a couple of years ago, so it's not like the girls see the boys going back and forth between houses or anything.

I don't think it's a huge deal, and my son's reasoning seemed fine. He isn't unkind or cruel to the girls, and they haven't said anything about it (even though he's definitely said it in front of them). It is simply a fact, and many of their friends have blended families of all kinds, so the idea of a half-sibling isn't going to be anything that singles them out in any way in our community.

But my husband brought it up *again* today and says that I'm going to be creating major issues in the relationship between the kids if I don't put a stop to it now, especially as O will probably be leaving for college (or whatever he chooses to do) next year. Husband wants all the kids to feel like they're ""on the same team"" even though they won't all live together.

He told me he bought a ticket until mid September and I told him that I thought it was fine.

A few weeks pass. He goes to work and starts going to parties on weekdays. His room is a mess and starts bringing food to his room and leaving a bunch of garbage in there. I told him to clean up multiple times to not avail. On his third week he is told he is fired. Although his boss was far from great, he also made a bunch of really stupid mistakes and kept behaving like a teenager at work.

I'm not using a throwaway since I don't expect this to exactly incriminate me. 

I love wine. I love most types of alcohol, which is why I work as a bartender, but I especially love wine. A few months ago, I met a bunch of new people at a wine tasting for people ""in the business"" (for lack of better phrasing), joining them on a few after-works and becoming fast friends. I am significantly younger than most of them, by 7 or 8 years at least, but I really do enjoy hanging out with them. 

One of them, a guy I'll call Brendan, turned 29 a few days ago. I wasn't able to attend his actual celebration, but we made plans to have dinner at his place, have a few drinks, watch tv, and hang out with his beautiful, good good dog. 

I had a fairly expensive bottle of wine from my modestly sized collection: A Grace Family Cabernet Sauvignon, from 2013. These go for about 300-400 dollars, and there are only 600-700 cases made every year. There's also a waiting list, which is why I normally would never have gotten my hands on one: My brother in laws grandfather let me buy one from him at a discount as a graduation present when I was 18.

I figured that drinking wine is best to do with wine lovers, and brought it to cork open after dinner, and we finished it between us over episodes of WILTY. It tasted pretty fantastic.

I left at about 1 am, thinking that I had had a wonderful evening.

The next day, I got a text from Brendan, saying that whilst he appreciated the wine and enjoyed it, he thought that it was incredibly rude of me to drink from a bottle I gave to someone else, and that a gift wasn't meant to be shared with the giver. He said it was disingenuous of me, and that I was really just giving it to myself. 

I was taken aback by this, and have been kind of agonising over it these last few days, especially since we don't know each other very well and I really want them to like me.

I proceed to go outside and mow the lawn, just as I have my entire life. After I do the front yard I mow the back. On the way back to the garage to drop off my lawn mower, my neighbor approached me. 

This is how the conversation went:

Me: ""Hey, how's it going?""

Neighbor: ""Could you not blow your grass onto my lawn please""

Me: ""I have no control over where the mower puts out its grass.""

Neighbor: ""Can you mow side to side? 

*\*Our houses are 15ft from each other, he wants me to mow side to side all the way along where our properties meet.\**

Me: ""You want me to mow side to side all the way across there?""

Me: ""Well, I have never blown grass into your lawn!""

Neighbor: ""Then whoever""

First off, I do not have a bag for my mower, because it mulches. It does not blow grass anywhere, it simply mulches it and drops it as you move along further. The grass was pretty long as I said so I was leaving some mulch pockets, but nothing in his yard.

801,Not the A-hole,"Been lurking on reddit for ages without an account, finally made one for this post. 

So I [22M] have a 5yo daughter. Her mum and I aren't together any more, but we share custody 50/50 (she does a week at mum's, a week at mine, so on). Today, I took she and my little stepbrother [12M] to the cinema to to and see Toy Story 4. After we came out of the film, my little girl started complaining that she needed the toilet really badly. She claimed she'd needed to go for ages but didn't want to miss any of the film so she held it. 

This particular cinema is a very small independent local one, and it doesn't have any kind of ""family bathroom"" or gender neutral option available. Now, in this situation I'd usually just nip my daughter into one of the cubicles of the men's toilets. Except here's the issue; there's only one stall in this men's room at this cinema, and my brother had seen when he'd been in before the film that it was out of order. I asked if she could hold it til we got home, and she said no. Obviously I didn't want her to wet herself, so I told her to run into the ladies really quick and I would wait right outside. 

She went in and came out a short while later accompanied by a very angry woman who basically yelled at me that I was an irresponsible father and didn't I know what could've happened and I should be ashamed of myself. I tried explaining but she didn't want to hear it. Idk I can see why it was a stupid move but it was the only conceivable one, really, given the circumstances.

802,Not the A-hole,"So a bit of back story, I (33F) live alone in a 4 story walk up & have a few creepy neighbors (I know, how's it possible with a building so small? You'd be amazed...anyways). Our building is one of those buildings with front door, a mail room lobby & then second door to get into the actual building (only outsides require keys).

This one neighbor(65-80M) in particular has ALWAYS made me uncomfortable. He has a habit of trying to force people into long conversations with him (he explained one time that he does this for entertainment). He's generally annoying outside of this as well but this is my main issue. 

I've learned how to exit a conversation abruptly fairly well due to this, so I thank him for that, except the other day. I was coming back home when I see said neighbor doing god knows what to the front lawn adjacent the front door entrance. My headphones in, trying to pretend like I can't hear, to avoid getting into one of his endless convos . Sadly, he springs into action getting to the front door before me opening it letting me in behind him. Before I have the chance to get through the second door & make my escape he physically blocks it. I mean literally physically places his forearm on the door with his body in the way. Imagine one of those cliche poses of a guy leaning against a wall trying to look cool while hitting on someone type of pose. 

I look at him with a look that clearly displays both my annoyance and dismay at the realization at what he's doing. My facial expression now showing sheer aggravation he starts with his usual ""Ya know what?...."" expecting the answer of, ""no....what?""... 

Except this time, I couldn't take it. Something fucking broke guys. Like no joke. I guess the build up of having to see him walking shirtless around the building, having to listen to him bitch & complain, & gossip about other neighbors & our landlord, or him trying to start endless conversation with me, once with his shirt off & button of his jeans undone, & endless other utter fucking nonsense from him, just broke me. I told him, ""I don't fucking care. Now get out of my fucking way"" pulled the door open with force getting him to move. A look of complete & utter shock lay across his face. I didn't care.

Now that the anger has subsided, I see there was another less abrasive method of handling this situation - I could have (& will next time he pulls this stunt) simply used the front front door to exit the building & walk around to the back entrance. Or I could have simply kept my cool also, but alas, here we are. 

Now I know he's TA most of the time, but was ITA in this situation?

This would work out because we were traveling to California that weekend for my daughters first birthday party (that’s where all of our family is) and then we could just drive from Vegas instead of making 4 separate 6 hour drives. Then we realized that we could not afford a dog sitter for 6 days, and my daughter and I would just stay home and take the dog to CA with us. I was fine with this.  

My husbands coworker (who wasn’t attending the conference- she’s front desk) asked if my daughter and I were going to Vegas. My husband said no and told her why. That’s when she said “oh man I would love to watch your dog!! I’d do it for free!” My husband asked if she was sure and told her how many days it would be. she confirmed that she would love to, saying that when she was at work her boyfriend would help. This was great because our income is tight, we had been saving up to be able to afford the trip to California for my daughters first birthday so all of our family could come since I didn’t expect 30+ people to travel to Arizona for her birthday. We stayed with my in-laws. All we had to pay for was the gas and party supplies, and my mom covered like half of the party supplies.

We get back from our trip and are driving back from picking up our dog and I text her again to thank her. she replies back with a text saying “so we never discussed payment- how much were you thinking”  I was caught really off guard since she was the one who offered to do it for free to begin with. I texted back “oh I hadn’t thought about it since the initial  discussion you said you wouldn’t expect payment” she responded with “oh well I was thinking like $40” I thought that was fair enough and didn’t want to make a big stink of it so whatever, I’ll take it out of our grocery money, I’ll shop at the 99 cent store this week.

I finally get it unfolded and idk what they did with it but the front panel was warped and bent so the bottom tray couldn’t come out and the door wouldn’t close properly. Like at all. This would have to be intentional because these crates are not easy to bend. I texted the coworker and asked if there had been any incident with the crate. She said “well I know boyfriend had trouble getting it folded up before you guys got there but other than that no” we then sent her pictures of the damage. I told her I wouldn’t be able to pay her because we had to buy a new crate-  crates are like $60.  

Am I the asshole for refusing to pay the dog sitter after a. She offered to do it for free and b. Wrecked the dog crate so it’s practically unusable

Update: she called me and apologized for the damage, said that she wouldn’t expect us to pay after that",72,366,0.96

806,Not the A-hole,"Seeing the buzz around WoW Classic, I felt some intense nostalgia and decided to log into my Blizzard/WoW account after a  7+ year absence. After some issues logging in and a Blizzard support ticket, I found out that my account has been in use during my 7+ year hiatus. 

Found out one of my ex friends who somehow had access to my account when I quit has been using it since I quit. I can see the transaction history of his payments for subscriptions. I decided to change the password, phone number, email, contact details, payment methods,  security questions, etc. as well as add the authentication feature. 

Here’s where I feel conflicted: He created new characters in various realms and leveled them to 120 with tons of gold and items. He still kept my old main characters roughly where they were at when I quit,  but he did strip them of gold and deleted or transferred some of my old characters. Or at least changed their names/races or transferred servers.

I do not know this guy anymore, like at all: have not talked to him in years, he doesn’t know my phone number, we’re not connected on any social media, and I live in a new state. Should I try to reach out to him and offer to transfer his characters? I admit it’s kind of a dick move to take over this account but he did it to me first, without my consent. FYI, My name was actually still on the account for the first & last name! 

I vaguely remember logging into my account at his house. It's possible I may of even allowed him to play my characters in the time period between quitting but with my subscription still active for a few more weeks. It's been so long it's kind of difficult to know for certain. To be clear: I do NOT remember giving him explicit permission to use my account in entirety or mess around with my characters",682,5170,0.96

Yesterday (which happened to be our ""three month anniversary"" apparently, I hadn't kept track of it as were not boyfriend/girlfriend quite yet). He texted me saying he had something to show me and asked if he could come over and I was like ""yeah, sure"" he sounded really excited so I was curious what he had planned, I thought maybe he had been accepted to the course he's applied for. But you all know that wasn't it.

He shows up at my place and I instantly spot the plastic on his arm so obviously I ask what that is. He says he's gotten a tattoo to celebrate our thee month anniversary and I already felt uncomfortable there but once he unwrapped it and showed me it got way way waaaay worse. In big bold letters he's had my name (including my two middle names) tattooed with some red and pink roses around. It's maybe 20x7 centimeters large.

I got so shocked that the first thing coming out of my mouth was ""you f*cking idiot"" which I know was kinda rough, I just couldn't believe how he'd think that was a good idea. We could have been married for ten years and I would have thought it was stupid but after three (!!) months?? That's just crazy.

He got really angry at me, calling me ungrateful, that he'd spent so much money on it to make me happy and show me how special I am to him. I told him that tattoo is just making him look like an obsessed weirdo (once again, harsh I know). Then he called me a ""stupid whore"" (he's never used that sort of language with me before) and stormed out the door.

He hasn't called or texted me once since yesterday and neither have I


---> *Uppdate* : he texted me like half an hour ago saying he's given me exactly 24 hours to say I'm sorry and that he's disappointed in me for not doing so, that he ""expected more"" from me and that he really didn't think I was ""just another hoe"".

With his behaviour lately and all you guys warning me I'm honestly a bit scared. My mom just picked me up and she's taking me back to her place right now, I'm typing this from the backseat.

We’re just two fundamentally different people, she’s very into her church and like black power type stuff (spoiler I’m white so I don’t think she’s too excited about that and I also don’t particularly care about religion). Anyways, her wedding date has been known for at least six months now. I never got a formal invitation, but my boyfriend told me I would be his plus one. I assumed that was the end of it and went and bought a new dress and shoes for the event. Today (which is a day before the wedding) I found out I’m not really invited. My boyfriends mom was looking at the reception guest list and saw I wasn’t on there and asked my boyfriend why that was. He asked his sister why I wasn’t on the list and she said because he never asked about it, though he says he did have a plus one conversation with her. He insisted they did talk about it and she kind of brushed it off with an “oh” and moved on with getting ready for tomorrow. He brought it up again and she said “she’s still welcome to come to the ceremony”. To me that just feels disingenuous and clearly an afterthought in that moment and I’d rather just not be there at all. I also think it would be awkward to leave my boyfriend and his family after the ceremony. I told my boyfriend I just don’t really want to go at all anymore because it’s clear I was never really wanted and I’m hurt over it. My boyfriend wants me to go to the ceremony for him.

810,No A-holes here,"So I was eating in my university's cafeteria with my brother. While we were talking about video games I jokingly said ""PC master race."" He then texts me (even though it was just the two of us sitting across from each other) that I shouldn't say ""master race"" in public as a white person. I asked him if he knew anyone who got in trouble for saying that before, and he said no.

A few months later, my brother was criticizing me again for something I did that *he* thought was socially unacceptable. This time I defended myself and told him that his idea of what is or isn't socially acceptable is ridiculous. I referred back to the ""master race"" statement. I told him that nobody is going to think that I'm a white supremacist for saying ""PC master race."" He then it ""wouldn't sound good to people of color passing by"" and that it's only logical to not say it to be safe. He then says we're ""hella white."" And then he says that if I want to say those things I have to do it without him around and I have to ""take the risk.""

Personally, I don't think people are going to think I'm a racist for saying ""PC master race."" It's not like I said anything offensive like ""white is the master race."" If for some ridiculous reason something thinks that I am being racist and they try to confront me, I can say that I was talking about ""PC master race"" and not race like black or white.

811,Asshole,"Hi Reddit! I'm based in the UK in case there are any cultural differences/nuances. I am 26 and my sister is 36.

My partner and I are about to remortgage his house and add me to the mortgage - for this reason I need to be in the best financial health, but I have a reasonable amount of credit card debt and a small overdraft that I am unable to clear. This is because I am currently paying off a loan I was encouraged to take to go on a dream holiday with my sister and all the family, which was a terrible decision both financially and because the two sides of the family had a massive falling out which has not been fully resolved.

When my sister got married in 2007 my parents contributed £10k to her wedding and have always said they would do the same for me. However my partner and I are not interested in getting married so we do not ""need"" this money. My parents offered to pay off my cc and overdraft using this ""wedding fund"" before we look for mortgages, so we will get a better deal. The loan will be over early next year, so without this I would have paid everything off by Christmas 2020.

We graciously accepted their offer but I feel incredibly guilty about taking this money from them. My dad is retired and my mum works part time, and I know they don't currently have it sat in the bank and are saving it up to give to me. In the meantime I have applied for a promotion which if I get it will mean a £10k payrise starting around this Christmas (and therefore will be better). 

I would like to repay this money to my parents and my partner suggested paying for them to go on their dream cruise to the Norwegian Fjords, as they would never spend that sort of money on themselves. I think it's a brilliant idea (if I just gave my parents the cash back, we would pay bank transfer ping pong as they would not accept it) , however I think my sister would be upset.

She is married with 2 children and has a good job, lives in a nice house and goes on several foreign holidays a year. I would not expect her to pay half of this holiday, the point is to repay my parents and I think she should be making memories with her family. But it is an extravagent gesture that she may interpret as making her look bad. I am actively trying to repair our relationship after the holiday fall out and am conscious of doing anything that might make our relationship worse. I thought of suggesting she gave them money to spend on board for Christmas and birthdays. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if I did such an extravagent gesture?

Tl;dr: I want to repay my parents money they gave me by sending them on a cruise, which my sister would be unlikely to contribute to, WIBTA?

Edit: after reading this back I know it sounds like a validation post, however I am very concerned about hurting my sister in any way which is why I wanted anonymous strangers points of view!

Edit 2: thank you all for your judgements. Many of you have picked up on the fact that I need to manage my money - as clarified in the comments any gift back wouldn't be for several years when I'd saved up both enough to pay them back and some savings for me. I've always been careful with money despite this blip and would absolutely not make the same mistake twice. I was more concerned about how my sister would react, because I'm trying to repair our relationship. But I just wanted to say thank you all for your comments and judgements.",23,117,0.87

It was pretty nice as during the ""traditions"" I stayed with them the whole time, helped them prepare the whole thing, helped them with the guest and I felt really good.

The bad thing, though, happened 30 mins after the party started. I was seated next to my cousin's sister (we got along pretty well, as we were also classmates for 4 years). All safe and sound until I went to change my outfit for the night party. As I was heading to my place, there was my cousin's sister with her friend sitting on my place.

She said that it sounded really fun and that she wanted to try it, but the problem is that in college, i've tried geocaching before and it's not fun at all. It's tedious and boring, plus my daughter isn't very patient so I don't think that she'll like it very much.

I told her about my geocaching experiences in college, and how I think that she wouldn't like it.

She was kinda sad, but she didn't really care in the end until recently.

My husband told her more about geocaching, and now she's begging me to come with her. I think that my husband's biased because he LOVES geocaching, and really wants someone else to do it with since I don't like it.

814,Not the A-hole,"Recently, I had an expensive package delivered to my house, and it was unfortunately stolen off my front porch. I have a camera, however, so I got video footage of the guy stealing my package. I am a member of a community Facebook group, and decided to post the video footage in the group to see if anyone could ID him.

I didn’t do this to form a lynch mob against the guy, or “get revenge” on him, or get anything started, I just thought that over a thousand potential members of this group who live in my community would be a better resource at coming up with a name than a couple cops; all it takes is one person out of that bunch to recognize him. After he was ID’d, I was planning on going to the cops with his name and the video.

The video got an enormous amount of attention, and I got several responses from people who recognized him, and gave me his first and last name. I plugged the guy’s name into Facebook, found his profile, and saw that the face was a definite match.

Here’s where things went a little...wrong, though. This guy has a very uncommon last name and a somewhat unusual first name, and is named after his father (who lives right in town as well). This guy’s father is a fairly well-known local business owner whose name apparently can be found on a decent number of billboards and commercials. I personally didn’t remember/recognize the name, but many other people in my area do. From what I heard later, it seems like this father and son are largely estranged, probably over the son’s behavior.

The thumbnail of the video I posted doesn’t show the thief’s face; you have to click on the video and wait for a few seconds to see him appear. Some jackass saw my post, noticed the thief’s first and last name in the comments, and started incorrectly posting and sharing with people that the thief’s *father* (with the same name) was the one who stole my package. This rumor spread like wildfire over the course of that day and the following day, and apparently caused the guy’s business and reputation damage.

I didn’t know about any of this until the business owner’s daughter (and employee) contacted me angrily the next day. She blamed me for damaging the name of the family business, and said that I should have kept the video between myself and the police, since she said “this kind of stuff is bound to happen when you make stuff like this public on the internet.” She accused me of trying to start drama by posting the video, which was not my intent at all.

I removed the video and I feel sorry that the thief’s father was affected, but I don’t feel responsible for it as I was not the one who started spreading the misinformation; all I wanted was to ID a thief and get my package back. But what does Reddit think, was I in the wrong or irresponsible to make the video public in the first place?",187,969,0.97

My partner (31m) comes from a big family, 6 brothers and sisters, lots and lots of nieces and nephews. I have one sister who lives in Europe (I’m in US), and she had the one and only child in my entire family, my niece. We decided because we’re having a cocktail bar wedding, we’d do a child free wedding. I was sad some of the kids couldn’t come, but we figured it would let everyone relax more. Plus my sister is pregnant and couldn’t travel over. 

Now here’s the problem. We told everyone months ago it’s childfree. No problems, everyone made their plans. But yesterday my sister called excitedly to say she’s booked 3 surprise tickets for her, her daughter and husband! I was speechless and delighted, but instantly started panicking about the childfree problem. Tickets had been bought and I honestly think my sister would never speak to me again if I said her daughter couldn’t come! She told me right at the beginning she couldn’t come, so I actually don’t remember mentioning it was child free to her as it wouldn’t affect her. 

My idea is to have my niece come to wedding and reception, but go with a sitter for dinner onwards. I asked my partner to reach out to his family to ask to bring their kids to wedding reception too but they all have plans set in stone and can only come alone. Am I the asshole if I allow my niece?

The ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the [""cocktail"" definition here](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

Husband doesn't *dress up*. He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. He wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (That was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

When I broke the news about N's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""No. I'm not wearing a suit. I guess I'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

I told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. I added ""Nice priorities there, honey.""

* My mom and brother (N's dad) said YTA - just ask N if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* N's mom says I'm NTA, but my delivery could have been better (I disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* I don't have very many friends to ask, and I'm NOT asking N. Weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

I don’t want to because:

1. The only way to get there is by car & since we don’t have a car, it’s a $30-40 cab ride

2. I have to climb up some stairs to get to the lift, & carrying a stroller + car seat + baby up stairs is a pain

3. The area is full of mosquitoes 

4. My baby howls nonstop during car ride & it’s a 20 min drive 

But the main reason is that the guy’s a dick. 

When we took him out for dinner, he made loud, racist comments nonstop about the restaurant owners even though they were nice enough to give us a seat while they were full, just because I was pregnant. He wasn’t even pissed, he just enjoys telling people why they’re inferior. 

He has Parkinson’s & was supposed to stop driving years ago, but he still sneaks off to do it even though he had already hit someone at a red light. 

He lives off my father-in-law & wants to do shit like get $3000 laser treatments to get rid of his freckles.  

We had to stay with him while I was pregnant & it was so bad, we moved out a day after I was discharged from the hospital after giving birth. We’re Chinese, so this was a big fuck you since we were expected to stay for at least my confinement period (1 month after baby’s born). 

He would order me around & kept yelling while I was trying to help. He doesn’t acknowledge me & would address questions for me to my husband. He expected us to serve him in ridiculous ways like take him to the barber (fine) and literally stand next to him & watch him get his hair cut (wtf). 

He has a full-time caretaker who offered to do it & she was horrified he insisted on us even though I was 8 months pregnant & we were dealing with a high risk pregnancy that required lots of doctor visits, apartment hunting & shopping for baby stuff last minute (pregnancy could’ve failed up to the 3rd trimester, didn’t dare shop earlier). My husband said no. I bonded so much with his caretaker over hating on that selfish dick. 


He never bothered seeing the baby when he was healthier, just because we asked to meet near our apartment. His caretaker offered to take him multiple times but he refused. 

I’m also suspicious over the “dying” claim, because this is the 4th time my MIL claimed he was dying. She made it sound so dire last time, my brother-in-law & his wife cut their vacation short to fly over (12h flight here, 18.5h flight back to their home), & I risked a trip to the hospital with a compromised immune system & left my 8 weeks old baby with a babysitter. He was fine enough for a loud, church sing-along session in a *shared* ward (hospital staff were pissed).

825,Not the A-hole,"I’m a college professor teaching an semi-advanced calculus course. I know how difficult it can get and how important grades are to some people, so I have tons of extra credit opportunities. I give extra marks for legibility on tests. I give extra marks for attending PASS sessions. I give extra marks for 100 percent attendance. I give extra marks for 100 percent homework done. I give extra marks in the form of bonus questions I throw around in class. All in all, a student who does everything should have around 12 or 13 extra points on their overall grade. That turns a 69 to an 82.

So I had his student who wasn’t very strong in math but was an extremely hard worker. She did everything possible she could to bring up her grade and met with me occasionally to discuss how scared she is and how little she knows about calculus and how she needs to keep her scholarship and things like that. I helped her by giving her free private tutoring sessions whenever I could and showing her how to easily get all the extra points. She worked extremely hard and her final grade in the course was an 89.2. 

Tbh, she does not have a B level of knowledge in the course, it’s more of a C level, but the extra points were more of a reward for hard work. When the grades were released she sent me an email begging for an extra 0.8 points to raise her grade to an A. I denied. She kept begging and said only 0.8 wouldn’t mean much and that she really needed an A in the course but I wouldn’t budge. I wake up this morning to see an angry 1 star response on RateMyProfessor from this student. She made it so obvious it was her with angry quips on how I wouldn’t raise an 89.2 to a 90.

AITA?

EDIT: so I’ll ad a little context. I might have stretched it a bit when I said 12-13 extra points, but I thought I would be the consensus asshole if I said she only got 6 of those points. In actuality a student who did everything perfectly would get about 8 points and she *tried* to do everything, but she only made 6 of those. 

I’m not kidding when I say she’s a C student in knowledge however, it’s just she probably got help for all her homework which is about twenty five percent of her grade, and also lucked out from my lax grading system on the tests. She didn’t get the final answers but her steps were semi-coherent and showed effort.

Anyways, she wasn’t going to lose her scholarship or anything, but she would be on the brink and the math courses would only get harder, or so she said.

Now you gotta understand that in the state where i live this a very common site, so people have become pretty desensitized towards such happenings. 

So coming back to the incident, i was very disturbed seeing such a small child working from morning till night, not going to the school and overall destruction of a child's innocence. Like many people here, i tried to ignore all of this even though it made me sick to the core and extremely sad. I even thought of confronting the owner but my past experience of doing so with a juice vendor had taught me that this is a futile exercise in the context to the area i live in.

But, today it was a bit too much for my conscience to handle because its my little 9 year old cousin's birthday and the child working doesnt look a year older than 10. This really hit me, like i cant imagine my cousin doing anything else than eating chocolates, going to school and playing video games and seeing this small child working his ass off in such a horrendous environment, i couldn't control myself and decided to talk to the boy.

Luckily, the boy came to my building to deliver some food and i took this opportunity. I sat him down and first tried to video record our conversation, but to no avail, he saw that and got up. So i kept my phone aside and asked him his name, where he is from, how old he is, his education status and where does he live currently. He told me that he is around 11, from some far off village in Uttar Pradesh and lives with his brother-in-law here, he is currently not enrolled in school and earns around ₹2000 or $29 a month working 7 days a week here. 

This literally made me furious. I bid him goodbye and in a fit of rage dialed the child helpline number and reported the issue, the case worker called me back and took additional information. By that time i had come to my senses and i requested him to keep the complaint anonymous. He agreeed and informed me that his team would come on the next working day to look into the matter. 

However, i went into a strange guilt, what if in place of helping this poor kid i somehow made his life more horrible by pushing him into the hands of substandard child care services with a very choppy travk record ? Have i put myself in jeopardy by going against social mores? Maybe his immediate family depended on his small earnings to fend two square meals a day!? AITA for doing what i thought was public service but can turn really ugly for all involved?

TLDR- saw a 11 year old child working 16 hour shifts in a cafeteria, in a fit of rage called the authorities and filed an anonymous complaint. But now feel guilty about pushing child in the hands of state and theie sub standard child services.",24,41,0.84

831,Asshole,"So a few months ago a friend of mine asked if I would foster his pet. He has been going through a tough time lately and could not keep his pet while couch-surfing so I agreed. He made an agreement with me that I would only be watching/taking care of this said pet for two months. Well, two months after that (I’ve had this pet for four months now) and I get a message out the blue from my friend saying he is coming to pick up his pet this weekend.

The entire time I have looked after this pet, it has put on a few (healthy) pounds, I have purchased all of the food it needs and other necessities and also I have not heard a word from this guy in months now. I all but assumed he had abandoned his pet and have grown quite attached to it and want to keep it. AITA for thinking this way or am I a pet thief?",28,56,0.9

835,Not the A-hole,"Im getting married next year, and today My sister, mom, mother in law, and myself were going to go look at wedding dresses. My sister wanted to try on a wedding dress as a joke but when I asked he if she would really put one on, she said she would. I told her that I didn't want her to try on a wedding dress when I was the one getting married and she BLEW UP. She spent 15 minutes screaming at me calling me a bitch, a bridezilla and repeatedly saying fuck you. In the end we did not go dress shopping and my mother is saying that I was at fault for not allowing her to try a dress on. In my opinion I was not in the wrong because im the bride, I wanted to be the one who tries on a wedding dress and see myself in the mirror with that dress on. I feel emotionally crushed because I wanted this to be a nice day and now everyone is exasperated and I dont know if I even want to go wedding dress shopping with my family again. Am I in the wrong here?

Update: my mom told me that she won’t coming along when I try on dresses in the future. So I’m going to go on my own one day. Thank you all for your input.

836,Update,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bmdlxo/aita_if_i_cancel_my_fathers_dream_trip_bc_im/

Three months ago I posted about possibly canceling a cruise with my father because I was afraid of leaving my 14 year old blind cat, JJ.  At the time my cat was undergoing chemotherapy for small cell intestinal lymphoma and his health was frail.

Welp, in the three months since my JJ's condition has changed radically...for the better!  He's put on two pounds and is full of typical JJ spunk and brattitude.  He will need to continue his chemotherapy for a full year, but he's responding beautifully to treatment and so far has had no side effects.  

Dad and I just returned from the cruise this morning.  We should have done more research in terms of boat size and activities, but it was a fun time.  We swam with some stingrays, learned to ride Segways, visited a massive water park, and took in some shows.  I took home a souvenir in the form of the worst sunburn I've ever had in my life.  Crispy chicken over here.

A vet tech friend of mine checked on JJ and the other critters 2x a day while we were gone and JJ also had an automatic feeder for extra meals.  We had an ant invasion and one of the younger cats broke into a cabinet and devoured an entire bag of treats, but other then that everything went fine. All four cats (last time I posted we only had three , but have since welcomed Stark into the family) are happy to see us.

837,Not the A-hole,"ok, this might be a long story, so let's get some stuff out the way, also, im not a native english speaker, so please excuse any writing errors

1) this is my 2nd wife, first wife passed away a bit over 3 years ago

2) i had 3 kids with my past wife, 2 of which are now in college in our home country (egypt), i had no kids with my current wife

3) i don't live in egypt, im working in ksa, my wife and 3rd child live in ksa with me, we do go to egypt on vacations

4) our house in egypt is big, 2 living rooms, 2 doors, etc. it sort of looks like 2 houses, with a small hallway between the 2 living rooms, however, we usually have the hallway room open as we do move between the 2 living rooms alot (houses are NOT separated)

5) People involved : M - me
                                    W - wife
                                    SIL - sister in law
                                    C - children (ones in egypt)


so, W needed to get some papers from our room back in egypt, she had left the keys with SIL when we last went, so SIL took the keys and went to house (SIL does not live near us), C were sitting at home, and heard movement in the other living room, which scared them, but they decided to check it out, it was SIL, She got the papers and decided to stay for 2 days as her home is far, no problem, house is big, besides she's my SIL, so there's no issue w her staying

now during those 2 days, she was going around like there's no one in the house, refusing to eat with C, (always bought/made her own food), barely talked to them, and most of the time kept the hallway door closed (locked w a key)

naturally, C got annoyed by that, when i talked to W about it, and told her that SIL should have informed C that she was coming instead of just getting in without anyone's knowledge, and shouldn't have locked the hallway door, as C sometimes go to the other living room (honestly didn't care if she didn't wanna interact w C, if she doesn't want to, it's wrong to force an interaction)

W took it really personal, her main point was ""why should my sister ask your kids for permission to get into my house, or lock a door in it""

to which i responded to with ""there's nothing such as your house! this is everyone's house, your sister should've respected that there are people in that house, she should inform them, not ask for permission, and she shouldn't lock doors for no reason, as it's  a really gesture""

she didn't even respond, she just said ""i need a break"" and left

am i being an a-hole here

was i wrong for getting upset at what SIL did??",86,1040,0.94

843,Not the A-hole,"I am not that great at writing so bear with me. Little back story: 

During my marriage to my daughters father I found out he fathered a son. He paid the women a messily $250 a month during our marriage and his family provided diapers and small things, he only saw his son until about the age of 5 because the mother started dating a great man who wanted to take on the father role and they started a family together. I have never seen his son or the mother. I just know her first name and think I might know what the child’s name is but I’m not 100%) The child and mother live (or lived) in the same city as us. 

My ex and I agreed that when his son turns 18 we will tell our daughter she has a half brother. Because he might want to meet his biological father. His son should be around 20 now. 

Flash forward to the past 3-4 years. My ex has had nothing to do with our 16 year old daughter. He has a new girlfriend and they don’t get along and long story short he moved new GF in and kicked our daughter out and has not been involved at all besides Merry Christmas text or texting that her grandmother passed. (I know he’s a real pos). (My daughter has been learning how to cope the past few years with therapy) she doing a lot better now, but that’s a whole other story. 

A few months ago while watching tv we were watching a program about a group of 5 siblings that all found out they were related through DNA testing. 

My daughter asked me if I would tell her if she had a sister or a brother that she didn’t know about. I said of course that they would be a part of our family. (I hadn’t thought about her half brother in over a decade) but when she asked about her father having another child I quickly remembered. I thought it wouldn’t be my place that her father should be the one to tell her. So I said I would think he would if she wanted to know. 

Later that night I emailed my ex about it. I said I think it’s time he let her know. He called me a liar and said it wasn’t true and I was making it all up. I messaged back that she’s old enough to know and we had discussed this and agreed to let her know. He has ignored every email I have sent regarding that issue. 

I can just tell my daughter to call her father and talk to him because he won’t answer her calls. He wants nothing to do with her. 

So, I told my daughter. I know a lot of people are going to hate on me for telling her but she is old enough to know that she has a half brother who lived/lives in the same city. 

She wants to know him. She wants to know who he is, what he looks like, what his personality is like, she’s excited and wants to know (her brother) 

I think she is still struggling with her fathers abandonment and looks at this as a being a part of his family or having a relationship with her fathers family.

844,Not the A-hole,"My husband left the house this morning to play dungeons and dragons with friends. He's usually gone from about 9:30am-4pm, sometimes a little earlier or later. He left the house and accidentally took both sets of keys, so now I can't leave the house all day. He has all the house keys and my bike lock keys (plus his keys and our car/car keys) He's only a 13 minute drive away, so I asked him to run a pair of keys home quickly (this was about 10:30am) but he says he doesn't want to leave.

I know it wasn't intentional, but it also sucks to be trapped at home for 6+ hours. Am I the asshole for thinking he should bring them back?

Update: he remembered where a third house key is, one that we haven't used since we bought the place, and a spare for his bike lock, so that solves things for now! He offered to get a copy of the car key made on his way home to prevent this from happening again hopefully.

However I once was on the computer and found a note where my mom was mad at my dad and said the only good thing in her life was my younger sister. 

My dad clearly does more stuff with my brother because he’s a boy. Vice versa with my mom, my younger sister is her favorite because she’s into girly things. I’m not, therefore she gets upset when I refuse to wear dresses or don’t want to get my nails done.

However, some events have happened where it’s clear that my dad is choosing my brother over me for events simply because he’s a boy. My mom refuses to acknowledge that’s the case, but now I feel left out of everything because no parent does stuff with me. 

The reason I’d point it out is to prove that I’m being ignored. They keep doing all this stuff with the other kids, but when I ask to do something with them, then I’m complaining too much.

848,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend moved from IL to AZ to live with me back in 2014. At first, he disliked my sister, which obviously bothered me. My sister and I have always had a rocky relationship but of course I still love her and didnt want him to dislike her. He stopped disliking her around the end of last year. His reasoning is that he misses his brothers and that my sister is like a sister to him. They have also bonded over the fact that they both suffer from depression. I was fine with their relationship until a few months ago. In April I was talking to my sister about life and ended up telling her that, a year prior, I considered living separately from my bf due to some issues in the relationship but he was adamant about not going through with this option. A week later, I can hear my bf getting continuous Snapchat messages and it gave me a gut-wrenching feeling. Lo and behold it's my sister asking him ""did you tell her yet?"" I went off, my gut had been telling me something was off. My bf then tells me that he's been reconsidering the living separately situation after talking to my sister about it. He was still having problems with our relationship that I was unaware of. Months later we've worked through the problems but my sister is still in the picture and causing tension. She will stop by our house and pick up my bf to go on short car rides, just the two of them. The final straw came the other day through a conversation with my sister.

I'm an ugly ass hairy guy with acne and he's an attractive successful guy with abs who talks about all the girls that fall for him on a daily basis, we were just talking about work when he asked out of nowhere... He also didn't play it off as a joke which makes me further believe it was a mistake and not actually something he meant to send me.

 He said he was sorry and stuff, but the thing that got me was that the message had the shift leads name on it, I was gunning for this promotion and worked my ass off and was surprised to hear the position went to her. She had been there one 2 months and I had been there almost a year when she got it... I couldn't help but think that she only got the position because she was sleeping with Mr Nipple Flex.. so I told HR. After about a month of getting calls and stuff from the DM they were both suddenly gone and replaced by a new manager.. I now have the shift lead position, but I feel kind of bad that they got fired...

 Some of the other employees say they knew they were sleeping together, but didn't really care...

Edit: it seems it was the right thing to do to report them, but it was a bit scummy to only care because I had a better position on the line. So what I learned is I need to be more selfless and allow bad things to happen if I only care about stopping the bad thing because it effects my life.

Is this what it's like to be a politician?

Edit 2: some people NEED to understand this, coworkers can date and even get married more power to them if they do, BUT supervisors and subordinates cannot regardless of when or how the relationship starts or how professional they both are and this is the case within MOST if not all companies and is always a conflict of interest.

Around that same time I was in and out both psychology offices and psychiatry offices because of my sister.

Sue knows that I can't see my sister. But decided to invite me and my sister to attend her bridal shower because she's a bride and wants the family to come together.

So this morning I texted Sue, and told that my health isn't strong enough to see my sister yet. Sue blames me left and right for not being strong enough mentally or physically.

I know that Dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. I asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her Miss Annie (not Dina's mother) is very good friends with Dina's PCP, who told her the gossip.

About a decade ago or a little more, my dad had a falling out with my grandpa and my grandma(my dads stepmom) and stopped talking to them.

866,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory English not first language disclaimer, etc!

I rent a ground floor apartment. My patio was originally shared with the other two ground floor units, but our landlord marked dividing lines so each would have our own private patio. I was the first to move in and built a 2,30m tall fence between my space and my neighbour's. 

I have three cats. Cats are sneaky beasts, and through the years it has taken some trial and error effort to improve and reinforce the fence so they can't jump or sneak into the neighbours' patios. Through this process, one of them snuck out, ate some plants and almost died of hemolytic anemia, costing me 1600€ in vet bills and a lot of fear and crying. My other neighbours (not the one this story is about) have pet birds so that's another reason to make sure my cats can't ever get out.

A couple months ago my neighbour buzzed me to ask if he could cross through my patio to his, as he had locked himself out. I said no for the following reasons:

1.- It would have meant opening a section of the fence, and I don't trust my ability to rebuild it safely for my cats.

2.- Our landlord, who lives next door, has copies of all our keys

3.- The cost of a locksmith would be approx the same as the cost for me rebuilding the fence

4.- He was drunk as a skunk and I don't want strange drunk people inside my apartment

He kept buzzing through the day I guess to ask again, but I ignored him.

So what happened is in his drunken state he decided to ask strangers from the street for help forcing his front door open and in the process they destroyed the lock, so when he called an actual locksmith he was told the entire lock needed to be replaced... and instead of using the locksmith services I guess he asked strangers again and ended up with a giant hole in his front door. From the noises I could hear from my bedroom I think everyone involved was very drunk.

So he ended up having to pay for an entire new door.

Now him and his boyfriend hate me and I've heard them refer to me as ""the wh*re who refused to help J."" but from my point of view I did nothing wrong since he could just have called our landlord, or a locksmith, instead of me having to tear down a section of my fence potentially endangering my cats' health. I feel a bit like an asshole for not answering while he was buzzing the rest of the day, but honestly I was not in the mood for arguing with a drunk guy.

I could also have offered to let him jump the fence but I was afraid he would break something.

Tl;dr: we’re having trouble conceiving, I’m going through medical hell trying to figure out why, and my husband can’t stop smoking long enough to maintain his sperm health no matter how much I beg.

Ok reddit. 
My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for about a year now, to no avail. Smoking is very bad for your swimmers, if you didn’t know. We knew it was a me problem, tested to see if it was a him problem too (about 2 months after he quit smoking which is about how long it takes for sperm to make their comeback) and he was in the clear. I still made my stance on smoking pretty clear (that it has no place in a house with pregnant women/children/anyone tbh) and asked that he remained smoke-free as it can cause lots of birth defects and other issues as well. He agreed. 

Now here’s where it gets tricky.
Most of his friends are social smokers. They’re in bands, hang out at dive bars playing shows, etc. I’ve never begrudged him the occasional social cig (once a month-ish) as long as he didn’t buy a pack of his own and stopped at one, maybe two.  It’s worth noting that this is not his first attempt to quit. He makes it a couple months and then completely gives up. But I digress. He has his social smoke, nbd, I ask that he doesn’t have another because I have a big fertility related procedure coming up (involving a catheter where no woman wants a catheter), we go back in for his friend’s band to set up. I go out to the main bar area to find a seat while they set up because it’s midnight on a Thursday and I work 11 hour days. I’m looking out the window and I see him and his friend go out for a second smoke. I’m a little peeved since I asked him not to, but ok, it’s just 2, that’s within my acceptable range. Then he lights a third. And a fourth. And they come back in. I tell him I saw him outside and I felt very disrespected since all of the fertility work falls on me and it’s unfair that he says we’re in this together but won’t do the only thing he can to help. He just said “I knew you’d catch me” and that really hurt my feelings. We talked it over the next morning and it was fine, he said he wouldn’t buy any, and at that point it was over so I just said ok and everything was fine. 

Fast forward a week later. I he comes to bed smelling like smoke, there’s a cigarette butt in the toilet, and he hasn’t been out in hours, so he must have a pack in the house somewhere. I’m furious, he’s completely unapologetic, making jokes, and I ask that he doesn’t smoke socially (therefore, at all) anymore. I know he has an addictive personality and it’s hard for him, but countless appointments, tests, surgeries, etc is a lot harder on me than not smoking out of respect for your wife IMO. So, reddit, am I the asshole?",179,904,0.93
871,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway for multiple reasons. 

&#x200B;

My boyfriend is the lead singer and guitarist of a fairly successful band. Not crazy famous, but with a very loyal and strong following and three critically acclaimed albums. 

&#x200B;

I had never heard of the band when we started dating, and as I got to know and like him more I made the conscious decision not to listen to his music too soon. I obviously checked out a few tracks, but I didn't want to go in too deep and let the perceived 'glamour' of him being in a band influence my feelings for him. I thought it might make me feel slightly intimidated, so I elected to get to know him as a 'person' first, and this worked great. 

&#x200B;

Ten months later, we're in a happy relationship and I, of course, have listened to his albums now. I have picked through them and found my favourite songs and have listened to them loads. I've talked to him in-depth about how much I love his music and think he's amazing. I'm glad I waited before properly getting into the band because now it's not an influencing factor in the slightest, just something I'm super proud of my partner for doing. That being said, there are a few songs that I didn't particularly like as much, and so as a result I tended to gloss over them when listening to the albums.

&#x200B;

A few times, it's been bought up that he can't believe I ""don't know"" some of the songs I've listened to less. When he was watching a loud video on his phone and I asked what was it was, he looked incredulously at me and said ""That's one of our biggest songs. I can't believe you don't know it - our fans would eat you alive"". It happened again this morning when he was plucking out some chords on the guitar and I mentioned it sounded pretty, and he rolled his eyes and said ""well if you actually listened to *Band Name* then you'd know what it was"". 

&#x200B;

To be clear, I have listened to pretty much everything in whole - some of them just not enough to recognise from a video snippet or acoustic chord progression. It's not a huge source of contention or anything, but he's genuinely seemed quite miffed about it and I wonder if I'm TA or coming across as unsupportive?",34,91,0.93
872,Asshole,"My 13yo sister moved in with me around 6 months ago. For many years now I've either been living alone, or with a significant other, so having to suddenly care about privacy again is something I'm still getting used to. It doesn't help that she is just a teeny-tiny thing, her feetsteps are very quiet and she seems to teleport around the place a bit. After living together for a couple of months, a few embarrassing incidents prompted me to stick some bells over the top of both of our bedrooms so that they would make a sound whenever we would be on the move.

I like to think of it as a sort of squeaky floorboard, something that's useful occasionally, but I can see how it's could be a bit of an annoyance. She doesn't like them being there, mostly because it means she can't sneak as many midnight snacks as she would like, but she also says it's an invasion of her privacy, and wants to be able to leave her room without alerting me.

873,No A-holes here,"Using fake names and posting here because I really don't know who I can ask. All the people in my real life are fine with me making the choice myself and don't want to influence my choice, so I'm turning to strangers on the internet in the hopes they'll be impartial.

19 years ago, when I was 18, I got pregnant and had a daughter. I asked for a closed adoption because open would be too much for me, but I was told that the couple who adopted her named her Katie.

In the present day, I don't know the specifics on her end, but 4 days ago this girl called Katie messaged me through facebook, claiming she's my daughter and she wants to meet me. I haven't responded but it's on ""seen"".

It's not that my first child never crossed my mind but she came about in the worst possible circumstances and I've had years of therapy to get over those circumstances, as well as what it did to me having to give her up. To this day, putting her up for adoption is one of the hardest choices I've ever had to make, and there's always been a part of me that wondered how she was, where she was, what was going on in her life, but I never reached out to her because it was a closed adoption. I didn't even have her last name, and if I was in Katie's position and someone approached me saying they were my real mother I wouldn't take that well.

But, as far as I can tell, Katie has had a happy life. With parents who did more for her than I ever could. I realised Katie was looking through my photo albums so I went onto her page and saw all these photos of her and her adoptive parents. They look happy and they look like a family, which they are.

Katie says in her message that she wants to make up for lost time. In this time I've had 3 more kids, sons ages 7 and 10 and a 14 year old daughter, and I'm married to a woman. I told my other daughter, Cassie, the specifics as it look like Katie went to her high school and used to play on the same netball team and I wasn't sure they hadn't met already, but it looks like the age gap was just large enough that they missed each other.

I gave Katie up thinking that raising her would be too painful, but now she's an adult the fact I didn't raise her hurts.

My wife says I should do whatever I think is right, whether that means talking to Katie or ignoring the message.

Cassie has said that it's my choice but if it were her then she'd at least want a reply.

875,Not the A-hole,"A co-worker, let’s call her Chloe (27F), of mine (25F) sadly lost her grandfather earlier this month; she was off work for about 3 weeks then returned on Monday. On Wednesday she was having a rubbish day so I went out to sit with her for lunch outside. As we were eating, she thanked me for coming to sit with her and said that she enjoys being outside as she feels closer to her grandfather because he loved the outdoors and he can see her from heaven. I told her that was a lovely way to think of it. 

She then asked me if I had any similar beliefs and I told her I don’t. She began on at me about how the idea of her grandfather watching her from heaven has really helped her cope with his death and that I should look to sky once in a while and picture my loved ones smiling down at me. I suffered the loss of a loved one earlier this year and didn’t want to think about it then and there. I thanked her for her suggestion but explained that I have grieved in my own ways and said that I’m not sure what I believe about the afterlife. Her mood changed and she got defensive and asked me *“Don’t know about the afterlife? So you don’t believe in heaven?”* I said I don’t and then she got angry and asked *“So you don’t think my grandad is in heaven? Where do you think he is? Did he not deserve to go to heaven?”* I tried to slide the question with *“you have your beliefs so what does it matter what I think?”* but that wasn’t enough for her. She told me that I’m insulting my loved ones by denying them being in heaven. I then got annoyed and was a little curt when I replied *“I don’t believe in a heaven and hell because I don’t think life is that black and white, I’m not even sure if I believe in any kind of life after death. I don’t like worrying about death and the unknown; I’d rather focus on life and the living”*. She started to cry and walked off back to work. 

About an hour later a different colleague told me that Chloe was going around work claiming that I don’t respect people’s beliefs, that I said I don’t think her grandfather went to heaven, and that I made her cry. When I explained the situation to a couple of work friends they said I should apologise and I should have just told her I think her grandfather went to heaven because she’s grieving and needs to hear it. I know how much it hurts to lose someone important and I feel bad because I didn’t want to make her cry. I understand that some people lash out in grief and it’s not her fault she’s emotional. I don’t usually discuss my thoughts on the afterlife so I guess I wasn’t thinking of the ramifications of mentioning my own beliefs but she asked me a question and I felt pushed into answering. So I’m here to ask the internet: should I have just nodded, smiled and kept my mouth shut or was I right to stick to my views?

EDIT: thank you everyone for your inputs and insights. I was actually kind of dreading going back to work on Monday but I now have confidence in my actions. Could I have handled it better? Probably.

880,Not the A-hole,"So the title sounds pretty bad but hear me out. 

I go to school in the city and we don’t have a lunch hall so we have cards that work for certain restaurants. We occasionally eat pizza and bring it to the park. There is always this homeless man who doesn’t speak much swedish, he says a few words but usually just points at things.

He always goes around with a large trash bag to collect plastic bottles because you get money if you recycle them. I think that is great as he earns money and it’s good for the environment as some people just throw it on the ground.

The problem now is that he demands it, if you sit with a bottle of water just opened it he will ask for it. He won’t go away until you give it to him, he can stand there for 5 minutes staring at you constantly asking for it before giving up. We see him go up to everyone there asking for it and making them uncomfortable. If I have finished drinking my drink and someone asks for the bottle and I don’t need it I give it to them, but with this guy I really don’t want to encourage his behavior so around him we never finish our drinks or just don’t drink in the park. 

I hate confrontation but this guy can even walk up behind people and steal the drink they put down on the ground and pour it all out behind them. He is rude and creepy, but still he is in a very bad situation that I don’t wish anyone was in. I feel like it would be really rude to tell him to stop since this is the way he makes money and survives, but he is making the park a very uncomfortable environment for everyone. But at the same time I feel like he is going too far. WIBTA if I told him to stop and he is making people uncomfortable? I feel like it would be an asshole move as everyone else is just dealing with it and me and my friends could just not go there or ignore him, and maybe without asking for bottles he wouldn’t make enough money for food, I really don’t know his situation.",63,380,0.93

882,No A-holes here,"TL:DR at the bottom.

Ok, so, my (30) wife (28) is 7 months pregnant, we’re due in November. It’s going to be our first child and we’re both stupidly excited and terrified. I’m working and she’s a stay-at-home wife, soon to be stay-at-home mom.

Unfortunately, however, I got fired. More specifically, my company terminates my contract with the end of October, offering a very generous severance pay.

So we made a decision – use the severance pay to allow me to stay unemployed for two months, so that I can stay with my wife for the final weeks of the pregnancy, the birth, and then the first couple of weeks of being with our newborn. I am now searching for a new job with the idea of starting in January 2020. She’s totally on board with this and we’re both very happy for this “paternity leave” of mine.

So I got a job offer, and for all intents and purposes, it’s a dream job that I had been coveting for the past several years. Great company, great position, amazing money (more than TWICE my current salary). Chances of me finding anything comparable right now are next to none. Normally it would be a no-brainer for me to accept it.

The catch: as part of the induction/training for this role, I would have to go on a 2-week business trip in the second half of January, abroad, potentially even to the US (I’m in Europe), leaving my wife completely alone with a 2-month-old baby, and 2 dogs, for 2 weeks. I’m VERY uncomfortable with this idea and it makes me feel at best like an asshole and at worst as a monster.

Important details: she would be pretty much completely alone and nobody would be able to help. Our families are not in the picture, they live too far away to be able to assist. We don’t have any friends locally (at least not close enough to help with baby and house management), nor any sufficiently friendly neighbours. We have 2 dogs, and no garden, so the dogs need to be walked, at least twice a day. She would have to manage the baby, the apartment, the dogs, any shopping and what-not, cooking, and basically anything and everything else, all by herself.

She’s saying she “will manage”, she’s happy that I got the job offer and is telling me I should take it. I’m not sure she really comprehends the challenge of having a newborn in the house all by herself. I never had children of my own, but as a frequenter of r/beyondthebump, I’ve read enough to be seriously worried.

The alternative is to ditch this job offer and keep looking for something that would not imply any frequent or long business trips, but the downsides are quite obviously also severe – the offer is just too good to refuse. She says I should take the job, whereas my parents share my concerns and told me it sound very selfish and irresponsible. Reddit - would I be the asshole if I took this job?

886,Not the A-hole,"I was part of a meals on wheels program for community service in high school and met this wonderfully sweet old woman who didn’t have any family nearby. 

We had a lot in common, I had been considering a career in social work, she didn’t have any family nearby, and I didn’t have any living grandmothers so we became fast friends. 

She developed dementia and towards the end I basically moved in with her and cared for her in exchange for free rent in her home and groceries. (It was also out of my love for her, but I couldn’t have afforded to care for her full time if I also had to make rent.) 

She died and it was heartbreaking but I also saw firsthand how she was suffering in the final days, so it was bittersweet. 

She divided her will among her children and I equally. I did not ask her to do this, I never asked her about the contents of her will and the one time we briefly discussed it all we discussed was the house, not her savings. 

She left me 80k and change, and the same amount to her two children. A remarkable gesture and life changing for me, obviously. 

Her children are contesting the will because she apparently added me in around the same time her dementia began to rear it’s ugly head. They insist she was confused and had mistakenly come to believe I was one of her children and that even if she hadn’t mistaken me to be one of her children, that she was not in her right mind when she did this so the will should be invalid. 

I am very conflicted as to my responsibility here.  I would obviously very much like to keep the money but I don’t want to let how life changing the money would be cloud my judgment. I don’t need it so badly that it would be worth doing wrong by her or her kids.

However, I now know that his girlfriend and future wife cheated on him, as far back as four or five months ago. I know this because another mutual friend of ours confessed to me that he had sex with her, multiple times, and he feels guilty because now their relationship is getting even more serious. 

He also thinks that the baby may not be my best friends, because the girlfriend apparently had relations with other guys after their affair was over.

Okay so some basic context: in May this year, my long term partner and I decided to move out from my parents' house and get a feel for actually living together. We comprised at renting a room from a 22/yr old mom with a husband in the military and two kids. Original rent agreement: $500/mo, utilities etc. included if I watched her kids. Okay, no big deal, except I also work and go to school part time. Whatever, move on.

In June, rent went up to $600 because she didn't anticipate the increase in her bills. Again, fine, whatever. My partner and I are both working, Landlord has lost her job and needs extra income, OK girl I gotchu. I quit school and go to work full time.

In July, her military husband comes home for 2wks and all is good. It's relaxed, we all have some beer, a nice bonfire, all is good and well. Also in July, the rent spikes again from $600 to $900 starting August 1st.

Her reasoning for the spike this time is that my partner and I use too much shit in the house. Okay... I mean, we buy our own toiletries, paper towels, food, etc., but okay. Whatever. But at this point, my partner has lost his job (due to in competency on their part, not his) and I'm the only one working.

My first paycheck in August, I have to get a new car (my Chevy Malibu of the past was sold out from under me) and I scrape by until then, getting rides from friends and such. I get the car road-ready, move on with my life, overall a stressful time but I can cope.

Then... Late August (maybe a week or two ago?) my partner tells me that Landlord has given us 2wks notice to move out. We have to pay her the final $450 on Sept. 6th or else she's tossing our shit in the trash and formally evicting us from the property.

My aunts still visited me a lot, and I visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time I stayed with them for a month straight. 

I did a lot of stuff while visiting my aunts. One of them gave me a job at her bakery, and I loved helping and earning money. They taught me to drive, which my grandparents said I couldn’t do until I turn 18. I also started dating a guy who will be going to the local high school. I visited the high school and I loved it, it was so much bigger than the tiny school I went to last year near my grandparents, with a lot more class options and AP courses and extracurriculars. I also felt like I got to know my aunts a lot better, and they told me a lot of stories about my dad which I never knew before. 

My aunts always told me that their door is always open for me, and that I’m welcome any time. I told them that I wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then I told my grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. I didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if I moved out. I honestly thought it would just take off a burden from them, I didn’t think they would react as sadly as they did, and I feel awful for not even talking it over with them first, just telling them I want to move out, and thinking harder about it, I’m seeing that some of the reasons I wanted to move are kind of stupid. 

I’m worried that my grandparents feel threatened by my aunts or something. Since they’re from different sides, they don’t really know each other, I’m the only connection. I feel bad for essentially choosing my aunts over my grandparents, but it’s a hard decision—my dad’s sisters or my mom’s parents, and I don’t really know what to do! AITA?",21,173,0.95
898,Not the A-hole,"I graduated from college in May and live in a small two-bedroom apartment with a good friend from school. He has a girlfriend, which I knew when we signed our lease, so I made sure to gave him the much larger, private bedroom when we moved in. The gf is a full-time grad student, so I didn't think she would be staying over much, but it honestly feels like she never leaves.

She stays over at least four nights a week, and whenever she is over the two of them are always in our common living room/kitchen treating it like it is their own apartment, so much so that if I go in to fill up my water bottle, they stop what they are doing and stare at me as if I interrupted something very important and am not in my own home. Her things are all over the kitchen table that I paid for. She leaves her hair in the shower in that nasty way.

The thing that really bothers me about this is that I am never, nor was I ever, asked about how I felt about her staying at the apartment so often. Perhaps it was my fault for not having a discussion about this before we moved in, but I didn't think we needed to, for my roommate and I are good friends, and he lived with my best friend senior year, so I know it wasn't like this a few months ago.

We have a mutual friend who needed to stay with us for two nights fairly last-minute. I texted my roommate to let him know that she would be sleeping on our couch (mind you, this was still several days in advance), and he told me I was not being respectful by having a guest over with so little notice and using a common space. I had had a stressful day at work, so I responded by telling him that I never get any notice of his guest who is over half the time. He flipped out and will no longer speak to me.

So, AITA?

899,Not the A-hole,"I was in an artsy area of downtown Dallas earlier where parking can be VERY hard to find. I noticed an empty spot on the side of the road so I pulled a u-turn to get back to it. As I pulled up there was a couple standing in the middle of it. I didn't think much about it and set my car up to parallel park.

As I'm pulling back into the spot they start screaming at me that this spot isn't available and I can't park there. I don't see a car so I keep pulling back into it. The girl gets behind my car and tries to physically stop me from pulling back so I just slow down to a crawl and slowly keep pulling back. She then comes to my passenger door and tries to open it, but luckily my doors were locked. She's screaming at me through me closed window this whole time.

I finish parking and get out of my car and go to pay the meter. She proceeds to get in my face and keep screaming at me. ""Do you get off on being an asshole?"" ""Do you realize what a piece of shit you are?"" ""Our friends are right down the road, we're saving this spot for them."" I pay my meter, take a picture of them and say ""I've got your faces, don't fuck with my car.""

Am I the asshole for taking this spot that the couple was physically trying to prevent me from taking? Is there some unwritten rule about people reserving a parking spot that I don't know about? As far as I know, if there isn't a car there the the spot is fair game.",575,4812,0.97
900,Not the A-hole,"This happened a couple years ago, but the story and topic were brought up a couple days ago.

I have a GoPro and got one of those dog mounts. First thing I did was take my (leashed) dog to a local park and test it out. The park is a wide open patch of grass next to a river, no equipment or sport fields or anything. As I got out of my car there was a family nearby with 4 kids just kinda standing there. They saw the camera blinking and the parents instantly got upset. “What are you EVEN filming here? *My children?*” I said I was just trying out the mount. The whole family, kids included, made a face and one of the *kids* continued “*Why* at the park? There’s nothing here *except for us*.” I felt very uncomfortable and just said “Oh, we’re going now” (we hadn’t left the parking lot yet, still standing next to my car) and the mom said “Yeah, you’d better.”

I was a bit freaked out that this family was so aggressive, but figured rich people are just mean as has been my general experience in the area and didn’t think much of it. Yesterday my friend mentioned wanting to put a gopro on her pitbull and I made a joke about the story. Then her two sisters, the only of us that have kids, agreed that they would have done the same thing if they was having a nice day at a park with their kids and someone “tried to film them with a dog”. My friend and I don’t have kids, so we both are second guessing mounting a camera on her dog.",37,68,0.85

902,Not the A-hole,"I know it will immediately sound like i’m TA, but hear me out. This isn’t a new thing. My dad calls to vent to me about her and her kids a lot. He loves them a lot as do I and they’ve been in my family for a long time, i’m grieving my step brother as well, but my step mom and her son are not good for my father mentally. He works three weeks on and one week off as a crane operator and he works about 5 hours from home. His wife does not contribute to rent or utilities. He comes home and his house is a complete wreck. Like the dirtiest house you can imagine. She also has 5 dogs she just lets shit and piss anywhere they want and her and her son refuse to clean it up. My dad as well as myself, cannot function in this kind of environment. It’s causes us very bad anxiety. She refuses to help clean no matter how much he begs. She also accuses him of cheating all the time. She even freaked out when my dad was texting my little brothers girlfriend. She gets jealous when my dad wants to spend time alone with his kids and the list goes on. Now flash forward to last week, my step brother passes away. He was only 25 and this happened about 2 years after my little brother was killed, so both parents are pretty distraught. I called to check and see how my dad is doing and he’s crying on the phone and he’s telling me that the house is like hoarders type nasty and that he can’t take it anymore. He told me when he comes home to that he feels like killing himself. I told him if she’s not contributing to anything and is only causing messes, and is being mentally abusive (accusing him of cheating, trying to keep him from his bio kids) then he needs to divorce her.

905,Not the A-hole,"There's this guy, who I assume (based on our multiple interactions) is mentally challenged in some way, that works as maintenance for the apartments that I live in. I say that I think he's mentally challenged because he doesn't really understand social cues, he is slow when speaking, slurs his words and seems to have a very limited vocabulary. He also overshares. Which leads to my issue. 

The first time I met him, he was fixing a leak in our kitchen sink with a few other maintenance workers (it was an emergency). I didnt really pay any attention to him because I was busy distracting our dogs. My husband was talking to the guys and one of them was asking questions about his job, normal convo. 

The second time, it was a few months later. I had just had my baby about a month prior, and I was heading to my mom's to hang out. With my arms full, I was walking to the car when he (who we will call Chris) stopped me and asked if I got a flyer already. I said no, and he handed one to me. He started asking questions about my baby and how my pregnancy was, which I thought was very nice. Until he said this, ""Yeah, I really like kids. Kids are great. I would love to have kids of my own. But I can't. I can't because a few years ago I got testicular cancer and they had to remove them. Yeah they had to remove my testicles. Wish I could have my own kids.""

Now.. I felt really bad for this guy, also mixed with feeling uncomfortable. But I just told him I was sorry that happened and that I, too, love kids. He said it was fine and that he loved his job because they covered most of the costs of his treatment and what not. He left the convo because his coworker was shouting at him to get away from me (I have no idea why).

A few months after this, Chris shows up to fix small things in our unit and during our conversation, he brings up, again, his cancer and how they removed his testicles. He then started asking questions about what my husband's work schedule was like. I told him it was random (even though it isn't). He then asked when my husband would be home and I said soon, even though that wasn't true. 

He took forever to fix the simple things, which is fine, I understand, but I felt so uncomfortable that I just wanted him to leave.

Now, whenever he sees me coming or going (whether from my unit or from the complex itself as I'm driving), he stares me down. Its definitely intentional, he doesnt smile or wave, he just stares me down (like he will turn his body or head with me as I walk/drive by so that he can stare at me).

This has made me very uncomfortable to say the least. So, since I'm going to need things fixed around my unit in the future, and I'd rather it be by one of the other guys instead of Chris, I was wondering if IWBTA if I told the office to send anyone other than Chris. I don't really want him to lose his job, I just dont want him in my unit.

906,Not the A-hole,"Here is a little background. My mum has consistently thrown Anti-VAX rhetoric at me since I have had children. She goes on and on about how vaccinations will cause my children to get autism blah blah blah. Its complete nonsense and I am a strong believer in science (I work in the Biotech field).

My son who is 3 and a half now was in day care from 6 months onwards. When he moved up to the toddler class, he just kind of shut down. We knew something was up so we reached out to the county (Or school district I forget which one) and got him enrolled in an Early Intervention Program where we were provided with someone to work on his speech and someone to help him with his social behaviour. 

7 months ago we had him evaluated by a developmental pediatrician and found out he had very mild autism, formally known as asperger's syndrome and mild ADHD. It is worth noting that since my son has been involved in the EIP, the progress he has made has been staggeringly good, his providers have been astounded by his progress and my wife and I have bent out entire lives around his schedule to give him the greatest opportunity for success. 

Now comes the potentially asshole part. My mum has maintained her insane rantings about vaccinations, so while the rest of my wifes family know everything that has happened, I cannot even think about telling my parents because I know they will blame us and blame the vaccinations etc. I dont have the best relationship with my parents and up until recently they havent been a huge part of my kids lives so it has been easy to keep this from them, but they are starting to want to be much more involved. I fear they will find out and will be upset that I kept this from them. But I just know it will be a huge fight and they blame us :/

907,Not the A-hole,"My younger sister is 17, she is an artist and makes T-Shirts with her art printed on them. She does this by hand, (buying blank tees, Printing and applying the prints). She uses her min wage part time job as a supplement to buy supplies.

She asked if she could borrow my moderatley expensive camera for a shoot for her shirts and other art, with her friends. I was reluctant but agreed as she has used the camera before with me nearby and has never shown any type of mishandling with it. I give her my standard electronic zoom lens that came bundled with the camera along with the extra battery and case.

So the shoot goes well according to her and she brings back the camera and gives it to me. The first thing I notice is that my lens cap looks diffrent, she then tells me (before I ask her) that she lost the lens cap and went to best buy and got a new one. NBD they are small and I have dropped it many times before this.

I then notice that the lens is jutting slightlybforward from thr body. This is not normal. This lens can only zoom out with power and when off it sits flush to the body when powered off to be more compact. It also automatically comes out of the body as soon as you turn it on. When I turn on the lens I hear the motor but the lens doesn't move. Not good.

I ask her if anything else happened during the shoot. She says no. I then inform her that the lens is broken. And this issue can be caused by dropping the lens or pushing on it with too much force. She insists that it was fine during the shoot and nothing like that happened. 

I should note, this is not the most pricy lens and since it is a kit lens for the camera you can find them used all day for less than half the retail cost (approx 300 usd). I have found many for about $120. I never asked for a brand new lens

Anyway I ask her what we should do at this point she says she didn't break it. I point out that I handed her a working lens and was returned a broken lens. 

She tells me she will pay for it but looks very sad/frustrated.

The issue is since then, she has not paid me and every instance I bring it up, she she starts to sigh and act sad or get angry abut how she doesn't make a ton at work and needs money for her art and shirt based side Hustle. My parents are not helpful. My dad says this is between me and her, my mom is obviously sympathetic to her youngest child and says I should cut her some slack. I am not asking them to pay for it as she is 17 with a job not a 7 year old.

I definitely support her art and understand she doesn't make a ton and I having a full time job have more income, the cost of the lens is not going to sink me financially, but I am also trying to save up as much as I can before moving out. 

The main reason I am asking is becasue ceritan family including her are making me feel guilty or getting slightly angey for asking this of the not even adult on min wage. AITA?",19,44,0.94

909,Asshole,"Throwaway, all fake names, blah blah blah. I (22M) have always had an albino fetish, but it isn’t something I share with any people. Until recently, I didn’t know any albinos, but I do enjoy watching albino porn in my free time. 

I just started taking Italian this semester, and I’ve been sitting by “Carmen” (19?F). She is an albino, and she’s seriously the most gorgeous girl I’ve ever seen. She has a great figure and cute little vintage glasses, and of course she’s an albino. We’ve been chatting before and after class, and yesterday we walked to the library together.

That’s where I made my mistake. As we were walking, I asked if I could take her out for a nice meal, and I told her my albino fetish. She didn’t say anything, and this morning she didn’t sit next to me. My instructor was looking daggers at me the entire class, and I think Carmen must have told her something.

910,Not the A-hole,"Short about me: 28 year old guy, having a good salary job, lived cheap all my life so quite some savings, just bought a house in a big city. Short about her: 32 year old girl, loves her job as a teacher (yet it pays terrible), has a rental house in a cheap area near the big city. No option to get a mortgage with her salary and almost no rental houses in her salary range.

She has lived for a few years in this area near the big city, with no option to buy something in the future or rent something in a better area. She loves her job as a teacher and doesn't want to move to the other side of the country (in which the rent prices are about halve the price). So here is the catch, we only are dating for one month. Her rent contract is about to expire and she has no place to go. So she has three options:

&#x200B;

1. Move to the cheaper area of the country (and leave her job with the kids she loves)
2. Find another rental (which is about impossible)
3. Move in with me

Option 1 is a no-go for her because she loves the kids too much. Option 2 is the preferred option, but given the chance and time, it's a dead end. So we both made our conclusions: 

For me: There is no way we are going to move in together in my new house. We only know each other for a month and this is litterly my life savings. I am not willing to share that already with someone I just met. 

For her: The only option to keep her job is to stay with me.

  

So we had a chat, and she is furious with me. She blames me for forcing her to go to the other side of the country and leave the children she loves behind. In her eyes, i am the bad guy. I know i might be harsh in my choice, but i feel like her problem is shoved to me. I am not the one ending her house rent, so why am i the one getting the blame?

  
 From her side, i can understand the problem she is going through. For her, moving in with me is the only option to stay with the kids she loves. We are dating for a month (and beside this, it's all going smooth) so i can understand her hope to move in with me. That makes me question my part in this.

Cast: 
Me = me...
Fiance = F
The Kids Mother = KM 
KMs New Husband = J
The kids = their ages, 7 and 9

I cannot have children of my own, and my boyfriend, now fiance has two beautiful girls ages 7 and 9. I've been in their lives for over 3 years and love them like my own. We have a great relationship the four of us and I work really hard to never shout or yell and always am honest with them about why we have certain rules or why we have to do homework, etc. My own mother was a stepmother and I know how difficult it is from the childs prespective of having this strange woman trying to tell you what to do just because she's dating your dad, so having a calm and loving space is so important when it's our turn to have 7 and 9. We share custody with KM, its 50%, three days there, three days here and split Sundays. 

KM recently got married and had 7 and 9 in her wedding to J. 7 and 9 had a great time at the reception and are looking forward to Me and F's wedding. 

The dilemma: 

I would love to have 7 and 9 in the wedding but not at the reception. It's my first wedding (hopefully last) and I want it to be about us as a couple. F has been married twice and doesn't really care about the details, he just wants to be married to me. He really doesn't have an opinion about if the kids are at the reception or not. 

I do not want them at the reception because I don't want ANY kids at the reception. I've been to weddings were there are kids and they just are not as fun as child free weddings. 

WIBTA if I only had them in the wedding but not the reception?

Edit: By having them at the ceremony I intend to have them there for the cake cutting, first dance, etc but then since there are no other children their grandmother keep them overnight.

Edit 2 (Post ruling): Well this blew up. Thanks for all the suggestions and comments, including the negative ones. It lets me know to contextualize more and keep my questions more concise in the future. This post was linked to the bridezillas subreddit I learned that sub exists! 

I was trying to convay that I wanted my kids at the beginning of the reception, but I didn't want to have the couples to feel obligated to bring their kids just to entertain mine if they wanted my reception as an excuse for a night out. Not planning on snorting coke or having fire dancers as some suggested, but thanks for the idea! 

Thanks for the suggestions about having a kid side room with games and movies for the kids that are there to have something to do that isn't boring wedding stuff, and for the idea of having a surprise wedding goodie bag for when they get home that night.",369,959,0.9

My sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  

My sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

The guy proceeded to get out of his car, step over the trash pile he'd just created, and then pulled a skateboard out of the backseat and walked away, presumably to the skate park.

I happened to notice that he'd left his window open, so as soon as he was out of sight I went over and picked up all of his garbage and threw it back into the car, right onto the driver's seat. The park was pretty empty so nobody saw him dumping the trash or me putting it back in his car.

I left shortly after, so I don't know what happened when he saw what I'd done, but I've told some friends about it and gotten pretty mixed reactions. Some people thought it was awesome that I threw his trash back in his car, while some people think I was a huge dick and should have just minded my own business (or at least thrown it into a trashcan instead of the dude's car). I feel like I was in the right, because it's a much bigger asshole move to dump all your garbage on the ground, especially in a freaking park where people bring their kids and pets.

I figured if she doesn't wanna smash I can't make her but I also need some kind of release.

921,Not the A-hole,"My daughters cheer coach created a public YouTube channel with our school name and posted a video of our kids, with the intention to post more. She had good intentions and wanted a way for them to share videos and practice, but I’m worried about privacy and the girls location being so public for any random person to find. I asked if it could be made private, or at the very least if she could name the channel something generic (like mascot cheer) instead of the school name so it wouldn’t be so easy to locate them. I also suggested they could do it on a private Facebook group or share the videos in a different, more secure manner. 

The coach basically said ok, we won’t do it and acted like it’s an all or nothing and then sent out a separate survey asking if parents would give permission for their kids to be in the videos.

Some background all my life it’s just been my mom, brother and I as my dad is shit and so is most of his family as well as my moms family. I am 23F and my brother is 19M and is honestly spoiled. My mom with me was strict I couldn’t go out with friends until I was like 17 nor could I just take her car whenever etc. Like if I talked back etc I’d get my ass beat but my brother? He got to be out till late and take her car whenever when he was only 15/16. 

We grew up somewhat poor not gonna lie but you best believe he had an Xbox iPod etc where’s I was lucky if I could convince her to let me get something nice. I had to work for all my shit where’s he got to sit on his ass eat and play Xbox all day. Anyway me and my mom do not get along at all (surprise surprise), I moved to a city 45 mins away and rarely talk to her or my brother. Before I moved he got this shitty Toyota Corolla from our step dad and my mom basically guilt tripped me/forced me to put his car under my insurance as well as under my name cause if he got insurance on his own or put it under his name it’d be hella expensive because he’s young etc. 

He has been on it for a year now & it’s been hell, I have to constantly remind him to pay me the $45 for his part or I literally have to threaten taking him off to pay me. I’m honestly getting tired of it, and recently I’ve found out he’s smoking weed which is whatever I do 2 but he’s being dumb about it. For example he’s always snap chatting him smoking or like the bag of weed or recently HIM SMOKING AND DRIVING AROUND. Oh and of course my mom doesn’t care nor says anything to him, but it’s one thing if he did it at home etc but now he’s risking my rate going up as well as me getting in trouble because the car is under my name!!!

After finding this out I told him that after this next month he is off my insurance I don’t care how much he whines or begs because I’ve had enough, I also told him he better have money ready to register the car in his name as I am taking my name off and cancelling the plates. Of course this did not go over well, he blew up my phone with calls and texts. Calling me a bitch, stuck up, that I must hate him, he doesn’t need me he’s grown, all the way to fake crying and begging me to please keep it in my name and the insurance because he doesn’t have money. But yet he’s got money for weed, going out to eat, going out with friends etc!?!? Yeah right. 

Now my mom is also blowing up my phone pleading on my brothers behalf/ guilt tripping me again. At this point I’m ready to just put him back on so I don’t have to deal with my phone being blown up.

927,Asshole,"My older sister is getting ready to have kids. She’s talked about baby names and I was surprised to hear her plans. 

A little background: i got my middle name from my mom. My older sister has her own original first and middle names and I was given my mom’s middle name as my middle name. To clarify, let’s say my mom’s middle name is Alice. My sister is not named after Alice. My middle name is Alice. I know from previous conversations that I got Alice because my parents couldn’t think of anything they liked and my aunt suggested passing down the middle name.

I have always had intentions on passing Alice as my first daughter’s middle name. I don’t know if my sister knows this. She wants to name her first girl something like Haley Alice Lastname but definitely Alice for the middle name. This BOTHERS me. 

I know it may be petty but I need to decide if I’m going to let this bother me or not. It my name; it’s not her name. She’s older and my parents chose her name on simply names they liked—no family names were passed down. I got an unoriginal middle name but it’s my moms and I take pride it was passed down to me—even though it’s because they couldn’t come up with something else.

I understand that my sister’s kid would be getting her grandmothers middle name passed down to her (my sister and I obviously have the same parents) but it feels weird to me to plan on having a three generation tradition on my side that my sister kinda jumped onto. And the thing is—she’s 100% going to have kids before I do and I don’t know how ‘entitled’ I am to my name. I am irrationally upset about this and I know bringing it up will be enough to cause problems with/for my sister.

WIBTA if I told her not to use Alice*?

928,Not the A-hole,"I have a heart condition that causes my heart to beat really fast/irregularly when I have alcohol. I technically *can* have alcohol, but drinking it puts me into a state of discomfort and sometimes can get kind of scary, so I usually avoid it as much as possible (in the last year, I had a sip of champagne at a friend's wedding and that was it).

All my friends do like to go to bars still so I'll go with them and just get a virgin drink. Last night a guy approached me while I was standing near the bar and introduced himself and we chatted a tiny bit. Then he said, ""Can I get you anything?""

I thought he was cute but my first inclination is always to be over-polite, so I said ""Oh, no, that's okay!""

Him: ""No, I'd really like to get you something. Anything you want, on me.""

It went back and forth with him insisting (not aggressively, just in a friendly way) so I caved in before it got too ""NO."" So I thanked him, said ""are you sure?"", he nodded and smiled, I turned to the bartender and asked for one of my favorite (non-alcoholic) drinks. They didn't have the stuff to make it, so I quickly glanced at the happy hour menu for an alternative and saw 3$ potstickers, which are my favorite. (Cocktails are usually around 10$ at this bar and I hate the taste of wine and beer.) So I turned to him and said, ""Do you want to split an appetizer?""

He reacted like I was incredibly weird and presumptuous for asking that. He said incredulously ""oh you want to eat?"" and I said ""oh, I have this condition where I can't drink..."" and he said ""why are you at a bar then?"" And I explained. After a little hemming and hawing I could tell he really did not want to feed me (lol) so I said ""it's okay actually, I can just stick with water!""

But the mood was killed and we parted ways shortly after. When I got back to my table, my friends all told me it was a dick move to ask to order food when he was obviously offering to buy me a drink, even though the food was much cheaper than anything else I could have ordered. It's a bummer because I was interested!

930,Not the A-hole,"Okay I don’t know if this matters for context but I’ll go ahead and say it anyway: I am a black man, my ex is a white woman, and our son is obviously a biracial kiddo. He’s 13 and gay. Or he’s pretty sure he’s gay. Either way, he identifies as being gay. 

His mom is veeeerrryyyy religious and that’s actually how we met. She used to be a no no on him being a homosexual, but she is an AWESOME mom and loves our son so much that she is actively in therapy/ trying to understand/ is putting herself in new scenarios so that she doesn’t alienate our child. He came out to us last year. I dont know what the inner workings of her mind are, but I DO know that she is very protective over him and he has privately told me that he feels safe and comfortable with her, if a little awkward. 

She has primary custody but lately she’s asked if I can have him more because she’s pregnant with baby number 5 and between that and church and the other kids she’s run off her feet. Obviously I jumped at the chance so I’ve had him a lot. 

He asked me last night if he could bleach his (already ~~blowfish~~ blondish) hair and dye it. He told me he had asked his mom and she had shut it down and said no. I asked if he thought that was due to his age or his sexuality, and he told me he privately thought it was the latter because he has younger half sisters and they have had colored hair before.

I didn’t think that was fair to my kid so I took him to get his hair done and he’s fucking in love with it and the selfies or smiles haven’t stopped.

I called up my ex to let her know and she kind of sighed on the phone, and said fine, and didn’t say anything more than that. She asked for a pic so I sent one in the group chat. Whilst she replied with a ‘cool! 👍🏻’ her sister blew up the group chat saying it was wrong of me when I knew her sisters wishes, etc, etc.

931,Asshole,"I live in an area full of entitled wealthy people who, for some reason, find it reasonable to throw ridiculous tantrums in public when things don’t go their way. 

For example, the other day I was in a drive thru and the woman ahead of me would not move forward after other cars ahead of her moved. After waiting for a minute, I honked at her. She didn't move but instead started screaming at me and flailing around until a worker came out.

This is not a singular occurrence. I’ve seen these ridiculous people everywhere, in parking lots, coffee shops, grocery stores, harassing people over the dumbest shit. Shit like this happens daily and i’m fucking sick of it and want these people to realize that they look like fucking lunatics when they throw their tantrums.

I recently changed psychiatrists because the office at my old one’s office was poorly run. I still have business cards for my old psychiatrist and thought it would be funny if I handed them out to these adults throwing tantrums under the guise of concern for their mental health. Who knows, maybe it would be a wake up call. However, it might be considered an asshole move as it may belittle those with actual mental health issues.

934,Not the A-hole,"So it sounds bad I know but hear me out, (apologies in advance for my horrid grammar) I'm the first person in my family to go to college and I'll be living in a dorm for the school year. My family is very close so obviously it's a hard time for everyone. I'm just as sentimental as everyone else is but I'm ready to start living my own life and be (for the most part) independent. 

Last month I decided that barring the first month, I would try to come home once a month depending on my work schedule and coursework since it's only a couple hours drive. My family also decided once every few months they'd come and visit for a day with the same stipulations. I am completely fine with this arrangement as I think it gives me a chance to live my life and get acclimated to being an independent adult while still having a positive relationship with my family.

As we were packing up today it came up that my grandmother and my dad want to not only visit me next weekend (literally the week school starts) but also plan on coming to visit every other weekend. Obviously I'm not okay with either idea and I expressed that to then as soon as they said it. My mom also sided with me but they still decided I have no say and that ""I'm being unreasonable by sticking with our initial agreement"". I should also mention both of these people didn't want me to go to a college where I couldn't live at home in the first place. 

I don't want to strain my relationship with my family members (partially due to financial dependence and insurance reasons) but I also don't want my entire life to revolve around them. I know that they love me and everything which is why I feel like I'm ta for not letting them visit me as much as they want. So wibta?",22,83,0.93

936,Not the A-hole,"Ok, backstory. My (27F) husband's (29M) older sister (36F) had a child when she was 19 from a one night stand. He was adopted by a nice couple a couple states over in an open adoption. They will send her pictures, are friends on Facebook and occasionally have little get togethers. He calls her ""Mama T"", as her name starts with a T. Although she does not celebrate mother's day with him, she asks those around her to wish her a happy mother's day and becomes depressed when she is not acknowledged. She is very active in birth mother groups and speaks annually at a camp on birth mother's trauma and issues. She is unmarried and has always desperately wanted to have a family and children.

Also for reasons that are not relevant (medical), my husband and I have decided adoption is the best idea as we cannot/will not have a biological child together naturally.

About 6 months ago, T announced that she is pregnant again. She told us she wants to have the baby but, once again, is not in a financial position to keep the child. So she's looking for adoptive families. Our families all know that we have been looking to adopt and so she came to us about possibly adopting her child.

My husband thinks it would be a good idea. The timing is right and his sister is a ""known quantity"", as he put it. IE we know she isn't doing drugs or drinking. I'm not opposed, but I had some concerns. For one thing, I don't want my child calling anyone else ""mom"". We also live 45 minutes away, and from the way she acts from her first child's birthday and mother's day, I'm not sure it would be healthy for anyone involved.

After discussions, last weekend we went to T and told her we would be willing to adopt her child. She and my MIL were thrilled, as the only other prospective birth parents she had spoken to were 2000 miles away. Until I told T that she would be Aunt T, not Mama T. She freaked on me. Told me that I was trying to erase her role as birth mother from the child's life. I told her that the child would be very aware they were adopted and that T was their birth mother, but they would not be referring to her or treating her as a mother. She burst into tears and said I was trying to take her baby from her. I told her that, if we adopted it, it wouldn't be her baby anymore. That... didn't go over well.

My MIL has decided to stay out of this issue as much as possible. The entire rest of the family, who lives nearer to them, has been telling me that I'm being heartless and selfish and taking out my misery of being unwilling (they all know I'm capable) to bear children on her. My husband supports me in front of them. He has said that if we aren't united then we won't do it, but has also privately expressed to me how nice it would be to have a child genetically related to him. I guess he didn't realize how strongly he felt about passing on his genes until the option was back on the table?

tl;dr I refuse to adopt my SIL's unborn child unless I'm the only one called mom. AITA?",1294,9211,0.96
937,Not the A-hole,"So some backstory my parents are really bad with money, they have borrowed money from me for a while and have paid me back most of it. I am 19 in my second year in college.  They still owe me a decent amount of money (around 2,000 dollars) but they are very poor so its safe to assume I won't see it again. Also good to note they pay my insurance and phone bills which I am still thankful for them for that so honestly we are probably pretty even. I have a pretty good job and financial aid covers my schooling, but I have to save up money for when I go to an actual university next year and between starting my savings account for that, gas, textbooks, and my laptop that I bought for school I am not really in a great financial place spending wise right now. 

Alright so two years ago I bought a 1997 Toyota Camry for 1100, the thing is a tank and runs with no issues and will forever be my favorite car. But a couple months ago my dads car stopped working at 500,000 miles (also a Camry). I decided I could afford to buy a new-to-me car and so I upgraded and gave my dad my old car free of charge and never brought it up again. Then two weeks ago my parents said that they were going to start charging me either 100 dollars a month or 25 dollars a week as payment for living here I guess. The thing is that will eat into my savings and leave me with basically nothing for a while since I just spent about 500 on textbooks and access codes this week, so it will be hard for me to catch up. So I said that I would start paying them weekly but I would take my old car back to sell it so I could still maintain a good savings account for school next year. That did not sit well with them and they basically called me an asshole without saying the word asshole. So, AITA?",68,227,0.94

I work in a shop, and we often have art displays in the windows seasonally. For pride month in June we were putting up an LGBT+ display at work, especially since we are on the pride parade route for my city’s pride parade, and as most of the staff are lgbt. 

So the manager and her friend are putting up different flags in the windows, they start with rainbow flag, then trans flag, then pan and bi. As a lesbian, I had asked where they were gonna put the lesbian flag, but she just kind of shrugged it off. 

Next week I come in and they’re putting up ace flags, I again ask about the lesbian flag as I thought it must have just slipped her mind. She tells me that the lesbian flag isn’t really known, and said something about how she doesn’t really like it being all pink stripes. I was also told that lesbians can just have the rainbow flag as gay and lesbian are the same thing. Well if that’s the case then surely bi and pan are the same thing and should only get the one flag right?

The week before the parade, after I asked again, she did put a small lesbian flag on the window. But after the parade it was also the first she took down.

941,Not the A-hole,"Although my fiance and I both wanted to go to the courthouse to get married, we compromised and about 6 months ago, between his aunt and my dad, they guilted us into having a wedding. So now we're getting married in less than two weeks in front of about 25 people.

My dad has a new fling every few months (last night when we talked, I mentioned another girl he got engaged to last year after like 3 months. Neither of us could even remember her name for a couple of minutes). Because of that, I don't think the new fling should come to my wedding. For one, I don't want her in pictures. For two, we wanted to get married privately but are accepting getting married in front of others, why would we want anyone but people we're super comfortable with there? After all, she's a stranger to me.

My dad brought up that he was going to invite her. I told him that I'm not going to make the decision for him, but that he knows what we want and I hope he respects it. He goes on to say that until he's shown otherwise, he's treating every relationship he's in as if she'll be the person he spends his life with. I told him that I understand that, but that doesn't mean involving them in family situations, she's HIS gf, not the family's. He would literally be bringing a stranger (and I think her granddaughter too) to my wedding.

He asked me how I'd feel if it was the other way around and I pointed out that my SO and I were together almost a year before he even met him. I wanted to make sure my relationship was real myself before getting others involved.

Eventually I told him to let me meet her this weekend and I'd think about it but I wasn't saying yes. To which he said he might've already told her she can def come. 

I told him that he'll feel like he needs to pay her a lot of attention bc she won't know anyone else when his attention should be on his baby getting married. I told him that no one else is allowed to bring a plus one. I told him that I hope he respects what we want.

He keeps reassuring me that I'll like her but it's not about that. It's about my extremely PRIVATE moment that I already have to have in front of friends and family, I definitely don't want to do it with randos there. Even if I spent the next 10 days with her, I wouldn't be comfortable enough around her.

Then i ask again and she doesn't answer and I ask a 3rd time and she doesn't answer. 

Now to explain, I am not sitting down while asking. I am normally asking on my way over to her. But regardless she never answers and it bugs the shit out of me. Then i get there and she lightly cut her finger or stubbed her toe or whatever. 

I've gotten so used to it that when I hear her yell ""OW!!!"" i will ask if she is okay. If no answer I will ask again. And then if no answer I don't bother. She got upset when I didn't come check on her but I told her that I am tired of once a week sprinting to an unresponsive wife imagine her bleeding out on the floor just to find out she stubbed a toe. If she is hurt or needs help all she has to do is answer me when I ask her if she is ok. 

If the crash or accident sounds severe obviously I go. But if she can yell Ow she can answer if things are ok. 

So i basically just assume its nothing unless she says otherwise and sometimes don't react anymore.

Back in college I roomed with 3 guys. One was never there, one I got along with really well, and the third was a bit different from the rest of us.

I imagine the third guy was somewhere on the spectrum but we never asked or treated him different because of it, and the year went pretty smooth all in all.

The roommate who I got along with and I would drink a lot through the year, mostly sitting around the apartment playing video games or watching sports. We'd come up with random little drinking games whenever one of us had a good idea.

The roommate who didn't talk with much had a habit of coming downstairs into the living room and just standing there. He wouldn't say anything, just stand there and watch us, watch the TV, not much else. There wasn't much furniture and we did invite him to sit the first few times, but he just shrugged it off.

One day when he came down to his spot, I had a an idea for a drinking game, whenever he comes downstairs, secretly start a timer and for every 30 seconds he's there without moving or saying anything, take a drink.

I will admit, not the best idea I've ever had, but we never told him we were doing this, we just kept an eye on timer and took a drink every uninterrupted 30 seconds.

948,Not the A-hole,"Okay this is so stupid and I really feel like I'm NTA but my friend is adamant that I am so I'm seeking Reddit's opinion via a throwaway account. 

My girl friends and I were recently at Canada's Wonderland and having been there dozens of times since I was a kid (am now in my 20s), I know that the women's bathroom at the front of the park has ""additional stalls"" at the back of the bathroom. 

So basically there's about 10-15 stalls at first sight and then at the far back, there's a sign that says ""additional stalls ->"" and there's 4 stalls that are never, ever being used because they're off in their own corner room. 

Well, for the last few times I've been to the park, there's always a long line (like 15 women sometimes) and I always go straight to the back room to check if anybody is there. There never is and I use the bathroom stalls there. On my way out I'll always tell other women""hey there's stalls back there"" to which they say thank you.

My friend now thinks I'm selfish and rude for doing this. She thinks that I should always go to the front of the line, tell the women about the bathrooms in the back, and then join the line at the end. 

I don't see it this way because the sign is so clear and it's not my fault they're not seeing these additional stalls. Not only that but walking to the front of the line, saying that, and then going to the back of the line is awkward as hell. 

My friend hasn't let it go and is now saying she ""sees a different side"" of me. This is something I truly don't think is that big of a deal and my friend is making me feel terrible, I'm starting to question if she's right?

Please tell me if I'm wrong, seriously, I don't get it.

I'm now taking a break from my friend and reassessing how she treats me and makes me question little actions that aren't worthy of explosive attitude from her.

952,Not the A-hole,"Where do I begin? In 1980 my buddy (I'll call Eddy) and I did a road trip to Minneapolis to see the proto-Goth band ""Bauhaus"" play at a club during their first U.S. tour.  I was a film major in college at the time, so snuck my movie camera into the club and shot some amazing footage of the band. This was before they got really popular, so it was very intimate. Great shots of Peter Murphy who was only about 10 feet from me. Anyway, I get the film developed and placed the labeled reels on a bookshelf in my dorm room.  At the end of my senior year, I box up all my stuff and move back home, thinking I had everything. Only a few months later do I start going through my college film projects when I realize the reels from the Bauhaus concert are missing. WHAT-THE-FUCK??? I go through all of my stuff thinking maybe I put them in the wrong box, or left a box behind (if I discovered other stuff was missing). Nope. Everything is accounted for except for these specific film reels. I'm at a total loss about what could have happened to them.  


Fast forward 35 years and I'm drinking with Eddy having a great old time, laughing and reminiscing about old times when I bring up the Bauhaus concert we went to. I said something like, ""I can't believe I lost the film I shot of them. Could you imagine how cool it would be to still have that?"" And - keep in mind we've been doing Boilermakers for the past hour and pretty loose - Eddy says, ""Oh, I think I swiped that from your dorm room just before you graduated."" My immediate retort was, ""You ASSHOLE!"" ...followed by laughing it off because at the moment we were having a lot of fun.  


The next day, having sobered up, I remember Eddy's confession. I'm now genuinely pissed. I can forgive a lot of stuff, but stealing from me seems like a fundamental betrayal of trust. Furthermore, it's not like he had the film and could return it to me, because in the course of his confession he mentions he has no idea what became of the film reels.

Meanwhile I brought 4 of everything; bowls, cups, mugs, silverware, etc. We all eat at the apartment frequently and everyone loves using my dishes. But they never clean a single dish. We don’t have a dishwasher so we just have to hand wash everything but honestly it isn’t even hard. Most mornings I find myself cleaning a mountain of MY dishes in the sink that my roommates trashed the night before. So now I just keep all my dishes in a drawer in my room and when I need to make a bowl of soup or cup of coffee I just take it out, use it, clean it, and put it back in my drawer.

956,Not the A-hole,"My sister \[23 F\] and I \[27 F\] are close. She lives in California with our mom and most of our relatives while I live in Tennessee (military, no family nearby). 

She’s in her first relationship, going on 2 years. They met on PS4 (Overwatch ftw!). He \[21 M\] lives in Oregon but they talk, FaceTime or play PS4 daily. Our family had doubts since he’s EXTREMELY socially awkward and shy, but he’s nice. Hard to tell over PS4… In April my boyfriend \[27 M\] and I flew to my mom’s for a visit. My sister wanted us to meet her boyfriend, so she invited him to join which I had no issue with. I finally saw how much he loves her- he WORSHIPS my sister and she’s happy. So even though I may not understand his personality, that’s what matters. My mom’s opinion also improved.

Our dad and stepmom live in New Mexico (NM). For the Labor Day weekend, my sister and her boyfriend are flying in late Thurs and leaving the following Wed. She’s super excited for a while for them all to meet. 

My boyfriend is a police officer and works on a rotating shifts. Long story short, last minute change of shift means this weekend is the 2nd time ever we’ll have > 2 days off together. 1st time we used it to drive to NM to visit dad/stepmom and thought we could do it again- bonus see my sister/her bf too! So I called my sister and asked her what she thought about us joining for NM Thurs-Sun. She kind of shut down and got defensive- She said it was sudden and she needed time to process. I could see she was uncomfortable and said to sleep on it. 

She got back to me Thurs (day we’d leave) and asked me to respect her planned trip by not coming. In her words “this isn’t a family weekend that you’re being excluded from, this was a planned get-to-know-your-boyfriend trip” and “if you’re there, the focus changes. Not in a bad way, just changes.” Her concern is that since her boyfriend is so shy, they’d be left behind since I’m more extroverted. I pointed out we’d only be there for half their visit. She replied, “I don’t think you realize the gravity of that time. 3 days is a lot” because they’re long-distance. I asked her to remember that I rarely get to see family. I see our mom and dad/stepmom maybe twice a year. She argued that I’ll have more time next year to see them since I’m hoping to move to AZ which is in between them. I said that’s a big assumption and shouldn’t matter for this.

It was massive argument. Both of us sobbing. She said my mom agrees with her (haven’t talked to my mom yet) but my dad/stepmom/boyfriend said I’m welcome to come, that she’ll have to just deal with it. Sister said that if I come, things will change between us. I feel like no matter what, things have changed. She made me feel so crappy for inviting myself/boyfriend this weekend.

They both have no parental support while my parents pay for college and will help with rent if I need it, they are the best.

958,Not the A-hole,"The prequel to this is a one night stand gone wrong which resulted in me becoming a father of now four year old. The mother has custody and lives four states away with my daughter. They visit here once or twice a year. I do not have a good relationship with the mother and barely any contact with the child. Whenever they visit, they stay at my parents. My relationship with my parents has been ruined because they insisted I try and ""work it out"" with her despite me not wanting this woman in my life any more than necessary. I have been paying court ordered child support at 25% of my paycheck since my daughter was born. It is what it is, I'm one of ""those"" dads but I never really had a shot at any amicable solution with the woman. 

&#x200B;

Three years ago I met my now wife. She of course knew of my history of having a child but does not want to be on the hook for it which I understand. This wasn't an issue to start with, until my wife finished a novel she had started writing way before me and her even met. The novel got picked up and published and for about half a year my wife has been receiving royalties from its sales, which has been somewhere around 3k a month. She still works her old job. She might or might not write another novel in the future, with the emphasis on might not, because this novel has had a lot of her autobiography spun into it. 

&#x200B;

A month and a half ago we got out of our rental house, put a downpayment on a condo and moved in. Again we are not living in luxury and driving sports cars all of a sudden. We bought a piece of real estate, something we wanted to do at some point anyway. I had to notify babymom of my new address, she then must have looked up the area and called my parents, who then told her that ""our household income had increased"". The condo is in my wife's name only, because we didn't want to give babymom any leg to stand on legally. But she of course now demands more child support, saying how the child needs to have the same living standard as I do. I pay my court ordered 25%. She will probably try and take it to court, but this is clearly my wife's income and not mine. I do not want to pay a penny more. I could, but no I don't want to. My parents, unsurprisingly, sided with babymom, and now demand from me I voluntarily pay an extra $400 a month. I am not seeing it at all. The child isn't lacking anything. Yes, our household income increased, and a big chunk of this money will go towards mortgage. The novel might not even bring in this type of money consistently in the long run, who knows. 

&#x200B;

So am I the asshole here?


EDIT because people keep asking: the story is pretty fresh and still unfolding, we did meet with a lawyer briefly to discuss the options, he said babymom would basically have to prove beyond doubt that I co-wrote the book (I didn't, it was there before I was in my wife's life) to theoretically be entitled to any of the money that came from it. She takes us to court then so be it. My income which is cost basis for child support can be between 2.5k and 3.5k depending on workload.",857,2484,0.96

961,Not the A-hole,"Sorry this is going to be a long one. 

My best friend and roommate (we’ll call her A) was dating a guy (we’ll call him B) for around eight months. My roommates and I loved B. He was and still is one of our best friends. However, she broke up with him earlier this year after hanging out with her ex-boyfriend, feeling stressed over the distance (like an hour apart from one another, nothing extreme), and said she just wanted to be single. 

Immediately after A and B broke up, A started seeing another boy (we’ll call him C). C was at our house every day over this summer. Essentially he was our 5th roommate. We mentioned to her that it was a little suspect that she instantly starting spending every waking moment (literally) with C after breaking up with B (who she said she was going to marry) in order to be single. 

Fast forward to a music festival this summer. B and his sister camped with our group. A and B acted like they were dating the entire time. Holding hands, skipping and shit, the whole nine yards. Let it be known that C was also at this music festival. A would go off and spend time with C as well. I’m not sure if they also held hands and skipped but I don’t doubt it because keep in mind, C has been living with us for over a month now. 

A couple weeks ago, A told me she wanted to end things with C in order to get back together with B. I advised her to think carefully about what she was going to do because it isn’t fair to B and C for her to flip flop. She ended things with C, but wanted to maintain a friendship since they work together. 

B comes and stays the weekend with us last week. Things are great. They’re acting like a couple and what not, good shit. We even went to B’s huge ass family gathering. They also booked a trip to Europe together (leaving in a couple months.) So to everyone else except for A apparently, it seems like they’re dating. 

This week, however, A has been going to C’s house. She has spent the past two or three nights at his house, went to a show with him last night, and has continued to talk to him (very frequently) all of which she has kept from B. 

Last night, I text A to see if she wanted to grab a beer, and she said she was out with C. I just asked if B was like... okay with that? To which she responded that “B and I aren’t dating. I didn’t tell him, but it isn’t his business. Nothing is happening lmao.” 

This entire situation makes me uncomfortable. I’ve been good about minding my own business, but it’s at the point where she can’t keep both of them at arm’s reach with no repercussions. I’ve been with her through this whole thing, listening to her vent and cry, trying to give good advice, just being a friend. However, B is one of my best friends, and C and I became close friends as well, so there’s multiple people I care about being fucked over here.

This was a total shock to me, as she isn't gay. She's never dated a woman or suggested she wants to.

Last night I get a text message from him asking if $80 is okay for the cost of the trip. That seemed a bit high for me since it usually only costs me $60 to get there. So I offered to take my vehicle since it must be better on gas if it costs him $80 one way. He messages me back saying that it also only costs him $60 but the extra $20 is for ""tires and stuff.""

967,Not the A-hole," I (25F) have been working in a lab for a few years, first as a student, now after graduation, as a paid employee. Mother teaches basic science to kids aged 12-14, so she gets some of it and is very interested in what I do.

But over the past few months, especially since I’m doing it as a job I feel she doesn't take it seriously. She keeps saying she wants to work here too and is sure she would be good at it, which I find kind of insulting since I had to get an MSc for it while her education doesn't even qualify as university. My contract says 40 hours/week but with no set schedule, basically I come and go whenever I want to and nobody checks it, but I religiously count my 8 hours/day because I'm... a decent person lol (plus, I still gotta keep those results coming).

All summer (when she doesn’t teach) she kept making plans on workdays when I can’t attend and when I reminded her that I have a fulltime job now she’d be like “but can’t you just skip a day whenever?”, and I technically can but also... can’t really. I feel she is jealous of my free schedule and that I can take part in some exciting research while she feels burnt out in her job but sometimes her attitude makes me feel she thinks it’s all fun and games and I’m just a kid with expensive toys.

So she had this idea that she wants to visit the lab. I was like ""okay, we actually have an open day event soon, you can come to that and we will show you around"".

She got SO OFFENDED at my suggestion. She was like she isn't just some random nobody, I should just take her there!

I told her it's not possible. The truth is that it kiiinda is but it's complicated and also, frankly, weird and embarrassing in my opinion. The building requires cards for entry so I'd have to check her in at the entrance. I could use it as an excuse to her visit that she is ""in science"" too, profs bring colleagues to visit all the time, but I'm not a prof so I don't feel it's in my right. No one else ever brought family or partners to visit, only on open days. Again, might be only my judgement but I feel she thinks this is just some student playground and not an actual, serious research lab. But it is, and it isn’t for public entertainment - except on the open day, which she is free to come to!

But she finds that insulting, so much that on a recent family gathering I overheard her complaining to my aunt ""...and I asked if I can visit and can you imagine what she said?! That I can visit on an open day!"" but all this laughing, jokingly, as if my suggestion was unbelievable ridiculous.

TLDR; My mother is interested in my laboratory job to the point she wants to visit my workplace, and she found my suggestion that she can come visit on an upcoming open day insulting.

968,Not the A-hole,"Heres the situation: Me (36m) and my GF (33f) have been basically living together for 2 years, together for almost 3. Recently I decided to purchase a house due to a terrible slumlord who bought my apartment and was actively trying to force tennants out. 

When I told the GF she explicitly said that she does NOT want to be on the mortgage due to a past experience with a previous boyfriend that didnt work out well. She wanted to just pay rent to me and work it out that way. I said fine, but I warned her that when we both disagreed on something that has to do with the house that because she has ""no skin in the game"" aka no consequences she would ultimately not get the final say. 

Fast forward to now. I purchased the house (totally in my name). The GF has been VERY adamant about choices that  are made in the house. For example, I wanted to paint rooms a certain color. The GF has an absolute fit about it (she wanted different colors) and I caved just to stop the argument so she got her colors. Any sort of furniture or decoration for the house I am not allowed to pick. 

So the problem: I am in a 10 person fantasy football league. I am obligated to host ONE ""football sunday"" at my house this year. The GF wants me to cram 10 people into my small den room. This is not possible (well it is possible but it would be VERY uncomfortable for everyone). I told her that just isnt possible and we would need to host in the living room. She had a meltdown and then said that NOONE would be coming over for football sunday. I then informed her that while I do respect her opinion, there is no possible way she will be shutting down football sunday.

I went to HR and asked them for advice to deal with the situation. Honestly, she wasn’t very helpful and said I should just keep working as usual/try to ignore him. I think they went and talked to him though, because immediately after my meeting he started avoiding me.
 
 

This was until two weeks ago, when I gave my notice.
 

 
They decided that Louis should be my replacement, despite having absolutely no experience in my department. Which means I’ve spent the past two weeks training him.
 
 

Honestly, there’s no other way to describe the experience except as “Hell on Earth”.
 
 

There’s too much creepiness to even write about; he’s engaged in full creep mode this whole time. Making all sorts of inappropriate comments. Touching me whenever gets the chance and literally sitting an inch away from me. And he doesn’t take notes or anything about how to do the job. He just stares at me and tries to make conversation.
 
 

You remember the office when Toby touches Pam’s knee? That happened the other day. When we were sitting at my desk and I was training him. He straight up touched my knee and held his hand on it as he was telling me how proud he was of me. It made me so uncomfortable I got up and walked away.
 
 

I tried talking to HR about it. Since I gave my notice, they’ve no interest in dealing with it.
 
 

Yesterday was my last day and I will never have to see Louis again. I’m so grateful for that, and for all of you for the advice I’ve been given.

This summer, we ended up having to move. I graduated from university last summer and got offered a job, which pays well and is something I really want to do. The issue was that it would require me moving to a new town, about 2 hours drive from where we were. I asked my brother if he'd be alright with it before accepting, and he said we should go for it, and have a new start. So we went for it.

I told him that if he wanted to see his old friends he could go there and I'd drive him or pay for train tickets and even cover a hotel room if he wanted to stay overnight, and I'd drive them or cover their train tickets if he wanted his friends to come here. He's taken me up on the offer a few times, but since going to the tasters and induction, he's been talking about cutting ties, for a ""clean break"", and told me he'd made new friends on the induction day, who he'll be going to sixth form with.

I said he could have the new friends over whenever he wanted, assuming the type of friend he had hadn't changed.

His old friends were the same age as him, with similar personalities. They tended to be reserved around me but respectful and just generally not dicks.

He did this yesterday, putting the console in the box and then putting the box into a larger plastic storage container with all his games, as he's out of town for next week. He left the container under our bed, but the side was poking out so you could see the playstation box through the plastic.

Today my sister (31f) had a few work meetings, one after the other, over about 5 hours, and rang me in a panic, saying the sitter called in sick and she needed someone to watch Nephew (11 years old). I reluctantly agreed, and she dropped him by. He wanted to watch TV so I gave him the remote and got on with my work. Couple hours go by without incident, but then Nephew got hungry. I went to the kitchen to cook for him. About a minute later I went to check on him and he was gone. I found him upstairs in mine and BF's room, digging through the container with the PS4 inside. By the time I'd gotten there he'd taken out the box and a few games and I asked him what he thought he was doing.

He said he was bored and wanted to play. I said no. He did the whole ""I'll tell my mum you're being mean to me"". I said ""tell her what you want, still not happening"". Nephew, on realising I wasn't about to let him use it, tried to run past me, carrying the PS4 in his arms, presumably to hook it up to the TV downstairs. IDK what happened exactly, if he tripped or lost his grip or what, but he dropped the PS4, right at the top of the stairs. It fell down the flight of stairs, and when we checked it it's a mess of cracked plastic and wiring.

I clean up, give Nephew his lunch, sit him in front of the TV. The whole time Nephew is saying that I should have just let him use it. I rang BF to let him know and he's obviously mad/sad but says that it's fine when it clearly isn't. He asks me to look up prices for a new one and it's more than we can afford rn.

Sister arrives, asks if Nephew was any trouble, and I tell her about the console. She immediately says I should have watched him better. I tell her that I was cooking and that I watched him today for 6 hours, as well as countless other times I've babysat, and never once expected payment, but in this case it's ""you break it, you buy it"", and I show her the prices I got when I searched for a new console. She says I'm being unreasonable and she's not replacing it because she didn't do it and I was watching Nephew, plus she's not paying for a new one when BF had his for a couple months already.

AITA?

INFO: BF has previously told Nephew that he isn't allowed on it and due to lack of warranty BF treats the playstation like it's made of glass.

INFO: BF bought his console from a friend for £229 and it sounds like the friend had had it for a while and just never used it, which is why the warranty was expired. The replacement I found was used in ""fair condition"" for £129 but the page I showed my sister contained the £129 one and some significantly cheaper ones that would have been fine.

Also: When I said ""new one"" I meant one that isn't a heap of wires and plastic, not a brand new pristine condition PS4.

Update: BF complained to his brother, who offered him a free xbox and some games. IDK what type but it's whichever one was before the latest one as the brother upgraded to the latest console.

Update 2: BF is saving up for a new ps4. His birthday is in September and his grandparents still send him a card with £50 in it which is already nearly half and he can budget for the rest. He says that this is probably a good thing (losing the playstation and me arguing with my sister) because now we have a reason to never babysit again.",1832,8355,0.97
982,No A-holes here,"My girlfriend recently asked me to share my location with her via google maps, not for a specific time or event but just indefinitely. She had already shared her location with me a while ago, and had explained that for her safety (we live in a city) she likes others knowing where she is, as of right now I think that list is me and her mother. I said I wasn't sure I wanted to and had a hard time having any reason for it, it just felt somehow invasive.

I'm happy/willing to let her know where I am when she asks, or sharing my location for a specific occasion if we're somewhere we may get separated in a crowd, but this somehow felt different. She mentioned that it was strange  to have an imbalance where I knew where she was while she didn't know where I was. I agree that imbalance is strange, but I had never asked to see her location, I thought she just liked the security of feeling like people could find her.

She respected that I didn't want to but I could tell it upset her, it seemed like she expected me to say 'of course'.

984,Not the A-hole,"So my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years, lived with each the last 2.5 years. He gets up every morning at 6:30, leaves at 7:30 to be at work for 8.  

We have a clock radio in our bedroom. Every morning at 6:30 regardless if he is working or not, the radio will go off. He likes to hear the local news.  The radio goes on at 6:30 and stays on for a whole hour. The problem is that I’m trying to sleep but the radio wakes me up.   

Now in the summer my work closes for 6 weeks. It’s unpaid so it’s not as glamorous as it sounds.  I always do housework and take care of our pets during the day so I don’t just sit and do nothing. 
I’ve always had trouble sleeping and it affects my mental health. Sometimes I will have a hard at night and can’t get to sleep until 1 or 2 in the morning.  My boyfriend on the other hand can fall asleep anywhere anytime. He likes to fall asleep listening to the news. It boggles me that he can fall asleep to the same thing that wakes him up. 
I get really annoyed and cranky in the morning because I want to sleep in a for a little bit longer.   

We are generally happy together. He’s my best friend and we do have a lot of fun together. The radio thing is probably one of the few things we fight about.   

I’ve asked him if he can go listen to the radio some where’s else but he likes listening to it in the bedroom.  He gets ready for work and listens to it at the same. I’ve tried putting  pillows over my head and using ear plugs to block out the noise but they do not help. My boyfriend gets mad when I do that. He says I I should learn to embrace it and get up early to become a morning person. I hate it so much though and it just sets me up to be in a cranky mood all day.  
I haven’t slept in past 7:00 in so long.  Today is the last day I have off before I go back to work. We had a big fight and I was in tears all before 8 this morning. 

Who’s being the asshole here? Should I just suck it up and learn to become one of those early risers? Maybe I’ll be one of those ppl to call in public radio and talk about the size of my tomatoes from the garden. 
Or should my boyfriend let his girl sleep for a few more minutes and go listen to his damn radio some where’s else?",82,187,0.94
985,Not the A-hole,"My long-time friend and her mother (let's call her Vicky) came to visit my baby (3m) for the first time. I do have a rule that everyone ***must*** wash their hands with hot water + soap before handling my son. We passed the baby around and he eventually ended up in Vicky's lap. Vicky then sticks her finger inside my baby's mouth, and, he, being a 3 month old, began to suck and gnaw on it.

I was so shocked I honestly froze in that moment and didn't know how to react- rip the baby away? Yell at Vicky to stop immediately? It was like I couldn't move despite feeling uncomfortable, I just physically *could not* force myself for some reason. My husband saw the whole thing, and took our son out of Vicky's arms, saying he needed to change the baby's diaper.  He didn't, however, tell off Vicky for putting her finger in our son's mouth. The visit went on normally and we had a great time.

After Vicky and her daughter left, my husband immediately starts screaming at me and accusing me of ""not having control"" over my guests. He yelled at me saying I can't be trusted anymore if I would let Vicky put her fingers in our infant son's mouth, and how he shouldn't have had to step in. I told my husband he also could have spoken up and been clear about his reason for taking the baby, since he did act.

 I feel horrible and like a failure of a mother now. Even if Vicky's hands were clean, I was uncomfortable with her actions and just felt too anxious and shocked to say anything. I don't blame Vicky for doing it, she meant no harm. My husband hasn't spoken to me since earlier tonight, beyond telling me how I'm never allowed to have guests again.

My (29m) younger brother (21m) is getting married this December and I have no interest in attending.

For context, we have no ongoing feud and never have had a ""negative"" relationship, just a rather absent one. I'm one of his two brothers, but our oldest brother has severe drug addiction problems, psychosis issues and has been excommunicated from the family for about 8 years, so long story short, I'm his only brother.

I've been away from home (out of state) since I was 20 and have only seen him about once/year since that point, along with the rest of my family. We dont talk/text in any capacity, although I tried very hard to kindle communications with him a few months ago when I moved closer to home (5hr drive), but he didnt have interest.

He started dating his first girlfriend 2 years ago and proposed at the beginning of 2019. Ive never met this girl and actually couldn't even tell you her name right now without checking Facebook. I only ever found out they were dating because my mother mentioned it and I only discovered they were engaged because of a Facebook post (and my mom text me).

I received a wedding invitation earlier this month. As expected, I'm not a groomsman in the wedding. That's to be expected at this point, I suppose. Point being is that I'm not going to be ruining what he has planned for the ceremony by not being there.

Me (21m) and my girlfriend (21f) have been dating for a bit over a year now. Despite her being a big believer in Christianity and me being an atheist, we find a lot of common ground.
She was always a big believer even though her parents weren't much,  and she attends church a lot of times throughout the week. 
I've always been a big supporter of her, however there is one thing always getting on my nerves.
She constantly prays, at every meal, when watching something sad, or she'll just do it randomly. She could pray up to 20+ times a day. 
It always gets on my nerves because I find it rude of her to just do it whilst in my presence, practically ignoring me. She sometimes asks me to pray with her but I decline, because I believe she shouldn't be pressuring me.
I brought it up to her the other day, saying how if she couldn't not do it while I'm around, because it makes me feel uncomfortable. After saying that she immediately started praying for about 10 seconds before calmly asking me to rethink what I said. 
I got quite annoyed with her and asked her if she loved me more then god, to which she immediately replied ""no"" with an astounded face.
She believes that God's relationship with her is supposed to be ""the most important"".  she then stormed off.

993,Not the A-hole,"So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.

My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

He doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

I've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.

995,Not the A-hole,"This is a long story, and I will change dates and numbers to anonimaze it a tiny bit. This story is not in the US, I am 28, my sister is 19 and my father is 64

My mother passed away a few years ago while I was working abroad. My father and my sister rushed to do all the paperwork and the funeral before I even had a chance to get back.

Once I got back I got told everything was done, and I accepted that. I know  my mother had some money, since she trusted and gave me full control over her bank accounts (she knew I would never do anything that wasn't fair) but I didn't even check, I believed my father and just wanted to move on. At that point my father claimed that everything was done and nothing belonged to me, because ""he was the one that worked"" and my mother had money of her own, since my mother was just staying home

Fast forward a few years, and naive me comes to read a bank letter and find out that, actually, the bank doesn't even know my mother passed away. I try to ask my father if he had done any of the paperwork and he assures me he has. And I ask him to come with me to see a lawyer, or someone, because I think that there is something missing. He refused that at every step.

At that point I am suspicious and inform him, and I ask a lawyer, ask a notary, start doing the paperwork and inform him that I am going to go through the paperwork. He keeps assuring me that there is nothing to do.

Well, as I am gathering all the paperwork, it turns out he hasn't done it. Part of that paperwork is a letter from each bank my mother had an account with stating how much money was in her bank account when she passed away. When I informed the bank of her death to get that paper they immediately blocked half of each account. I did not tell my father that, since the consultant I talked to said that I should wait until I do the paperwork in the notary, to prevent him taking the money.

Welp, according to my mother's testament. Half her money is mine and the other half is my sister's.

My father found out the other day that I was doing the paperwork when he noticed half the money missing on his shared bank account with my mother. He insulted me and told me that I did it on his back. My sister doesn't talk to me, and the rest of my family says I am trying to steal from my father and that ""I hated my mother"" trying to do that.

996,Not the A-hole,"My entire family was out at the mall because we have a family wedding and have been shopping for things together. My husbands side are Indian American, and I’m just white American so sometimes culture clashes do happen but usually they aren’t this divisive! 

My daughter and her cousins were going to Starbucks to get drinks. I reminded her before I gave her some cash that she’s not allowed anything with coffee in it. She was totally cool about it because she was probably going to get some cream based milkshake monstrosity anyway plus it’s always been a rule so she’s aware of it. 

A lot of my young in laws (20’s / 30’s) who are visiting from abroad absolutely couldn’t believe I don’t let my daughter drink coffee or tea (Indian tea is VERY different to American tea and is super strong) and said it was basically depriving her of a part of her culture. I laughed it off because that sounded ridiculous to me, she is immersed in her culture and not allowing her to drink coffee or strong tea when she’s a kid is hardly deprivation. 

My father in law who was next to me jumped in and said that my visiting family were being ridiculous and of course a 12 year shouldn’t be drinking coffee, and then finally my husband who had come out the restrooms whilst this debacle was happening joined the conversation and when he realized what was being said shut it down totally because the comments were starting to get a little offensive towards me. 

One of my OTHER in laws who is American like my husband and I said that it was a dumb rule anyway and she didn’t know why I was so strict about it because ‘lots of kids drink coffee’

Bf and I have been together five years, living together four and a half years, his friend moved to town about two years ago). This friend has been consistently here at least once a week the past seven months (he hangs out, we feed him, bf games with him, we let him do laundry here, he watches our cats when we're out of town, we watch his dog when he's gone etc.) but every time without fail, he lets out these crazy long belches lasting over five seconds when we're eating with him, fairly frequently throughout.

1001,Asshole,"Sort of like it says in the title. My ex-girlfriend broke up with me roughly six months back, and I've finally worked through all that and feel ready to date again-- but I get no catches at all. I've tried the dating apps, I've tried meetups, I've tried other bars, and it's like I'm anywhere ranging from invisible to slightly repulsive. It's doing a serious number on my self-esteem.

I was hanging with a couple of friends of mine, and we went to go see a performance we'd been interested in, which happened to be happening at a popular gay bar in town. When I was going up to the bar to get us drinks, I noticed I was getting a lot of looks from the guys there. My friends noticed too and were giving me some lighthearted crap for it, but I was honestly just really flattered? It felt really good to be looked at like that.

Once everyone was a little drunker, one of the guys at the bar even nudged me and joked about the fact that he knew that I was *probably* straight because lots of people that don't normally go to gay bars were there for the performance, but that he just had to give it a shot to see. I told him very sincerely that I was super flattered, but I had to get back to my friends-- I didn't tell him I wasn't gay. I guess it didn't seem important to mention, since I was 'turning him down' anyway and he'd already guessed that I was straight.

But I've been back quite a few times since. For one, it's a rad bar and the drinks are stellar, but it really does come down to the fact that I've been feeling so low and ugly and unwanted, but there I get checked out and flirted with like I'm hot stuff. It's been a gigantic confidence-booster.

I casually mentioned this to my sister, and she was completely gobsmacked. She says that's despicable of me to do, that I'm lying to and stringing along people that might have real interest, and I'm using them as 'helium to inflate my balloon' (as she says) and not thinking of them as real people with real feelings.

1004,Not the A-hole,"I met this friend nearly a decade ago. We hit it off immediately and stayed close since. One of the staples of our relationship has been honesty and openness. 

So, when they asked me to be in their wedding party, I gladly accepted. I got added to multiple group chats to organize the wedding party plans, and I made sure to keep up whenever somebody posted an update.

Fast forward a few months, two weeks before the wedding to be specific. My friend messages me telling me that they felt I hadn’t been “engaged enough” and they questioned whether I actually wanted to be in their wedding. I apologized and attempted to assure them that if my actions implied that I wasn’t interested that it was not my intention; I was genuinely excited about being a part of their special day. 

This friend gave no prior indication that they were upset or that they felt I hadn’t been engaged. It was only two weeks before the wedding that they chose to address it. At which point they decided they didn’t want me in their wedding anymore. I was seriously dumbfounded. I had no indication that anything was wrong, and the extent of involvement I could’ve had prior to the wedding was replying to the group chat, which I didn’t view as necessary because I didn’t see the majority of people actively participating. 

They didn’t particularly care for my apology or attempts to rectify the situation. They entirely ignored me and chose to remove me from all of the wedding party group chats. 

Following this, they sent me a message saying that they “hoped I would still attend as a guest.”  I replied saying that it would be humiliating and exhausting to show up and have so many people know that I was removed from the wedding party.

1005,Not the A-hole,"Hello there, I'm a 23 yo girl, my boyfriend is 25.

My bf was raised by his young single mother. At the beginning it was very hard for them, later she got a high-paying job and their life got significantly better. I admire that she managed to do this alone and raise him the good man he is now.

But that was years ago. Now, when we started dating he mentioned his mother and the way he talked about her sounded strange to me. It was like he was admiring her and at the same time he kinda acted lame about it? It was like shame, mixed with the way a kid that got caught doing something wrong would act. He acted the same way when speaking with her on the phone. 

Later in our relationship he shared more about his family. To keep it simple his mother had a few romantic relationships while he was young and when he was 13 she gave birth to his half-brother. There was a lot of drama in the relationship with the father of this kid and after some years they broke up and she was left with A LOT of debts. She then got with another man, and then another man,and another. 

She has now been with some guy for 2-3 years, she depends on him since she has no job now, they are breaking up every other week, once they brake up she calls my boyfriend to update him and be dramatic over the phone. When they get back together they are always with each other and she only calls if she needs something(that's how it looks to me, I admit I could be wrong). 

My boyfriend's half-brother has seen a lot of sh*t since he is living with her. Their mother and her now-boyfriend are arguing a lot,even fighting some times. And from what I've gathered it was the same with her previous relationships as well.

What angers me the most is that she told my boyfriend some unspeakable things when she was having her episodes,things like that she wishes he was never born and that all of her problems come from him? Who says shit like that to his own kid? And the sad part is that he defends her and says that he was not a good kid at the time? Hell, I was an awful kid and my parents never ever told me anything even close to that. 

So overall there is a lot of drama. And I hate dramatic people. I also hate women that put their romantic realtionships above everything and grown women which act like little teenagers. I have no repsect for people which don't have their life together, start a family and have babies without being financially stable. I dislike people who make thoughtless decisions. Everything his mother did, I would have done differently.

I have quite bluntly shared all of this and even more with my boyfriend. 2 days ago he told me he wants me to give chance to her, go out with them and see if this is what I really think of her. He says that I've only seen her bad side and I have to see the good one. I don't want to do that? I've heard enough to make my gudgement.

Family knows I'm financially screwed right now.  I said if he did not contact me by Sunday I will mail it.   Sister said make sure to send priority with tracking.  I was going to go cheapest route.  

Then I thought, hey I am doing guy a favor.  Somebody else could have stole the money, he would have to get new ID, (I just went through this, it sucks, and I would never do that)

I said out loud what if I just use his money to mail it, put receipt and note in package?  Brother in law was pissed called me cheap and said do the right thing and just it.  My dad scoffed and said just pay for it and do the good deed.  Three months ago before money trouble, I would have.  I am watching every penny I spend right now.

Priority mail with tracking is $10 bucks.  He lost it, small price to pay for getting it back.  It is not a ton of money, but add it to my debt, I will pay interest on it for the next 6 months as I pay this debt down. 

My mom agreed with me and it sparked a debate.  She said it would cost him more to get a new ID, a new wallet, plus time and aggravation.  He is getting off cheap. Other people said I should just pay it.  Told my brother in law he can feel free to pay for it. He got in a huff and said he was staying out of it.  

Anyway.  AITA? Should I just go in debt a bit deeper?  Would you be mad if your wallet was returned this way?

UPDATE. 
Put message on his FB and his mom’s account. He called me. He is as broke as me and can’t get at his money without ID or debit card.  Told him will mail, his address changed so glad I waited. Told him I will take out money to pay shipping 
  
He was stoked he didn’t have to cancel his card or have to go to DMV.",50,36,0.85
1010,Asshole,"background: Our baby is about 6 weeks old. Our prenatal class, doctors, and nurses all said that breastmilk is one of only a few factors that can reduce the chance of SIDS. We both wanted our baby to be breastfed. My wife had a difficult delivery with complications that prevented her from breastfeeding or pumping initially.I'm trying to be fair, but I'm sure my bias is going to show through a bit, so take my story with a grain of salt (of course).

My wife asked me out of the blue if I was disappointed in her for not feeding our baby breastmilk, and I answered honestly that I am, since it didn't seem like she was trying to find a comfortable way to pump, but that it isn't a big deal to me since we're using high quality formula, and most importantly, **its not my body** so I don't get a say in the matter anyways.

It blew up into a big fight, with her saying that I have no right to be disappointed, since I'm not in her shoes and I don't know the full situation... and me saying that I wasn't planning on pressuring her to breastfeed anyways so I didn't bother to validate my assumptions, she is the one who suddenly asked and I just answered honestly to the best of my ability.

AITA?

edit:to address a common comment - its not that I didn't think she was trying hard enough to be a good mother. Its not that she wasn't breastfeeding or pumping. Its that we were given resources (like a contact to a lactation clinic) to use, and it didn't *seem* like she had any interest in using those resources to try to make breastfeeding or pumping more tolerable... or even ask me to book an appointment at the clinic. I didn't want to do it myself in case it seemed like I was pressuring her. If we looked into it, and found that breastfeeding or pumping just weren't feasible, that would be fine and I wouldn't be disappointed at all.Maybe she was actually using the resources while I was asleep and not telling me, but since the answer didn't matter (until she asked), I didn't find out.

I don't really think that my wife is the asshole here, I totally understand how my answer would make her upset, but I didn't want to lie either... I'm just hoping that I'm not an asshole either.  


edit 2:  
I'm the ass. I've realized that I made 3 huge mistakes.  
1) my wife wanted reassurance, I shouldn't have been such a pedant about the question.  
2) avoiding the issue of breastfeeding to avoid pressuring her wasn't considerate, it was stupid. We weren't on the same page, serious disconnect between us.  
3) the disappointment was my own fault. If we had of spoken about breastfeeding openly from the start, we would have been on the same page and there wouldn't have been any disappointment.

I've handled the whole situation like a true asshat.",255,162,0.78
1011,No A-holes here,"This happened several years ago but it still haunts me to this day.

I had finished running some errands and decided to stop by a local pie shop that sells personal sized sweet and savory pies for an easy dinner and dessert. There were about 3 people in line in front of me when I walked in and, with two people still in front of me in line, a little old white haired lady and a girl who couldn't be over 5 years old walked in on, presumably, a grandma granddaughter date.

Now instead of waiting in the queue for their turn to pick their pies, the grandmother excitedly marches up to the glass case and presses her face on the glass like you'd expect a young child to do while the young girl simply hovered behind in a more reserved but still kid-in-a-pie-shop happy way. Realizing that she is preventing the people in front of her from viewing the case and ordering, the grandma steps out of the way and gets in line. Just before it's my turn to order, I can hear the grandmother ask the girl, ""Oooooohhh!  Which pie are you going to get sweetheart?!"" to which the girl replies, ""Bluebewwy!"" in an excited chirp and then they both giggled and cooed together, seriously.

Being a regular at this pie shop, I had tried most varieties and established my favorites. I knew that I was going to order a sausage pie, a pie of the month, and a blueberry pie before I even walked in.  It wasn't uncommon to have to deviate your order as they make everything daily and ran out of everything at some point during the day. Overhearing the girl and then suddenly seeing that there was only one blueberry pie left in the case put me at a major crossroad, I could either pretend I didn't hear her and just place my order or I could be a silent hero and order something else.

I looked in the case, the only sweet pies left were custard(meh), chocolate(too rich), and the lone blueberry(my favorite). ""Fuck it,"" I thought to myself as I placed my order as I originally intended, ""I was in line first and the lady was kind of rude for barging to the front instead of respecting the line. Don't count your chickens before they hatch!"". The woman at the counter had obviously heard the little girl's reply as her body language instantly revealed her mind was racing about how best to handle the awkward situation, but she just bagged up my order and politely told me to have a nice day.

I turned around and the sweet old lady had turned into a dagger-eyed goblin boiling with rage, still confined to her fragile frame and speechless with flabbergastedness. I walked out as quickly as I could but I overheard the young girl ordering ""Bluebewwy"" and the woman behind the counter having to tell her there aren't any left and my heart shrank a bit as I walked out the door with pies in hand but less hungry than before. I enjoyed the pies but I have been waffling over whether or not I was the asshole for ordering what I wanted instead of something else just because the little girl behind me wanted it.",136,416,0.91

1013,Not the A-hole,"Some colleagues and I have been using an open plan co-working space and people have stuck up signs around the main workspace saying this is a “Quiet” space. Now having worked in open plan offices a lot I understand the need to be respectful of excessive noise. No loud or long phone conversations, open mic Skype meetings, use earphones etc… you know normal polite behaviour. 

The issue we have is we are a team of three people working on a project and there will need to be a normal amount of communication between us, answer the odd phone call etc.. But there are a couple people who seem to have interpreted this open space as a silent study area like in a University library. Even as much as asking a colleague to go for coffee gets a shouting interruption form across the room that this is a quiet space.   

Now I understand that some people work best in silence, but my opinion is this is an open space for co-working, you choose to be here or not.

Today, while walking home from work, I saw one of my bikes with someone who is homeless. It has had a few modifications, and was in better shape then when it was stolen.

To be honest, I probably wouldn’t have used the bike much, and I’m financially well off. But I feel frustrated that someone has stole something from a private property. I’m also concerned that this will be a recurring thing. 

Am I the asshole for contemplating ways to get my bike back from a homeless person?  I’m unsure if this person stole it, but I’m 100% sure that it’s my bike.

1015,Not the A-hole,"I am on vacation this week with my family at a beach that is known for loggerhead sea turtle nesting. This is the prime time for nests to start hatching and around 100 turtles make their way to the ocean.

Tonight was extremely exciting because my wife and I came upon a group of people watching a nest that had movement and turtles were going to scramble out.

This is where the problem starts. A homeowner, Jane, and her children are watching with their red lights spotlighting directly into the opening. Jane is acting like a turtle expert and giving information about the entire process. Since the process is taking a long time she said there must have been a crab eating the hatchlings.

Jane starts moving what appears to be dead sea turtles off the top of the nest and gently tossing them aside. Within seconds an explosion of turtles pop up and start making their way out. Now the children are making a barrier with their hand to force the turtles toward the ocean.

Their red lights are still trained on the nest and they start to follow the turtles around the beach. Instead of moving out of the way they are guiding the turtles by either blocking them from heading up the beach or carrying them to the water.

I called the cops because the turtles are protected by federal law and cannot be disturbed. I was told by the cops that the Department of Natural Resources was going to write tickets to each of them and it was going to be ""a steep fine"".

I know these people have good intentions and want the best for the turtles. I also know that loggerheads are endangered and should have special care to make sure the species thrives. Did I screw up by calling the cops and potentially costing them a ton of money?

I forgot to add that the nests are roped off and have a sign that says something to the effect of protected by the DNR. It is an offense to handle or interfere with the turtles.",121,736,0.94

1018,Not the A-hole,"My Aunt was a stay at home mum when my cousins, siblings and I were growing up. Both our families grew up together with Dad and Uncle working the same farm. Neither of our families was well off but my mum worked as a nurse growing up to give me and my sibling's extra things. My Aunt has always been jealous of the things my mother bought us and always made backhanded comments about how things that we had (eg our family computer) belonged to the farm and should be used by everybody. She would often gossip about how my mum abandoned us alone at home and how mothers shouldn’t work while raising children etc and overall was just plain nasty to my mum. 

Anyway, now all of us kids are adults and moved out of our parents and my mum passed away 2 years ago. We were all at a family dinner for my cousin who is pregnant when the topic of when my cousin would go back to work came up. Out of nowhere Aunt starts another monologue about how mothers shouldn’t work and how it messes the child up and how women who work as mothers only do it because they want expensive things. I am pissed and ask her directly whether she thinks the same about my mum. Aunt backtracks a bit but still says that my mother shouldn’t have worked when we were kids. At this point, I am holding back using some very expressive words and say that my mother worked to give us kids opportunities in life instead of demanding money for doing absolutely nothing and  I asked what my Aunts excuse is now for not working because both her kids have moved out. My Aunt is embarrassed and my brother, sister and I leave the dinner.

1019,Everyone Sucks,"So my name is Evelyn (female), pronounced Ev-uh-lyn. I have a coworker, John, who is from England. He's been pronouncing my name in the way I assume is the English way, ""Eve. Lin."" The first couple times I forgave him for it because I assumed it was just cross-ocean confusion. Sort of like how Americans and Brits spell certain words differently, color/colour, etc.

But now it's been a year and a half of me telling him the proper pronunciation and he persists in calling me by the wrong pronunciation. I've gone to management, to HR, we've had meetings, I've spoken to him, he refuses to call me by my correct name. I know it's not a huge issue but it's not my name. That would be like calling someone named Jerry ""Garry"" simply because J and G can make the same sound.

His name is John. Plain old John. A lovely name. My son's name. However, I know Jack is an acceptable nickname for John. So I've started calling him Jack. Apparently he hates the name Jack. He let it slide twice before he came to me and spoke to me and requested I call him John and only John. I gave him the same response he gives me ""of course, my apologizes, will make right in future."" I thought maybe he'd take a hint but he keeps calling me the wrong pronunciation.

So I continued calling him Jack. He took me to HR with the issue where HR promptly ignored my previous complaint, despite my paper trail of emails to the contrary. Eventually they capitulated that I had raised the issue first but I still got a write-up for creating a toxic and unfriendly work atmosphere.

Now I'm just not speaking to John unless necessary and I refuse to use a name when talking to him at all. And when we email or text I've been signing my emails with ""regards"" which I've read is considered a stern and rude way to end correspondence to the English.

Despite the fact that it made my coworkers laugh they all agreed that while John is a bigger asshole, I'm also an asshole for adding to the issue.

I'm curious, was I right or was an ass?

ETA: John can pronounce my name the correct way. The first few times I spoke to him and gave him the correct pronunciation he recited it flawlessly, no issue. He can do it he chooses not to.",126,66,0.85

1026,Not the A-hole,"I wanted to post because I kind of got into an argument with someone and now our mutual friends are saying I was a dick. 

I'm having a party at my place in a week or two, nothing big but it should be fun. So I was inviting a group of people, and after we chatted about it one girl, more of an acquaintance said ""what are the vegan options?"" And I told her I was making guac and a veggie plate. Then she asked if I was making a vegan entree, and I said I was just making the one entree, though she was welcome to bring something. 

She then told me that it was extremely rude not to offer a full meal that was vegan or make the entree vegan. I'm making pad thai with homemade sauce, can't do that without fish sauce. She told me it was insensitive because I was making everything gluten free, but I called her on that bullshit. My fiance has celiac disease, and unlike veganism that's not a choice, and we just automatically expect to bring him his own thing. That seemed to only piss her off more and my friends told me it was unreasonable of me to call her veganism a ""something you were chosing to do"" vs an allergy. 

TBH I don't want to make her something specialty. I don't even like vegan cooking and while I think people can make whatever silly dietary choices they want, I'm not making a special entree for one person out of 15. If someone else told me they don't like thai food I wouldn't change everything around.


Edit: 

I want to clarify some common things. 
1. She's not really my friend, she's dating my buddy and he's bringing her 

2. I probably shouldn't have said ""silly"" I wrote this post soon after it happened and I was pretty mad because she essentially said ""well you're making things gluten free for [fiance], you should at least make me a vegan entree

3. I am making a ton of food in like 4 hours, so making a vegan dish for 1 person is kind of a pain

4. I know a lot of people think I should just change the menu, but I'm just making my fiance's favorite foods (note that guac, pad thai, and gluten free cake don't really make sense). The dinner party is because his best friend is driving down like 7 hours to come visit him. I don't care if I'm the asshole, I'm not changing the whole menu. I might make a seperate dish, but I'm not changing the way I make pad thai. The party is not for her. 

5. I am a lady. Not a big deal, just needed to clarify.


Update: 

So, I've been texting her boyfriend and our friends and, after some negotiations, we decided to order her in from a local Mediterranean place. Having to sell her on getting bought a free meal from a non-cheap restaurant was exceedingly irritating, but this is my friend's girlfriend. So, with the promise of the $24 ""veggie platter"" and free booze I was able to calm down a very upset vegan 21 year old. Who'd have thought. Ultimately, sorry guys, it wasn't reddit that changed things, my other friend called and we talked about trying to make the vegan girlfriend feel extra welcome since she's new and she's younger and she probably just wants to fit in. 

I know some of you were hoping for me to tell her to fuck off, or conversely were hoping I would get told to fuck off, but sadly there seems to be a peaceful solution.

I understand modesty, but a girl wore shorts that were fingertip length - the rule I was told just the other day. I was sent home and missed an hour of work just to change.

They told me I didn’t know what that meant, then told me to not ever bring it up again unless I wanted to be grounded. It made me scared to date, and I haven’t even tried to date anyone all because of this.

Then it was; “I’m not there most of the week, so that changes things a bit.” I asked him which it was and he said that it’s a mix of both. So be it. I just can’t shake the feeling that he wasn’t expecting me to have an issue with them splitting the other half of expenses between themselves and I’d still cover my half like before.

Am I an asshole for even bringing this up? I feel like he’s bummed on me for even asking. Just worried I guess...",65,34,0.92

1039,Not the A-hole,"Hey... So.


I was supposed to give a small presentation to my class about usage and maintenance of public spaces.

I was talking about it and got on the topic on people littering, and I wanted to explain how it's a big problem in poorer areas because people don't think that they ""own"" those public spaces/lack of a social conscience, so they just throw their trash anywhere they see easier.

but as I was starting to explain that, I got cut off by 2 girls in class who started talking on how I was ""Wrong"" and got destroyed by every classmate.


Now I'm the guy who said poor people are dumb and filthy (even though it was not what I said).

I was trying to explain how since people in poor areas usually have a lack of public service, they don't think they ""own"" those public spaces, so they don't take care about it/create a social conscience.
this is what I said and meant.


but they just went right past it and to the ""you hate poor people""

I was just explaining the slide and mentioned that to get to my point (that if public services where readily available) people would take better care of their parks and city

I feel awful and honestly don't wanna go back to class tomorrow.

1040,Not enough info,"This happened last week and it's just something I've been turning over in my head since it happened.

My girlfriend (Kate) and I went out to dinner the other day with my brother and sister. We decided on a popular Korean chicken-wing chain called Bonchon. When you walk in there's multiple TV's playing mostly Korean music videos with the occasional football game on one or two of the TV's. I was seated facing the wall with an easy view of both the music videos and the football games.

Everything is fine until we get our food and the conversation essentially dies between the 4 of us as we eat. The TV's catch my eye and I'm honestly just zoning out and flicking between watching the music videos and football while eating. Everyone is glued to to their phones and not making much conversation at all save for a comment on the food or the football going on, but everytime someone talks I make sure to at least respond in some way and even try and start some conversation once or twice to no avail.

We pay and leave and as I'm talking to my girlfriend on the ride home she said she's upset and we'll talk about it when we get home. When we get home she explodes at me saying I was drooling over these half dressed girls in the music videos in front of her and not partaking in any of the conversation with my siblings and her. I'm confused, trying to explain to her there was practically no conversation at all during dinner and she was basically on her phone the whole time so what was I supposed to do? And while I think the girls in the video are conventionally attractive I would hardly consider casually watching them and football ""drooling"". 

If I try hard I can kinda see her point of view but I'm just curious of Reddit's opinion. Thanks!",13,45,0.91
1041,Not the A-hole,"Background: My girlfriend is very body positive. We've been dating for about 9 months, and we recently discussed her artistic photos. She has a friend who does rigging for BDSM photos. She had let him tie her up in the past while she was topless. She assured me it wasn't sexual, and that he was respectful. He is married but they are swingers. The photos are recreation and have nothing to do with her employment.

She believes I am stifling her creativity and I am the one who is sexualizing the activity when it isn't sexual. She believes it is a problem I need to unpack and get over myself. I know I'm not comfortable with it at all. I feel if I give in and she does topless bondage shoots and posts them to instagram I'll just resent her and poison the relationship. I am not a controlling person, but I know what I am and am not comfortable with. I told her if it is not something she is willing to give up we probably aren't compatible long-term. 

I did say I was fine with her doing bondage shots if a straight woman was doing the rigging, but she insists it is something I need to get over. I know I can trust her and she said I can come with her, but it doesn't sit right with me and I don't know if I can ever get over that.

1042,Asshole,"I'll be honest, I'm 90% sure I'm the asshole here but I figure I will just see what the internet thinks.

&#x200B;

The building where I work has a cafeteria in it. It's the kind of place where you go walk around and get your food then bring it up to the cashier who looks at what you got and rings you up. I always go at pretty much the exact same time and get the same size/type of coffee to drink. To the point where pretty much all the workers there know me and simply just prepare the drink once they see me walk in. I know exactly how much it costs, and so I always have the exact amount ready to pay for it so that way the cashiers can just take it and I can be on my merry way.

&#x200B;

It started when I was waiting in line one day when one of the cashiers was walking by and just told me to give her my money since she knew I had it. This kinda kept happening, and then eventually I just started walking up past the line, putting the exact change on the table in front of them. They would smile and nod at me and then I'd get back to work with my coffee.

My friend said I was an asshole for doing this, since even though I go fast, lines are just kindof a universally sucky thing and it's a dick move to cut it for any reason. The cashiers seemed fine with it and I don't feel as though me doing this was really affecting their ability to ring up other customers.

So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn’t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn’t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it’s extremely concerning that he’s so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn’t hurt her, she was following me, I didn’t use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn’t answer.


Update: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn’t do anything wrong,she didn’t hurt my brother and it wasn’t her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her.

She’s in college and she’s been basically ignoring me all day. Shed text me maybe 3 worded conversations and I’d get left on read for hours since about 8 am. Her reasoning was that she had classes all day. 

I got curious, it’s like 3:00 at the time and I go to see her location, just to see what she’s up to. She’s at a restaurant, no biggie. Until she texts me:

“When you come visit tomorrow can you jump my car? I can’t find anyone with jumper cables around here and I have to walk to class”

Odd. How was she at a restaurant in the city if her dorm is across the campus without a car?

I figured she went with a friend or something so I let it go. Kind of bothered that she’s just fine with letting me kick rocks all day and not speak to her. 

At around 4 she calls me. 

“Sorry I was in class the entire time.” 

I was fed up, so I said calmly and maturely:
“You were at a restaurant all the way across town.”

### “what do you mean” 

“Well you share your location with me always, I got curious and looked. I saw you were at a restaurant.”

She then got super rude. 

“Stalking my location? I guess YOU don’t trust a single bit of me? So what if I was at a restaurant! Why do you care!”

So calmly again I said:

“Because you said you don’t have a car at the moment. You also just told me you were in class the entire time.” 

She hangs up. I haven’t spoken to her for the rest of the day. I’m not exactly sure what I did.

EDIT: Let’s clarify a bit, Checking her location once because I wanted to know why she’s been ignoring me all day is far from stalking.

1058,Not the A-hole,"Throw away account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

I'm married to a wonderful woman who is the love of my life. We have been married for several years now, and about 6 months ago, her oldest sister whom she hasn't spoken to or heard from for nearly 12 years suddenly came back into her life.

&#x200B;

Her sister married a man who is a known drug abuser. This man has been arrested multiple times for possession and distribution of cocaine. They also had 3 small children together, oldest being 8, youngest is 3. Earlier this year, the husband lost his job as a cook for McDonald's due to using cocaine during working hours and they ended up being evicted from their home since they missed too many payments for their rent. They moved in with my in-laws, under the circumstance that they would find a place within 3 months time. Well, 3 months came and went and they still didn't' find a place to live. The husband was working as a part-time cook for a local restaurant, until a few weeks ago he was fired for using cocaine again. My wife's sister refuses to work because ""her kids are her job"".

&#x200B;

So my wife's family live on the eastern coast of Florida, about 20 minutes from the beach. My wife and I reside in Central Florida, we recently purchased a new home and are planning on having children soon. We are both financially stable with decent-paying jobs. My in-laws, whom I love very dearly are asking if Hurricane Dorian gets above Category 2, if they could stay with us, since we are more in-land.

&#x200B;

If it was just the in-laws, I would have no problem with them staying, we have plenty of room. However, my deadbeat sister and her drug-abusing husband is another story. Besides my in-laws, they have no other place to stay for the hurricane, and they also have 3 small children. My wife is saying that we should just house them and then send them away after the hurricane passes. What I am worried about if we do shelter them during the storm, they will demand that we let them move in, as they did with my in-laws. We also live in a good neighborhood and I don't want a known drug addict under my roof.

&#x200B;

I told my wife I do not want them under my roof under any circumstance. I told her that it is unfortunate that they lost their home, but they chose to do what they did. I don't feel I am responsible for looking out for them when they obviously do not care about anyone but themselves.

&#x200B;

What harms me the most about this are the children who are innocent in this whole debacle. I told my wife that I would gladly house them during the storm, but not her sister or the husband.

1060,Not the A-hole,"I have a neighbor on my street, about 5 houses down, who does mobile detailing and detailing out of his driveway. Until last week, I had seen and waved to him a handful of times, but we never spoke.

Last week I'm driving when he waves me down. Initially he just starts chatting me up about my truck. Our trucks are very similar and I mention how I'm always impressed with the immaculate paint on his. He tells me to hold on and runs to his driveway to grab his detailing bag. I'm just sitting in the middle of the residential street, but it's a quiet street so no big deal. He hands me his business card, and starts showing me the products he uses. It's half a sales pitch, but he looked genuinely excited to meet his neighbor and show off his business.

He tells me I should observe him apply this wax coating product he uses and he starts walking to his truck. I say ""do you want me to get out and come take a look?"" to which he replies ""if you'd like!"" and I respond ""let me park first"" -- I put my truck into reverse and turn the wheel to back up against the curb. I start reversing and hear a loud CRUNCH and see him running back out into the street yelling ""noooo!!!""

Apparently this dude thought to leave his detailing bag leaning against my front tire! Real smart. I crushed a bunch of cleaning products but he was focused on his glasses and how he just got them and they are $300 prescription glasses. He looks mad at himself and maybe mad at me but is trying to hide it. He keeps going ""it's ok, it's ok, mistakes happen"" and still wants me to come check out 'how his product works.

I park and walk over. He still has a smile but every few seconds he's going 'ah shit ah fuck' under his breath -- I leave telling him I'm sorry for running over his glasses but I'll give him business and in touch soon to make a detailing appointment.

Fast forward to today. He waves me down again while I'm driving, all smiles. Says something along the line of ""Hey bud, I checked with my insurance and they won't cover the glasses. It's going to be $500 *($200 more than he had originally said)*, do you think you could give me $100 toward it?"" Before I could give any sort of real response a car was coming and he said ""we can talk later, it doesn't have to be today or anything."" I told him I would be in touch soon for a detailing and kind of ignored the $100 thing, but I got the feeling he inferred I would be willing to.

Now, I don't feel I owe this man anything. I'm not the one who left valuables in the middle of the road against the tire of a running vehicle. HOWEVER, I will have to see this man a lot; because of his business he always seems to be in his driveway and he can spot my truck from a mile away. It seems like maybe the non-asshole thing to do is just help him out with his glasses and be done with it and not have to worry about awkward interactions every time I pass him.

So, WIBTA if I just ignore the situation? What do I even say the next time he flags me down?

I live in a not so great neighborhood with my husband but at the moment its all we can afford. Its not horrible and dangerous but there have been a few robberies, a couple muggings, one sexual assult, and a few carjackings over the last few months.

My mother comes over once a week to visit. She likes to help me around the house because im in the early stages of pregnancy and ive been very sick.

I keep telling her she needs to lock her car when she visits otherwise she risks getting it stolen. She is convinced im lying about how bad the neighborhood is and continues to leave her car unlocked with her purse inside.

She has money so its a really nice, really flashy car. Ive seen people eyeing it up when i walk her out at night.

So the other day she came over and in thr backseat was this new flat screen tv for my dad's birthday. Still in the box, big red bow, not even wrapped. And her fucking Prada bag in the front seat. I told her to move the tv to the trunk and get her purse before locking the door but she refused, said nothing would happen.

She was helping me paint and accidentally spilled paint thinner on herself so i offered her my shower and some clothes. While she was in the shower i went downstairs.

She had left her keys on the driver seat so i started her car and moved it around the corner and locked it. I hid the keys on my person and went upstairs like nothing had happened.

When she was ready to leave and saw her car was missing she absolutely lost her mind. Hit the ground, clutching her chest, snotty sobbing and hyperventilating. Started screaming for police assistance. My husband was unaware of what i had done and brought her some water and managed to calm her down.

I asked her if she had left her car unlocked and she said yes and the keys were inside. She was freaking the hell out something awful. I asked her if this had taught her anything. She admitted my neighborhood was terrible and she should have listened.

So i pulled the keys out and led her to her car. She realized what happened and looked at me with murder in her eyes. She called me all sorts of names, cursed me, and sped off.

But I've apologized several times and she iant responding so I've done all I feel I can do. But someone made a good point: if she's this cavalier about her things then how will she be when my child is born? Will she stop her naivete or will her actions affect my child? She was a loving mother but she was very very unprepared for the real world and I was hurt several times by her unwillingness to learn.

ETA: in the event mom's car was actually stolen she's the type of person who blames others for her misfortune. If it had been some toughie who stole her car in her eyes it would have been my fault regardless of my warnings because ""you choose to live here"" ""you should have just locked it for me"".

1065,No A-holes here,"So I’m at this buffet where you pick out raw ingredients and then get in line to have your food cooked. The line extends around a large round stove  where there is a large round counter top that surrounds the cooks and stove where you are supposed to put your bowl of raw ingredients.

There were like 3 people at the end of this circle countertop and then a massive gap of space where two old ladies at the beginning of the line, standing there, waiting for their food to be taken. As a result, my gf and I who were standing directly behind them, along with 6 others behind us, had to hold their bowls overflowing with raw chicken and sauce in their hands. I didn’t want to bother them or cause a scene by giving them orders, so I just decided to go up to the counter and put my bowl down. One of the cooks immediately took my bowl and started cooking it. The old ladies yelled out, “aren’t we next!?” The cook went and took their bowls and once they moved down the line, everyone moved all the way down and put their bowls down on the counter (which the old ladies were stopping all of them from doing).

In my opinion everyone who was on line should have followed behind me, because why were those two ladies just standing at the beginning of the line? Like, move up...

OR the chef could have just ignored me and taken the old ladies bowls first. I wouldn’t have been mad. I just wanted to put my bowl down. 

As I write this, other people on the line have moved all the way down to the end of the line with everyone able to rest their bowl on the counter. This is how it should be.

Edit: Low key...I’m thinking, a lot of the time the chefs will ask patrons to move down. When I went to the end of the line she grabbed my bowl really quickly (and gf). Almost as a thank you for doing the right thing.

Also want to make clear my personal intention was just to put the bowl down, especially with my gf nagging my ear about them not moving. The cooks could have taken the old ladies food before mine if they wanted to, except they didn’t, I wonder why.

1068,Asshole,"So I work in the restaurant industry as a baker for a major franchise at a very busy location. I work a 9 and half hour shift most days some are shorter but not by much. I often stay and work over time because they are understaffed so my 9 and half hour shift usually turns into a 10 hour or more shift. On Friday I had plans to go to a weekend event and my ride was leaving at 3. I of course needed time to have  a shower after work as baking is hot work. I informed my manager in the morning that I would have to leave on time she assured me it would be fine. All is good or so I thought for as I go to punch out the other manager looks at me and says ""so is everything ready to go?"" I responded ""doesn't matter, I'm leaving."" she says ""it does matter"" Then I said ""don't care write me up then."" Well sure enough come today next time I see her she's written me up for it.

1069,Asshole,"A week or two ago, my girlfriend and I bought a pizza from a small-scale local pizza place. We really liked it, so I went to their website and signed up for their loyalty program. When I got the email from them, I noticed there was a referral section. It said that I can refer friends to sign up for their loyalty program and get 25 points for each referral. Immediately I started to wonder how well it was made and if I could cheese the system. 

&nbsp; 

Clicking the ""refer a friend"" link takes me to a page where I fill out a first name and email for 5 friends. I make up random first names and emails using a disposable email generator, yopmail. I check the inbox of the first fake email I gave. There was an email from the pizza place that read ""Your friend John Doe invited you to sign up for your loyalty program"". I clicked the ""sign up"" link and all it asked for was a name and email. So, again, I wrote the random name and fake email to complete sign up. Then I instantly get an email to my personal email that said ""Thanks for referring Jane Doe. We credited your account with 25 points!"". I check the first email and it says I need 100 to redeem for a pizza. So I did this whole process twice, referring 10 total fake people. My account had 250 points, or 2.5 free pizzas. I feel like a champion. I can fuel my poor dietary habits for free?! I'm down! 

&nbsp; 

I tell my girlfriend that we're having pizza again, and this time it's for free. She asks how, and I explain the whole thing. She starts telling me I'm an asshole for taking advantage of a broken referral system, especially a referral system for a small local pizza place. I told her it's a symbiotic thing; I help the pizza place by discovering flaws in their referral system, and they reward me with free pizza. Win-win. Am I the asshole?

&nbsp; 

edit: I did this last night. I haven't been doing it for months and redeemed hundreds of dollars of free pizza. One pizza, about $18 or so. They'll be fine. I can still call them and tell them about it. I haven't ruled it out. I know I'm still an AH though. Just thought this was worth adding.

&nbsp; 

edit: I have since sent a message via their ""contact us"" page on their website. Told them about their referral system, and suggested they require a purchase to credit points for referrals, or block disposable email domains such as yopmail. I doubt I'll get a response, but will update if I do.",196,244,0.86

Were both into tattoos and have a good few, so we both want to honor our child (and hopefully three other future children) with some ink. When talking about it the other day, she said she wants to do names+birthdates, but that she would put the name of the kid she previously miscarried and the date of the miscarriage above our child’s. The miscarriage happened six years ago before I met her with an ex. I know losing a kid was tough on both of them. I also know he’s had a kid since and will still refer to himself as having two kids - the one with my wife and one with his gf now. My wife has kind of followed that, she doesn’t call our child her first and says the one she lost always will be. 

I’m not trying to be the guy whose upset because his wife had a life before him, but I feel weird about her putting the name her and her ex gave the miscarried child on the same level as our child, in a tattoo. I told her that and she got kind of mad and upset at me. I know she thinks of the miscarried child as as much her child as ours, but to me it’s different bc that child never lived, and our kid won’t ever meet that kid. I don’t know if this is just bc it’s not my child though, and I need to shut up and just accept it. 

I have no problem with her getting other tattoos for her miscarried child, I don’t think those are any of my business and I totally support that.

1072,Not the A-hole,"Edit: So a couple of details I wanted to add. First, N's maternal grandparents are not in the running in this custody dispute. Currently, they are not even capable of providing for N as their home was foreclosed on 3 months ago & they've had to severely downsize since then. This is literally the only reason B has her own place/a job now with N living with her full time instead of the grandparents. I am also not capable of providing guardianship for N due to both health issues & insufficient income. 

As far as the custody dispute goes: A wants shared custody, with visitation from Thurs-Tues every other week. B wants to minimize A's visitation rights as much as possible & limit it to supervised visits only. She also wants mandated child support w/ backpay.

Let me be clear, I think they're both trying to be good parents - but they're definitely not trying their hardest & neither of them is very good. They've both disparaged each other in front of N, and/or made her uncomfortable expressing her affections to either parent while in the presence of both. They both have seriously short comings that have caused emotional trauma/hardship for N. Both parents have been investigated by CPS (presumably because they called on each other), both have been asked to submit to drug tests ( though I'm not sure if either ever did), & both have been given warnings by CPS social workers, though nothing much seems to have come from any of it so far as I know. I've always tried to keep clear of their conflicts with each other & remain  a neutral party for N.

I'm grateful for the advice on contacting a GAL or CASA, but I don't know if N was ever appointed one or how I would contact them discretely if they exist. I definitely don't want either parent perceiving me as picking a side & being the enemy, as both have tried to persuade me in past matters using N as a token of persuasion & threatening to cut me out of her life.",102,714,0.93

1074,Not the A-hole,"So I'm 16 years old, I grew up with my mom telling me my dad was working in another country and he was very busy so we couldn't visit him. I used to write him letters, send drawings, postcards and so on. I got letters and presents from him on my birthday and Christmas.

When I was 9 a mean cousin told me that my dad was in prison and I was the daughter of a criminal. I ran to my mother and he confirmed it, which shattered my world (on top of being bullied by my cousins). I stopped sending letters and threw away the letters and presents I got from him.  

A couple of years later I looked him up and learned that he was imprisoned for a robbery gone wrong, he and an accomplice were robbing a store, one of the patrons tried running away and they shot him in the back. They were lucky he didn't die, but still were given a hefty prison sentence. I realized that he had been in prison for longer than I had existed, so I went to my mom and she confirmed that I was conceived during a conjugal visit, which made things even worse for me.  

My mom has been in contact with him the whole time, and happily announced that he's due to be released in a couple months, and as her husband, he's going to come and live with us.  
I told her that I don't want to have anything to do with this man, I don't want to talk to him, interact with him in anyway or even look at him, I've never even talked to him in person, nor has he ever contributed to my life in any way, so I consider him a stranger, and a criminal one at that.  
My mom said tough luck, I'm living in her house rent free, still a minor and I have no say in all of this. So I asked around and I found an aunt willing to take me in and pay for my sustenance, just so I don't have to be near this guy.  

Now my mom is saying I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance, but I don't feel like I have to, he's a criminal, not a petty one but he tried to kill someone, and besides I was lied to for several years and only learned the truth because of someone else.

My cousin and I are both university students, we both are vegetarian but I don't get picky when food contains eggs in it. Like cake, cookies and stuff. But my cousin is strictly vegetarian and avoids eggs and reads every package to see if he can eat it.

And he is really proud to do so and my mom also compares me to him and says look he doesn't do that and this and so on.

Thought out our university years we always grab bagels from Tim Hortons since its easy and convenient. I recently found out all their bakery products contain eggs.

My cousin currently isn't in the same city as me we had different terms but starting next week we will be and I just want to tell him ""hey you can't eat anything from Tims"".

Literally some days when everything is closed, a 24 hours Tim Hortons is what saved us through exams.

1084,Everyone Sucks,"TL/DR at bottom 

I'm 20 years old, my brother is 24. We both live at home. We both have full time jobs. My brother is a data scientist, I own a business. We each, individually, make more than our parents combined income ever was.

Mom got very successful (millions in assets) by being EXTREMELY frugal.

Sure, I spend more than I should,  but I save $1000 a week, every week. I'm doing my best while still enjoying myself. I project that in the start of next year, I'll be buying my first home. Here's where the problem starts. 

My mother loves to snoop around our rooms while we're at work. She opens drawers and moves shit around, to the point where I can't find important things like my social security card, passport, or titles to my vehicles. She also likes to throw shit, that she deems useless, away. I can't even compute the value of things she's thrown away. From expensive headphones to SSDs, things that weren't even in plain sight: in the garbage. She's opened my mail, taken cash from my special stash (she's always paid me back, but not the point). It's utterly ridiculous! I have spoken to her about this snooping maybe 8 separate times over months, and my brother, the same. She doesn't listen. 

Now, to make matters worse, she wants to charge us rent! This is where the screaming starts. I told her that the second she starts charging rent, I'm moving out. It's not because I think it's unfair she's charging rent, it's because 1) all previous issues would persist and 2) it's a bullshit tactic she's using to try and teach us a lesson about spending, so that we'd save for a home instead. For the amount of money I make, I'm saving a great amount. The only reason I haven't bought my own place by now is because this is my second year working full time. I'm waiting for this year's tax forms to reflect income before starting the loan process. I scream all this at her. 

Last night, my father comes up to me and talks to me about it all. He said I was a bit excessive with her and it really bothered her.

Am I the asshole? 

TL/DR: Me (20) and my brother (24) live with our parents. We both work full time and do very well in our respective fields. Our mother constantly screams at us about not saving enough money to buy our own properties. She goes through our rooms while we work. She's thrown expensive electronics away, she's opened mail, she's questioned why we have things that she wouldn't know we have unless she were snooping. She's misplaced my passport, social security card and my vehicle titles a bunch of times. I've confronted her many times about it, to no avail. Now she wants to charge us rent so we get smart about saving while we know good and well that the constant invasion of privacy will continue. I screamed at her over it all and told her that the second she starts charging rent, I'm moving out, because that completely disincentives my whole reason for living at home and putting up with her shit: saving money.",128,132,0.89

I've a friend of 3 years and I always knew she had something going on. She would always talk about her abusive parents, her shitty abusive raltionships, anger issues, depression and etc,,, We were good friends up until recently and she would often self proclaimed herself as my best friend to others.

She would get very dramatic and verbally aggressive whenever I would do something she wouldn't like and would always demand more time with her once I started drifting away from her.

We were always really close, and because of uni spend almost everyday together but since I got work, a bf, and my course was generally more work intensive than hers (I do Computer technologies, she does Arts). She would panic saying I'm leaving her, that I hate her, and that I'm replacing her with my bf. Those always came in small episodes but they were really frequent almost twice a week. I felt burnt out from trying to help her, and she would always end up third wheeling us making me dread spending time with my boyfriend.

She spend time with my group of friends, since she couldn't make any in her course. And they soon began disliking her and often avoiding her because she would be very controlling of their humour and conversation topics saying they trigger her or are insensitive. Our humour is quite dark, and we're generally quite nerdy with our course so she felt left out. 

Eventually it started making me very anxious as she would jump to insane extremes, doing things, and exhibiting very depressive behaviours in front of me and only me which would make me ridiculously uncomfortable since I've been battling my own set of demons at the time. 

Due to a recent insidend she had to be admitted to the University counselling service, where they confirmed that she had a severe issue and will have to seek professional help. She refused to do so but from now on whenever anything happened she would blame it on the mental illness and expect me to apologise for being angry or upset with her. 

She said her mental illness made her clingy, made her overthink things, jump to extremes, made her overly sensitive to things and etc,,, 

Eventually I told her that I can't continue like that, and that we should stop being friend. She called me an asshole, that I was ungrateful for all the things she did for me, and that I was selfish for putting myself before her especially since its ""just my mental illness and I will soon change"" She said I'm judging her by the mental illness and not by the type of person she really is.

Bob has pretty good vocab from anime, but Mike knows like 100 words. Neither of them know any grammar so I often need to translate for them.

Mike is an absolute hit with the ladies here. It's hard to convey just how attractive he's considered.  One girl became particularly enamoured meeting him, and invited us (through Mike) to stay at her parents beach house. Mike loves the beach, and it's free accommodation, so I was warm to the idea, imagining she'd bring a couple friends and we'd have fun drinking together. I also assumed, perhaps unjustifiably, that her parents wouldn't actually be there.

I was wrong. I found out yesterday in the house would be her, her parents, and the three of us. I immediately lost all impetus to go. The third wheeling, the inevitable awkward interactions with her parents, and the fact that I didn't really fancy going to a beach. I thought this wouldn't be a big deal because we've already split up a couple times.

I tell Mike, but he said that I had to come or it would be too awkward. I told him that's his issue. He got a tad angry but it was dropped and we went out drinking.

The next morning, he woke us up and I reconfirm I'm not going. I told him if he was serious and made a heartfelt plea I'd go, but he just kept repeating the same reasons from earlier progressively getting angrier, before storming off to shower. This was perhaps unfair because he's terrible at communicating emotions, but the fact that he could only get angry firmed my resolve.

I talked with Bob, and said he was welcome to come with me, go with Mike, or solo adventure. He said he still wanted to go. Bob's a super laid back guy so it's hard to figure out what he's actually feeling at some times, and whether he actually wanted to go or felt pressured to, or if he though I was being a twat. 

So, AITA? I did, pretty heavily imply I would go, and I have left my mates on a sticky wicket with three random Japanese people and minimal ways to communicate, however, I did make those implications under different circumstances, and frankly it's not my monkeys and it's not my circus. I don't feel obliged to translate for him so he can have less awkward time getting laid, especially at the expense of two days of the trip. Admittedly, however, awkward interactions are much more enjoyable in groups, so even if it wasn't as a translator, just my presence would probably have been a nice thing to have, and as a friend, maybe I should have stayed for his sake. I can definitely see why he thinks I'm being a bad friend ditching him last minute, but I also don't think it's ridiculous to not want to go given the situation.

Neither of us are biologically related to each other or our parents. We both had happy childhoods and our parents were always supportive of us. We always knew we were adopted and I never felt that my parents loved us any less than our brother (we have one older brother who is our parents biological child). Neither of us had ever cared to look for our birth parents when we were younger but our parents said that we would be able to when we turned 18.

About a year ago though someone suggested to her that she read the Primal Wound. The gist of the book is basically that if you're adopted you will be traumatized for the rest of your life because separation of a baby from the mother is traumatic. I read a bit of it and I didn't care for it and honestly I thought it was bullshit. If the book's hypothesis were true then children whose mothers died in childbirth would be traumatized or those born through a surrogate. 

However, she took everything she read to heart and basically blamed adoption for all of her problems. She did 23andme and was able to find her birth mother. Her birth mother was nice to her at first but I'm not really sure what went down but she eventually had to tell my sister to keep away. The birth mother had remarried and had done really well for herself and was not interested in the close relationship that my sister wants. From what I understand, she apparently had wanted to keep her but was unable to do so because of financial reasons. She regrets giving up her sister but at this point in her life she has come to terms with it and has decided with her husband (who is not my sisters father) that they can't be there for her as her parents. (apparently my sisters  bio dad died in prison about 15 years ago) 

Since then my sister has been very moody. Every time we see each other she pesters me to read the book and we end up fighting about it. All she does is complain about how her life would be so much better if her mother had kept her or if our parents had given her bio mom money so that she could keep her. 

Finally last night when we were having dinner together she started her usual complaints. I finally got mad and went off on her telling her that our parents were the best thing that had ever happened. She probably wouldn't have done well with her bio mom and adoption isn't traumatizing and that book completely messed up her life and I wish she hadn't read it. She is now not talking to me.

1106,No A-holes here,"I always carry my own bag. I'm very absent minded and have lost my wallet, keys, phone, multiple times to great inconvenience and expense. I trained myself to always put everything in a bag, always have the bag on me, look around before I leave a restaurant in case I left anything behind, etc, and I haven't lost anything in decades. I might be a bit neurotic and anxious about all this but that's pretty normal for me since I have anxiety. It makes me feel really uncomfortable not to have my bag on me, and kind of trapped and anxious because I have to rely on someone else to give me access to my stuff. 

Anyway I'm heavily pregnant and carrying my bag around - it's not that heavy - and everyone offers to carry it for me all the time, I always politely decline and thank them and if they keep asking I explain why. 

I'm hanging out with the in laws and husband and decline politely four times as we're walking out to lunch, and explain yet again my reason (which I literally just explained the day before, among other times). I also promise I'll ask for their help if I need it. They mutter something about how i never let them carry my bag. 

After a bit, my husband tells me again to give him my bag. At that point I'm annoyed at everyone's pushiness and tell him to stop bugging me. He stops, but my mil glares at me. 

I mean, I feel bad because I know everyone is just trying to help but I don't need or want their help at the moment, and I explained why. AITA for getting annoyed that they won't take no for an answer?

Edit: It's a roughly 5.5 lb bag. Heaviest things in it are my water bottle and Kindle. 6 months pregnant, no complications.

Edit2: Help was offered four times between all three of them, not four times by my husband alone, but we were all walking together so everyone would've known. I got annoyed at #5.

1108,Asshole,"Warning: this is a bit long. I’m on mobile. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

Background: I’m a medical student at my dream school. I will be the first to get a doctorate in my family. Most of my family and friends come from low income backgrounds and that’s the life I grew up in.

I’m living off scholarship in med school right now, but I am very good at budgeting and occasionally have funds to spend on the people I care about. Not a lot, but enough to take my grandma out to dinner or treat my best friend to a night out every once in a while. 

A lot of times people will insist on paying since I’m a student with no real income. I tell them I don’t mind, that I wouldn’t do it if I couldn’t afford to. They often insist anyway. Now, I do appreciate the gesture and their sentiment, but what usually bothers me is what a lot of these people say immediately afterward.

“You can treat me with expensive dinners and five star restaurants when you’re a rich doctor!” (Or some variation there of.)

Now this may just be me being petty but I really resent that people assume that I’m going to just want to blow money on them if I start actually making money one day. 

To me, a persons income shouldn’t ever be relevant to your relationship. Someone could make a million dollars and still take my ass to IHOP and I’d be over the moon that a friend wants to treat me to anything. 

It just really irks me because A LOT of people in my life say things like this. My mom, my friends, a lot of extended family. Basically anybody who occasional treats me to something, they basically say they’re treating me now so I can treat them later.
My best friend from college used to joke that she was “investing” in me now for when I could afford to treat her in the future. 

I feel like a huge asshole now because all I think now is that when I doing start actually making money I won’t want to spend it on anybody because they’re basically saying they’re entitled to the benefits of my labor because they treated me to dinner a couple of times when I was broke. 

I mentioned this to my mom and she called me ungrateful and said that I have to pay back people who supported me along the way. I countered that she was the only person who really financially supported me, and even then, I got through college on full scholarship, same for med school. She is probably the only person I’d want to take care of despite her entitlement simply because she’s actually always been there to support me when needed for things besides money.

She’s still convinced I’m being super petty, cheap, and ungrateful to everyone else. I honestly want to know if she’s right because sometimes even I have my doubts that I’m right. 

TLDR: Am I being petty for resenting people who say that they don’t mind spending money on broke me now because future rich me can treat them to even more fancy stuff later in life?

Edit: to clarify, I don’t believe all the people in my life who have made jokes like this are being genuinely serious. But there are a handful of people that do this repetitively that I think deep down are serious about it. 

And to amend: It wasn’t just my labor that got me to where I am. It took a lot of things coming together in just the right way and the help of a lot of people. 
I meant it more like it was not THOSE people who only make me feel like a cash cow who helped me get to where I am today.",36,47,0.79

1112,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) am posting this on behalf of my little sister (22F) who is still in college. Her situation is below.

&#x200B;

I am in my final year of college studying mechanical engineering and live in a house my parents built as an investment for my sister and I to live in and rent to roommates while we were in college. The house is super nice and has 4 bedrooms. Two upstairs and two master suites downstairs. The way the downstairs living room is set up has the TV right next to the doorway to my room (I am in one of the master suites). There is a 5 foot long ""hallway"" that leads to my bedroom door. I have 3 other roommates - me and another girl are still in school while the other two have recently graduated and working but we are all the same age. This post is mainly about one of the girls that has graduated and working, lets call her ""A"". 

A's boyfriend comes over every night which isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that I have to study ALOT and they always blare the TV until late at night and the TV blares right into my room where my desk is. This is definitely a distraction and when I don't have to study, I can't even watch TV in my room because I can't hear it due to them watching TV in the living room. They aren't just watching TV, they cuddle the whole time which makes it kind of weird to go into the kitchen and living room because I feel like I am interrupting their couple time. As a side note, A is one of my friends and her boyfriend is a really nice guy. I understand the living room is a common space and I don't want to ask them to not watch TV in there anymore (she does have a TV in her bedroom) but her boyfriend doesn't pay rent and having him in our common space all of the time makes us (the other roommates and I) not feel comfortable walking around in our pajamas and what not. A is the only one with a boyfriend in the house. I feel like if I have a house meeting and specifically say anything about boyfriends, she will take offense. I think I could be the asshole for trying to dictate what people do in the common space and when but I also feel like I have a right to be able to study in my own bedroom. A could be cuddling and watching TV in her room without disrupting anyone.

1113,Everyone Sucks,"Hear me out before you judge me.
English isn't my first language. So, peace out.

I'm a 19M living with my parents and have started law college a year ago. Both my parents are well off, and have strictly forbidden me to work full-time or part-time in any kind of job essentially till i finish my graduation.

It's customory for the parents here (not the US)  to buy their kids a ""enjoy your college life"" gift just as they commence college. So around a year ago, my parents had asked me what i would like, for which i suggested a motorcycle which costs around $2000. They initially agreed on the condition that i wait for a year.

 A year later and last week to be precise,  as i started urging them to visit the bike showroom for getting a better idea on the model and make of the bike, they scoffed that $2000 was waaay too expensive for a bike and they didn't have ""that kind of money"" on them right now and asked me to settle with something less expensive. I expressed that i was disappointed with not so many words and yet agreed to buy a $1000 model. Now note i was perfectly satisfied with my bike given it's the best in it's class compared to other bikes with the same specs.

Skip to yesterday. My dad's sister had an unforeseen emergency for which she asked my dad for financial assistance as a loan. My dad immediately transferred around $7000  and refused to get repaid with the words, ""that's some money I'll never use."" This infuriated me but i didn't express it yesterday as it was already very late. So i wanted to confront him today but i felt i was feeling too Entitled as the money was his to spend anyway he wished.

But i had rejected many jobs as a paralegal as my dad had forbidden it and felt sore that i could've saved the money myself and bought one with better specs.

So Redittors, AITA? 
Will accept any judgement by the jury.


EDIT : just to clarify in minimal words, the emergency wasn't for my dad's sister, but for someone she knew. It was just that she didn't have that kinda money and approached dad.",32,26,0.77

1118,Not the A-hole,"My partner has fibromyalgia which is a chronic pain condition, that can be managed but is as of yet incurable and not very well understood by Doctors. 

My friend has recently got very into alternative medicine, which is fine, however he's recently shared an image with her claiming Fibromyalgia can be cured with celery juice. About five minutes googling will reveal this idea comes from a man who believes ghosts told him celery juice can cure many ailments, it has no basis in science and zero evidence that isn't anecdotal.

My partner was a little upset by this, so I told him as much, and might of gone a bit far by saying the advice was ""unwelcome, condescending, and hurtful"" and referred to him as just some ""prick in a van"" giving unwanted advice (He lives in a van). He responded by saying it wasn't advice it was just ""universal knowledge"" he thought might help, so it would be wrong not to share it. I walked away at this point because I was getting angry and I didn't feel like it was worth falling out over.

A few days later he texts my partner to apologise, but followed his apology by saying ""I'm only trying to help, if that offends you maybe you should look at yourself and figure out why"" and then continued to encourage her to research celery juice. This has only infuriated my partner and I further to be honest.

1119,Asshole,"I know how that title reads so bear with me. First and foremost, I have no issue with people who do not eat meat. Hell, my diet is almost exclusively vegetarian at this point. Back to the story at hand, everyone in my social circle is wrapping up their degree and getting their first job. 

It's become a bit of a tradition that when one of us gets a job, we take everyone out somewhere for dinner. We were discussing this last night and one of our friends (who we'll call S) piped up with no meat at my dinner. Now, S is very religious and refuses to eat meat. I asked him rhetorically why he'd impose a rule as we've all had dinner before and it's never been an issue. 

He responded with ""I don't want to spend any of my money on non vegetarian products"". Fair enough, I can get that. So I asked what if we had a separate tab that we paid for and he shut that down. ""What kind of person would I be if I had someone else pay at my dinner?"". 

I don't really mind the dude's beliefs (you do you man) but I don't like to have other people impose their beliefs on me. Now, I'd initially let it go until today when another friend (in the same social circle) and I headed out to get some tea and he pipes up with ""Man, S was really pissing me off last night. He's free to have his own beliefs but don't force them down our throats, yeah? If that's the case then fuck it, I'm not gonna go"".

1122,Not the A-hole,"New alt account, forgive lack of posts.

Gonna cut right to it: I [25M] suffer pretty severely from PTSD. On top of a shitty childhood, when I was 16, my then boyfriend and I got into a head-on collision with a drunk driver going 20mph over the limit. I was left with permanent physical injuries and he died on impact. I've been in therapy ever since but the crash is something that's still very traumatic and difficult for me. I have severe car anxiety and have nightmares about it even now. For a long time, I even struggled watching films which featured fast cars/car accidents, even if they weren't intended to be frightening. Like I'm talking I couldn't even get through Fast and Furious without having a panic attack. 

Recently, my friends and I were planning to hang out and watch horror movies. One of them which was suggested was Cujo. A girl who is new to the group (let's call her Kay) immediately shot down the suggestion, stating she had issues getting through it because of a traumatic event in her life. Everyone was understanding, and I reached out separately to express my empathy to her and to tell her I'd had similar issues so if she wanted help working through it to give me a shout. I felt asking about the trauma was invasive and so I didn't, but I assumed she'd probably been bitten by a dog or something.

Fast forward to the film night. Out of curiosity, another friend asks Kay what the traumatic event was that meant she couldn't warch Cujo. Kay explained that her childhood pet was a St Bernard who had to be put down when Kay was 7 because he was old and super arthritic. She followed it with ""[My name] gets it though, you had the same thing happen right?"" And I replied ""I mean kind of. I got in a bad car crash and the other person died, so it's a bit different."" Kay got kinda weird and huffy then and left shortly after. 

Two days ago, Kay finally contacted me about it. She said she felt like what I did was really rude and I put her in a super awkward position. She felt like I was turning trauma into a competition and that there was no need for me to ""one up"" her like that. I think she's being unreasonable; I've no doubt that losing her beloved pet was traumatic and I've a great deal of sympathy but is it really wrong of me to say that isn't the same as what I went through?

Edit: since some people seem to think I directly told her I had a pet die let me just be clear: when I reached out about ""similar problems"" I mean I reached out saying I also couldn't watch certain films because of trauma. I never mentioned pets or what my trauma was in that conversation, as she knew I'd been in a crash and I just assumed she knew that's what I was referencing.

I admit I found their fast and furious romance a little odd but she always chucked it to it being a common aspect in lesbian relationships. I shrugged it off seeing that she was happy and I just wanted to support my friend, I even officiated at their wedding. As the year went on I would hear odd stories about her wife getting mad at my friend for essentially not giving her undivided attention. In the past few months, the arguments have ramped up.

I told her it would be good to take herself out to a movie alone. She could just turn off for a bit. She responded  her wife would be furious. ""She can't be alone for two hours?"" I asked. ""Never"" she replied. I had it. I was insanely blunt. ""That's not a marriage that's a hostage situation."" She admitted to seeing red flags and even admitted that she was scared of her wife's anger. I said she wasn't as vibrant as I had known her. Suddenly, she flipped a switch.

She started defending her wife and saying if she needed space she could get it but of course she doesn't want it. I didn't want to hear excuses so I just said ""You don't have to explain anything. I just want you to be ok. I love you."" She responded with another defensive text. It was radio silent after that. A few days passed and I started to get nervous.

My answer was immediately no, but I couldn’t say that so I told her I’d ask my dad. Immediately thereafter, my dad calls me first and says X’s mom text him just saying there was a “situation” and he wanted me to explain. Me explaining them wanting to move in here made it sound like my idea, and he said he’d talk to X’s mother about it and go from there. 

And that’s the very last I heard of the situation for three days. My dad wouldn’t answer my texts, X was being vague and secretive, and I was being desperately urged by X not to ask my dad about it. I hated being out of the loop but waited. 

After three entire days, my dad tells me in passing that X and her family are moving in this weekend. I was already super late to leave so I said I’d talk to him about it later. 

Talking about it later was a short phone call of me expressing “I don’t want them to live here, and here’s why” and he said he’d get back to me. 

X and I kept talking, my dad stayed silent, and we got onto the situation of X and her family’s shitty decisions, how she could totally work and support rent and they didn’t have to live here, and X stops responding for two days 

Then I ask my dad about it again and apparently he was told all about how terribly rude and cruel I was to my poor best friends homeless family for no reason and he was pissed at me about it. 

My dad’s never had a problem telling people no, I’ve watched him just roll up the window on beggars and shit. So idk what her drug addict mom had told my dad to get him to agree to have a family of 3 plus several animals move into our medium sized home, but nobody will tell me. 

Am I the asshole for not wanting someone who’s functionally a stranger, a shitty person, a drug addict and functionally involved in crime living in my house with her whole family because they made shitty financial decisions and couldn’t follow basic advice?

Edit: to clarify, my dad and I live in the same house, my mother’s deceased, X’s father isn’t involved in their lives. X and her family are probably good folks deep down, but do shitty stuff. Her and her mother do drugs together, her mother either has or still does sell pills on the side of a babysitting job, they’ve been known to steal, and after her aunt kicked her out they stayed there as long as they legally could, keeping one family member at their aunt’s house at all times so they couldn’t change the locks and threatening to sue if they were forced out. Her younger sister has destructive habits.",78,320,0.91

1145,Not the A-hole,"Hi all! I just want to preface this by saying that this coworker is super super sweet and I would never want to intentially hurt her. 

I (25F) have been working with this particular co-worker (around 45f) for over a year. Recently I moved and it turns out that we are on the same train back into the suburbs, estimated about 50 minutes or so to our stop.

Now I have a super high stress high demand job so by the time were both on the train I am EXHAUSTED and want to veg out on a podcast and not have to think about anything. Here is where the problem is, my coworker recently got a new pet and all they want to do is sit next to me on the train and show me every single picture her or her husband have ever taken of said pet.

First few times I'm like thinking okay not ideal but I can manage. Except now it's been weeks and I'm exhausted emotionally. For those who are similar with the spoon theory, I am a spoonie and I don't have enough spoons after a long day of work to manage this.

My friends say I should be honest and say that I would like my private time on the train. But would that make me TA? Can you nicely tell someone you don't want to talk to them?",23,28,0.9

1147,No A-holes here,"So I've been living in an apartment that is pet friendly for about 5 years. A new neighbour moved in to the unit across from us about three months ago.

Last night when I was getting out of the elevator with my dog, this neighbour and her son were waiting to get in, and my dog was surprised and started barking. The mother jumped back and ran back into her unit. I felt really bad and apologized to the son. My dog stopped barking and we stepped out of the elevator. As I was walking to my unit I heard the son say ""you should watch your dog."" I stopped and told him again I was really sorry and that she barks but it's not aggressive, and he repeated, ""you should watch your dog. Did you see my mother? She's scared."" I apologized again, but was a little frustrated, and it probably showed. I said, ""I'm really sorry but I don't know what to do, have a good night"" and went into my apartment. Obviously not the best response but I was caught off guard. Like I said, I've been living here for years, never had a complaint before, and my dog is not aggressive.

I'll admit, she is a [Keeshond](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/keeshond), a breed originally bred as watchdogs, so they have a loud bark and they were bred to bark when they hear unfamiliar noises or see unfamiliar people in their perceived 'territory.' It's not aggressive barking, but I can understand how it could be startling. I hired a private behaviourist/trainer when my dog was younger to learn techniques to control this kind of barking, and I've worked on it for a while. I can generally get her under control by redirecting her attention, but sometimes she'll bark first before I can do that. When we're on the elevator and the doors open, I hold her back a few feet and she has to wait calmly before exiting. If she sees something that sets her off like another dog or a person she doesn't expect to be there, she'll start barking and trying to pull out of the elevator, so I hold her back and provide distractions (treats) until she calms down, usually about five to ten seconds.

The son was definitely upset. In his mind my out of control dog just terrified his mother and I have no doubt he thinks I'm a total asshole. So I guess I'm asking, am I the asshole if my dog scared my neighbour? I feel like now I have a problem in any case and I'm afraid the neighbour is going to report my dog as aggressive or something. What should I do about this?",86,77,0.91

1150,Not the A-hole,"For the past two years, a group of friends and I have been planning a weeklong trip to Orlando to visit Disneyworld and Universal Studios in three weeks. The first rule we made when we started to plan this trip is that it would be childfree. The two people in our group that have children agreed that their children were young enough not to be traumatized from not going to Disney at 3 years old.

For personal reasons, one of my buddies had to drop out of the trip last minute. Since everything has been paid for, he said that if I could find someone to take his place he wouldn’t expect to be reimbursed in any way, except for sweets from Honeydukes and mouse ears.

I managed to find someone, but before I could say anything to the group. My girlfriend (hopefully soon to be fiancée, I plan to purpose on the trip) told me her sister wanted to take the empty spot. I asked how, because her sister just had a baby and at the time of the trip she will be 6 or 7 weeks. She said that her sister would just bring her daughter and we would make it work.

My girlfriend is a huge pushover when it comes to her sister and has never said no to her before.

I called her sister and tried to politely tell her that everyone going on this trip is either in their late 20’s or early to mid-’30s. She wouldn’t listen and started rambling about her daughter getting pictures with Mickey and Elsa (she also named her daughter Elsa btw) and how much fun she’ll have. I interrupted her and said that the trip was adults only and her newborn was not allowed. I then pointed out that a lot of the places we’ll be going to after the parks are adults only and no one would want to stay behind with her and the baby. Plus I don’t think an unvaccinated newborn should be taken to Disney.

I was called a dick and how dare I tell her how to parent her child and it was creepy that a bunch of adults wanted to go to Disney without children. The last thing I told her before I hung up was that the empty spot had already been taken, by someone, so sadly she cannot come, but we'll take plenty of pics in our coordinated disneybound outfits and wizard robes to show her later.  I think she cussed me out, before I ended the call.

My girlfriend thinks I was mean to her sister and said I should apologize for not giving her a chance to come on the trip. AITA?",648,2621,0.98
1151,Not the A-hole,"So today a man came into the local coffee shop I've been working at and started talking up how yesterday he got a very subpar hot chocolate. He said that it was just brown water with cocoa powder in the bottom, I apologized cordially but he went on to say that he felt this entitled him to a new hot chocolate.

I agreed and rang him up but as I did he stopped me and said:

""wait you want me to pay for it?""

""You want it for free?"" I asked

""well yes"" he said ""yesterday's sucked and I come here all the time.""

"" I don't think I have the authority to do that unfortunately""

""you have a key to the place don't you?""

""well, yes""

""then I think you have the authority?""

""Honestly no, I just don't think I can.""

This is where he got mad, he went on a whole rant about customer loyalty and my questionable customer service to the point where I said ""ok, just once I'll give it to you ok?""

He huffed.

""Then moment's past."" he said ""but next time, when someone asks you to do this, I HIGHLY suggest you do.""

The he attempted (and failed) to slam our door and walked out.

I texted my boss immediately after asking if I did the right thing. The first thing he pointed out is that:

&#x200B;

1. We don't make our hot chocolate with water, we use      milk.
2. Why didn't this man bring it up yesterday?

I didn’t think it really mattered and I figured that she could assume that the medium was the size above the smallest one, I just pointed to the cup I wanted and said I wanted that, she then continued to correct me and said “that’s the tall cup is that the size you want” (obviously that was the size I wanted I just pointed to it) so I just nodded, she then told me one more time that it was called a tall almost talking down to me and I just stood there not really knowing what to do (I think she really wanted me to say tall) we stood there for an awkward 5 second silence and just stared at each other, she finally called out to the back “one tall black coffee”  I handed her a $10 she gave me back my change and I sat down and waited for my drink.

1153,Asshole,"Ex and I were going strong for a few years. We were soulmates - I was gonna ask him to marry me. His family didn't approve, of course, they didn't like the fact that their son was a ""fag"". Nevertheless I had in mind a future of marriage, starting a family, of living a long happy life with him. 

Then his bitch aunt died - the one who said that I was to blame for turning her nephew into a fairy. Turns out my comment about her having a sour cunt hit a little close to the mark - cervical cancer, age 56. He's devastated - they were close before he came out, however poorly she treated him afterward (I believe her exact words were ""go ahead and spit on Jesus' name, for all I care. You'll regret it in Hell."") He goes to the funeral alone (we decided that it would be best if I stayed away.) This was the first time he'd seen most of his family in a long while. 

When we started dating I was the first boyfriend he'd ever had. I defended him when his family turned on him. I helped him out of the slump that came after one by one his family stopped talking to him. He said I was the one who rescued him from pretending all the time. 

He went on a ""fishing trip"" with his father a few weeks later. Imagine my surprise, then, when I see his father across the street while he's supposedly gone. I don;t say anything, although later it turns out Ex was at one of those psychotic ""ex-gay"" retreats in the wilderness of bumfuck, Utah. He keeps disappearing, and I have no idea why, until finally he sits me down one day and tells me that he was ""having a phase,"" when he met me, and that he ""isn't the man he thought he was."" Turns out he was seeing some dry old cunt of a church lady who posed as a therapist, one of those conversion therapists. He dumps me and says that he's been seeing a woman who his parents picked out for him. 

We met at work, so a few weeks later I put in my two weeks and moved to another workplace across town so I could avoid him. Lo and behold it's two years later and he applies for a position at my work. My boss and I usually go over the new applicants together. I check to see if it's him and sure enough it is. My boss asks me what I think about him. I tell him that Ex was kind of a pill while I worked with him, that the other people found him ""difficult,"" because he couldn't take criticism. I make no mention of our previous relationship. I pull out another applicant's file and tell him I think she's a better fit for the job. My boss sends her an email giving her the good news later that day. 

To clarify, New Girl is eminently qualified. It's just that until I spoiled the process Ex was the top candidate. AITA?",143,322,0.87

1155,Not the A-hole,"My son just turned 5 and we are taking him to Disney. It is a family tradition for everyone to go when the grandkids turn 5. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. We have been planning this trip for years. I love those corny matching family shirts that people wear to Disney so I dropped $700 on matching T-shirt’s for everyone going, almost 20 people. Everyone was aware that we would wear the shirts and take the stereotypical Magic Kingdom family pictures in front of Cinderella’s castle. I was just informed my cousin’s boyfriend plans on proposing to her while we are at Disney since she is a huge fan. I was asked if this was ok with me since it was technically my son’s trip. I said I had no problem with it. I was just informed my aunt doesn’t want her to be wearing our family shirts and instead something “cute” on the day we visit Magic Kingdom. We are going to Magic Kingdom one day so if we don’t wear the shirts then we will have to wear them to another park and take the family photos there. I said absolutely not. I have been planning this for too long and spent $700 on everyone’s shirts to take the picture in front of the castle. He can either propose while we take the photos in front of Cinderella’s castle in our family shirts or propose another day so she can wear something cute at a different park. Am I the asshole?

EDIT: the shirt thing was agreed prior to me getting the shirts made. It was also agreed what day and which park we would all wear them. Everyone agreed.

EDIT2: thanks for the responses! When I posted this it was just a short time after I had the initial convo with my sister about the whole thing. I hadn’t begun thinking of alternatives or compromises yet. I’ve bent over backwards for everyone on this trip and felt that I should be able to get the picture I wanted, but being the type of person I am, it was quite difficult for me not to bend., but I still felt guilty about it so I wanted to see if Im an asshole or not. This discussion didn’t cause a family feud- no hard feelings, etc , and my aunt and sister have decided to still have the boyfriend propose in the family picture while wearing our “corny” shirts, but have also got them an additional park ticket on a different day to do proper engagement photos. Thanks for the suggests! For those of you jumping the gun,  making assumptions, and otherwise just fucking negative, you can fuck off. For my first AITA post I enjoyed reading the responses nonetheless!

Final update: for any of you who are curious as to how everything turned out: we all went to Disney, wore our matching shirts the day we went to MK. We got the giant family photo in front of the castle and my cousin was proposed to mid photo. She didn’t care about her clothes.  Loved that we were all there and got great pics of it. They got “proper” engagement photos around Disney and everything went great. The shirts might be corny but we loved wearing them one day and we got a couple of great photos of our family taking up the whole ride.",135,364,0.95
1156,Not the A-hole,"Five months ago, my best friend (M) and his gf had a massive fight and broke up, and during the break up he ended up sending me a nude. A week later they got back together and I never brought the picture up again because it happened while he was single and didn’t seem relevant to their relationship. Fast forward to now, they have a bare all heart to heart and she finds out about the nude, I wake up to her blowing up my phone saying I’m not her friend anymore and how not telling her was so fucked up. During the period of time that the pic was sent, I was not her friend - she was just my best mate’s girlfriend. We hung out one time one on one like three months later and then always in a group setting, so therefore it doesn’t make sense to me why she thinks I’d prioritize her over my friend. But she thinks that because they got back together so soon after the picture was sent, she deserved to know it happened, regardless of whether or not he was single at the time. AITA for not telling her about the nude even though they got back together five days later? 


TLDR; I didn’t tell an acquaintance that her (now) boyfriend sent me a nude while they were broken up.

EDIT: There was no intimacy beyond that picture he sent at any point, the past few years I’ve known him he’s always been in this relationship (apart from the breakup, obvs). It wasn’t unsolicited, he asked if he could send the picture and I said alright, I complimented him, and nothing was sent in exchange. As for the reason, I assumed it was for a confidence boost or trying to see if I’d be open to be some kind of rebound as he’s coming out of the relationship, but it never went any further than the dick pic.

EDIT 2: It was a dick pic of himself, not his gf’s nude. Sorry for the confusion.",49,172,0.91

1158,Not the A-hole,"At my workplace, there are a decent number of call-outs that result in a need for employees to pick up extra shifts. I rarely agree to it when asked; I already work longer hours than most there and I very seldomly take days off myself, so it’s not like the favor is being returned to me. My employers know I’m not super willing to pick up extra shifts, so when they ask me they’re usually desperate to get someone.

When my coworkers get asked to pick up extra shifts and they clearly don’t want to, it seems like they always try and come up with a super legit-sounding excuse about why they can’t, in the hopes of not appearing lazy/unwilling/selfish. Like, “Oh my, I really wish I could but...my aunt I haven’t seen in 30 years is flying across the world to see my family that night,” or “My car got in a freak accident, is in the shop and I won’t be able to get a ride then,” or claim that they have a super important doctor’s appointment/family wedding/class/shift from another job. I have the  feeling a lot of the time, it’s not true.

But me when I’m asked and don’t want to? I will always be 100% honest about why I can’t pick it up, and usually the excuse is that I don’t feel like doing it. Here are some of my responses I’ve given when asked (usually when they are desperate to get someone):

* Sorry, but my favorite show is airing a new episode during that time.
* Sorry, but that day’s set aside for some time out with the bros.
* Sorry, but I was planning for that night to be more of a “beer, potato chips and video games ‘till 2 AM” kinda night.
* Sorry, but I’ve got some serious Netflix binging planned for that day.
* Sorry, but Halloween’s my fave holiday, and I want to relax and kick it that day.

Not to sound way too braggy, but I am a terrific employee and feel confident enough that I don’t feel like I have to do every extra favor my employers request of me or provide some excuse for everything I do. If I need a night out with the bros or to relax, I feel I’ve earned it and deserve it for all the hard work I’ve put in, and I have no shame about it. That’s what I believe, at least.

In college, I was in excellent shape and regularly competed in bodybuilding physique competitions, with my body fat percentage varying between 8-12% on and off season. My wife hasn't really been into the fitness thing, but I respect that because it isn't everybody's thing. 

Well we moved across the country for a new job (all me, mostly, she flew in when I was done), and it's been pretty stressful. Fitness is important to me, but I don't know, I'm tired of competing now and making personal meals out of boiled chicken and cottage cheese. Since my new job is mostly office work I'd say that right now I'm probably at 18-22% body fat. I don't feel overweight, I meal prep, and lift or run almost every day.

For whatever reason though, my wife started to comment a lot on my weight. For the past year, Everytime I'm not eating something really lean she'll comment about how the meal will make it difficult for me to get back into physique competitions (I've told her I'm  not doing them anymore), on cheat days she'll comment on how good I *used* to look, or during sex she'll tell me about how it was so much better during the college days.

It got to a point where eating meals together made me uncomfortable. I've tried to eat only before it after her, but it reached a head last night. When she made another comment about how I was looking ""fluffier"" during dinner together, I kind of unloaded on her.

And I went “obviously”

And I straight up look at her, then turn to the guy on the other side of me and start talking to him, pretty much ignoring her while I could feel her glaring at me.

1165,Everyone Sucks,"This is more of a ‘are we the asshole’ I guess. 

My colleagues and I work a very physically demanding job which amongst other things, also involves pools/ life guarding. Because of that we have showers located at work as we are constantly getting sweaty and grimy and need to wash off to attend to other duties/ be presentable. 

Whenever we finish ‘dry reccing’ which is basically us attending to whatever dryside clean ups (not pool related) we are expected to shower. Before you do that you go into the staff room to collect your personal belongings like towels etc. 

Our female colleagues started to yell at us at one point when summer got super hot, saying ‘you smell of unwashed balls, go shower!!’ And other stuff that’s pretty similar. We’d get called gross, some girls actually started to physically push us out the staff room in order to try and get us to not stink up the place. Like yeah, we know we smell, but we are literally going in to grab towels and leave not stand around and have a chat. 

This has become a near daily occurrence and frankly it’s so fucking annoying to walk into the staff room and immediately there’s a group of girls making faces and gagging when you’ve literally just entered. 

Last week 3 of the girls had gone to attend to dryside activities which meant that when they came back, they were covered in sweat and grime too. (we work at an Olympic facility and we have to put in a LOT of physical work in the heat so yeah, it’s bad) and so jokingly I said ‘ew, smells like unwashed pussy, go shower’ 

One of the girls who is the most vocal about us smelling got super super offended and started mouthing off that I was an asshole. A lot of the other guys, some whom I don’t even freaking talk to, joined in and said ‘yeah, go shower! Don’t you tell us to leave as soon as we get in?’. 2 of em took it well and laughed but the third has been telling everyone and anyone about it all day.

1166,Asshole,"Hi Reddit!   So, I feel like a dick right now but I need your opinion.   One of my good friends from college, lets call her L, is getting married this weekend and has been planning this wedding for about a year now.   Originally, I was not given a plus one although I had a boyfriend since before she even got engaged.   Whatever, I can deal.

Earlier this month at another friends wedding (whom did give me a plus one and boyfriend knew about months in advance), L finally meets my boyfriend and gets drunk and invites him to the wedding.   He obliged at that time so the next day I send L his info.  Fast forward to 11 days before her wedding, I tell L that I didn't think my boyfriend would make it because it is the last day he could move.  Specifically, he and I have just moved in together and he's taken the entire month to make the move.  In his words, he's got a lot going on and really needs the Saturday to himself.   I can confirm that, he has a very demanding job.

This is where I need your help.   As soon as I told her this, L flips out at me and tells me that he has to come since that Friday (I had told her Monday morning) she already finalized the guest count and sent in the deposit.   Then, 3 days ago, my other friend E who is also a bridesmaid flips out on me about my boyfriend not coming since it was ""a very expensive wedding"".  E says I need to offer L money for his seat since she had to do and pay extra to invite him last minute.

AITA for canceling his reservation 11 days in advance?  Should I offer to pay for his seat?

Please note:  I am not a bridesmaid or in the wedding at all.

UPDATE:  Thank you all for your detailed and honest responses!   I have carefully looked through all of them and yes, I agree IATA.   Now, I did fail to mention that my boyfriend has significant mental health issues and debilitating anxiety.  For context, we're both recovering addicts and mental health and sobriety has to come first for either of us to be fully functioning members of society (some may think this is a cop out, but they have also not walked in our shoes).   He would never have cancelled had this week not been weighing in on this.   Finally, how to make this right.  I spoke to E (who spoke to L) and I came up with a plan to 1. double her gift amount to pay for his portion, and 2. find someone to bring to the wedding who L likes.

I don't mind short amounts of time obviously, and its not like a shun her, but would I be the asshole if I asked her to tone it down?

Edit: Yes, I have seen the seinfeld episode, and no, I will not buy a power sander haha",619,1445,0.92

1169,Asshole,"So here's the story. My Wife has a co-worker that works at the desk right next to her and they chat throughout the day. Most of the co-workers in her office are much older so they naturally gravitate towards each other. To be honest my wife doesn't really like her co-worker as she is so self absorbed but since there is no one else to really chat with they have become ""friends"".

This has resulted in going out for dinner and drinks a few times with my wife's co-worker and her boyfriend. The guy is a total douche-bag and openly says misogynistic and racist things to my face thinking it was funny. After a few times I told my wife I wasn't comfortable hanging out with him anymore and she was fine with that. Her co worker even seemed to understand because she knows her boyfriend is terrible and talks about leaving him all the time but never does. In the past he has hit her, degraded her, and emotionally abused her son (from a different father).

I have been lucky and haven't had to see or talk to either co-worker or her boyfriend for 5-6 months since I refused to hang out with him. So on Monday my wife and I took the day off for our kids first day of school. It was a great day, kids were excited and after school we took the kids for ice cream. While at ice cream my wife got a text from her co-worker that she needs to talk to her asap. we ran back to our house and her co-worker was in her car parked in our driveway.

When we went inside her co worker was crying hard and told us she was pregnant. She had just told her boyfriend who freaked out and left. She kept going on and on about how angry he was and she has never seen him this mad etc...

My wife was trying to calm her down and talk with her when out of the blue she started to ask me questions like ""You're a guy, would you freak out over finding out your girlfriend was pregnant, would you have stormed out? I told her she shouldn't be thinking about his feelings at all right now. She needs to focus on her self and her son. She should go to her parents and stay there because her boyfriend is unstable and may hurt her or her son. She needs to Immediately end all contact with boyfriend unless its through a third party. I then told her that since she can barely afford to take care of her son and her boyfriend is a deadbeat she should consider aborting her pregnancy. She does not have the financial or emotional resources available to care for a second child and it would force her to be tied to her current boyfriend in some capacity for the next eighteen years.

My wife shot me a horrified look and co worker immediately started yelling at me. I tried to calmly explain my reasoning but it wasn't going over well so I went in the other room. Later after my wife's co-worker left she said I was a total asshole to suggest that. I felt she asked for my advice so I gave it. AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: So I kinda knew I was an asshole before posting but I thought maybe I would be surprised.

To clarify a little bit I knew how much of an asshole her boyfriend was first hand as he had blown up at her son at a company picnic over spilling a drink on him and after he left my wifes co worker admitted he sometimes get angry and the bruise she had a month or so back was him. 

Also I can't remember her exact phrasing but while sitting on our couch she had said something to the affect ""I don't think I can raise a baby on my own"" I took this to mean she was already considering abortion but I am an asshole so I might be misinterpreting her.",175,216,0.87

1172,Asshole,"This may need a bit more background information than usual, so hang in there. Both me and my wife (call her Sam), late 30's, are originally from Indian subcontinent living in the US. I feel this is important because I feel the issue on hand has a cultural overtone.

Let's state that first: in my opinion, in general, wives and in laws just don't have good relations in these cultures. Some harmless, some not, but nitpicking and general banter is quite common, and it may sound sexist, but this is practiced almost entirely by women. My humble opinion is that anyone who can, should stay out of it, unless something gets really serious. I tried doing just that but has landed in a shitstorm.

So, I went back home about couple of years ago. Sam didn't join. She was worried about our 2 year old getting sick there and because she is upset with her mom. At that time, she says this happened. I don't have a memory of it, but I don't question her on that because it sounds like something that would happen and I would react exactly how she says I did react. Since it is my reaction that's in question here, it doesn't matter if it really happened or not. I still bring it up to show how insignificant I thought it was .

Here the event(let's assume it happened): my SIL tells me that since moving to US Sam has forgotten them, she never calls, does not care about us at all. I shrug, smile and move on.

Somehow wife finds out about this interaction. Now she wants to know why I didn't defend her. Why didn't I say they don't call either. Why did not I mention that they didn't call when she even had a big accident? All true. They didn't. But I am not a confrontational person and even though I understood Sam is the one in the right here, I let it go. I saw no point in a confrontation with someone who I would see at most once every couple years. I really, really and I mean really do not understand the reaction Sam is having, even after so long. And to be honest, I am appalled by her reaction that she still can't let it go and that it is important to her. She now says I am the type of person who won't defend her no matter what. 

I feel absolutely sure of my decision and think Sam is way over reacting. She feels absolutely sure that I am a total piece of shit for not defending her. It has been the source of numerous arguments and yelling competition. Am I really the Asshole here?",57,30,0.78

Bringing a toddler to the library and expecting everyone to tolerate the noise is like someone going to a playground and telling kids to be quiet because they want to mediate. Plus, these parents don't even watch their kids. Like every half-hour the staff pages the library about an unattended child.

Hey everyone! This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn’t know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We’re both here to respond to comments if you have any.

I saw that a few people asked what my aunt’s opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. 

I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn’t telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven’t had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I’ve done I would hope she would tell me.

Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.

After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin’s wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. 

After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would “sabotage the wedding” if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn’t be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.

The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other’s major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven’t figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I’m not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.

Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! We got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). If you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",1186,13353,0.94

1178,Not the A-hole,"*I’m on my phone so apologies for any formatting errors*

I’ve had a big issue with my sight for a few years and I’ve finally been offered an operation for it in a couple weeks.

It’s an early operation (7am) so I need to be there at about 5:30am. I’ve never had a surgery before and I’m extremely nervous about it. I told my parents and asked if one of them could come with me. My mum said she had to work and that she’ll try to get as early a shift as possible to come see me after. Okay , I understand that she needs to work. My dad on the other hand is unemployed due to a recent accident. He said that he wouldn’t be coming because the operation is too early for him to wake up, and the hospital has no decent coffee shop so he’d just be sat bored in the waiting room for a couple of hours so he didn’t see the point when he could be taking my brother to his football training at 9am and have fun with his friends there. 

He then got mad at me because I got upset about the fact that he’s choosing to watch my brother train than be there for me during an operation.

For reference this has happened before:

I got ill last year and got sent to the hospital with suspected sepsis, and he chose to go to my brother’s school play rather than be with me to find out if I have a life threatening illness. He didn’t come to visit after the play because he met my other brother for lunch and went car shopping instead. My mum again was working and couldn’t leave as she was the only manager in the store. 

I had to walk home that day despite not being able to walk properly and being very faint so the walk took about 3 hours, and I didn’t speak to my dad when I got home and he said I was overreacting because I didn’t even have sepsis so I shouldn’t be mad.

Am I the asshole here? Or am I right to be mad at my dad?",73,114,0.92

1181,Not the A-hole,"I'll try to keep this short, and no matter what you think, please keep comments civil. This is my mother, after all.

So my mom got married a few months ago to a guy that I think she barely knew, she never told us about, and they decided to get married and move in within maybe a couple of months of dating. I met him after they signed the paperwork to be married, and I could see that she really didn't like the guy. She talked shit about him all the time.

Surprise surprise, they're getting a divorce. After maybe four months of marriage. She gave up her apartment to move in to a house that they (or maybe just he) bought. So now she's looking to move out but apartments are super expensive here and there's not a lot open that isn't in some kinda sketchy areas.

To my side of this: my wife and I have been married since 2015. Six months after, I lost my job and we lost everything. We were evicted, my car got repossessed, everything. My mom (at the time, she was living in her tiny 2BR apartment) offered for us to stay with her until we could get back on our feet. We declined, but only because my in-laws offered the same thing and they own a 3BR single-family house. Much more space for us to be us. But ""a few months"" turned into 3+ years. In that time, my wife and I nearly got divorced. We lost all intimacy, we never had sex, and I fell into deep, deep depression and almost killed myself. But we pulled ourselves out, we worked on ourselves and bought our own 2BR condo (read: apartment) a couple of months ago and we've been making huge progress on getting back to being the loving couple we used to be. It's been wonderful, and we're getting ready to start trying for kids.

But then my mom has this happen and she's been eyeballing my second bedroom, which right now is an office but I'm hoping to turn into a nursery soon. The problem isn't that she needs a place to live. The problem is that she kind of invited herself to live in our second bedroom and has been guilt tripping me every time I try to find a solution where she isn't living with her youngest son. ""I offered you a place to live"" and ""There comes a time when kids have to take care of their parents"". She's 61. Not 85. She doesn't have a great job.

I'm scared that if I let her move in, she'll never find a place and my wife and I will lose all the progress we've made. Plus, we're not exactly young (I'm 35) and if we can't start a family soon, I'm scared we never will.

I feel absolutely horrible that my mom is going through this. I understand exactly the kind of anxiety she's feeling, and I want to help her as much as I can. But I feel that in giving her a place to live (she's been offered other places by other family) that I'm sacrificing my marriage, my future family, and maybe even my life. I am completely torn with guilt and it's keeping me awake at night but my wife and my brother assure me I'm doing the right thing. I just wish I felt that way.

EDIT: I just noticed I didn't put in in here: My wife and I are helping her look for places using the network of people and services that helped us find our home. We're not leaving her high and dry. Also, she does not have any clue about my depression or that my wife and I almost divorced. I've been too ashamed to bring it up and now I think it's biting me in the ass. I won't let her go homeless, if absolutely nothing works out then as an absolute final, last last last resort I would consider having her live with us after a lengthy chat, but as long as I know she's exhausted all other options. Maybe. She's not a bad mom, honestly she loves us a lot and she's always been super supportive. I love her to death but she just doesn't understand what she's asking I think. I do need to come clean with her and my family.",54,95,0.91

1183,Asshole,"I was hosting movie night. Me, a friend, this girl I like (Rose), and another girl were all coming over.

I arranged it so that Rose was sat next to me and the other guy and girl were on the other couch. She suggested a thriller, he said horror. Rose said whatever we pick can we watch something that isn't ""too scary"", and the other girl agreed. Years ago my cousin told me that if I put on a scary movie then a girl might get closer to me out of fear. My friends said as it's my place I got final say so I picked a horror movie that I don't find scary but Rose was scared shitless, and she was practically in my lap before it was halfway through.

Movie finished, and the other guy asked me to go into the kitchen with him and asked why I put on a horror movie when the girls said nothing scary. I told him about what my cousin said and the thing I have for Rose. Apparently I was too loud because the next thing I heard was the other girl calling me a dickhead. Both girls pulled on their jackets and left. The male friend is now calling me a dickhead for the intentionally scaring movie scaring the girls off.

INFO: It was Grave Encounters.

Also I didn't know she'd find it that scary.

1184,No A-holes here,"This one is simple, IMO: my fiancé and I are both from huge families. Our wedding invite list, before friends, is close to 400. Once we include friends it is well over that number. Even if we cut out nonessential family (lol) it is still over 300. We can’t afford that, and don’t want to. Her family is from a pretty expensive place to get to with a remarkably high COL and visiting. When we visited there early in our relationship that is where our relationship really took off. So, we threw around the idea of getting married there and her mother was absolutely thrilled. We made an announcement and a lot of our friends were super supportive and talking about saving money to go since the date is pretty far off (>2 years). 

Additional important info: we are getting really good pricing because of family connections in the location we are going to. Even if all 400 people showed up it would *still* be cheaper than having it in our home area. 

Now, one of our good friends is really insulted that we chose a destination, partially because we want to cut the number of attendees down and partially because a lot of college friends won’t go. Our thought is that we would love everyone to come, but understand if they can’t because it is expensive. We feel like assholes now because of this friend and simultaneously also are really annoyed at the entitlement of being able to attend the wedding in the first place. We are kind of tired of trying to appease everyone in our lives.

1186,Not the A-hole,"Together 2 yrs. He went bald in his teens, completely bald by age 19 or 20. No medical condition, just very early onset male pattern baldness. I am hugely sympathetic – your hair is a big part of how you look, and I can’t imagine how hard that’d be as a teen. Not diminishing the importance or what a big deal that is to guys, especially so young. I get it. 

He is going to interview for medical residency soon and all he can talk about is how no one is going to hire him because he’s bald. He’s 6’2”, slim and athletic (swimmer/runner body), Caucasian, very handsome and symmetrical face, perfect teeth. Some people don’t like the bald look, but everything else is conventionally perfect. And he’s very sociable, intelligent, great with kids (looking for pediatric-related residency, so that’s relevant), has good grades, etc.

He goes on and on about how being bald is going to hold him back, nobody’s going to hire him, he should’ve gone to school for a job where you don’t interact with the public so employers might still hire him and just keep him in the background where nobody has to see him. In short, he’s being ridiculous, but he actually says this stuff very seriously, every single day.

I, on the other hand, am a very petite (4’11”, 95 lb), very young-looking (I was carded for an R-rated movie last year), dark-skinned black woman, also a doctor.  I started a little younger than he did, so I’m almost done with my surgery-related residency. It’s a constant struggle for me to be taken seriously as a surgeon. I am ALWAYS confused for a secretary or medical assistant (at best, a nurse) even when I’m in my surgical scrubs. This includes patients, staff, and other doctors. Patients don’t trust my advice, staff don’t take my instructions as seriously, colleagues aren’t always welcoming. That’s its own story, suffices to say I have a hard time and probably always will.

I just deal with it (what choice do I have?) but it’s really bothering me lately how much my SO whines about being bald when he otherwise has THE most stereotypical “doctor look” ever. I honestly want to tell him that I’m not the right person to complain to about that, considering how much harder I objectively have it, and that he needs to grow up. It just makes me roll my eyes being a dark-skinned black woman who looks like a third-grader, comforting this tall, thin, athletic, handsome white man about how he’s such a poor victim of genetics and will never be accepted into medicine because he has no hair, and reassuring him that he isn’t too “weird looking” to get a residency. Get a grip.

WIBTA if I told him how tone-deaf he’s being and to stop complaining to me about it? Again, I know going bald is a big deal. I just don’t feel as sorry for him as he does for himself because I feel like I have it way harder and I persevere every day without complaining about it.",183,815,0.94

I’ll cut the details for the divorce short as i don’t want to include a lot of personal details, but we were married for almost 3 years, and 7-8 months ago we got a divorce.  After a very difficult time and with him (ExH) admitting he wasn’t loyal to me several times, we decided to part ways. I’m pretty much over what happened and am keen to get on with my life but this invite has dragged me back into past memories again :(

ExH would lie and say he was going out with his male friends only but it turns out he was meeting with another woman after a close friend of mine tipped me off.  You can’t exactly sit around and sulk forever; whilst I was very hurt initially and the emotions were still raw, he told me quickly that he wanted to move on, and we both agreed it was probably best. 

In the end we decided to stay on good, friendly terms, keep in contact and carry on with our lives. We do occasionally meet up but always with mutual friends, so it’s not like we’ve cut each other off completely.  

Last week, ExH emailed his a wedding invitation asking me if I’d like to attend. On terms of how cool we are it’s about a 6-7/10 but I just felt like it was a bit weird to invite your divorced wife to your wedding. It was a special invite for just me and not my partner also, he offered to pay for the ticket to fly me out and hotel stay for 4 days to Morocco where he and his fiancée will get married. 

I’m happy for ExH and already have a partner but I really don’t know why he would invite me. I feel blank inside and also quite confused. It’s mixed feelings, I’m over the past but I feel like I wouldn’t be able to take it if I go, especially without my partner for support. 

My partner insists it’s my choice and that he doesn’t have an opinion on the matter but he made it clear he would not be paying for his own flight and hotel stay and has no intentions of going himself even if my ex decided to pay for him too. 

I feel like it’s unfair to ExH and I don’t want to ruin his important day if I say no as I KNOW he has a very short fuse and he’s exactly the type of person to bite your head off and take anything very defensively if he doesn’t get his way.  He will probably be pissed off and twist the story to our friends who will most likely turn against me and side with him as he introduced me to those friends and I don’t want to fall into all of that again.  So it puts pressure on me to go just to keep up the friendship with ExH and mutual friends :,(

1194,Asshole,"This happened quite a while back but I think back to it every now and then and wonder if I'm in the wrong.

I was a university student at the time and carried an umbrella everywhere to protect my laptop from rain. So one rainy day, as I was waiting to cross the street on the way home, I noticed another random stranger at the traffic light also waiting to cross. She looked pretty young (maybe 16?) and she didn't have an umbrella, she was just standing there in the rain.

I walked a bit closer to her and asked, ""Do you want to share my umbrella?"" (Not exact words, but something like that)

She glanced at me for a second but shook her head. I was a bit amused at her reply since it didn't make any sense to me. The traffic light wasn't about to change anytime soon, and the rain was still pouring. So I asked one more time, ""Are you *sure*?""

Again she glanced at me briefly, this time she nodded. So I moved a bit closer and sheltered us both under the umbrella in silence as we waited one awkward minute for the light to turn, then crossed the street together. But once we reached the sheltered residential area on the other side of the street, the girl just sprinted off into the distance like her life depended on it. She gave me a backwards glance at one point during her 'escape' and she looked pretty terrified and maybe a bit angry, as if I was going to kidnap her or something.

Needless to say I felt really bad after that. My country is pretty conservative and it's highly unusual to strike up a conversation with a stranger for any reason, but I'm slightly retarded and social conventions don't really have a hold on me. Besides, I'd done this sort of umbrella-sheltering thing once before, but it was a middle-aged guy and he gave me a smile and a thumbs-up. I absolutely did not expect this hostile reaction from this girl, I was just trying to do a good deed. Should I not do this kind of thing anymore?

AITA?

Edit: I'm a 6ft tall, skinny male, though I don't think I look threatening at all. No tattoos or piercings, and I was wearing a plain tee, shorts, and slippers.

1195,Not the A-hole,"Difficult family member (DFM) asks what is for dinner.  I told her we were having chili which I make with beef, lamb, and venison.  She was told up-front that there was venison in the chili but was never told if it was the cubed meat, the ground meat, or the loosely-bound meatballs.  I don't know why she wasn't told or why she didn't ask.  It was just something that never came up.  

We raise the lamb, buy the beef from our friends a cow at a time, and we hunt the deer so know it's all quality meat.  DFM says she'll just pick out the venison because she thinks it tastes terrible.  Dinner comes around and I notice she is picking out the wrong bits of meat.  She was picking out the ground beef and eating the cubed venison and lamb ""meatballs"".  Dinner ended and DFM went home.  

A couple days later, we were having leftovers for dinner when DFM came over to drop something off.  She saw my kids eating the chili and remarked how surprised she was that they will eat venison twice in one week since, ""even the small pieces I accidentally ate were so gamey"" in the chili the other night.  My eldest  scooped a piece of the cubed meat and said, ""No, DFM, I love deer!"" and popped it into her mouth. DFM said, ""But that's the beef, honey.""  Daughter corrected her and finished with, ""Right, Daddy?""  DFM looked to me and I confirmed daughter was correct.  DFM stormed out.

DFM's only objection to venison is flavor, nothing dietary, religious, health-related, etc.  Over the two decades I have known her, she has always claimed that she'd eat more of it if it, ""just tasted better"".  I hang my pre-rut deer for a day (two, if I can) before I break them down to improve flavor.  My deer are mostly corn-fed because that's what my state grows a lot of which in turn causes our venison to be somewhat similar to commercial beef in flavor.  Personally, I notice the texture difference more than the flavor.

As far as parasites or bacterial concerns, North American venison is very safe to eat.  Salmonella, E.Coli, Trichonosis are all super-rare and animals with CWD are easy to spot and avoid for consumption.  I cook all my game thoroughly which is basically unavoidable anyway with a chili that simmers for 3-4 hours.  No increase in lead exposure either as I use solid copper bullets for hunting instead of lead.  Ironically, the lamb that went into that stew was slaughtered with a lead .22LR.

So AITA for not telling DFM that she was eating the venison?",185,1107,0.94

1197,Not the A-hole,"Around 3 years ago, I (20F) borrowed my friends (19F)  polaroid camera. I’ve had it since then, and not for lack of me trying to return it. I asked her multiple times over the year if she wanted it back, when I should drop it off, and it was always a no. The last time i asked her was before she moved for university (around 2 years ago). She told me I could have it. Now some months ago we had a huge fight and no longer are friends. Only contact since then is me asking for concert tickets I had already payed her for, which she responded by blocking my number and making me go through her friend from the same group. I did get the ticket back tho. 

Now another girl from that group has messaged me saying if she could use the camera, as the friend had told her she could borrow “her” camera. In my mind it’s my camera now, i tried to return it for years and she refused it, and even told me to keep it. You don’t take back old gifts just because you’re not friends anymore. That item is just no longer yours. I don’t know if she just doesn’t remember that’s what she did or now that we’re no longer friends she wants it back. 

It also seems like she’s just hiding behind this other friend because she’s too scared to talk to me in person because she knows she gave it to me. But that’s just speculations. Obviously I don’t WANT to give it back, and feel justified, but I’d appreciate some other input too.

EDIT 
Unfortunately I wasn’t able to find any text proof of her giving me the camera. I responded to the message by saying if the ex-friend wanted to talk to me, she had my number. This girl said ex-friend didn’t have my number... which is just crazy to me, as I am sure they would’ve been talking about me as soon as I replied, and it’s not as if there isn’t other ways she can contact me, with all our mutual friends/acquaintances and social medias. I told her she can give her my number than, and that I wouldn’t be doing this back and forth where she hides behind other people to talk to me instead of being an adult. 
That was last night, and no reply yet. If she ever grows up and manages to text me, who knows, maybe I’ll even give the camera back lol.

1200,Not the A-hole,"Before I describe what happened, it is probably relevant to mention that, though not officially diagnosed, I exhibit some characteristics which might place me on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. (I grew up in a country where there is a paucity of understanding, even among medical professionals, about the disorder, so I never got diagnosed. I now live in the USA.)

This happened a few weeks ago, at the start of this month. My manager Anne was showing the new hire Jane around the office, and introducing her to everyone. Anne had ordered some cakes and drinks to celebrate Jane's hiring, and we all gathered around the dining table to break the ice with Jane.

I don't remember how we ever got to the topic, but at some point during the conversation, Anne excitedly asked, ""How old do y'all think Jane is? You'd NEVER guess her age!"" Initially, Jane objected to having her age become the subject of speculation, but eventually relented in good spirits. (She was laughing in what seemed to me like a good-natured manner while giving her consent.) My colleagues started taking turns to throw out numbers in the 21-25 range, which invited more giggles from Jane.

When it was my turn, I said, ""Mmm... You're probably around 35 years old, I guess?"" Immediately the joyous atmosphere dampened a little (even I could tell), but Jane quickly smiled and told me that I'd guessed correctly. I could infer that I'd made a faux pas, but fortunately everyone managed to move on quickly to other topics, and soon the conversation was flowing again.

At the end of the work day, Anne pulled me inside her office and told me (very gently and kindly) that I should have lied and told Jane that she looked younger than her actual age, because it would have made Jane feel more welcome in our company. Jane herself has not brought up the episode to me.

I don't like hurting people's feelings, but at the same time, I also don't like lying, unless it is absolutely necessary. In this case, I don't think it is a grave insult to be told that one looks 35 when one is in fact 35. AITA for not lying? Should I lie in similar situations in the future?

**EDIT:** Thank you, everyone, for your feedback. I have received lots of really great advice. Someone pointed out that I should have been able to infer that my coworkers were deliberately underestimating Jane's age and follow suit, but at that time I genuinely didn't think of that possibility. :-( I also genuinely didn't mean to use autism as an excuse, and I am sorry that it came across that way. I was trying to highlight that I have this particular shortcoming, so that people can give me suggestions on how to mitigate it. So, apologies again if it seemed like I was making excuses for myself. I moved to the USA early this year, and I am still trying to settle in. I have already made plans to get an official diagnosis later this year.

In the future, I will 1) decline to join in the game, or 2) borrow u/Sheephuddle's line ""I suspect you're too young to be worried about your age"", or 3) make light of the situation by making a patently absurd guess. That way I wouldn't have to lie, and I also wouldn't risk hurting anyone's feelings.",919,6657,0.95
1201,No A-holes here,"A bit of context: I am Vietnamese-American and my husband is of mixed heritage, mostly German. We're about 10 weeks into the pregnancy (first kid, too), and have started talked about names. My husband and I are big anime fans, but we also admire other aspects of Japanese culture (such as customs/traditions, philosophies, artistic creations beyond anime, etc). When talking about names, we talked about the name Kotomi. Kotomi generally means ""beauty"" or ""beautiful"" (it can have multiple meanings, though), and it's a name that we both really like and would want to name our kid if our kid is a girl. If our kid is a boy, we would want to name him Haru (has a lot of meanings, but one we had in mind was ""Flowing Springtime"" since the kid's due date is in spring).

I'm worried that giving our kid a Japanese name would be culturally insensitive, especially since our friends and family know we're both big anime fans, and also because my husband and I are not Japanese. I am also worried that our kid would be bullied for having a Japanese name with no heritage ties, either.

So WIBTA if I gave my child a Japanese name despite my husband and not being Japanese?  


**EDIT:** I wanted to clarify that my husband and I being anime fans was meant to be an explanation of how we got introduced/exposed to Japanese culture, and to some of the Japanese names that we like. When we looked at names like Kotomi or Haru, it wasn't chosen for any ties to anime we like or anime in general. The names were chosen for their potential meanings, and names stemming from other cultures were chosen for their potential meanings as well (for example, Vietnamese names we've liked are Phuong, which means ""Phoenix"", and Khuyen, which means ""Giver of advice"")

**EDIT 2:** Thank you to everyone who commented/shared personal stories, with a verdict or otherwise. The feedback helped a lot, and I will make sure to bring up the concerns most people pointed out or had (kid will be bullied, kid will be questioned a lot, might be subject to social stigma because of my husband and I, etc) when considering names.

1202,Asshole,"I hate walking on carpeted floors with wet feet after a shower, so I dry myself with a towel, which I assume is common. My gf has this small cloth that I've seen her use while washing her face. Since we've started living together (about 5 months now) I've been using her cloth to wipe my feet because the texture feels SO GOOD. She recently caught me doing this and blew up, saying that I'm dirty and freaking out about her ""skin cleanliness"" or something. She's upset at the idea of unknowingly washing her face with something that has touched my feet, but I feel my body is exceptionally clean since I've just gotten out of the shower. She's disgusted with me and claims that you shouldn't wipe your feet, face, ass with the same towel but I believe it's not a big deal. Come on, it's the same clean body after a shower.

Note that she's not scared of dirt and frequently gets messy while skateboarding outside, so I don't know why she's suddenly so sensitive about this. Maybe she's upset because I took her facial towel but I strongly believe we should share items since we live together. It's not like those cloths are expensive, she swaps for a new one every few months or so but she's not at all concerned about my comfort. Is she too sensitive or am I really being an asshole?

So we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he’s very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


As I said my girlfriend said I was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

Our group of friends has a whatsapp group chat. All members are male.

A friend of mine sent a ""sexy"" picture of a girl he knows, on that group chat. I said that's not okay, and he says it's ok because the picture was posted by this girl on her public instagram account.

My position is that it's HER account, and SHE can decide whether to delete that picture or make her account private. So maybe posting a link to her instagram is okay, but posting the photo directly is definitely not.

His position is that when she agreed to the terms of service, she already decided that it's ok for other people to download her photo and share it anywhere.

AITA?

EDIT: He shared the picture and commented on the large size of her tits. I immediately told him not to share that and started the argument. Nobody else commented on the picture after that.

1208,No A-holes here,"So I'm a senior in highschool. Last year our school took part in a team based quiz competition run by our local newspaper where the questions were based on current affairs so you essentially just had to study the newspapers they gave us each day leading up to the round. There were three stages: A qualifier where we came third ( top three go through), a regional round (which we won) and the final national round (we didn't win). The quiz rounds started again this year and the qualifiers (which we won) were around two weeks ago. Regionals are tomorrow and my team seemingly out of nowhere told me that my performance has been inadequate and that they want to switch me out for another guy. They told me they've had to carry me through every single round we've done. The thing is there had never been any indication that this was the case at any point whatsoever until now. I was always under the impression I was doing fine because they never gave me a reason to believe otherwise. They gave me an ultimatum that if I don't preform tomorrow it's my moral obligation to quit so that they have a  better chance of winning. So I quit on the spot. I was taking part in the quiz to have fun. That's not to say I wasn't trying. I was getting a good few questions right each round. I guess I just wasn't up to their standard but again I wasn't made aware of that at all. But now it feels like even more extreme pressure since all the fun has been sucked out of it for me. It's also pressure I really don't need right now as I'm currently writing exams. So am I the asshole for quitting?",11,43,0.9
1209,Not the A-hole,"So, in 2010, I was stationed in the UK.  Now for those who haven’t been...there are bookmakers (or bookies) almost everywhere!  And they take bets on anything (from sports, politics, weather, etc) at any amount.  I tell people that if you had 50 cents and walked up to a sportsbook in Las Vegas and try to make a bet, they’d laugh you out of the casino...but in England the person behind the counter will be professional and ask “what do you want to bet on?”

Anyhow, I’ve heard of stories of parents placing bets on the children with the bookmakers.  [Here’s an example of what I mean](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2209493/amp/Ryan-Tunnicliffes-father-wins-10-000-placing-bet-son-play-team.html)Mostly the bets are sports related, but again, they’d take a bet on anything.  So, a few weeks after my son was born, I walked into my regular bookmaker, took a blank slip, and wrote “My son to be a professional athlete. £5.”  The lady at the counter looked at the slip, made a phone call, took down my info, and then processed the bet!  I was given 10,000 to 1 odds.  A few minutes later, a rep from the bookmakers called me and just wanted some further info...son’s date of birth, name, place of birth, and am I picking the sport or is it any sport?  Since I didn’t pick the sport, my odds were adjusted to 1,000 to 1.  (Later on, I found out if I had chosen professional musician, I would’ve gotten 20,000 to 1 but limited to £2.50).

At the time, I shared this info with my military friends and neighbors and they all got a good laugh out of it!  They all gave me encouragement and wished my son the best.

We now live in AZ and last month during a recent cleaning, I found the bet slip!  I called the customer support line to ask if the bet is still open...which it was!  Now granted though, my son isn’t really enjoying playing sports.  We tried soccer, basketball, and tee ball, but he didn’t enjoy them very much.  Oh well!

Last week though, my son’s school had a “meet the teacher and parents night,” and during a round of parent introductions (we’d say our name, child’s name, where we’re from, and an interesting fact about the family), I mention that I placed a bet on my son to be a professional athlete.  I was really surprised that I got a mixed reaction.  Two dads laughed at it, but the rest of the parents (moms and dads) gave awkward  looks.  One really outspoken mom blurted out “How dare you decide your son’s future at an early age!  Children are not your retirement account, what kind of a-hole does that!?”  

I sat down quietly and awkwardly.  Another parent approached me at the end of the night saying to ignore that mom, but it wasn’t just that mom that was outspoken.  There were others in the audience that didn’t approve of my bet.  Was that really an asshole move?",39,75,0.91
1210,Asshole,"Last week I was in a town near the Oregon cost watching some neighbor kids. We were just there for the day so I asked my brother if we could stop by and use his Airbnb rental to make lunch, go to the bath room, etc... 

He said that would be fine, just make sure everything is put back and dishes washed before I left. In fairness my brother said the place was not ""rental ready"" and he would be by later to pick up some stuff from his last hunting trip before he had renters arriving that night. I asked him if there were any guns or weapons and he said no. 

Well I was making lunch when I heard a huge almost pop or small explosion coming from the living room. when I walked in the kids were choking but laughing and spraying what smelled like spicy pepper all over the room. I started choking so I got the kids out. I called and told my brother and he started screaming his head off that he couldn't deal with this right now because he had renters that were coming for 3 months that would pay his mortgage for a year. I told him what was that supposed to mean. He screamed at me that I might have just cost him thousands of dollars. I told him he told me there no weapons around and at least according to the state of Oregon bear spray is a weapon. He told me that I should have been watching the kids. I told him he should not have left a weapon around and whatever happens is his fault. He hung up on me. 

Well I guess his home was uninhabitable for that night and the people cancelled their entire stay (I think he's being dramatic, if he really wanted to save the rental he could have got them a hotel until his house was clean). He's not only calling me an asshole he wants me to pay for the cleaning and make up for the lost income, he's actually threatening to take his sister to court over the lost income. To me it's an open shut legal case since he left a weapon out and if he takes it too far, I'll probably encourage the kids parents to sue him for causing pain.

1211,Not the A-hole,"Me (22m) and my girlfriend (21f) have been living together for almost 1,5 years, we’ve never had any problems when it comes to money and bills etc. 

Backstory: I’m currently studying and most of my savings are gone and my current income is around 1000€/month, I’m trying my best when it comes to saving. Most of it goes to bills and rent etc. 

My girlfriend has been wanting to buy a new couch, we’ve had this couch for about a year, we bought it brand new for around 600€ and it fits our apartment really nice. But last week, my girlfriend has been talking about buying a new one, I’ve never been interested in buying a new one because I think the one we have right now is just fine and I don’t have the funds to buy another brand new couch right now. I’m more than willing to look for a new one in maybe a year when I’m done in school and earn a good income. 

However, yesterday she texts me while I’m at school: “My friend just bought our couch for 300€, I bought this REAAAALLLY pretty couch, it costs 1400€ but we don’t have to pay it in one go, we can pay it monthly” 

Right here I’m starting to get really frustrated, we haven’t even discussed this, she knows that I I’m studying and I’m kinda struggling to make ends meet some months. But the thing that makes me the most angry is that she just straight up expects me to pay when I had no say in any of this, she never told me that she sold the couch which I also paid for and puts all the money into the new one. 

So I basically just told her that she can buy the new one but I’m not paying for it (which she did). She can make her monthly payments and all that, but since I had zero say in any of this, my economy doesn’t allow for more bills and just out of the principle that she just expects me to pay for anything that SHE wants without discussing it with me, I’m not paying for it.

Now she thinks that I’m an asshole for not helping her out and since I also live here, I should split all the bills with her, her friends agree with her as well.

So my eldest sister (28yrs) got engaged to her long time boyfriend (30yrs) in January. My sister's always been anti-marriage/marriage is patriarchal/ waste of money type person, and always claimed she'd never get married. She's held this belief for the past 10years while she been dating her fiance, so I'm sure he know she thought this. Despite this, she proposed to him and he said yes.

My family aren't religious, and are white, it's not important to us at all to get married. My other sister (26yrs) has also made up her mind 100% she is never ever getting married mainly because she just not interested and thinks it's pointless. I, also female and the youngest (21yrs) don't care either way. It's whatever. 

We're Australian so it's not a ""thing"" to save money for your children's wedding and with all of us being disinterested (also really my parents not making that much money) my parents never saved. 

They have, however, been saving to travel Europe. A long time dream, especially for my dad. The most they have ever travelled with to New Zealand before they had children. 

The point of this is that mum offered to pay for part of the wedding, that wasn't actually going to really be a wedding until mum offered to pay. My eldest sister accepted and told me it's so great that mums helping.

This really annoyed me. My parents have been saving to travel, not pay for her wedding. In my opinion they are getting old, and with that comes lower health and more limitations. I want them to travel not pay for this wedding that didn't exist until suddenly she wasn't paying for it. 

And yeah I have a big mouth and told my mum that she shouldn't be giving her money meant for her and dad to travel with. My other sister agreed with me whole heartily. 

During the argument, find out mum hasn't told dad about her plan to use their money. Dad also agreed that my sister should be paying for it herself - ""she didn't want one before so I'm not paying now. I want to retire soon"" kinda thing. 

Now mum got upset saying how we are acting like she wouldn't offer us money, and why do you have to be so negative etc. And that we are just jealous. Shes still upset and feels the family is all against her.

Sam is the person I have interacted with the most since they arrived, plus he seems to be a pretty chill guy. I tell him that I realized the situation after they ate the dish, then panicked and didn't know what to do. He actually surprised me a little by smiling and saying, ""ahhh no wonder it tasted so damn good. Man I wish you didn't tell me, now I can't ever eat it again!"" I was a bit shocked and I asked him if he were mad or if he felt his faith was negatively impacted. He said not mad at all and basically he should have asked before he ate it.  As many people mentioned, he said he was just used to most food being safe to eat where he is from and that he will have to be more careful now in America. He asked me how I made it and I explained. He asked if I thought it would taste as good using beef. I was honest and said no I didn't think it would be as good. I then asked him what to do about Sara and Sally. He said he didn't actually think Sally ate any because she doesn't like cheese and that if she complimented me on the dish it was probably just to be polite. On the other hand, he said Sara might be the type of person who would get upset. Not necessarily mad at me, but upset that ""unclean"" food entered her body, etc. He advised me not to tell her and repeated that he wished I didn't tell him (half joking i guess?). Sam and I really hit it off with this conversation and I am glad I told him. I am going to take his advice and leave well enough alone with Sara and Sally. Thanks everyone!*

*P.S. Many people assumed I was female. Is that because of some inherit bias that if I was a good cook I must be woman? Or do I just write like a girl?*

*TL:DR Sam was super chill and said it was not an issue and that he should have asked and will do so in the future. He advises not to tell Sara because what is done is done and she will be upset if she knows she ate pork. Sally likely didn't eat it anyway because she doesn't like cheese.*

This is confirmed shortly after their arrival when I realize they take a break each day to pray.

One more piece of backstory, I am famous at these events for my baked ziti. Everyone craves it, says its the best they ever had, begs me to make it more than once a year, etc. I have only given the recipe to one person at work because he also happens to be my best friend ""IRL"" and likes to cook too.

So the event was Monday and I bring my ziti. As usually, everyone devours it and gives me praise, including Sam, Sara, and Sally. Sam says something to the effect of,  ""I have never tasted anything quite like this is my life. It is delicious!"" I thought it was an odd comment, but I chalked it up to him being from a country without many Italian people and/or him just being very gracious and friendly. I mention the comment to my co-work/best friend and he just stares at without with a strange look on his face and says, ""Did you let Sam, Sara, and Sally eat your ziti?"" I said of course, why wouldn't I? He says, ""Dude, don't you make that sauce with pancetta?"" The moment he said I felt like I wanted to die. It never crossed my mind, but I do in fact make the sauce with pancetta, AKA pork! I was mortified. I wanted to die. I wanted to tell them. My friend convinced me not to say anything because 1- it was too late, 2- it could cause them great consternation to know they broke their religious laws and ate pork, and 3- I might face repercussions from my boss.

I told my father this story and he says Sam, Sara, and Sally have a right to know they ate pork and that I should tell them and apologize. He says they likely will be alright from a spiritual perspective because they were unaware the meal had pork in it. He says I am an AH if I don't tell them. What does everyone think?",418,1119,0.94
1218,Asshole,"My brother is a multi millionaire, he owns his own business he is known for being a tightwad. I am a retired government employee, He offered me a part time job as a tech consultant for his company, salary based on 3 days per week was the agreement so the pay is the same if I work 4 hours or 9 hours. I do not get any benefits, however he has paid me on some holidays if he was feeling generous. The only true critical part of my job is that I make the bank deposit at the end of the day, typically one day a week or up to three days a week if he is not there, if neither of us are there he has to pay his secretary OT to do the deposit. (she comes in at 5am, we close when the last truck arrives could be 3 could be 7 just depends.)

Recently our 85 year mother got sick, I took her to the hospital. Visiting hours are 9am to 9pm, for the week she was in the hospital I was there at 9am to 9pm, most days he would relieve me for 3-4 hours in the afternoon. I knew that since he was not at work someone else would have to do the deposit, I offered to take care of the deposit on several occasions, he said no, the secretary offered to stay and do it.

I took mom home from the hospital,(she was too weak to get out of bed without help) The hospital suggested someone take FMLA to stay with her.  I stayed with her the first 24 hours, the next few days he relieved me, but only for 4 hours or so I still spent the night. The 4th day he was going to watch her all day, but then said he needed to meet his architect to talk about a deck being built at his vacation home and that he could not be there until noon, that is today we will see what happens.

On payday I found that I had no paycheck, nothing. AITA for thinking that by brother could have paid me something even though I have no benefits even a partial paycheck, knowing that I offered to come to work and he told me no? I feel like he should have appreciated that stayed with mom 75% of the time compared to his 25%, which allowed him to stay at work and do what he needed to do, he did benefit from me being with mom it allowed him to do his work, and in the end he or his company actually saved the cost of my paycheck, so not only did I not get paid he profited for it. If I had a government job I would have had sick time, or FMLA to still get paid during this period. I am not expecting to be paid for watching my mom, that is my responsibility as son, But I would have appreciated getting paid for the fact that had I not spent those long hours with mom, he would have had to step away from his work to do his share, and I offered to come to work, had he said sure he will watch mom, so I could go to work I would have had a paycheck.

Please do not make this about my mother, that is not the issue here, I would have stayed with her no matter what and done whatever it takes to see her get better, this is about me dedicating more time to her than my brother so that his personal/business life was not impacted as much as mine.",40,50,0.87
1219,Asshole,"I made a throwaway because people I know look at my real account.

In my family I am the ""tech"" guy unfortunately. This usually means I always help my parents anytime they get the smallest issues with their computer (something as stupid as maximizing a window to finding out why it won't turn on). It can be annoying but I put up with it.

My dad has a friend who is in his late 60s and mentioned there is something wrong with his computer and that it's been very slow/full of pop ups. Of course my dad asked me to help him. His friend lives like an hour away so I decide to just remote into his PC instead. 

We're on the phone together and I give him instructions and after I am in, I realize he was not kidding when he said it was slow. It took like 15 minutes just to open up Internet Explorer. I originally thought it was because of too many toolbars/addons, but maybe it was malware. I begin the process of installing malwarebytes while trying to figure out if there is anyway I can speed it up.

The old guy is getting frustrated and keeps asking me if I am almost finished yet. I try to calm him down. He starts progressively getting angrier at me the longer it takes and makes suggestions like ""I should have just gotten a professional instead, this is ridiculous"" 

Now my blood is starting to boil because A) I am doing this for free, and B) He is showing zero gratitude. Eventually he tells me he is going out to get dinner with his family and he'll be back. 

To cut to the point: I got malwarebytes installed and got the computer to work a little faster. I am disgusted with his attitude and before I log off, I set his desktop background to be of a gay pornographic image of two men looking into the camera as one rides the other. I left a message telling him it was fixed.

My dad called me the next day asking if I ""did anything to his computer?"" All I tell him was that I made it faster, my dad goes on to basically say when the old guy got back on, he saw the gay pic with his wife in the room and he had to defend himself to her that he didn't put it there and that I ""must have had something to do with it."" Unfortunately he doesn't know how to change the desktop background and he wants me to try to fix it. 

Since he was rude and belittling to me during the call, I didn't really want to help them, but my gf says I was out of line and that I was an asshole putting the pic there in the first place.",54,124,0.89

1223,Not the A-hole,"I [25F] am getting married in October.  We already sent out the RSVPs and have gotten most of them back, as they are due in about a week.  However, a lot of people have added names to their RSVPs who were not invited.  People will add their SO of a few months who I have never met or even their children who I’ve never met.  I feel as though if they had asked in advance, I might have been more polite about it but people are just sending back their RSVPs that were ONLY addressed to THEM with other names on them.  People are also messaging me saying they don’t understand why they can’t have a plus one, and what kind of wedding is this where I can’t have a plus one? Well, I’ll tell you what kind of wedding it is; the kind that I don’t want to pay $60+ for a random person to be at! But, this is MY wedding day! Are you coming to my wedding to enjoy yourself and watch me happily get married, or are you coming to reap the benefits of free food and drinks? I even had a girl who told me her and her boyfriend broke up recently but to still keep her RSVP number the same because she wants to bring a date.  So, Reddit, What is wedding etiquette here? AITA here for telling everyone NO PLUS ONES unless you are married or unless the bride and/or groom KNOW them?  Can I contact these people and tell them I’m only RSVPing for the people on the invite?

EDIT: we have about 150 people coming to the wedding, most of which know each other. I have a friend from out of town coming who does not know many people and I did tell her she could bring a plus one so she wouldn’t feel alone.  I do realize that by saying “it’s MY wedding” does make me sound a little crazy. However, my parents are paying for the wedding and I’m trying to keep prices as low as possible.  We have a wedding website which we posted the URL on the RSVP and on the website it states “unless you were specifically addressed, please no plus ones.” And in the case of the people asking for the plus ones, all of them will know a fair amount of people at the wedding.

1227,Not the A-hole,"So my family has this little guest house that we rent out. We’ve had the same tenant for about 2 years now. My parents met him through a neighbor that he works for (construction). While he has helped us out a lot around the house, he comes off very creepy at times. He’s also a raging alcoholic and is a huge asshole when he’s drunk.

Some examples:
-He came into the store I used to work at completely wasted and begging me to drive him home (while i was on the job) and he hit on me the whole time. I called my dad to pick him up.

-He helped my boyfriend get his drone out of a tree once, but brings it up every time he asks for a favor (“since I helped you with your drone, can you go get me beer at 12am?”)

-He goes to our neighborhood beach to catcall the underage lifeguards and has been warned by multiple neighbors to stop

-Whenever we have someone else working on the house, he comes over and tells them what they’re doing wrong constantly

-I had a bonfire with some friends and he blasted his music to drown out the sound of us talking. It was on the weekend and wasn’t too late so I didn’t think we were being rude.

My dad can’t stand him, but my mom thinks he’s only a jerk when he’s drinking (but she doesn’t know about the underage lifeguards). I want him out so bad. So lately, I’ve been telling my parents every time he does something even slightly out of line. I’d feel bad if he doesn’t have anywhere else to go, but I’m sick of him living here. AITA for trying to get my parents to kick him out?

EDIT: I forgot to add, the whole reason I made this post- he’s working on our roof with our neighbor and we saw my cat attack a baby possum. He knows that we are huge animal lovers in my family and he started laughing and was like “look, it’s still moving!” KNOWING we don’t want to hear that shit. This happened like 10 minutes ago.",32,112,0.9

1229,Not the A-hole,"My son’s school only passes out 8 tickets per senior.   My household would need 4 tickets (graduate doesn’t need a ticket).   

My dad has been like a father to my kids and was their father figure for years before I remarried.   So that’s another ticket.  My mother’s (divorced from my dad but they are good friends) heart would be broken if she doesn’t get a ticket.   Her grandbabies are her reasons for living and breathing.  So there’s another ticket.   
That leaves me with two tickets.  
Of course... I have to give one to my children’s father.  He was a dead beat for most of their years growing up, but has matured and stepped up in their teen years, we have a good relationship and that’s their father.   He didn’t go to our daughter’s graduation because he was on an ankle monitor and his PO wouldn’t show up for his meetings to ask permission.   
But if I invite him, than I only have 1 ticket left and have to decide to either give it to the kids’ other grandpa (my stepfather who had been around all of my children’s lives) or my ex husband’s wife - who has only known my kids for a year.  
I’m afraid people will think I’m being petty and it will cause contention between my ex and us, or even her and my ex.   I’ve never felt petty toward her as she is an absolute sweetheart and I’m glad she in their lives.  But if I have to weigh who’s feelings I care least about hurting... or who my son prioritizes ... she certainly ranks lower than my parents.   All my kids’ other grandparents and extended family understand they won’t be getting an invite.  But they are arranging watch parties and will all be at the graduation party later that evening.   

TL;DR.  Limited number of graduation tickets are making me consider not inviting my ex-husband’s new wife.  

Edit: obviously if i can get my hands on extra tickets I will.

Edit; I realize I use the word “I” and ""me"" in this whole post, but the pressure is felt by my son too.  He also doesn’t want to make his father feel like his new wife is expendable or cause strife.  

Easier to answer a few questions here for those asking INFO:  
- Regarding the splitting of the tickets: My household is 5. Of course my son doesn't need a ticket, so the 4 will be myself, my husband (whom my kids call Dad and we've been married for over a decade and is highly involved in school affairs), and his 2 siblings. The other two for sure grandparents are very close to him and he sees his grandfather almost daily and his grandmother weekly. Those 6 tickets are THE most important people to my son. His father is 7th... and that's where the issues lies. His stepmother, while a complete sweetheart, is not someone he loves or has known for a long period (they've been together a year and he's only spent a handful of time around her). He doesn't want to give his grandfather's ticket to his new stepmom, but is scared of hurting his father's and his stepmom's feelings too.  And I, knowing my ex as I do, will probably be blamed for it.
- Of COURSE he chooses who he wants to come.  But he is not physically handing out the tickets.  I'm including them in his graduation announcements which I'm in charge of sending out.  I'm also getting his guest list together to send out his graduation party invites.  His girlfriend and friends he's known since Kindergarten are all graduating with him so that's a non-issue.",100,194,0.92

I didn’t say it to my parents though, so I said thank you and everything was fine.

1233,Asshole,"Backstory my aunt abandoned my Cousin and my Grandparents raise him, he has minor autism so they let him get away with everything and I’m gonna divide this into multiple parts 

**HOUSE USE** 

This obsessive nature started at age 3 when he started using bathrooms for the first time, he loves the toilet flush idk why but he wants to use the bathroom constantly, he flushed the toilet even if their nothing there 

And while most kid would spend their time playing with toys and shit, he spends flushing the toilet, at first they tried to stop him but he screamed and kicked and yelled my Grandma always points to his MINOR autism to defend him, my grandma is 61 and my Grandma is 59 they shouldn’t be raising an Autistic kid at this age

He spends hours a day flushing the toilet and sometimes even tries to go into my room to flush it, if my door I ever unlocked he will come inside my room to flush it constantly and freak out if I try to make him leave, now my Grandma just comes into my room with him and watches his flush the toilet so I started locking my doors and everyday he throws a tantrum at my door, which is why I don’t spend time at my grandparents house anymore and just stay with my parents 

**INTERNET** 

He just watches videos if Toilet Flushes constantly, sometimes people reviewing toilets, I checked his search history and his recommend list and it’s just toilets 

Yesterday which is the catalyst for me wanting to do this he was watching so animated shut of Cailou fucking drowning his sister in a toilet and flushing her down and that was the first time they stopped him from doing shit like this in years but he screamed and kicked and yelled again 

**PUBLIC** 

Whenever we get to a new place the first thing he wants to do is use the bathroom I kid you not that’s always the first thing he ever says 

We got to Cuba FUCKING CUBA and went into a gorgeous new hotel and the first thing he wanted to do was use the bathroom 

**WIBTA?** 

I get that he’s Autistic but does that really allow them to spoil him like this? This isn’t what normal kids do this is wrong, they really need to sort this out, and if they don’t and continue to let him be like this, I’m just not gonna come back to my grandparents house again

Edit: Forgot to mention he’s had 3 Therapists who have brought him toys and games to play with them yet he has refused and tried flush toilets instead of playing, my grandma fires all 3 of them for being “too hard on him” and not letting him flush toilets which is the thing they’re trying to fix 

He has also flush toilets in the school a numerous amount of times and the teacher even asked if he had a bladder problem 

He ruined my trip to Cuba because my Grandma refused to leave the hotel for dinner until he finished flushing and he never finished, he kept us up until 2:00 in the morning on a different day because my grandma refuses to stop him",37,39,0.91

1235,Not the A-hole,"My girlfriend and I have been bouncing a mutual friend from Japan between our houses and entertaining him before he goes off to college here. On the drive to pick up his girlfriend for him, he began asking me about American food culture, which turned into him using my girlfriend as an example of what's ""not okay to eat like or look like"" in Japanese culture. He asked me if her weight was something I was okay with in a very shocked way among other things.

Anyways, the reason why this is relevant is because later him and his girlfriend began questioning me about my relationship and began trying to shut it down and respond negatively to everything. I felt very attacked, and this has been a trend both me and my girlfriend have noticed in the littlest of things he says to us and about us.

I mentioned all this to my girlfriend because it bothered me and it was relevant to us since we're friends with both of them. My girlfriend and his are really close and both have mild eating disorders, which they talk about and help each other with.

Every year, I plan for us to go to the renaissance festival because he has never been and it’s one of my favorite things in the world and I know he’d love it as well, but something always happens and we haven’t been able to go. This year, we finally can. A few days before we planned to go, his sister (23F) asked if she could go with us. His sister asks to go places with us all the time, and I have never said no. I am very close with his family and I do enjoy spending time with them, and his sister and I get along well. Anyway, he told his sister that I probably wouldn’t mind, before asking me. I did mind.. I have been planning this as a date for us for a long time, since he has never been, and if his sister went with us, we would not be able to completely be ourselves, as she is a little prude.. meaning she doesn’t swear at all, doesn’t have the same sense of humor as us, (for example, she wouldn’t find the pickle guy’s jokes funny) etc.  Since this will be my boyfriend’s first time there, and I planned to buy the tickets and everything, I really want him to fully enjoy himself, because he is always a bit more reserved around his family (just how he is). Since she still wanted to spend time with us regardless, she asked us to go to the state fair with her on Labor Day, and of course I said yes. However, I still feel like a jerk, because she has never been to the renaissance festival either. 

Was I an asshole for not letting her go with us?

Edit - Since a few people are assuming he’s not going to like it and I want him to go just because I like it, the very first things we bonded over and shared in common was our love for World of Warcraft, Game of thrones, and Lord of the Rings... so we are both pretty big nerds.

I'm inviting a bunch of people over for dinner next week. My partner eats meat, as do most of the guests (but not all). The menu I have planned for the evening is made of up of dishes that EVERYONE attending can eat, i.e. vegetarian. All the food will taste great (assuming no kitchen disasters), and I normally get great reviews from guests for my cooking. However, my partner is insisting that I serve meat at the dinner as well, to cater to our meat-eating guests. He claims that it's what a good host would do.

I completely disagree with this. First of all, I'm paying for all this, so why on earth would I pay to buy ingredients that I (and some of my guests) can't even eat? Is it such an insult for omnivores to go without meat for ONE meal? My partner argued that it would be the same as if a meat-eater served dishes with ONLY meat at a party, leaving nothing for vegetarians. Again, no, that argument doesn't hold because meat-eaters CAN eat vegetarian dishes, but it doesn't work the other way around.

Anyway, I brought this up in conversation with my parents today, and they are firmly on my partner's side. They're calling me self-centered for ""not thinking of every guest's comfort"".

1250,Asshole,"Last year in October my sister was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. This hit my whole family like a ton of bricks.

My sister is very very ignorant of her disease. She was under the impression that after her first round of chemo, she was going to be cancer free. And when we went to see the doctor today, she was told about the new tumor, and was shocked. It’s shocking regardless, but the situation is made worse by my sister asking the doctor “Am I going to die because of the cancer?” the doctor replied “Yes the cancer will probably kill you”.

Now me and my mom talked about my sister’s situation and she agreed that because of the limited time my sister might have, that she was going to fund my sister’s travel to England to meet her fiancé.  We started talking to my sister about how important it is to make a decision on this soon, because my sister has a tendency to make excuses and delay things,  She started crying saying that it sounds like we’re only giving her months to live and that she “just got told that she got cancer again”. I tried to explain that at stage 4, cancer doesn’t go away. But she started shouting that even if the doctor knew her ‘expiration date’, she wouldn’t want to know, that she’s scared. I admitted to her that this is a scary situation. But backed down and I told her we just wanted to make plans quick in case this new chemo hits her hard.

In reality, me and my mom had just gotten done having a conversation where my mother kind of asked me to tell my sister that she might not have long to live (survival rate for stage 4 ovarian cancer is 54% at 2 years, and my sister is about to be done with year 1.  I’m worried that she’s going to go downhill over the next year and that she’ll regret not living life to the fullest (currently her days consist of being on facebook for 6 hours and watching TV the rest of the day). I want her to make some memories over the next year so she can look back and say “I did that”, and have some positive memories when she doesn’t have the energy to do things anymore. Beyond that, I am an RN and we’re taught to give the patient all the information so they can make informed decisions also I wonder whether she will have a chance to ‘accept’ death before it’s imminent and thrust upon her

So here’s the crux of the issue: I still want to still have a conversation with her tomorrow about the extent of her illness regardless of whether she ‘wants’ to know or not. And am seriously debating telling her that her survival rate is 50% over the next year so she can’t ‘put off’ things anymore

So reddit, Am I the asshole for wanting to tell her the truth or is ignorance bliss?

TL:DR – Sister wants to remain ignorant of long term survival for her cancer, I want her to face reality to come to terms with what’s happening.

As I stated above, I am going to be there for two weeks.  He is going to be working while I'm there, so we will only have evenings together, except for five days (two weekends and Labor Day).  I really don't want to spend a whole day (maybe two) in a truck with someone I have never met, or entertaining myself elsewhere, when I'm actually there just to see my boyfriend.  Please note: hunting season lasts for several weeks.

AITA for insisting he follow the original plan of spotting from the road, and therefore keeping him from hunting, so we can spend time together?",47,60,0.9
1252,Not the A-hole,"Okay so some background information.

I'm 16 my mom is 31 she works her ass off at work (which is at night) to make sure we have a roof over our head and food on the table and this is something I adamantly respect about her. But I work too and go to school and clean the whole house and take care of my sister basically single handedly cause even if my mom is home she's almost always asleep or watching TV not paying attention to her. And I keep my space pretty clean its not perfect but like its livable. And I get being tired from work I really do.

BUT JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SHE HAS NO PROBLEM LIVING IN FILTH OR MAKING OTHERS LIVE IN FILTH

Some examples:

-Her boxes of stuff she refuses to get rid of are literally everywhere. We hardly have a living room

-She let's food mold in her room and then takes it to the kitchen and tells me to do the disgusting moldy dishes

-She never rinses her dishes off

-She never cleans up after herself, there's  constantly trash and food she didn't eat and drinks she didn't drink and misc. dishes from her all over the place

-She never puts in any effort to keep the house clean I.E. vacuuming, dishes, taking the garbage out, cleaning the bathroom. She just let's it get gross until I get pissed off and take care of it

Just a few examples

Am I the asshole? I give her money for rent and clean the house and raise her child and take care of the dog that I didn't want. But I feel so mean for being angry at her?",24,78,0.9
1253,Not the A-hole,"I’m the oldest of 3 siblings.  My bro and sis have always been much closer to each other than to me.  

My teen years were turbulent to say the least.  Despite being the ""gifted"" kid- I performed poorly.  I was expelled from school, would disappear for weeks, and eventually lived homeless in another State.

When I became interested in becoming stable I joined the military – but I make a poor soldier.  I spent most of my time AWOL or mopping floors for going AWOL.  

I was AWOL and homeless again when my dad had a heart attack.  I left the army and moved in and helped with his recovery.  I went back to school (and dropped out, oh well) , got a job, got married, had kids, and became a relatively stable person.  I took an IT job at the same place Dad worked.  He was beaming as I really started to shine there.  It was a long commute via train and we spent a lot of time together.  At work we would often sneak away together to grab lunch, go shopping, etc. 

Sis married a guy from my high school. He had been a good student while I was more the drug addled narcissist.  He’d apparently taken notice of me back then, but I had never noticed him.

He’s a decent fellow, and we got to know each other a bit when he started workin and commutin with my Dad and I.  He was very ambitious (abandoned our train to drive in early stay late, etc.) and would often try to “fix” things about me in our conversations.  It was clear we offended each other, but it was usually effortless for me to be passive about it.  He tried to block some opportunities for me which upset me – but I was content to note that deep down he was sadly “no true friend” and just keep on keepin on.  As long as my sis’ happy… meh, I was doin fine!

Later, I moved out of state to pursue other opportunities and a few years later tragedy struck.  Dad died suddenly, and while I handled the news fine, when my bro-in-law asked to give the eulogy… I exploded.  The thought of this vile person who refuses to see me as anything but an angsty teen giving MY dads eulogy…  

I confronted him.  I was harsh.  I was manic.  I made a scene.  It hurt my lil bro and scared sis.

I eulogized dad with notes the family hashed out together during the fog of it all.  Afterward I took my bro-in-law for a long walk.  By the end he seemed to understand my feelings and why his offer may have inappropriate.  We were able to hug, etc. and the family was able to relax around us again.  We’ve been back to contentedly ignoring each other ever since.

I recently spoke to my bro and learned that he (and maybe sis) is still angry.  He believes that I refuse to see some of the reality of the situation, and that I should be ashamed.  Despite reconciling somewhat with my bro-in-law, I still feel the same as I did back then.  It’s where I’m at emotionally, even a decade later.

So… am I….",324,2055,0.95
1254,Not the A-hole," 

About two months ago I was having a texting one of my good friends catching up and having a good conversation and eventually the topic of our conversation led to our SO's.

I asked what's new with her love life and she started to brush the fact that they had sex for the first time so I asked if they had done it and she said yes and explained that they are really excited to have taken such a big step forward in their relationship.

I congratulated her for losing her V card and I asked questions like ""How was it?"" or ""Did it hurt at all?"" and such and eventually told her that I was happy for them. We are very open about our lives so there is no TMI between each other. I quickly moved on and we started talking about other things.

Fast forward to a month and a half later, I am texting her and she said she was upset. Obviously I asked her what was wrong if she wanted to share and if there was anything I could do to help. She said that sometimes she regrets telling someone something so personal. Me being completely oblivious I asked her what happened and she kept deflecting my question and saying it's nothing. Eventually I asked if it was me and she didn't respond at first and said yes.

I asked what was wrong and she sent me this long paragraph about how she regrets telling me that she lost her V card because it was really special to her and the fact that I couldn't even spend at least 10 minutes talking to her about it was such a dick move.

I tried to apologize but she just shot me down and said that she refuses to accept my apology and goes on about how she regrets telling me in the first place and that she was being sensitive. I told her it wasn't a matter of not caring, and that I understood it was a big step for them and I just wasn't thinking in the moment. A lot of my friends had been losing their V cards but had been treating it like every other event that happened in their lives, so it was never a big deal amongst others. I asked if there was anything I could do to make up for it and she said no.

Follow the next three weeks I keep trying to talk to her and she kept acting cold and not engaging in any conversation I attempt to make. I ask if she was still upset about what happened and she starts berating me again asking why do I care and that I was a dick, so I eventually snapped and started telling her that she has to move on from what happened and just because I didn't care that much about the fact that she had sex for the first time doesn't give her the right to act cold and berate me. She got very upset and said that I was an asshole for being insensitive and not understanding due to the fact that I am a guy and I don't know what it's like.

I talked to another friend about it and she said that I was being an asshole because I was a guy and a girls V card is very special to them even if they don't say it, and I should have realized this. I want to fix things between my friend and I but first I need to know if I'm the asshole.",36,37,0.89
1255,Everyone Sucks,"My gf and I have been dating for two years. I happily pay for the majority of our expenses since I make more than her and she lives with me and is currently going to school. Over the years she has always done this thing where when she owes me money, she always rounds down the total amount. Sometimes cents, but sometimes dollars. Nothing too crazy, but it has happened often.

I recently ordered her printer ink and her class textbook on my prime account and she asks for the total which was only $82.65. She sends me $82 and I ask her about the $.65 since this has been going on for a long time and, at this point, I find it a little inconsiderate and annoying. 

She's thought I was joking and after explaining that I wasn't, she says that I'm being ridiculous for asking for so little and that anyone else wouldn't care. I told her that it seems rude and inconsiderate to give less than what you owe unless the person owed offers first. No matter the amount.

1256,Not the A-hole,"So some backstory. I haven’t worked with this coworker very long. Maybe about a month now? We got along at first, but at work shes become very bossy and almost looks down on me. So for that reason I almost dont feel bad about it?

She does a bit of artwork and after knowing her for a few days she added me on all social media and then joined a group i’m in showing off her artwork. I don’t mind that. What I did mind however, was that her artwork was just ideas she stole from other people. She looks up ideas on social media and then doesnt trace, but draws them on paper and posts these to her social media. It would be harmless however she was giving people permission to have it tattooed and selling prints of her artwork. One particular piece people were asking about was actually a piece by one of my favorite artists who I could contact. She was giving people permission to tattoo his art under the impression that it was her art.

In a later art post she made a comment that not all ideas are hers so they’d need to ask before getting things tattooed, but still did not give credit to anyone for using their ideas or getting inspiration and did not say anything to the people she already said yes to.

So AITA for letting that one artist know she stole and is selling his idea/artwork?

1257,Not the A-hole,"I bought a new (new to me) car roughly a year and a half ago. It is the nicest car I have ever owned and the first time I've had car payments, $173.00 to be exact. 

Last month I went out of town for work for a week. My boyfriend drove me to the airport the morning of my flight in my car. I offered to take my car that morning because the airport is out of the way and it was a nice gesture to drop me off instead of taking a ride service. While I was away he informed me he was heading to his home town for the weekend to visit his family/friends and to go rock climbing and camping. A round trip back home is 230 miles without driving around town/to the climbing spot/ out to his family's house in the valley. 

I had feeling while chatting with him the day he got to home town and simply asked which car he took. He said mine. I reacted and said it would've been nice if he had asked. He apologized the same day and said he didnt think it was a big deal. I tried explaining to him i was upset because putting hundreds of miles on my car without my knowledge is disrespectful. I feel like I  should say we've had a couple fights in the past over him asking to use my car and me saying no. 

He has never paid for any part of my car payment, maintenance, or insurance which I explained as calmly as possible. I honestly believe he took my car without asking because he knew I would say no and since I was out of the state there was nothing I could do. 

Anyways, I told him I want him to understand there are consequences to his actions and he should pay the $86 as half of my monthly car payment for putting 300+ miles on my car. He claimed he could pay $50 which I said no to. I want the $86.

AITA?

I did not expect this post to receive so much attention. Thank you everyone for providing good insight and questions. I feel as if I should add a few things (although I'm sure no one actually cares) I did not include in my original post but may have been important for some of you. 

Edit 1: I would not say he stole my car. 

Edit 2: I in no way continuously deny him use of my car. He is more than welcome to take my car to the store, a friends house, to the trail head, etc. What I have denied him is the use of my car for long road trips to go gallivanting through the mountains of western Montana. A little backstory: shortly after I bought my car last year while I was working weekdays and he worked weekends he would ask to take my car to his hometown for 3-4 days at a time almost every week of the spring and summer. I agreed several times because I could tell he was bored and didnt feel a sense of community where we were currently living. I eventually had to put my foot down due to feeling taken advantage of. He had a perfectly good car he could use while my car was racking up thousands of miles and I was footing the bill on payments, maintenance, etc. This resulted in arguements and me feeling unheard. Taking my car without asking last month was essentially the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Edit 3: Some of you accused me of not know how to share. Sharing requires consent, chew on that. 

Edit 4: This clearly has to do more with respect, boundaries, and trust. I should've focused more on that than the nickle and diming of the miles. I just didnt know how else to get across that I was seriously pissed. 

Edit 5: I never demanded money or gave him an ultimatum as some of you suggested. I've asked for the money once and only once. I mainly came here to determine if I should tell him how I felt one more time (four week since initial incident) and let it go.",649,1745,0.96

1259,Not the A-hole,"So I was on my pc playing some minecraft to pass the time and my little step brother walked in wanting to play, now a little backstory, my step brother had ADD, anger issues and was in therapy at the time so was quite irritable and got annoyed easily,

So I sat there playing and he asked if he could play, now I said yes at first and we started switching back and forth on minecraft for about 30 minutes until it was my turn to play, he passed it to me and about 5 minutes later he said this:

StepBro: I want to play now you’ve been playing forever! 

Me:It’s only been like 5 minutes you can play soon

StepBro: No I want to PLAY NOW 

And in a blink of an eye he tried to snatch the mouse from me, I moved the mouse out the way so he couldn’t grab it, he then went for the keyboard, grabbed it and slammed it on the floor, somehow luckily it didn’t break apart from a few keys coming off but I managed to put most of them back on.

After he had calmed down I decided to ban him from using my pc, mainly because I didn’t want my mouse, keyboard or pc to be damaged even more if he had another tantrum, but I feel bad because he has anger issues so it isn’t really his fault,

Last week, I hired some gardeners to plant a few trees in my backyard. I gave them very specific details on how I wanted them to look. They worked very hard for a couple of days and pretty much gave me exactly what I wanted. I was happy at the time and paid them.

But now, I just don't like the way the trees look anymore. The longer they're there, the more unattractive they seem. My wife also agrees that they don't really fit our backyard the way we had hoped. So we're planning on getting them removed. I thought it would be easier if we just hire the same people since they are familiar with our backyard, and they're cheap. (We are still paying for removal of course). My wife thinks that it would be cruel to make them remove the trees they had worked very hard to plant after just a week. She suggests that we hire some other people, but they are almost double the price.

1262,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr at bottom

Okay so I’m almost 19.

When my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn’t say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it’s weird they never told their daughters, given that they’re all such protestors against abortion.

But anyways dad also has a sister, who’s daughter I’m really close with. She’s Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given that he doesn’t have a father.

I’m usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle’s daughters, and I was messaging them three way last night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

I told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she’s easy and shouldn’t have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.

I got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

“Yeah I hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.”

Three hours later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.

And I was! My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning I’m using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with me today. I was very earnest. 

I always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus I ask, AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

1263,No A-holes here,"Hi, judges I'll try keep this brief. 

I've been dating an amazing woman for 8 weeks and I'm head over heels for this kid. We're polar opposites; she's very free spirited and easy going while I'm a bit uptight sometimes but she grounds me. I have to mention she never wears a bra, which I don't care about since it's her body but it's part of the problem addressed down below.  

I'm very close with my family as she is too. We had dinner with her parents last Wednesday, and they were so awesome, I was relieved because they're hilarious and would totally get along with my parents. This Friday is when she meets my family for the first time and I'm really excited. She's a bit nervous and she asked if she could do anything/bring anything and I said ""nope just yourself, my love"" then she asked what she should wear and I said just something nice since we're going to a pretty nice restaurant (it's also my sisters birthday dinner) 

one thing I did want to request is if she could wear a bra with whatever outfit she wears but I don't know how to go about it. 

Note: My sister can be an outspoken bitch sometimes and I really didn't want any reason for her to give my girlfriend any shit because it's not exactly unnoticeable when my girl doesn't wear a bra and I don't want to start an argument and make everything super awkward at dinner by telling her to shut the fuck up on her birthday.

1264,Asshole,"I am 23M and my father and his new wife (he remarried two years ago, he met her after divorcing my mother when i was 19) 'decided' that the house I grew up in should be redecorated. Of course I know it was only her who wanted this, she wants to tear down everything that's related to his previous family life. She even said once she wants a life of things only they have used like the sofa, beds, tables etc. She at least contributes financially but I get sad thinking all the things i grew up around, my familiar environment is disappearing, I 've tried to think this change could be good but it feels like it's turning into an ikea type house, like we had so many vintage items passed through family that they have now sold... they said they could find a storage facility for me but they wont pay for it, i can't afford storage. Also why would I when my father has a house with space. 

Anyway in my father's house I have my room which has also been redecorated and she has packed my things into boxes and wants me to take them. It just annoys me as I live in a city 200 miles away so it's easier when I have my things there. Also I don't like not having a room that feels like mine there either, I am only renting a small appartment so it would be hard for me to store myself aswell It feels like I don't have a home, I can barely call the place I live in now a home :/ On top of that I get a feeling my father changed completely after being with her, he said it's because he loves her and apparently he never loved my mother which makes me mad at him for using her all these years. My mother has mental illness problems sadly and she lives on government benefits, she doesn't have space nor the money and she didn't get any money from the divorce as my father fought her in court.

TL;DR I 23M am upset my father and his new wife are removing my possessions from their house, the house i grew up in, and are asking me to take them even though I can't afford to store them and my appartment is too small to store here. I feel like I don't have a home.",32,41,0.93
1265,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: Did a performance assessment with a new hire.  She is a single mom and left her 9 y/o son in her hotel room while we were working. I reported this to our manager due to liability and after returning to the home office this afternoon, was informed her contract had been terminated and she would no longer be employed at our affiliate partners. 

This Monday l was in the Midwest evaluating a remote new hire still in her probationary period in my department. While working, we shared small details of our lives that you normally do with new co-workers. She mentioned she was a single mom to a 9 y/o boy and since it was still summer break, she had a hard time finding childcare while she worked. I nodded in sympathy and then she told me she brought him along with her on this business trip to enjoy the hotel amenities and get out of the house. 

I paused what I was doing and looked at her in surprise. I asked if she had gotten approval for family travel as it’s allowed, as long as it’s requested in advance and approved by our manager. She told me that she didn’t think it was a big deal and she’s done it before in other companies. I didn’t say anything else and we finished our day at the site. 

While at the airport, my manager called asking how the review had gone. I gave him my assessment but told him my biggest concern was outside of the site work and mentioned what she had told me. I also expressed my concern over leaving a young child alone for so long. My manager agreed and told me this was a possible liability issue for the company. He said he needed to speak with HR department after our call. I gave him the rest of my assessment and then boarded my flight when it was called. 

Today, I arrived at our office for a weekly in-person team meeting. My manager informed us that the new Midwest hire’s contract had been terminated. He added that she would not be receiving a referral and that she was now blacklisted from working on partner company projects. 

After the meeting, a few colleagues asked me what happened. I summarized the trip and a couple of colleagues, also single mothers, said I shouldn’t have ratted her out because she most likely didn’t have any other option, and now she was no longer employable in our field. I told them I didn’t expect the consequences to be so severe, but I still had to report what she did because of liability. They disagreed and said I should’ve been more sympathetic to her situation. 

Am I the asshole for reporting her transgression?

ADDITIONAL EDIT to answer repeat questions. 

Thank you to everyone who’s given judgement and for all the constructive comments. To those who have attacked me personally based on my post, fair enough. 

6. A lot of people are assuming that the new hire was poor or at least too poor to hire childcare. I never wrote that she was poor, only that she had a hard time finding childcare because of summer break. I’m not trying to be elitist, but to qualify for our job, you need a graduate degree or a BSN with at least a couple of years of experience. The new hire certainly has options with other companies not affiliated with our current one or its partners. Any major health network or any large private clinic certainly has openings for what we do with or without a referral. 

7. In regards to corporate loyalty, me, my coworkers, and her are all contractors. We work for ourselves and we pick and choose contracts that we want to take. Once your contract is up, you move on. I could care less who the higher ups are as long as I get a fair evaluation at the end of my contract. 

8. As for HR policy regarding employee information. My field review summary is not privileged information among departmental co-workers who are also field reviewers. This wasn’t water cooler gossip. This was me giving a factual account of what occurred to people who perform the same function that I do. The fact that 2 co-workers thought I was an asshole is a result of this discussion. 

9. Some have asked what I do for a living. In broad terms, my co-workers and I audit clinics, hospitals, and insurance companies to be sure no fraud is happening on either end, and that government laws are followed in regards to procedures and practices. It’s literally our job to be meticulous in following and enforcing established policies. 

EDIT for Clarifications

1. She knew about the travel policies and needing approval.  We are all trained on company SOPs as contractors for several weeks before being certified. Once certified, we’re field reviewed and if approved are assigned work projects as remote workers. 

2. My role as a field reviewer was to assess her on her work ethic, site task abilities, and adherence to our SOPs including travel guidelines. I’m not allowed to give feedback to her as it’s her assigned mentor’s job to discuss strengths, weaknesses, and how to improve because they work one on one with new hires closely. I’m a essentially a proctor overseeing a field test. 

3. I’ve never met her or spoken with her or her son  before this past Monday and only know what she mentioned in passing. 

4. Her mentor and my manager would have learned she was traveling with someone eventually because the hotel receipt lists the room service menu items purchased. There no possible way food could have been delivered to her room while she was at work with me without someone else ordering it. 

5. “Outside of site work” refers specifically to the tasks we do while at the clinic but doesn’t mean she isn’t evaluated for following guidelines while offsite during travel.",1170,1256,0.92

1269,Not the A-hole," 

Backstory: My dad is the type to constantly be in and out of new relationships. Lately they've lasted around a year. I find it exhausting to constantly be involved with new women, and have expressed that I don't care what he does, but I'd like to not be involved.

Last night, my fiance and father had a conversation where we all agreed to place boundaries on the relationship between us and his girlfriend (this one's been about eight months) - namely that we would only have to be around or interact with her when it had to do with my sister (who is about 8 years younger). This is especially important due to our closeness in age with his girlfriend - my fiance has run into people she's gone to high school with that happen to be friends with this woman while we've been visiting my father and it's extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm getting married in about a month. My fiance is having a surprise bridal shower thrown for her on Saturday. Today, my dad texted me informing me that his girlfriend would be his date for the wedding and all wedding related events (including that she would be attending the bridal shower that neither my dad nor my sister or I would be, thrown for my fiance). I told my dad that we would actually appreciate it if he would attend the wedding solo so that he could focus his attention on being the father of the groom, as opposed to on his new girlfriend. Especially since none of the family have met her yet in the 8 months they've been together, and he is the type to likely go around introducing her to everyone, which I think is inappropriate to do for the first time at my wedding. He flipped. He's livid. My fiance and I think it's a perfectly reasonable request given his history and the boundaries we agreed to last night. He thinks he ""needs to fill the void beside him"" and us asking him to attend alone is the ultimate slight. He refuses to come without her, so we will probably cave and allow her to come. But really, am I the asshole?

1273,Not enough info,"I work for a large entertainment company. We got an email introducing new hires and one of the names stood out to me. I googled him and his LinkedIn profile came up. I recognize the guy as someone who worked at my kid's school as a TA and at Coffee Bean, not at ABC or NBC. I read his work profile and it's all lies. It doesn't match up. It's funny because he has no references on his profile. His education is true. I remember his saying that he was in college, but his work history is not. I believe they call references but really they could be speaking with your grandmother. They do verify education. He is working in casting. It kinda irritates me that I had to work my ass off to get where I'm at and this guy lied. Our departments overlap a bit. I'm the director in my department. I thought of reaching out to his managers and letting them know that they hired a fraud. This pisses me off. How many people lost a chance to work because he lied on his resume and sold it? He could do a lot of damage.",56,104,0.89

1278,No A-holes here,"I have made a habit of utilizing Amazon's warehouse deals when shopping. Even dipping into the used-acceptable to used-very good categories since it just seems to be stuff people returned for imperfect packaging or seemingly no good reason at all in most cases. 

Today a latest wave of boxes was incoming and instead of a towel bar for our bath, I was sent a nice laptop with a bent box and ""renewed"" labeling. Looked it up on their site and my $18 dollar item was swapped for a $1,400 one, even renewed. Wife and I checked the packaging, clearly for us and labeled household goods like the others, whereas this laptop is listed on their site as requiring a signature due to high value.

I would like to keep the laptop unless Amazon contacts me looking for it, but due the morals and karma involved my wife would like me to call them and tell them, rather than just ordering another towel bar and keep rolling the warehouse deal dice, WIBTA?

Side question in case anyone knows, is this even legal (USA) to hold onto? Edit - apparantly legal in the US and considered a gift by the FTC.

EDIT/Update - Wife still recommended I call, so I did this morning. CS told me they can only assist by sending a new bar and a label to return the laptop (likely only charging me $18 again if I didn't return the laptop) Or issue a refund of $18 and sending me a return label for the laptop. I asked her if I could keep it, and was told no further action is required by me (or her) if I am satisfied with what was received, echoing the FTC rule.",140,157,0.94
1279,Not the A-hole,"My brother (lets call him MB) just moved into his new home. My family and I have been helping MB move into the home over the last month and there are just two more trips of belongings that need to be made in order to finish the move. He is busy for the week and one of these trips is time sensitive, a storage unit, meanwhile the other trip can wait. My other brother (OB) and I have offered to move the storage unit belongings while MB is out, overall this is a 3 hour trip minimum.

Now OB wants us to make the second trip as well (another 3 hours minimum) as an act of kindness towards MB. This trip consists of nothing but a wheelbarrow and an ATV.

On a normal week, MB passes by where he used to live daily (where the belongings are) and even stops by for around half an hour every time before going to his new house. Because of this I think it would be best if OB and I just load up everything for MB one day when he stops by as he is already on his way to his house, and MB just spend 15 minutes unloading, rather than OB and I spend 3 hours round trip to do the same task. I’m willing to help MB but I just find this trip to be inefficient.


TL;DR AITA for not wanting to make a 3 hour trip out of kindness, when my brother already makes this trip daily and it would just add 15 minutes.


To clarify, I don’t believe MB to be involved here as the decision to make this trip was an idea by OB out of kindness. I just personally find the trip to be a bit excessive.",12,42,0.92
1280,Not the A-hole,"So I (27f) got engaged last December, and told my family shortly after. My twin sister proposed to her boyfriend *the next day*.

Throughout my wedding planning whenever I've said something me and my future wife are doing for our wedding it feels like Sis has immediately replied ""oh what a coincidence I'm doing the exact same thing""

So far we have exactly the same:

* Cake
* Centrepieces
* Flowers
* Venue
* Caterer/menu
* Outfits
* And fuck knows what else.

When the first couple things were exactly the same I was like ""okay... little weird but just a coincidence"".

But then I realised that after she picked out a ruched satin ballgown in ivory for her wedding dress, she switched to a full sleeve lace dress with a high-low skirt and sweetheart neckline, which is identical to my wedding dress. And when I say ""identical"", the only difference between these two dresses is that hers is in ivory and mine is in cream. And she made this switch *after* I picked out mine and she came with me to the store to help me pick, so she didn't just know I'd chosen that dress, she helped me choose it.

Her wedding is a month before mine. Hers is in November, while mine is in December. We both still have time to change stuff around, and were told as long as we made the choices before we got to the 1 month countdown, it would be fine, and after the countdown it was still possible, just trickier.

&#x200B;

I told my sister that I'm fine with the centrepieces, venue, caterer and menu being exactly the same, and I am willing to change my cake so she can keep hers as it is. I'll even change the colour scheme and let my sister have navy and change mine to a dark red or something. But she has to change *something*. She hasn't had the dress tailored yet and I have, so she can easily return or exchange it. If she can't or doesn't want to then change the cake, as she has time. Or the colour scheme or the flowers, as she has time to change those, too. But give me something from my wedding so I don't look like I'm copying her.

Sis says I'm being a bitch, I don't own or have a claim to any of these things. The cake comes from a bakery we loved when we were kids, the venue is one of the nicer wedding spots in town, the caterer, flowers, centrepiece are all decided, and after seeing the dress on me she wanted to see how it would look on her and loved it as much as I did. She argues that as my wedding is a month after hers, I am the one who should change things as I have more time. She also says that the closer we are to the deadline, the more expensive it will be to change things, so while I can still switch stuff around for free, she will have to at the very least pay a fee to change things and it's unreasonable of me to expect her to alter her wedding.

My father is on her side due to the timing and a few well timed tears from Sis, and my brother says she's not going to back down and it would be easier on everyone to just let her have this.

Dad is ill, not severely, but he's had a few health scares, has high blood pressure, and he can't deal with any upset in the family. I moved nearer to him to help look after him, and this is just causing unnecessary drama that could actually put his health at risk.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Info: I gave Sis some of the information because she's meant to be my Maid of Honour.

Edit: the stuff she's picked is so oddly specific, it's not just the identical dress. The flowers, for example, were a huge thing for us. On our first date I made a joke about how she ""couldn't get gayer"" and she gave me a bouquet of rainbow roses (they're made by splitting the stem and putting each part of the stem in a different colour dye) so for our wedding (with some advice from the florist) we went for bouquets of white roses with a single rainbow rose in the middle, and the buttonholes are white roses for everyone but my future wife, who has a rainbow rose. My sister, who doesn't even like roses and her groom, who is a raging homophobe, have no attachment to these flowers, but they are having these exact flowers for their wedding. It's too weird to be a coincidence.",335,826,0.97
1281,Not the A-hole,"So for context I’m 22 pretty damn skinny and a C cup. My parents and I are from Africa and they tend to be pretty conservative. (And they wonder why I wanna move out)

Anyways my mom has been getting on my case and wants me to wear a bra around the house whenever my dad is home. We had a huge argument when I wore a tank top and she made me go change.

I haven’t worn a tank top since I’ve worn big t shirts or thick tanks with thick straps and a bunch of writing on them to cover my boobs. 

When I go braless you literally can only see like the shape of my boobs idk how to describe it (girls know what I’m talking about) 

Anyway my mom always gets on my case about wearing a bra because it’s inappropriate around my dad but my argument is why would my dad even look at like like that in the first place (no my mom doesn’t know something I don’t she's just being weird)

But yeah at i the asshole for refusing to wear a bra and getting in an argument with my mom every time.

Edit: Thank you, I was worried I was being unreasonable. As of now I'll do my best to suck it up until I move out.

1284,Not the A-hole,"I work for a well known grocery store with an upbeat demeanor. For the past two years that I have been at this store there have been two women that come in everyday and stand by the sample station and continually take samples. For the past two years they have stood there and talked and eaten, they never buy anything, they just loiter. Of course with the company and their personal we aren't allowed to say anything that would come off as negative and for the most part I never work the sample station, today I did.

I was covering someone who needed to take a ten minute break. Once I got back there one of the two women was already on their second sample, while I was putting on my gloves she grabbed her third. Normally I'm a pretty laid back person, I try not to let things bother me, especially when they are as miniscule as this but today was different. I stood there  while a customer came up and poured himself a small cup of coffee (we also have little cups of coffee and a carafe for customers). Before the gentleman could take a sample one of the loiterers came up and grabbed the plate. I looked at her and her eyes made contact with mine. She said: I thought I would give you something to do while you just stand there, this meaning I would have to serve up another plate with the sample. I looked at her dead in the eyes and replied with: This is your last sample, you will not take another one. This seemed to startle her, her crony also looked at me with a face that could only be read as ""you can't do that."" A moment went by and the customer who I denied anymore samples went up to the coffee carafe and began to pour herself another cup. The carafe was near the bottom, she turned to me and said: You're almost out of coffee to which I replied: Yes, I know and I'll fill it up once you leave. Again she looked at me with a startled face and walked back towards her friend. 

Once the main sample person returned I told him what transpired and he looked a bit shocked. My day continued but I had this feeling in the back of my mind that maybe there was a chance I was indeed the asshole.",88,80,0.92

1288,Not the A-hole,"My family is mostly Catholic, I (27F) am not. I converted in high school and I'm active in a non-denominational church. Up until a few months ago I hadn't attended a Catholic Mass in almost 5 years.

My cousin had his first communion a few months ago. His family live closer to me than my parents so they were coming in to visit and I agreed to come see them. I said that I wouldn't take communion. Non-Catholics are not allowed to take communion in Catholic churches and in doing so I would be effectively making a statement I was Catholic, which I'm not willing to do.

My mom said she really didn't me to abstain because it'd embarrass her around family. It would be publicly signifying that I'm not Catholic around some relatives that might not know that I'm not and they might ask why and she'd be embarrassed. I told her that's not a valid justification to lie. She asked if I could go up with my arms crossed for a blessing instead which is offered because then people may not notice and only notice that I got up. I still refused because I don't believe in a priestly vocation and thus priestly blessings.

Day of she privately whispered to me before asking if I was going to ""embarrass her"". I told her once again I was not going up for communion, the end. As luck would have it I ended up sitting in a position in the pew where basically everyone else had to step over me, I stood up to let everyone else out and then sat down again remaining seated. My abstention was clearly visible and I think my mom gave me a glare after she stepped out.

1291,Not the A-hole,"16M. Recently had a birthday and received a decent amount of money. My mom is “keeping it for me” i.e. hiding it from me so I can’t spend it. This really gets on my nerves and I tried to stop it before she took all of it but she insisted and there was no winning that battle. Today I tried again. Not because I want to spend my money, but because I think I deserve to keep my own gift money. She gave me a card with an HS checking account on it, and she always has a fit when she checks my location and sees me at a place where I could be spending money. I literally can’t ride my bike to the grocery store (which is very close to my house) for non spending purposes without hearing her bitch about it. 

She told me explicitly that the card was for getting food if I’m with my friends or whatever. She wont let me use it online, and there’s not much else to spend my money on short of being able to drive to places and get a ticket to a movie or whatever.

I never agreed to her putting it towards “savings.” 1/2 my work money goes towards it, but it’s not in a bank, not for post-college; she just insists on saving the money for “bigger purchases”

“Bigger purchases” are another topic entirely. Basically if I ever want anything that’s on the internet or buy anything exceeding $15 I have to run it through her, and 99.999999999991% of the time she disapproves. I currently have $80 in that savings; $200 was recently spent on a used bike. 

Most of the time she says it’s not financially smart to spend money on the things I want to buy. It’s not even that I want to impulse buy everything that looks mildly cool, my spending habits are no different to hers when it comes to things I want to buy. Gag gifts are a good example. I’ve asked to buy 2 gag gifts for friends and she declined both. A week after the 1st declination she bought a stuffed vagina for my neighbor after she had surgery.",25,27,0.94
1292,No A-holes here,Today I learned my boss put her two weeks in. She came in and told us all as a group. It was no secret. My coworker who left for maternity leave a month ago hasn’t been in the loop obviously for a while so I thought I would update her. I tried to text her saying “[blank] put her two weeks in today 🙃🙃🙃”. Turns out I accidentally sent it to my boss. She texted back asking if that meant that I was happy about it and wanted to know what I meant exactly about it. I didn’t even think it was an offensive text so I just told her I didn’t mean to text her and that I just meant to update our coworker. I told her the emoji just meant that things are crazy and that it means “what’s gonna happen next” but apparently she took it the wrong way and called the main manager at our building in tears saying I was gossiping about her. It went so far as to my main manager coming up to me and telling me to stop gossiping. I told her exactly what happened and that I just meant that it’s crazy that she’s leaving. I’ve had over 13 bosses in the 3 years I’ve worked there and I just think it’s so crazy we can’t ever keep a manager. I apologized to her and told her I didn’t mean to offend her. I came back from my lunch and the whole building knew about it so other people are spreading to word. I wouldn’t care that much since she’s leaving but now all of management knows and they probably think I’m a crazy gossiper. All I want is for them to know I’m not so I can have a good reputation with them.  And I’m not all happy she’s leaving either. She’s been a pretty good boss. I do like her.

1304,Everyone Sucks," I'm not going to mention any details about what these hobbies are, because I don't really want to be identified; it's something fairly niche. Anyway:

For the past 3 years I've had a consistent art-related hobby that I've become really good at. My husband has dabbled in said hobby but never to the degree I have. About a two weeks ago, I told him that I wanted to expand my hobby into another, similar hobby. He instantly says he thinks that's a great idea. I begin investing in materials and tools. Then I consult a few people I know who have been doing this more-complex hobby for decades, and I sought out advice and tips from people I would consider experts. We have a group of about 8 friends who I'm planning on sharing this project with once it's finished. Husband is constantly is asking me about what my plan is, and offering unsolicited advice. He started watching these youtube videos about the hobby. I was appreciative at first, but started to get annoyed as time went on that someone who's never even touched the materials was lecturing me

Last Friday, I was telling him the details of what I was planning, and the entire time he rolled his eyes, shook his head, and mumbled, ""nope. That won't work. You should just do exactly what this guy on YouTube does"" and I lost it a little. It's a very heavily male-dominated hobby which probably added to my impulsive defensiveness. I told him that I felt like I was being man-splained to, and that I really didn't want his opinion. He became incredibly hurt, ""Fine. I guess I'll just nod and say, 'cool, babe.' because you don't value my opinion at all, and you're clearly an expert even though you're a beginner. "" We end up talking through it, later that evening, and decide that he's going to leave me alone about my project, but is free to do his own research into the hobby and if he contributes to materials, can use my specialty tools. 

Suddenly, without saying a word to me, my husband announces to the 8 friends I was intending to show my finished product to, in a group chat, that he started doing this new hobby (no mention of me) including pictures of his completed work he made using my tools and materials. (I was doing something complex, he chose to instead follow youtube step by steps for the fastest possible results, with no artistic creativity whatsoever. He literally followed a template while I was building and designing something from scratch. Granted, his still looks professional, but he didn't do anything original, or creative with it.) As soon as I saw that message, I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. I still feel resentful and betrayed. I explained to him that I felt like he was stealing my glory, and just swooped in and stole all the praise for my idea and my project . He insisted I was being petty, because I didn't invent this hobby and therefore anything I was doing wasn't an original idea, and it's my fault for not working faster. He told me I was being selfish.",301,476,0.87

1307,Not the A-hole,"Over the weekend I (23F) went to a theme park with some friends (two other girls my age). Since Summer is winding down, the park was really crowded. It was also crazy hot outside.

After getting off a ride, we decided to head to the bar for a drink. The bar had a very long outdoor line, in the sun. I'm estimating about 20 people in front of me and 15 people behind me. This is where things get interesting. There were two girls in front of me waiting, no big deal. However, a group of their friends walk over and cut into the line. Now, I usually don't care if it's one or two people, but this was legit eight extra people who joined the line.

I decided to confront them and let them know where the line starts and that they can't just cut in. However, the guys in their group started getting super defensive, towering over us and telling us they wouldn't move. Now, I'm only 5'1. I felt intimated and didn't really know what to say or do, so we ended up backing down.

At this point, I'm seething. I then overhear one of the girls saying she's so lucky she has her sister's ID. They get to the bar, order their drinks and are waiting to get them. When it's my turn, I whisper to the Cashier that that girl is using someone else's ID. The Cashier tells the Bartender who goes over to her and asks for another form of identification (i.e. a credit card with her name on it, etc.), which she doesn't have.

He tells her he can't serve her and she causes a huge scene. She keeps repeating that is her ID, that the Bartender is racist because she's Mexican, that this is discrimination, etc. Security ends up coming over and escorting her away. They might have even kicked her out of the park. I have no way of verifying this, but we didn't see her around the park later in the day, but we did run into a few from her group. Luckily they didn't say anything to us, so I don't think they knew it was me who snitched.

Now I know this is petty, but I felt happy with the outcome and even laughed about it with my friends. But I am going to be totally honest, I probably wouldn't have cared that she was using a fake ID had they not cut in front of us. My friend told me that I'm TA because of that. She said everyone cuts in lines and that it was a bad idea to start shit with a big group of people who could probably kick our asses. I tried explaining to her that they were jerks for cutting and intimidating us and that the girl deserved her punishment.

So, what do you think? Am I the asshole?",39,104,0.91

She complains about my opinions, my personality, when she doesn’t do well in something, when others do. And I’m tired of it.

Because of this she's really mad at me and it's causing a major rift in our friend group. AITA for not refunding her?",182,297,0.94

1312,Asshole,"Alright foremost I should say that I work temporarily in a university office where I do my work at a computer in the breakroom. 

So today I get to work after volunteering for my school, which is put on party by my office (so everyone working there knows I was volunteering). I had to do landscaping work so i was wearing leggings and a tank top that dipped down a bit so my sports bra was partly exposed. I didn't have time to go home to change before work so sweaty clothes it was. I was working for a solid hour and then my boss comes and quietly tells me that this other worker complained that my attire wasn't appropriate. I was then forced to put on a baggy tshirt from the cardboard box in the corner. I was completely humiliated especially since there was another student in the room at the time.

No one ever gave me a dress code to follow yet this is the second time this situation has occured. My friend who works there even told me that girls are allowed to wear tank tops (which again I didnt know there was even a dress code). There is only one person in the entire office who has an issue and no one else cares. I can't even be seen by students coming in and out because of the location where I work.

I felt so sexualized, embarrased, and uncomfortable after that point that I left work early and called my mom crying. I am also sleep deprived so that might explain some of the crying ngl.

I seriously love my boss and he has told me he doesn't agree with this person yet he has to follow their will??? My mom and her coworker told me to contact HR and file a complaint but am I overreacting/ AITA???

Edit 1: I do want to say that normally student workers just show up in tshirts and shorts so it is far from a business casual workplace. Also yall I wasn't that sweaty to the point where my clothes were dirty or smelled.

Edit 2: The first time it occured my boss actually complimented my outfit so I assumed that it was only the one person who complained that had issue... not a real dress code

Edit 3: I have decided that I should take some responsibility and dress more appropriately in the future. Thank you to everyone who gave suggestions on how to make arrangements for having proper clothing in the future. I will be asking for the official dress code tomorrow. Honestly I'm glad I learned this lesson before I get into the real world.",87,182,0.84
1313,Not the A-hole,"So it's my first year of college, and almost every class has a GroupMe for us to ask questions and talk together. 

One class, my Geography class is HUGE and the GroupMe has over 100 people in it.

Every week we take a chapter quiz to see what we know, and one of the girls in the group chat sent screenshots of the correct answers to the group chat, and I asked 'isnt this a quiz?' and a whole bunch of upperclassmen in the groupchat jumped on me, and said it's no big deal as long as no one tells. I don't want to get anyone in trouble really, but what if someone ELSE says something, and I could get in trouble by association? 

Everyone said 'its no big deal' and 'he said we could work together so this is fine' and I said 'if it's no big deal, it won't be a problem for me to send a confirmation email to make sure this is okay' and everyone got so pissed, calling me names and telling me to just leave the group chat if I was so offended (which I will be doing) but I sent the email anyway.

AITA for making such a big deal out of this? My education is more important to me than anything and I don't want to risk it. I don't think I deserved to be ridiculed and made fun of the way I did for just wanting to check to see if we were doing the right thing, but what do you guys think?
Should I have just let it go, or AITA for sending an email to the teacher (without saying any specific names either btw).",232,310,0.86
1314,No A-holes here,"I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.

I'm used to people asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day (it always, always does).

Anyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife... through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie about how I lost my fingers.

Within about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into their good books. 

Anyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.

Update: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes, always cream the butter.",3351,24011,0.91
1315,Not the A-hole,"So I get off work at like 2:15 , I'm on 53rd and Broadway in Manhattan and have to get to Grand Central on 42nd and Lex by 2:45. Totally doable and I could have walked and made it in time but I was tired and I can expense my cabs so I decided Id take a quick cab. So I get in and tell the guy ""Grand Central Please"". He says ok and off we go, while in the cab I get a call from work and I'm going through emails and stuff talking to my coworker when the guy says ""ok were here"". This guy brought me to Penn Station which is on 34th and 7th. I tell him no we arent and ask him why he is so far from grand central he says I told him Penn Station which I never in a million years would have said, ive never been through Penn and I would never even say the phrase Penn Station, I know for a fact I said Grand Central. So now I'm argueing with the guy telling him my train is in 10 min and if ge doesnt get me there in time I have to wait 1 hour for the next train and I will be late to get my son from daycare (all true). So he huffs and makes his way to where I want to go, mind you the meter has not stopped and a $10 ride turned into $25. I told the guy if I miss my train im cancelling the trip and getting out wherever he is and walking the rest of the way. Surprise surprise I miss my train, so I cancel the ride in my app and leave. I gear him honking at me but I ignore him and keep walking. Now I kinda feel bad but also I think he did that on purpose to make more money. Am I the asshole here?

So 53 and Broadway to 42 and lex is 11 blocks and 5 avenues. He took me 12 blocks and 2 avenues further than I wanted basically doubling the time.

1316,No A-holes here,"By way of context, I'm going backpacking for a few months and I thought it'd be nice to visit and stay with my parents for 2 weeks before I go. 

I told my parents way ahead of time that I'd be visiting and staying with them, and they were more than happy to accommodate me. They have a 3 bedroom house that has a spare single bedroom. I have 4 siblings, and one of my brothers lives with my parents. 

Since then, I've bought train tickets and made other plans around me staying with my parents.

Fast forward to yesterday, my sister told me that she's moved back with my parents to save up for her post-grad tuition fees. I message my parents about my living arrangements, and my mum suggested that me and my sister sleep in the same double bed.

7 people in a 3-bedroom house, obviously there were a few bunk beds and bed-sharing growing up. However, now that we're adults, my parents think that this is still fine; my dad messaged me saying ""too bad, it's either that or camp out in the garden"".

I said that we're too old to be sharing beds now and suggest they move their home gym out of the conservatory to make space for an air bed, as there's nowhere else in the house that would have enough space. I also said that I may otherwise either get an AirBnB or cut my stay short with them.

My parents have since ignored my messages. My mum's posted Facebook stories today so they're definitely ignoring me.

I don't mind paying for an Airbnb, but it's the fact that they don't consider my feelings or make any effort to make something work. Plus I have to save money for backpacking. So I'm leaning towards cancelling my visit.

I already have a strained relationship with my parents, so I feel like if I don't go, they'll resent me even more. Maybe I should just suck it up, but I anticipate it'll be less enjoyable and/or more expensive than I originally planned

1318,No A-holes here,"I'll try and keep this concise. I have a good friend whom I met in college in the deep South, where I grew up. She has remained in the South and I have moved away. 

About me: I'm a gay man living very happily with my fiance. Growing up in the deep South was tough at times. My college experience was mostly fine, but being in Mississippi, there were often instances of awkwardness or outright disdain from others regarding my sexual orientation. I was always ""out and proud"" in college and I'm happy for it. 

About my friend: she's deeply religious southern Baptist. Most of her social circle is as well, aside from our mutual friends from college. This is an important part of her identity that she holds onto. Despite her religion, she and I have a great relationship and she loves and accepts me yadda yadda. The problem is that she's more the exception within her faith. 

The issue: the wedding is in Mississippi. It's going to be southern Baptist. It'll have a ton of southern Baptists there, including both the ""good"" and ""bad"" (I also don't know the groom at all. Never met him). 

The thing is that I want to go to support her. I want to see her and my friends. I don't have a problem with that kind of environment because I'm used to it. But I'm also the confrontational type that will absolutely will call out someone I don't know who is rude to me, and that has a very real possibility of happening. I don't want to make my friend have to deal with that at her wedding, but I also won't stand for passive aggressive comments about my sexuality from strangers, even at my friend's wedding. Maybe that alone makes me the asshole...

The other concern is my fiance. I don't want to go to this wedding without him because I love him and want to share that experience with him. But he's also never really had to face the kind of discrimination/comments/stigma that I grew used to growing up. I don't want him to have to go to a wedding and have a really terrible time because of the looks/comments that we might get. Regardless of my willingness to snap back, it can still ruin an otherwise nice evening. 

So despite the fact that I really want to go to this wedding for my friend, I really don't want to put my fiance in an (almost inevitable) situation where he's uncomfortable and I don't want to put my friend in a situation where she has to deal with homophobic shit from her other guests on her wedding day.

1320,Not the A-hole,"I was at a train station a couple days ago and it was super hot, the sun was very strong and there was no shelter or indoor waiting area. The only shade was in the shadow of an overpass that linked the two platforms and coincidentally there was a bench in that shade patch. It's only big enough for two people as it's one of those benches which is made up of two separate seats with arm rests. The other seat was taken by an elderly lady.

After 5 mins or so, this girl comes over and asks if she can have my seat. I'm pretty reluctant because my feet hurt from swelling up in the heat, so I ask if she could sit on a free bench a way down the platform which is in the sun. She's probs 5ft tall and has like 3 huge luggage bags so I get why she wants to sit down but I'm not super keen on leaving my shady spot. She seems a bit put out and explains that she has to be in the shade for medical reasons. This seems shady (no pun intended... OK slightly intended) to me so I ask why. She gets a bit defensive and says she'd rather not say, so it seems to me like she just wants the best seat, which I've already got and don't super want to give up. 

I tell her that she's welcome to stand next to me in the shade and she says she has to sit down because of the bags and her medical reason. I'm pretty sure she's playing me now so I ask her again what the reason is. She gets a bit irritated at being asked but when I won't move she eventually tells me she's on some drug called Isotretinoin (yes I googled the spelling) and it makes her skin ridiculously sensitive to the sun and gives her horrible joint pain so she can't stand for long. 

I pointed out then that she doesn't have a hat so she's not taking the precautions she should in the sun in that case, and I don't see why I should sit in the sun because she forgot a hat when her skin is super sensitive to the sun. She admits she left it behind and that's why she needs to be in the shade. I tell her that it's not my problem and she can sit on the floor in the shade if she has to. the train is due in 5 so she'll cope. She's pretty upset by this point (angry not sad) but she sits on the floor until the train comes.

1324,Asshole,"Throwaway because my friends and family know my main account.

I know that I already sound like TA from the title, but please hear me out.

About a month ago, my sister had an outdoor wedding at a gorgeous hotel overlooking the coast. The ceremony and reception themselves were in the lawn/garden that the hotel rented out specifically for such events, but my fiancee and I also had booked a room in the hotel for the night, which itself was set a short distance apart from there.

My now fiancée (25F) and I (25M) are both very uncomfortable with large crowds, so some time into the wedding, I let my sister know that we were retreating to the hotel for a short breather. We had discovered a small terrace in the hotel the previous day that had an amazing view of the sunset, and we wanted to go there to have 10 mins to ourselves.

We are both huge romantics (seriously, we will make you retch) and LOVE the ocean and the sunset. For our first date, I borrowed the keys of my friend's apartment building's rooftop and set up an picnic and a playlist with a sunset view. Literally every anniversary of ours has involved a private place to watch the sun set over the ocean.

The view from the terrace was absolutely spectacular and the moment was so perfect that I couldn't help myself. It was completely spontaneous. I didn't even have a ring. I just got on one knee and asked her then and there to marry me AND SHE SAID YES!!

No one saw us. The terrace was empty and the garden in which the reception was held wasn't in our field of view. We were both buzzing with excitement but we both agreed to hold off telling anyone else because this was my sister's special day.

Last night, we had dinner with my family, and my fiancée and I broke the news to my family that we were engaged. Everyone was obviously delighted and asked us to narrate the story of how I or she proposed.

My sister was FURIOUS to find out I had proposed during her wedding. She pulled me aside after dinner and completely blew up at me. She accused me of trying to steal the attention from her wedding and I told her that we had intentionally kept the news to ourselves till now to avoid doing exactly that. She said it didn't matter because now everyone would remember her wedding as the day I proposed anyway.

I honestly disagree because no one really witnessed my proposal, so it wouldn't really be part of their wedding memories. We didn't tell anyone we got engaged till now and I don't really feel that anyone will associate her wedding with our engagement at this point because by now it's been long enough that they should feel like two separate events. My sister doesn't see it my way and has refused to speak to me since last night. AITA?

TLDR: Privately proposed to my fiancée during my sister's wedding and kept the news to ourselves. Revealed our engagement a month later to immediate family. Sister now furious with me.

Edit: Because people seem to be misunderstanding, I am repeating here. I did NOT reveal our engagement to anyone until last night which was a MONTH after the wedding, at a private dinner with my parents, sister, BIL and fiancée.

Update: I did not realize that my sister might be upset because she lost *my* attention on her wedding day, even if she didn't lose anyone else's. That day was supposed to be about her and I understand how she might feel abandoned in a way. First thing tomorrow, I will be calling her to apologize.

My fiancée and I also discussed it, and we agreed that we don't really want to share our proposal story with anyone else anyway. We are both very private people, and it feels like a very private moment to both of us. The only other people we will be telling will be her parents and sister. We are happy keeping the knowledge of what happened between our families, and hopefully this makes my sister feel happier about this too.

As for those people judging me for not having a ring or a plan, well.... The only person's approval I really care about is my fiancée's, and she told me she was delighted that I finally did something spontaneous because I'm usually too meticulous and cautious. So..... I guess, mind your own business?

Update 2: Oh my god, things are happening fast. I was talking to my fiancée about how neither of us realized that this was such a big deal to so many people, no matter how private we kept it. It's completely crazy to us, I guess mostly because neither of us has really cared for any sort of attention from other people whatsoever.

The conversation turned and the more we talked, the more we realized that neither of us want a big wedding with all the planning and the headache and the *guests*. Like fuck, we'd be running away from our own wedding. So we decided to save all the money we would have spent on our wedding for our honeymoon and just go to the courthouse and get married NEXT MONTH!!!!!

I'm so exhilarated right now I can't even be sure this is real. The only reason we decided to wait till next month is because we want to wait till we can take time off work and have our honeymoon right after we get married. We can have a small dinner right before we leave with both our immediate families but HOLY FUCK I'M GETTING MARRIED NEXT MONTH

Update 3: Since it's apparently unclear to most people, the ""mind your own business"" is for those telling me I suck for not getting a ring. It's not what I asked and it's so subjective that pretty much the only person who's opinion matters is hers. I would have thought this was obvious......

On a brighter note, THANK YOU FOR ALL THE CONGRATULATIONS!!! I don't think I've ever been this exhilarated in my life. We're both going to try to sleep now since we both have work tomorrow, and once we've spoken to my sister, were going to PLAN OUR HONEYMOON OMGG

Update 4: This is the last one, I promise. We just finished speaking to my sister and BIL. My sister dodged the first two calls, but persistence paid off. I apologized to her and told her I understood why she felt like she hadn't been a priority on her wedding day, and it was never my intention to make her feel that way. She apologized immediately after for blowing up, and said that I did nothing wrong and she shouldn't have taken out her hurt feelings on me. I think she's feeling a bit guilty now, and I felt a fair but guilty too, but overall we've patched up pretty well, and both my sister and BIL are very supportive of us getting married in a courthouse next month (we're going to need their help when we pitch this to my mom, lmao). We both got to scram to work now, and this day is going to fucking *crawl* until we're back and getting started on our honeymoon plans!!!

We both just want to say thanks sooooo much to every congratulatory and well wishing comment. I wish we could respond to each and every one of them, but we'll settle for leaving it up here. Thanks for the well wishes, we think you're all amazing and we're really really touched!! We solemnly swear we shall always be up to no good in the future (yes we both love HP) :)",1062,3261,0.89

1326,No A-holes here,"I'm getting married later this year, on a Saturday. My fiancee is upset that I'm hesitant about taking the Monday off immediately following the wedding. Our venue is about 2 hours away (driving) from our home, so traveling isn't an issue. I don't want to take the day off because I get paid hourly, and I don't get paid vacation days. Also, my job is client-oriented and dependent on their schedules, so I can't just make up those hours by working more the next few days.

We're going on a honeymoon a month after the wedding, which I'm already taking 5 days off for. Those 5 days off equates to roughly half the cost of the honeymoon itself, effectively making it cost 1.5 times the price (forgive me if my logic is off on this, that's just how it comes off in my head).

1329,Asshole,"Wife and I have two kids, an 8 year old girl and an 11 year old boy. My wife became a stay at home mom for a while after each of them was born but now she works a full time job like me. 

The thing that bothers me is that the kids pay 0 attention to me unless my wife tells them to or I'm lecturing them. If they need anything they'll always ask my wife. Help with homework, trouble at school, wanting something new, wanting to go out... They always ask my wife. 

Which ends up making me the bad one because most of the interactions that I have with them is when they do something wrong or if they start acting up. That isn't to say that my wife leaves the task to me, she does the same as well but she also gives them good moments which negates that, while I mostly get the bad ones.

I work a lot and I travel quite a few times and my wife has said that the kids probably didn't bond with me enough because of it. Which is not something that I could have avoided because my career is very important to me as well as my family. 

We tried a lot of things, currently my wife and I have a system where we take turns with their tasks so that we both get to spend the same time with them equally. But we noticed that unless the task was something they HAD to do, they would just avoid it when it was my turn to do it.  

That was when my wife suggested family therapy, she found a good therapist with good recommendations and such. The thing is, I don't want my time with my kids to be inside of a therapist's office and the thought that for my kids to like me I need to get professional help while they like my wife just fine is hurtful.

My wife said that I was being immature for not accepting this and said I needed to accept that our methods had failed. When I suggested that maybe we were being too soft with the kids she ended up getting extremely angry at me and now she only speaks to me in front of the kids.

1330,Everyone Sucks,"When my (now) ex-fiance and I got together, from the first time children were brought up, I told my ex if I ever had a son, he needed to be named after my dad. I told him it was incredibly important to me, and that it was a requirement. He disliked my dad's name but he agreed.

Then I got pregnant, and due to unrelated distress, our relationship ended. We are still civil and friendly, and planning on co-parenting as healthy as possible.

My ex was not happy at all it is a boy, as he wanted a girl, and he said ""That's lame, boys are gross and he's going to have a name I don't even like"". A couple weeks later, he referenced the name again and said ""How is little [name]? I was thinking of [another name] for a middle name."" Him saying that meant the WORLD to me, because I knew he didn't like my dad's name, and I thought that was his way of sort of solidifying that that would be his name. I was ECSTATIC. 

Due to this, and the multitudes of times I had brought up that a boy would be named after my dad, I assumed it was a decided thing. So, I told my dad he would be named after him. My dad was absolutely over the moon, and I got emotional, and he got emotional. When I called my son by his name later that day (""When little [name] gets here...""), he got genuinely giddy.

Things are bad right now, but that was something really happy-making for me. My dad is my hero and the most important person in my life, and my favorite person in the world. I don't know if that is dumb, or childish, or what... but it is and always has been important to me. I can't explain how emotionally attached I am to this stupid name, haha. I guess it's just years in the making.

However, my ex is now asking that I make my dad's name our son's middle name, and his chosen name would be the first name. I have a stomach ache over stress about this, and asked him to give me some time to think. It's been a couple weeks and I have made no progress... I know that it is his child too, and in NO WAY do I wish to disregard or belittle his say in this, but this has been known and (albeit sometimes reluctantly) agreed on for years now, and I already told my dad.

My ex's reasons for disliking the name: It's out-dated and old, and my dad is still alive and he thinks it's weird to be named after a living relative. (I don't know if that's weird or not?)

But I may just be too emotionally invested to see that I would be a total asshole here if I told him his name would still be my dad's. Maybe I would be a huge dick... I just really need some perspective. Also sorry I rambled so long.

**TL;DR:** Told ex when we first got serious that if we *ever* had a son he would have to be named after my dad. He agreed, but disliked the name.

1331,Asshole,"**TL:DR** My wife called wanting to spend $400 on a purse, and I and my mom told her it was too much.


My wife called me yesterday and told me she found a purse she really liked. Okay, cool. 

It’s made with top grain leather, and guaranteed for life. Great. 

It’s $400. Hold up.


Some background. My wife is a stay at home mom for our 3 kids, and I have a 4/10 job, which means I work 4 days a week. We aren’t rich by any stretch of the imagination, but we get by. I supplement our income with various side hustles, including working on my days off.

None of this bothers me, or her. And it works for us. The point of it all is that $400 is more than both if our car payments put together. It’s more than all of our monthly insurance costs. It’s about what we pay for utilities every month. So, in monthly budget terms, $400 is a chunk for us.

I said as much on the phone, but I also said that this is how I felt about ""our"" money. Money that I earned for the family, for groceries and diapers and spending money. I told her that if she earned it somehow, or got birthday money, I wasn’t gonna tell her how to spend it, since it was hers.

Now, remember how I said I work on my days off? My dad is a contractor, and on some of those days off I work for him, doing office stuff. Measuring and typing up estimates, ordering materials, that kind of thing. His is a home-office, so while I was having this conversation with my wife, my mom was at her desk, overhearing.
My mom wanted to say something, so I asked my wife if she wanted to go on speaker to talk to my mom. She agreed, and my mom told her that even she felt that $400 was too much for a purse. My wife then asked my mom how much she spent on pedicures, and yoga, and getting her hair done, and my mom told her that our situations are different. I honestly agree. My parents have our-accountant-told-us-to-buy-new-cars-for-tax-purposes money, which they wrote checks for, by the way. Totally different financially.

My wife got quiet, and I could tell she was upset. I took her off speakerphone, and she told me she wanted this purse. I told her I didn’t think spending that much was reasonable, for the same reason I don’t have $4k guitar. One I can pay less for will still do the job. I told her again that if she had her own money, I’m not gonna tell her what to do with it, but the money we have is pretty much spoken for.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized I probably could have handled it better. My tone was incredulous, and I had been caught off guard by the phone call. I called her later that day, to try and talk, and she said she didn’t want to talk about it. I asked her if she was mad, and she said she wasn’t happy.

All last night, she only responded to my questions with one-word answers, and never initiated any conversation. This isn’t normal. We’re constantly talking and joking with each other. She’s mad. But, am I the asshole? Or is she over-reacting? I could really use some objective third-party thoughts here.

**Edit:1 INFO**

I commented to some folks individually, but yes, we do have discretionary spending. It’s not a set amount in the budget, but If either of us wants to make a personal purchase over $50, we call the other to discuss if it’s a good idea or not. That’s what the phone call was about.

**Edit 2 Mom and ""My Money""**

For the mom thing, I could have handled that part better, but I didn’t ""Go running to mommy."" I asked my wife if she wanted to hear what my mom had to say, and my wife said okay. My mom apologized after the call to me for getting involved, and has probably already called my wife to apologize, they have a good relationship.

I don’t look at the money that comes in as ""mine"" it goes into a joint checking account we both access and use to buy groceries, gas and pay bills. That’s what my salary is for. My wife has her own side hustles, and she decides what to do with that money, since she earned it by working in addition to all of the stuff she does as a mom. My issue with the purse is that she wanted to pay for it with the joint(bills) account, and our budget allows for little splurges, but not $400 ones.



**Update**

I called her a little bit ago, and asked if she was cool to talk about everything. She was. 

I apologized for letting my mom on the phone, and if I had made her feel condescended to, or ganged up on. I also did my best to explain that while I wasn’t against the purchase, I didn’t think our budget was built for the way she wanted to do it. 

Turns out she didn’t care about my mom being in the convo, so there’s that. She was upset that she felt I had said no, and shut her down. I didn’t do a good job explaining my reasoning yesterday. I was in the middle of something pretty complex, and had been caught off guard. 

I told her I was happy to try and work something out, either taking it out of the budget over time, or calling it an early Christmas present if we went halfsies on it. 

She said she was mad yesterday, and she had just needed time to stew. And in the meantime, she found the same purse on Facebook marketplace for $100. I can do $100",608,1705,0.94

1336,Not the A-hole,"Back in 2011, I got married. Everything went great (except for the weather). All the vendors we used showed up and delivered what they were supposed to. The flowers were there, the food was great, the band played an amazing night, and the photographers/videographers were all there to catch it all. We paid upfront for everything, and it didn’t seem like an issue.

Fast forward to after our honeymoon and our photographer is avoiding us. He won’t return calls, won’t answer emails, and won’t answer the door when I show up in person. This went on for YEARS. Finally, after 5 years, I took him to court. The judge (actually, it was small claims court, and it was an arbitrator, not a judge) sided with me in record time. The guy tried to say his business no longer exists, but luckily all the checks I wrote to him were in his name, not the company’s name.

I finally get the photo album, and video (they were not to our ‘order’ but it was better than nothing). This was after the court said he had 45 days to deliver, otherwise he’d have to pay us back the whole amount plus 5+ years of interest.

The package with everything in it had the name of a photo studio. I started leaving reviews for that studio. I was very clear in all the reviews that it was only about a specific employee, and told my story. I said any studio that employs someone like this guy should not be trusted.

Of course, after doing that, I started getting threatening emails and phone calls. The studio is asking me to take down those reviews, because they don’t know who this guy is. They have never heard of him, blah blah blah (Obviously, it’s not true. How else would they have my contact information? How else would they know who wrote the reviews?)

I’ve since had my Yelp account revoked, because the claimed I slandered them or something, and all my other reviews on other forums have been removed.

EDIT: This is probably a major piece of information.  When I first suspected the guy was ditching me, we were able to find a trail of businesses he started.  It seemed he would start a business, take money for about a year, and close down.  He would start it up again a few months later, with a new name.  All the reviews for each of these businesses over the years all named the same guy as the owner.  To get the guy to report to court, we had to hire a Private Investigator to serve him.  They found him in a very upscale neighborhood with multiple luxury cars.  Posting a review of my story on the now-defunct business that I actually used, lead to over 10 people asking me how to find the guy, since he did the same thing to them.  So, it was my assumption, that he was doing it again under the name of the new business.  (also, he obviously worked there.  As I said, as soon as I posted a negative review, naming him specifically, is when I started getting harassing phone calls and emails.  And there is no way they could have gotten my contact information if he wasn't involved to give it to them).

&#x200B;

EDIT 2 (based on a convo with someone below):   In regards to the new studio.  I had tried to call to talk to someone there, but they wouldn't respond. The only time they even acknowledged I existed was when after I posted. It was also located in the same town/area as his previous companies, and I tried to go there to see in person, but nobody answered the door. It seemed very much like his previous M.O. based on other reviews of his businesses. Also, the box didn't just say 'Studio XYZ' it sayd 'Guy's Name, at Studio XYZ'.",55,284,0.91

1338,No A-holes here,"By hobby shop I mean somewhere you can buy board games, Magic the Gathering, Warhammer, etc. I also do Magic tournaments and my turnout is around 50 for these.

I own the building the hobby shop is in. It's on the second floor and you need to go through what currently is a storage floor to get there. Basically you go inside the storage area, to the back, then up the stairs, and you're in my shop. I own both floors.

My friend works in the e-cig industry and asked if I'd lease him my bottom floor. This means you'd need to walk through a vape shop to get into the hobby shop. But this poses an issue since vape shops are strictly 18+ and minors will be turned away at the door. Basically my hobby shop becomes 18+ because the area you need to walk through to get in will be 18+.

My customers are by and large older men in their 30s and 40s. Like 99%. I can't remember the last time I've had a minor customer but sometimes people who come to my tournaments bring their children and some of those patrons themselves are teens.

Would I be the asshole for this arrangement? I don't need to do it, but it's a friend and it would maybe strike up new business for me, anyways. Maybe some of his customers get involved in my store and vice versa. It would eliminate patrons who are teens or parents with kids, though.",187,670,0.96

1340,Not the A-hole,"In the company where I work, it's tradition to bring a cake or sodas and sweets or whatever after you got married or had a baby. However, most of my coworkers are homophobic POS and I'm a gay guy so I wanted to avoid any unpleasantness by simply not bringing cake at all or mentioning I got married to anyone.

When I got married a few weeks ago, I had to notify HR (something about tax). As I was writing the email to her, one of my coworkers was standing behind my back and saw what I was writing. He, as well as the other 2 guys in our office, congratulated me and didn't mention it again. However, not even 2 hours later, when most of us were having lunch in the break room, I got a whole posse of hungry people (10ish of them) confronting me about the absence of cake.

Now I do want to emphasize that I heavily dislike all of them for the homophobic shit they've said in the past. Ranging from comparisons to disgusting stuff involving children and animals I'm not sure I can even write here without having my post automatically removed, to the less disgusting idea that gay marriage is somehow ruining straight marriage. I have 4 friends at work, all of who know my husband, and all of who were told about my marriage and invited to celebrate at my home over drinks and bbq. The rest of them (17) I either don't care for or can't stand.

So, having said that, when they started going on about how I'm breaking the tradition of bringing in cake and even going so far as to keep it a secret, I said: I'm sorry, I just didn't think you'd want to eat gay cake.

They looked confused and started saying huh and what and eh?, until one of them asked: What's a gay cake?

I said: I got married to a man. Considering your colorful opinions of gay people, I didn't think you would like to eat cake celebrating the marriage of two gay men.

The responses were very different, from ""Oh god"", to ""I knew it"", to my favorite ""Wow, you couldn't have just lied?"". The next day, I got an invitation from HR that somebody reported me for creating a hostile environment, but didn't say what for, so when I went to see the HR person, I told her the truth. She agreed that their report was unnecessary and that she would talk to the guys that reported me, but she also said that it ***is*** sort of bad form to not bring cake, since it ***is*** tradition in the office, and not being the bigger man is making me look bad. Essentially, it's making me look like an asshole. She didn't say that word, but it sure sounded like she thinks it.

So now I'm confused here... AITA for not feeding my hateful coworkers cake?

**Edit: Guys, if you want to know whether I ate their cakes - I didn't. If you want more details, just find the most downvoted comment and my response to it.**

**Edit 2: People... please... don't be so upset about the cake thing. I'm not in the US, and literally my entire country (and possibly other countries around us) do the thing where the person celebrating brings the cake. We're only given cake when we're kids or very young, or if it's a surprise. But if we're the ones organizing the celebration, we provide the cake and drinks and whatever. Don't be mad, guys. :)**",326,1031,0.95

1342,No A-holes here,"I’ve been in a relationship with my girlfriend for a little over a year and a half. We don’t live together currently because we live/work in an area with really high rent/housing prices and can’t afford a bigger apartment/house. I have a small apartment to myself (an in-law unit behind a bigger house) and she still lives with her family about 30-40 minutes away (depending on traffic). I enjoy the time that we spend together, but I am an introvert and need my alone time to “recharge” and take care of myself. I am also working on a PhD, so I’ll often need some time alone to catch up on work for the night or just decompress from a stressful day. Recently, my girlfriend accepted a job located less than 5 minutes away from my apartment. While she mentioned she was applying for the job, we didn’t really discuss it much (in terms of time spent together, etc.) before she interviewed and accepted the position. 

Now, she’s insistent on staying at my apartment Monday through Friday so that she’d be closer to work and wouldn’t have to commute back and forth. I was initially supportive of her applying to the job because she was eager to find a teaching position in the area (which is tough to come by), but I did not explicitly tell her that she could essentially live out of my apartment while she was working close by.

I told her that she could stay here a few nights a week, but that I need nights to myself to pursue some of my own interests or spend time with other friends. She seemed visibly frustrated by this, but it seems unfair to be cater my entire weekday schedule to her work week. It also seems unfair to my landlords since they did not sign on to having two people living in their in-law unit. She suggested that she could stay over Monday through Friday and that I could have my alone time on the weekends, but that hardly seems like a solution to me. I understand her not wanting to make the long commute every morning, but this is my apartment (that I pay rent for) and I can’t help but feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

TL;DR – My girlfriend wants to stay at my apartment M-F for the convenience and proximity to work. AITA for telling her that she can’t because I need my alone time?",45,52,0.89

But I didnt immediately move forward. The guy behind me honks at me, gestures and mouths the word ""pay attention"". I slowly creep up to fill the gap between cars. It's not like this made any sort of difference now we are here instead of there. He is still trapped behind me in standstill traffic. 
Maybe 30 seconds later this happens again where a gap opens up and I dont stick to the car in front of me. This time he honks and pulls out his phone and takes a picture of my licences plate. He is clearly very upset.

To his point, I imagine hes in a hurry to get somewhere and traffic is really frustrating. Perhaps hes worried someone in an adjacent lane will fill the gap I'm leaving which would make our lane go slower. Is there something that I'm doing that is bad? Why is this taboo? 01

1345,Not the A-hole,"I have a puppy, who is about 6 months old. She lives with me and I live alone, I also don’t have any really young family members/friends with babies so my puppy has not really had any experience around babies. She loves kids but tends to jump up on them (she is a small breed) but I usually discourage kids from trying to pet her only because I know her little nails will scratch them. Otherwise, she loves people and is the friendliest girl. 

Recently I was at the dog park to help get her energy out, and we were in the designated Under 25 lbs area. This area is a bit hit or miss because sometimes the dogs in there are old and do nothing but sit in the grass, but the dogs in the regular area were quite big and rowdy that day, so I brought her in to throw her tennis ball and just let her run around. 

Enter young mom with 5-6 month old infant in a stroller and her Jack Russell. Cute, I thought. I love dogs and kids, and even said hi to her when she came in. Until she sets a blanket on the ground, takes her kid out of the stroller and lays him on it. Of course none of the other old dogs were bothered, but my pup instantly ran up and was sniffing the baby, trying to lick him, and overall was just being curious. HOWEVER, remember those nails and how they can scratch if she happened to step on an arm or hand or get to close to the face. 

I was sitting on a chair across the field so immediately got up, grabbed her, tried to redirect her, and apologized. But she went right back to explore the little human. After many times of redirecting, and asking her to “leave it” (which she is still learning), the mom started to get aggressive with my dog, pushing her away, yelling at her, etc. BUT NOT ONCE did she move her baby, pick him up, or put him back in the stroller. I tried everything I could do before I just picked her up and held her. 

I considered leaving but....it’s an off leash DOG park. The park is for dogs to enjoy and exercise in, not for someone to set up a blanket with their baby. She suggested maybe my “rowdy” dog should move to the big area, and I said she would be fine if baby was back in the stroller. Of course that was not okay, and she said the dog park was for everyone to enjoy, and I just needed to control my dog. 

AITA for thinking she should have just picked up her baby and put him in his stroller? It’s been bothering me :(",862,4863,0.96

1348,Not the A-hole,"So years ago I had this friend, I wouldn't say we were close friends, we never really talked through social media, just at gatherings, parties etc but we got on really well when we did.

Now this friend, she's quite a 'big' person and loves taking photos of herself for her Instagram. At the time she started to Photoshop her pics to make herself look thinner and it was so obvious that people were making fun of her behind her back. This had gone on for awhile and more and more people were talking about it and I felt so bad for her - no one was telling her and she seemed oblivious too it so I decided to do something about it.

Okay so, I decided to privately message her to bring it to her attention and I tried to word it as nicely as possible.

I don't have the original message but what I basically said was that I've noticed she's been photoshopping her photos and that it is quite obvious and I just wanted to let her know in case people start making fun of her behind her back. I also mentioned how she's a beautiful person and doesn't even need to Photoshop herself to make her look better and I mentioned that I understand it helps her feel better but that she should try to find something else for her as this is only going to make her feel worse eventually. Again, I was trying to be as nice as possible about it and just inform her of the mistakes and reminding her she doesn't need it. I told her as well that I was only looking out for her because I didn't want anyone to make fun of her for it since she doesn't deserve that.

This was a long paragraph, so I sent it and awaited a response - it wasn't long until she responded but it was definitely not what I was expecting.

Her response was so hostile, she told me that I ruined her holiday (I had no idea she was on holiday until she mentioned it) and that she broke down crying in front of her entire family and that her mum is shocked and disappointed in my behaviour. She also said I was a disgusting, horrible, cruel person for even messaging her that and that she thought we were friends and no longer wants to speak to me.

I replied apologising that she took it the wrong way but I tried to tell her that it wasn't my intent to make her feel horrible, I was only looking out for her but she didn't see it that way at all.

She blocked me on all social media and started telling people how horrible I am.

I showed me best friend and boyfriend the message I sent her and asked them if they believed I was horrible in it and they both said I wasn't, but it still bothers me now in case I was in the wrong.

1349,Not the A-hole,"Pretty much the title, I (19f) just moved out and told my mom some not so nice things. 

For a long time my mom was very depressed and thus a bit, absent. She was home quite often but didn't have the mental capacity to deal with anything besides her own problems, so I always had to deal with those myself. I could deal with that. 

The real problem was my brother. He had some real behavioural issues as well as some anger issues and often took it out on me. No matter what I did he wouldn't stop, and our mom didn't do anything to stop it. 

Some examples of things he did: steal money from my wallet, hide my keys/passport/schoolbooks, destroy or hide my belongings, mess with my room (pour soda on the bed, paint on the walls), listen to very loud music all night, cut big chunks out of my hair while I slept, etc. 

I was constantly stressed, I got a job working weekends when I was 15 just so i could afford a lock on my door to protect my belongings. He acted like this for years. 

I started college this year and moved out asap. My mom, who's been doing a bit better mentally, got very sad and asked me to promise to come over often and call every day. 

I told her that's not happening, that she pretended I didn't exist for years and that I don't want her to start now. I called her neglectful and selfish and left. 

That was two days ago, and since then my phone is blowing up with crying voicemails, angry or very depressed texts, plus texts from several family members calling me entitled and rude. 

I do feel bad, it was my brother causing all those problems, not her. But she's also our mom and I feel like she should have stepped in. But she was dealing with some serious mental shit. So AITA? 

Sidenote: my brother is two years older than me if that matters. The problems started when I was 13 and because less when I was 17, but they never quite disappeared.

Edit: I can't change the title, but I did tell her why. Sorry, brain fart. The family doesn't know why though, my mom hasn't told them.

Edit 2: I talked to my grandparents and one of my aunts and uncles about this situation. My grandparents where very dismissive pretty much told me to get over it, be an adult, and don't take it out on mom. My aunt and uncle where very shocked, they had no idea. They've been very sympathetic and are helping me look into options for therapy. 

Some people said I'm punishing my mom for being depressed, or that I resent her. I don't know if I do. I just want some space and maybe try to talk it out later. For now I'm too busy to worry much about it.",185,976,0.94
1350,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: GF and I paid for $500 flights and $800 hotel, she broke up with me, I still want to enjoy my vacations and she does not, so she is asking me to give her half of the money from my pockets if I want to go.

&#x200B;

So me and my ex-GF had vacations paid for during september 3rd and september 10th.

2 weeks ago she broke up with me because she does not feel the same way about me as she used to. During the break up conversation I asked about the paid vacations we had, and she said we could try to cancel the flights and hotel and get reimbursed, and if we couldn't do that she said she would give me the money I was going to lose.

&#x200B;

So fast forward to yesterday I contact both the hotel and flight agency, and the hotel can be fully reimbursed, $800 total, but the flights, $500, can't be refunded. I told her that I still wanted to go to the holidays since I paid my half and she could choose to go or not to go, her choice. She told me I now have to give her $400 half from the hotel since it can be reimbursed but doing that I am unable to go to the holidays and I will lose the money from my flights.

AITA for still going alone? And what would be the best thing to do here? I just don't think I must lose money now because she broke up with me and does not want to go now.

EDIT: More info. When we broke up she said she would give me any money I would lose. But now she is demanding me $400 from the hotel since she is not going. I told her that I can stay at home and not go but that she should give me $250 from the flights that she said she would when she broke up with me.So my options are:

1. Going alone and not pay her anything, I already paid for my half of the vacations and I will enjoy half of everything, I am not bringing anyone with me.
2. Reimburse the hotel and give her the $400, but now I am losing the $250 from the flights.

There is no option for me to just go to the vacations I paid for

EDIT 2: More info. I tried checking out AirBnB in the area and also some cheaper hotels. Most stuff is already fully booked, our hotel is fully booked too. If I refund the I would not find anything for near these $400 so I could stay alone

I just think that I paid my half and she paid her half, I still want to go and enjoy my half of the vacations. She decided it was best for her to broke up and understandably does not want to go with me. But she paid her half and her flight will still have a seat for her and the hotel will still have breakfast, lunch and dinner for her, she just doesn't want to go.

1358,Not the A-hole,"I had horses my entire childhood and teen years. When I graduated high school, my parents split and neither were able to help me pay for the board of my horses, and being a college student on a server's income I couldn't either, so I sold my horses.

My brother in law has been dating his girlfriend for 2 years, but we were only made aware of her about 8 months ago. She seemed really nice at first, but she's actually a control freak who is extremely insecure and jealous. She will not let my BIL talk on the phone unless its on speaker, 99% of the time she is texting for him, and is very easy to get upset if things don't go her way.

So a few months ago, my future SIL mentioned that she is getting another horse and cannot afford the board on her other horse. My husband had been looking to buy me a horse for several months prior, but was having trouble finding one. So, my SIL told him ""Adventoursslut can have (her horse), but just make sure that if she ever wants to get rid of him, she lets me know first and I'll take him back"" She said it was because she's very worried about selling to someone she doesn't know and this way she would know who has him.

So the day comes and I'm surprised with him. My SIL lives 45 min away, so we moved him to a boarding pasture 7 minutes down the road from us. She helped us move him down and get him settled, and the next day called me and said she had a contract for me to sign. ""It just says that you'll take care of him and that if you sell him I get him back"". The contract actually said that everything, from brand of feed to his farrier had to be approved by her, or she had the right to take him back. I was so ready to have a horse that I just signed whatever I needed to sign and just considered it a formality.

Fast forward a couple months, and she's driving me insane. She goes by the boarder multiple times a week and sends me pictures of every little scratch. I go over there every other day to ride and check on him. Even while she was on vacation she sends her sister over there to send her videos and pictures of him so she can check on him. There is also a man whom I pay to board them who feeds them and keeps an eye on him.

She goes by yesterday, sends me a text asking when the farrier is coming, and says ""I notice he has a small scratch on his hind end you've been treating. How bad was it?"" I noticed it on Friday but I didn't tell her because I don't feel like I need to update her daily on every little scratch. My husband asked me what was up and I mentioned about how frustrating it is being nagged to death. He told me later he called his brother just to mention it (without my knowledge) and his brother said ""Well its not adventurousslut's horse, SIL is just letting her ride it and that's what you guys get out of the deal.""

Am I the asshole because I want her to back off? I feel like I'm just paying for the upkeep on her horse and am just pretty much babysitting it for her in exchange for riding it some.",59,102,0.93

She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault. 

Am I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?",8997,36221,0.87

I have been with my fiancé for over 5 years.  Over the last 5 years he has had 4 surgeries. After each one I took care of him so he could heal properly.  One surgery was while I was pregnant, and another was a week after I had a c-section, so even when i should have been catered to and pampered, i was taking care of him instead. I never feel that I get taken care of, like my problems or issues are second to his.  I always put him first, but I feel like the same is not given to me.  In May, I started having physical issues with my foot to the point where I have now been to urgent care, my GP at least twice, an orthopedic doctor, a podiatrist, a neurologist, and I am now in physical therapy.  I also had to miss work for 5 days.  I have been told to rest my foot and am now in an orthotic boot and using a crutch. My daily life has been affected by my foot issue, I can’t walk for very long without it flaring up and causing intense pain and I can’t sleep because I can’t get my foot comfortable. My issue is that I am not being taken care of the way I took care of him during his many medical surgeries/issues. I take care of him all the time and just wanted him to want to take care of me when I needed him to.  Massage and icing my foot are the only real relief I get, when I tell people this, they always say well your fiancé can give you nightly massages.  And I smile and nod, like of coarse that’s what is happening when the truth is that in the 3 months this has all been going on, he has only rubbed my feet like 3 times.  I still attempt to do grocery shopping, when he could offer to do it (he’s a stay at home dad that gets 2 days off when our child goes to daycare), I still work all day and come home and stand on my foot to cook dinner when there are options for him to cook but he doesn’t feel like it.  There are other examples like waiting until I get up to do something before saying I was going to do that but then not actually taking the task over so I can go sit down. 
Recently I can’t help but feel that people at work will go out of their way to help me more than my fiancé does. 
 
AITA for wanting my fiancé to want to do more and to want to take care of me when I’m trying to heal? Fyi this is my first post.


Update: his surgeries were for his knee. None were surgeries he elected to have, they were necessary. He severed his tendon from his knee. Then the VA botched the surgery and it snapped again so they put in a wire to reattach it. Then the wire started fraying and needed to be removed. (the removal of the wire was the surgery after my C-section)  another surgery was for his nose. 

And i openly admit i havent voiced my concerns/aggravation yet but planned to after this post.  Not sure i agree that i should have to ask to be taken care of but i agree that it cant get better without communication.",39,43,0.89

1363,Not the A-hole,"Me and I girlfriend recently went to this super nice place in Korea. There were 2 places in particular this happened. Also I paid for this tour to surprise her cause she loves naturey stuff. 

First place was in a garden and she loved it and was taking a bunch of pics and she recently got a selfie stick and was using that. I was just taking pics of the whole area, I'd let her go about and we'd take a pic together when she asked. Near the end of that, she was over the place, she said how I never took pictures of her and she's alway the one doing the selfies with us or asking me to do it rather than me doing it first. 

I've never been the type to take pics of myself. Rather see where I'm at then my own face. I don't know. Eventually she cooled down and we went to the next place. 

First off my girlfriend was wearing a shirt showing most of her back and some shorts. Nothing to crazy like her ass hanging out or anything in my opinion.

As the day went on at this place, she was visibly getting more and more upset. And I asked her what's wrong, and she said guys are just staring at her. I was kind of oblivious to it as I was just enjoying the scenery around us till she pointed it out. I said something along the lines of they're gonna look at us but they're not doing anything to us and there's just so many people here. 

Moments later she's just fuming mad, almost yelling with people around us and goes off saying how I'm not protective at all or care about her and that I should cover her from guys looking at her. Mind you, this is a very touristy area, there's people in every direction.

We eventually go into a gift shop and I buy a scarf for her and she covers her back.

1364,Not the A-hole,"I [21F] am a postgraduate student in the UK. For the past year, my housemate [27M] has been an absolute nightmare - throwing parties during deadline week, stealing things, and being generally rude, messy and inconsiderate. Any time we complained, he refused to admit he was in the wrong and would often respond with some sort of petty vengeance. I tried my best to be reasonable, telling him he was welcome to use my kitchenware (not food) as long as he washed up after himself, but with two exceptions: that he couldn't use my wok, which apart from being my only semi-expensive item, was gifted to me by a family member who has since passed, and that he couldn't cook or eat shellfish with my things as I am severely allergic and was worried about contamination. A week later, I come home to find him cooking paella with my wok. He claimed that he 'forgot' he wasn't supposed to.

He was constantly stealing food. One of the many times I caught him red-handed - eating a previously unopened box of chocolates with a note addressed to me from my girlfriend attached - his excuse was that I shouldn't mind him eating my food because I have a scholarship and he doesn't. While this is true, his family sends him a LOT of money, whereas my scholarship was granted partially due to financial need. I wouldn't be able to study here without it, and I still sometimes struggle to make ends meet, so having someone constantly eating my food was really upsetting.

My housemate moved out before I did, leaving me with some 'tasks' he forgot to do himself, one of which was to take a few bags of clothes to the charity shop. He specifically said he didn't want them and that I should donate them. Well, these were really nice clothes, expensive brands in very good condition. I saw an opportunity and selected a couple of items which I estimated I could sell on eBay for maybe £30, a little over a week's worth of food for me. Actually, they ended up selling for almost £50. It's hard to estimate how much the food he stole throughout the year would add up to, so I can't really say how fair that is, but I'd guess it's close enough.

What I feel bad about is that the clothes were meant to go to a charity shop. Having given it some thought, I feel more like I've stolen from a charity than back from him, as the shop could have made money from those clothes had I not sold them myself. I feel like what I've done is against my own moral code. I thought about donating the money I made to charity, but in my current financial situation £50 is too precious to donate all at once. I may do so at a later stage, or in increments, just to ease my conscience.

I don't think I'm a massive A for selling his stuff as such, seeing as he didn't want it, but probably am TA for not passing on what was meant to be a charitable donation. But what do others think - AITA?



Edit: Just to clarify, I did donate the rest of the clothes, just not the two items I picked put. Apologies!",37,134,0.92

1367,Everyone Sucks,"Hi all. 

My daughter Elly is great. She is very pretty, smart and has lots of friends. She received her A Level grades recently and they were excellent, and she got into a very selective university to study economics. I'll be honest, we do spoil her quite a bit. That's not to say we let her run wild or that she's a troublemaker or that we don't punish her if she messes up, but at the same time she does know how to get what she wants. 

Elly went to a party on Saturday. We got a call from one of her friends at about 4am in the morning saying Elly was in the hospital and we needed to come quickly. 

We got there and she had a broken ankle. Apparently after the party Elly and several friends were drunk and went to a nearby railway track to hang out. They were having fun until Elly slipped/tripped on the uneven surface and fell over. It hurt too much to walk on and one of her friends had to call an ambulance. 

Elly was taken to hospital where she was treated. It will be a while before she can walk again however. 

The police also showed up to question her, firstly because trespassing on the railway is illegal, but also because she was found with drugs in her handbag, enough for it to be considered ''intent to supply'', which it wasn't. It was just her and her friends stuff for the night. She was arrested and charged. Her friends also took the trespass charge but only Elly was charged for the drugs. 

We will, of course, get her a lawyer and make the best effort to get her to be treated leniently. She will be pleading guilty since the evidence is obvious. There is potential for her to get time in prison, but realistically she will likely get off with a fine since she has not been in any trouble before. Her university offer has been withdrawn, but since her grades were so good she got a place at a lesser ranking uni fairly soon after. 

However, we have shown her absolutely no sympathy for this. Since she has been at home on crutches she has been increasingly demanding of us, asking her to buy her a new phone, new clothes, etc, and asked for her a new handbag since her current one was damaged when she fell. We have refused repeatedly. She is constantly demanding that me or her dad bring her food or snacks and has even asked us to go to the shop for her. 

Elly has been crying, saying we don't care about the fact that she has been hurt, or that she's terrified for the outcome of her court case. We've both said that she got herself into that situation. She didn't have to go to the railway or do drugs. She chose to put herself in that situation, so we shouldn't have to pay for the outcome. 

Elly has been crying and saying we are bad parents, but I think we are doing the right thing in showing her the consequences of her actions.",763,3238,0.95

I told them multiple times not to cancel as i don’t want to be the reason they don’t go however they cancelled, thanked me for ruining their time, and went to their room.

As we left the airport and took a huge turn to head north which is something I really don’t like. As we were turning we hit quite bad turbulence and I started gripping the seat and swearing. My mum and dad didn’t like this as they have no issue with flying. 

Around half an hour later we hit the worst turbulence I have ever experienced on a flight before so I was naturally terrified. All of a sudden the plane took a huge drop and a few people screamed and I swore really loudly. Obviously everything was okay and the plane altitude began to straighten out. 

As we landed I said to my mum and dad that that I was glad that we were down to which my mum replied “well the language wasn’t good!”

1371,Everyone Sucks,"My sister got me a cat maybe about half a year ago. Her name is Decaf and I really really love her. My brother who I live with does not.

Recently, I’ve been coming home from work to find Decaf outside or in the back shed, super dirty and full or bugs, fleas, mites, etc. It always stresses me out because I get home at like 2-3 am from work and then have to go and look for my cat. I asked my brother and sister in law to to not keep the back door open because she always finds a way outside. They said they’ll try and it seemed to work for a few days, and I would come home to find her waiting for me and I would cuddle with her. I should also state that she’s really affectionate and loves pats and rubs. She never bites, scratches, or hisses at me. 

Today I came back home again, I didn’t see her at first but I didn’t mind since she’s sometimes sleeping under the bed. I texted some friends then started calling her name. When she didn’t respond I started getting stressed out, checking around the house and seeing the back door was open again. I open it and shout her name but I didn’t hear a response so I search the house again. As I go outside to look again, she comes inside, but immediately wants to go out again. I try to pick her up but she hisses at me, which stressed me out even more. My brother comes to see the commotion since I was being loud shouting her name and stuff (it’s 3am). I argue with him about keeping the back door open and he said it was really hot and it’s selfish of me to have a cat. He could have opened windows or the front door but instead kept open the only way my cat gets outside. Anyway, Decaf runs to my room and I still can’t pet her or touch her at all, like she doesn’t recognize me. She hisses and bites every time. I just grabbed her with a towel over my arm so she couldn’t hurt me, and let her outside right now. I feel like it’s really stressful for me to keep trying to find the cat every day, after working 8 hours. And now school has started for me, I have to be up early too, it’s not like I can be up all the time keeping her clean after I find her. She kept scratching and her tail was full of fleas too when she came into the house. I spent a lot of time and money on her, buying her lots of toys and playing with her and cuddling with her and I feel like I can’t handle the stress of regaining her trust and keeping her clean with both school and work. 

AITA for not wanting to keep her anymore?

EDIT: I let her back inside, will be taking her to the vet tomorrow for a check up. Thanks to everyone for telling me off, after reading the replies I knew that I couldn't abandon her like that and it was stupid of me. I want to continue caring and loving her, and will try to a) secure a better (larger) room in the house so I can just keep her in that room and b) get more time off work so I can care for her. If I can't I will find a better home for her.

UPDATE: I took Decaf to the vet, and it turns out she doesn’t have fleas, but she did have other bugs crawling through her fur. She’s since gotten a bath a week early Cheristin application. she also warming up again and letting me give her belly rubs and play with her. There’s no apparent injuries or pain according to the vet.

I called my parents early this morning, and asked to move into the larger room my brother has his kids’ toys in. She agreed to let me move in there (though my brother doesn’t want to let me). Turns out he’s leaving the country in 2 days, so she told me to just move in after he leaves and she’ll talk to him about it.

Just to clarify, I live with my brother, but not in his house. It is my parents house, though they are out of the country most of the time and he likes to act like he’s the owner (he’s 12 years older than me). My parents agreed to let me have a cat when my sister gifted her to me, and she is taken well care of and always has someone around when they are here. I will be taking the advice of a lot of people here, and keep her in the room we are moving to, but not the rest of the house where she can run away (it’s large so she will have room to play). I’m also trying to arrange more time off work to have the ability to keep taking care of her.

I normally let Decaf roam the house when I’m not home and it has been fine until recently. My brother and his family don’t hate the cat, they just don’t care for her, and basically live their lives as if she doesn’t exist. I don’t think they would bully her, but they don’t care if she runs outside or anything because they don’t care about her (hence why they’ll keep the back door open even if I asked them not to).",108,125,0.84

1373,Not the A-hole,"Had a family holiday and stayed at a hotel for 2 weeks, at the end of our stay we still had some half used toiletries left and didn’t want to take them back home with us since we were running short for space in our luggage. 

The in-laws wanted to leave the half used toiletries like soap, shampoo, conditioner, and unfinished packets of makeup wipes, facial tissues etc. in a little hamper basket with a card to say thanks for cleaning up the room during our stay. 

I totally understand where they’re coming from about not wanting to waste stuff and they thought it was a good gesture but I just don’t think it’s right to dress it all up like that when they’re half used and unwanted. 

I don’t know if it makes sense to you but to me, it seems like they’re valuing the cleaner below themselves, like, you wouldn’t gift half used toiletries to your family or friends so why would you do it to a cleaner? Wouldn’t it have been better to just leave them there instead? It almost seems like they have to make it nice because they think that’s all the cleaner can afford or something, I would be insulted if I was the cleaner :(

The only reason why they’re “gifting” it is because it’s unwanted, and if we had none left then they wouldn’t have bothered leaving new gifts anyway. 

I told them I don’t have a problem with them leaving the stuff but maybe they shouldn’t have put it in a hamper and added a card, also to me it felt like they assumed that said cleaner can’t afford their own toiletries just because they are a cleaner. 

If the cleaners wanted to take the stuff then they could have done so if we just left it neatly arranged by the sink or something, we left food in the fridge freezer like an unopened packet of ham that we didn’t eat and a soft taco kit on the counter. 

Obviously I wasn’t going to throw away the basket and card because they paid for it all and made it look nice so we left it where it was and went on our way, but told them I did disagree with the way they went about it and how the cleaner could be offended. 

I have since apologised as I felt a little bad about shutting them down straight away when they probably put some thought into it. But I still stand my my original opinion. 

My point in short it that I think it’s disrespectful to “gift” half used toiletries to a cleaner because you wouldn’t do the same for friends or family and the cleaner might be insulted if they’re being given them because (1) they’re unwanted and (2) just because they clean hotel rooms doesn’t mean they can’t afford their own toiletries

We talked about how our grandma only points out only the bad things, how she is never glad for the presents people give her, how she thinks that women can't be living on their own without a men and so on...

1) my grandma went on vacation with her boyfriend (my grandpa died, when my mom was 18). her boyfriend paid the whole vacation with sea and beach (important note: our country doesn't have a sea and you have to travel at least 10 hours), because my grandma refused to work (she is not even retired) and she dared to say that the whole vacation was a bummer, because she had a room in the 1st floor and not ground floor. 

2) when my sister and her ex bf broke up, because he cheated, my grandma SAID that she should stay with him, because my sister can't earn that much to live by herself.

3) when my sister was only going on dates with a guy and my grandma heard that he is rich (IT guy), She immediately told my sister that NOW she won't have to worry about paying anything. 

4) when I couldn't go to hang out with her (school, work, and so on), she always told my mom, that I am a brat and that I don't even want to make time for her.

5) and when we do hangout, she is bored with everything. she doesn't wanna walk or do anything m and we talk, she just insults me or people around me.

6) whenever I changed my hair, got a tattoo, and so on, visible on my fb (i have never added my grandma)... my grandma stalked it out and told my mom ""U LET HER DO THAT? NOW NO MEN WILL WANT HER"". (also she pretty much have 5+ accounts to stalk me and my siblings)

these are just few things that bother me the most. 

my grandmother was never nice to my mom. When my mom married my dad (they are divorced for 18+ years), my grandma told my mom that she hopes they divorce each other... and when they actually divorced and my mom needed a shelter, my grandma just cussed her out that she is a whore and doesn't deserve happiness.

I told my sister that I want to go low contact with our grandmother, because of the reasons listed above. She told me that I am an asshole and I will regret that, when she dies and that I should just pull through before she pass away, so our mom won't be sad.

Backstory: When I took over 6 yesyes ago, the agency had a significant attendance problem. Calling off and tardiness were causing public service issues.  I was asked to fix the problem. I instituted a zero- tolerance tardiness policy (definitely a little asshole). 


For the most part it has fixed the problem.  Less than 1 tardy per person last year ( down from and average of 10 when I took over).


The situation is that we posted for a new position. All candidates were explained that timeliness was important.  One applicant showed up 15 minutes late claiming ""traffic problems."" I brought the candidate back,  explained the history and reason for our policy and thanked them for coming in. 

Then I excused then and explained that I would not be considering then for employment and that taking any more time to interview would be disrespectful to them and my staff that must abide by this policy.

1381,Asshole,"Okay, so me (28M) and my gf (23F) went travelling earlier this year. We made it to Indonesia for our last stop and we stayed for 3 weeks. The first day we got there, we were on a beach and a small puppy approached us. He was small, underfed and in a bad way so my gf got it some puppy food and fed it. I told her this was stupid as this would draw in other dogs and that she's gonna get attached. 
The next morning, the puppy was still on the beach near our apartment - again, my gf decided to feed it. 
Over the next few days she kept feeding the dog and grew super attached to it. 
We were due to travel to our next hotel in a different city and the dog followed us all the way. Like, it literally followed us on the taxi, through cities and to the apartment. 

The dog kept crying outside the hotel so the next day my gf took it to a local vet, got it's rabies vaccine and tests which all came back clear and then the next night when the dog was crying, she let it in the apartment where it slept.

My gf then hit me with the bombshell the next day that she was going to spend a further 3 months in the country so that we could get the dog back to the UK. She'd spent hours researching and decided to break the journey home up into two very short flights and a ferry so that it's less stress for the dog. She knew we needed to get the dog tested and vaccines and then keep it in the country for 3 months or it'd be quarantined alone when back in the UK. 

This was set to cost thousands of pounds. Money we don't really have as we've just spent 6 months travelling. We have no jobs secured for our return, so I don't think it's responsible to get a dog even if she has the money to pay for it all. 

My gf went to do a day massage course and left me with the dog. I decided enough was enough and took the dog for a long long walk, put some food down for it before hopping on my bike and going back to the apartment. The dog didn't find me after that. 

My gf returned, I'd packed up to go to the next place and she panicked about the dog. I told her the truth, and why I'd done it and she was hysterical and went looking for the dog, like searching everywhere. She ended up breaking up with me, calling me a psycho and abandoned me in our apartment. I think I did the right thing but AITA?

For my dad who's a tad posh and deadly afraid of flying on his own. Without ever so much as mentioning it to me beforehand.

My partner and I, barely awake from going out the night before, just sat there not knowing what to say. My dad was very thankful and touched.

In the coming weeks, my dad spent all that money on his gardener. I hoped he'd forget about the original purpose of the money, I offered alternatives, but he insisted on sticking to the plan, I think a little bit due to expectations from everyone and his set time off from work.

So I replanned our whole trip, much to my partner's and my annoyance because we will basically have to rush through great parts of the trip now. I made sure not to show that to my dad, though, because it's not his fault and he feels easily rejected.

I booked the flights and accommodations. The option of building a structure for the car to sleep in fell through because my dad needs to sit there now. We would have slept in a tent, but now b&b's it is. Anyway, I got over it, everything is booked.

Then I spoke to my older sister (who's idea that whole ""present"" was) and she tells me that she's trying to get a girlfriend for my dad, so he doesn't have to fly alone. Much to my dismay, she was successful. So again, all accommodations cancelled and booked again for 4 people. Great.

So far I had to pay 5k for everything and my dad keeps putting off paying me the 4k he owes me, so that's that. Bloody gardener. I'm so mad at my sister for putting us into this situation, but everyone just pats her on the shoulder for being such a great fucking person for reuniting my dad and me when I never even wanted it.

Am I the heartless asshole here?

1383,Asshole,"So got married a year ago. I had my vows written months before the wedding. Of course my husband (who I had been dating for 10 years) waited till a week before and had his brother look it over. (His brother is historically terrible at giving advice). 

Let me just say that big moments are not my husband's thing. The first time he said ""I love you"" was over Facebook. He tried to rush our marriage proposal and there was a hired photographer in my face the whole time. Whom I thought was a very rude bystandard at the time. So I guess this proposal was so very much fitting of my husband. I'm pretty sure he gets it from his dad. (Who one family Christmas party got drunk and told his entire family how he used to bang his now wife who is basically the mother Mary of Catholics)

So big day and half a year of me and my mom planning. Had over 200 people mostly his ginormous and awesome family and children there (this is important). His family is way bigger than mine. And it has taken me years to get over my anxiety around them.

Everything is great except I can barely breathe because my seamstress made my dress to tight. (Went fuzzy when I first put it on) I say my vows which were really straight to the point but from the heart.

Husband starts off okay talking about how we met. Okay no biggie pretty normal. (Warning rated PG13) Then gets into his favorite stories **one of which** is how he one day came home work and saw me posing naked taking pictures of myself. (I am a hobby artist, so I use pictures of myself to get a pose and light right. Note that I have never shown my family my art and have told my husband I am extremely uncomfortable about the idea of it).

Needless to say I was mortified. My grandparents and parents were, of course, there along with about 20 children. I had decided that I would let absolutely **nothing** ruin my day that day so I just got past it and went to the next thing. The end of his vows were actually perfect and from the heart. The rest of the wedding went off without a hitch we both had a great time and I get lots of good comments to this day. 



But I have said a few times how I would have preferred he had kept that out if the vows. I've told him how I wish he had just stuck to the end of his vows which I loved
 
AITA

Tldr; my husband ""undressed me"" during his vows.

Edit: he has said he feels bad and I don't bring it up we were watching a movie yesterday that had a vow scene and he brought it up. But when he says he feels bad I say something like ""yea it woulda been nice if you left that out"". I'm afraid I'm hurting his feelings when I say this. Should I lie and say it doesn't bother me?",167,677,0.94

1385,Asshole,"Now with that tittle I realize it makes me sounds like a giant, gaping ass hole. BUT, I feel like I was very reasonable in my actions.

I got an apartment with my friend while we finish our college. We’ve both got a couple years left. He’s going to be a teacher and I’m going for criminal justice to be a cop. Something he has known.

Despite being a college town, the actually city we live in is not the best. Which is all well and good, just keep the doors locked and all.

A couple weeks ago, the people right next to us had their car vandalized and where robbed.

That night, I explained that I want us to have a gun. Nothing crazy. A pistol at most, honestly.

My friend didn’t like the idea, saying that it wasn’t safe and that it would create more problems. He’s not familiar and comfortable too much with guns. I wasn’t comfortable with guns for a while till I started spending a little time every month shooting targets. I get where he’s coming from.

I argued that it could have easily been us that was robbed.

My classes are hybrid, so I’m in the apartment a lot, doing school work. If I’m at my desk working and someone breaks in, I’d prefer to be armed.

I’m not trying to kill anybody. I understand it takes a lot to pull the trigger on another human. Honestly. I’d never go for it, but since this just happened and so close, I wanted protection.

I bought a small pistol, and placed it in my nightstand. I’m not carrying it around town, concealing it or anything. It’s in my nightstand.

I told him and he freaked out. He said he wasn’t comfortable with a gun and that I was insane.

I feel a little bad but I want peace of mind.

1386,Asshole,"Some background here: one of my good friends who I've known since grammar school got married about a year ago. He comes from a very conservative background where both partners are expected to be virgins upon marriage, and things like sex/partying are hugely taboo. 

His wife and I didn't know each other prior to their marriage, but we have a mutual friend that we know from our college days. A few months ago, I met up with some friends from college, including said mutual friend, to catch up and have a good time. At one point, we were talking about marriage (one of my friends at the meetup was planning his wedding), and I brought up how I might settle down soon once I find a good girl. I brought my friend and his wife up as a good example, since they seemed pretty happy at the time, but our mutual friend told me that she wasn't as ""good"" as I thought.

I pried a bit, and looking back, I wish I didn't, but in short, my friend showed me photos, texts, and proof that my friend's wife was sleeping around, on tinder, partying, drinking, etc.-- basically all behavior that's super taboo in my friend's culture. I've always held the policy that being honest about shit like this is the wisest thing to do, so I told my friend about it the next day. 

Suffice to say, he was furious, and by the next month, his divorce was finalized. His wife recently texted me after finding out that it was me who told her ex, cursing me out, but I feel like I did the right thing by warning my friend of something that he wouldn't approve of.

1387,Not the A-hole,"A few months ago, one of my neighbors got pregnant. They decided to move their cat, Minnie, outside leaving her only food and water occasionally. Now this was back in early 2019, when the weather got cold at night. I worried about Minnie freezing, so I left her a blanket cursing my neighbors for not providing her at least a bed. Minnie is the sweetest cat, and she looked fed enough so I didn't worry too much.

Fast forward to a month ago, I began to notice Minnie looking a little thinner. I found out my neighbors were hardly feeding her by monitoring her food bowl. I took it upon myself to give her water and a bit of food. This pissed me off, and if it weren't for the fact that I have a dog I would have taken her in by now. I've been constantly checking her food bowl over the past few weeks and Minnie still isn't being fed consistently.

Today was my breaking point. In the morning I checked to see if she had any food in her bowl. Nothing. Desperately hoping she'd be fed, I went on my way. Tonight I checked her food bowl again. Absolutely nothing. Not even a drop of water. She was near me and I pet her, noticing she was even thinner. I filled her bowls, absolutely brimming with anger over the fact that they would leave a poor cat without food.

I've been seriously contemplating calling animal control to come to pick her up. They would provide her with food and shelter and, hopefully, a loving home. I've told my parents about this, but they said it was none of my business since it's not my cat. I'm also a bit afraid of backlash from my neighbors if I did go through with this, but I'd prefer that than a poor cat starving to death.

WIBTA if I called animal control?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies! After reading all of the comments, I've come up with a plan. I'll talk to my neighbors and see if they can give me Minnie's food so I can feed her instead. If that doesn't work, then I'll buy cat food so I can feed her. I didn't think about the possibility of Minnie being euthanized if I called animal control, so calling would be my last resort. I do agree that I WBTA if Minnie ends up euthanized. If I do end up calling, I'll make sure it's a no-kill shelter. I also should have mentioned that we live in an apartment complex, so there should be no doubt that my other neighbors have seen Minnie's treatment. It seems I'm the only one who cares about the poor cat since I'm the only one doing anything about it. I'm sure someone would have taken her in by now if they truly cared.",48,164,0.98
1388,Everyone Sucks,"This actually happened a year ago.

One day I was doing some job-hunting, filling out applications and dropping off copies of my resume in person (not a fan of the whole online thing, plus it's more formal). One happened to be this restaurant/bar that I've been to a few times and liked, they seemed to really like me. The next day, I actually happened to be passing through the area again and actually stopped by there, and they remembered me and since the GM happened to be around they offered me an interview.

She was very nice and seemed to really like me when she interviewed me, and enthusiastic about moving forward. She never said 'you're hired' just yet, but she did arrange a time for me to come back for a 'training session'. Seems promising so far.

Fast forward to that day. I come in, turns out she's not there that day cause she had something she needed to tend to. Okay. So I go in, have the training session with a different manager and some other workers. It goes pretty well, they seem to really like me. This seems promising and I'm excited to move forward with this. As far as I'm aware, it went pretty well, nothing went wrong. The manager who trained me even said the words ""**if you want to work here, you can**"" but since the GM wasn't around it needed to run by her first. They seemed like a chill crowd, at the end of my training shift they seemed pretty enthusiastic about seeing me again and said I ""should be getting a call in a few days"".

I wait a few days... radio silence. I try reaching out to them after a week, and the person on the phone actually remembered exactly who I am and was wondering what happened to me as well. Whatever. I know they say 'be persistent' but I'm a little hesitant going back there in person since I don't want to seem desperate. But I did remember them logging the time I was there so I figured there was at least some kind of check I was supposed to be getting.

I visit in person after about a month, since it seems they're ghosting me despite moving that far. The people at the front actually remembered me and asked what happened and seemed just as surprised as me that I wasn't back sooner. They get the manager, which was actually the guy that trained me (GM wasn't in) and he said something along the lines of ""yeah... we're just not hiring right now, try back in ____"". I accepted it but then asked if there was a check, and sure enough, there was one they were sitting on, he went and got me that. So I left, no bridges burnt. Walked out the walk of shame.

I've been told I should 'give them another shot', but I feel like it would make me look desperate. I feel like they might think ""he's coming back after we did that to him?"". And on the other hand, what they did wasn't cool. Yeah, I know jobs don't usually call back to say you're not hired, but after moving that far with me and saying everything they said I feel like they at least owed me that courtesy.

1389,No A-holes here,"My sister got married back in April. Literally the night before I was scheduled to get on the plane to attend the wedding, my wife receives a phone call that her grandmother had passed away. She had been sick for some time and finally succumbed. Her and my wife were very close.  I immediately made the decision to be with her and not go to the wedding. I had to call my sister the day before she was scheduled to get married and explain the situation. She hasn't spoken to me since. AITA for choosing what I felt my wife needed at the time instead of attending a wedding?

Edit: We live in CO, wedding was in FL, funeral in NC. Last minute tickets to NC for the both of us were going to be north of $3k so we ended up driving the whole way. Couldn't wait a few days. I tried to find a way to go to FL then back to CO the next day before leaving for NC. Couldn't make it work.

1390,Not the A-hole,"My family and I grew up very poor. From when I was old enough to legally work, I (19F) have had to take on multiple jobs while balancing school to help with my family and my younger sister. Growing up, I never had a lot and whatever money I earned I would spend on my sister (16F) and family. When I was 18 and had just been accepted into college, my dad's business that he'd worked on for the past couple of years finally took off. This also meant that my sister could now have a normal high school experience without worrying about money.

While I was in college, I wasn't in contact with my sister that much since I was so busy with schoolwork. However, from our calls and her social media, I could tell she had changed completely and was involved with some bad people. She would post videos on her snapchat of her getting drunk, smoking weed, juuling, driving while most likely drunk/high, etc. I tried reaching out to her, but she would mostly deny the claims and told me to mind my own business. At some point, she justified her actions using the argument, ""This is what the cool kids do now, not everyone was a nerd like you in high school."" One of my high school friends who also has a brother in the same grade reach out to me and said that she heard that my sister was seeing a sketchy guy from another school. Apparently he sells drugs and was expelled from my sister's high school. I asked my sister about this and she denied it. 

Last week I got a phone call from my mom who was sobbing. She tells me that my sister is pregnant. I was so shocked that I could not speak. Then I was angry. When I was her age and even younger, I gave her everything and so did my parents so she could have all the opportunities her peers had. Since my dad's business became lucrative, they've given her every opportunity to succeed (any extracurricular/sport she wants, academic tutoring, school activities, etc.). I never got any of those things. It angered me so much that she took all of this for granted and fucked up her life. The father? Her delinquent ""boyfriend"" who got expelled and sells drugs. 

She blows up my phone but I don't respond. She then sends me a series of long text messages asking if she can crash at my place. She also asked me if I could make her an appointment to see a doctor. Lastly, she asked if it would be okay if her boyfriend comes and stays over sometimes. I shut her down. I told her that you dug this hole for yourself. If you allowed yourself to become pregnant, then you should be able to deal with the consequences. Also, I’m currently sharing a small apartment with two roommates! She begged some more and I denied her. In the past few days, she's still be texting me and calling me non-stop saying that she has nowhere to go and has been living in her boyfriend's car. I haven't responded to a single message of hers, but I feel my resolve wavering a bit. I fully don't support her, but maybe I'm being an asshole?

EDIT: To clarify, I would still NEVER house her in my apartment. That would be extremely disrespectful towards my roommates and would get me kicked out due to the lease agreement. I meant I was considering giving in and sending her some money.

EDIT 2: My parents have DISOWNED her, not kicked her out. They are refusing to acknowledge that she is their daughter, but she is still welcome to live in their house.

1392,Asshole,"Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

So, I'm a senior in high school and played cricket after school for a long time, among some other things such as debate, business/investing clubs, model UN, and things like that. To many guys my age, cricket is a bonafide obsession- they spend all their waking hours that they can either playing, practicing, talking about it, or watching matches on TV. 

I am, if I say so myself, the best player on my school team. I am, at least according to lots of people, a 'cricket underachiever'- that is, people say I have actual skill and could go places if I were to take it seriously and play on a competitive team. The thing is, I don't take cricket as seriously as most guys my age- it's fun, to be sure, and being a good player improves your popularity and attraction from girls, but I'm not extremely attached to it and have zero intention of trying to go pro. That's why I don't join any competitive teams or coaching programs- I intend to study economics/business and probably go into business in the future, and plus I enjoy spending my free time hanging out. If I were to start playing competitively, that'd take up all my time for no reason.

Anyways, I wanted to be captain of my team, and everyone expected me to be. I know for a fact that most of the team voted for me (votes are public). However, I was passed over and the captaincy was given to someone else because according to the coaches 'he has more ability to build camaraderie' (the coaches are the ones who ultimately decide, regardless of votes). I felt like I had been stiffed, and as I mentioned, I don't really care all that much for cricket to begin with- it's fun, but not so fun I had to stand being stiffed. So I quit in protest, and a few of my friends did the same.

Since then, the team has been suffering a lot and losing matches, and the coach is asking me to come back. I told him I wouldn't since he stiffed me over the captaincy, and he called me an asshole.

Am I? I think I have a right to quit the team if I want, and he's not right for stiffing me in the first place.",299,75,0.79
1393,Not the A-hole,"Background: 

I’ve worked at this one store since I was a kid; even when I went to university out of town I would come back in the summers to work. This particular customer, a male 30+ yrs my senior (let’s call him Bob), is both a regular customer and a family acquaintance. 

I usually have no problem having small talk with Bob. At times he makes me a bit uncomfortable/gets too personal (ex. when I come back during vacation Bob would ask if I missed him and get offended when I don’t say yes) but I would brush it off thinking that he’s just joking. 

I graduated this past June and was super stressed out bc I was unsure of what I wanted to do next. I’d applied for jobs first and ended up getting a lot of shit from my parents bc they believed I was wasting my time. My anxiety was at an all-time high trying to smooth things over with them and on top of that I had customers asking me left and right what my post-grad plans were. I’m usually pretty laidback, but academics is something that really stresses me out. My dad convinced me to take the GRE, and with a month to study for it I’d spend my breaks at work reviewing. Majority of people, even my strict af parents, realized I was going through a rough patch and respectfully gave me space to figure things out on my own. 

Bob, however, couldn’t take a hint. He’d continuously ask me what I was doing during my breaks when I was studying, questioning why I couldn’t find a job in my field, why didn’t I want to pursue a master’s bc he thought I was an academic?, etc. even tho I told him I was doing my own thing. I finally got frustrated and told him SEVERAL TIMES that I wasn’t comfortable with him constantly asking about my life bc I DIDN’T FUCKING KNOW MYSELF and I didn’t want to share. Each time Bob would agree not to bring it up, but then continue to pester me every. single. day. FOR WEEKS. Eventually I would just answer “idk” and I guess he wasn’t satisfied with that, so he would secretly ask my parents. I told my mom I didn’t want her to tell him anything; when she told Bob to stop asking her about me bc I needed space, he replied, “Well I know I shouldn’t, but I do bc I care about her” which I thought was some manipulative BS that made me seem terrible for rejecting his “concern”. Sometimes during my breaks a customer would stop by to say hi to me, and Bob would go “oh don’t bother her, she doesn’t want to talk to anyone”. He would make petty comments about me “not wanting to talk to him anymore” and acts like I owe him something as if he’s my dad. Ugh.

I find it strange why he’s so invested in my life when at the end of the day he’s just a customer I talked to (it was my job?); he’s not my friend or my family or anyone I consider close. I got so tired of his pettiness that now I greet him when I need to, but overall I try my best to avoid him. My mom says I shouldn’t just avoid him, but I think it’s justified.

1394,Asshole,"My ex-boyfriend and I broke up over his strange obsession with ""furry"" stuff. 

That he was a furry came to me as a total shock after a long, almost entirely positive relationship that I exited feeling somewhat disgusted with myself for possibly (likely?) being shallow. Truthfully, it was sort of a bait and switch since he never mentioned his furry obsession at all until like 8 months into the relationship. I would have never considered pursuing a serious relationship with him had I known the extent of how creepy it would be to me. I did, in ernest, try to reconcile, but, in the process, the relationship fell apart.

Over the course of explaining why we broke up, dozens of times to different people, it slipped out to maybe one or two gossips, by accident, that the particular reason we broke up was his strange fetish/hobby.  

Most likely due to the breakup more than the concurring incident of exposing him as a furry, he has gained substantial weight and has shown some signs of depression. I honestly tried to maintain a friendship, but it kept getting wierder and wierder. There's a mix of sad and angry between both of us, but something that comes up way more often than it should was that I was responsible for outing him as a furry. 

I apologised for everything and anything and he refuses to accept any attempt at reconciliation at any point. Most of our mutuals genuinely didn't care or laughed it off if they found out. I never went out of my way to frame him as a wierdo and He never once asked me to keep it a secret, despite hiding it from me for so long. I honestly suspect his overly offensive reaction is more an overreaction to the rest of the situation.

1397,Asshole,"TL;DR My “friend” of over 10 years lied about hooking up with my boyfriend. WIBTA if I ghost her? 

This is a messy situation, I’ll do my best to explain the details. I am looking for impartial judgement as to whether or not IWBTA if I ghost my friend after she betrayed my trust. Sorry in advance for the long story!

I (25F) live in an apartment with my boyfriend (30M). About a month ago, my friend (25F) came into town for a weekend visit and stayed with us. We all ended up hooking up. This was completely random. My boyfriend and I had previously discussed having a threesome with another female, but were NOT expecting it to be with a friend of mine (or anyone that we know, for that matter.) We had been drinking and it just kind of...happened. If anyone was an instigator, it would have been me. Stupidly, none of us ever discussed any “rules” prior. The hooking up amongst us three continued throughout the weekend. 

On the last night, I fell asleep in bed next to my boyfriend and my friend after we had all messed around for a while. In the morning, I sensed that they were both acting “off” and assumed that something was up. While helping her pack up her things, I asked her if everything was okay. She said yes. Then I asked her if anything happened between her and him after I fell asleep. She (very quickly and nonchalantly) said “No, we just cuddled.” I thought her reaction was odd but figured that maybe she was just stressed or nervous about seeing her family or flying back home, because surely she wouldn’t lie to me. (Spoiler: she did.) 

After she left, I asked my boyfriend if anything happened between them after I fell asleep. He told me that they made out and then she sucked his dick. He apologized profusely for assuming that I would be okay with them hooking up without my involvement. 
I was VERY upset with both of them. 

Reminder: I am not looking for advice on what to do with him. That would be a different story for a different thread.

Later that day, I texted my friend and again asked her if she and my boyfriend hooked up while I was asleep. She replied saying she “can’t lie to me again” and then told me the truth (the same story my boyfriend told me.) She apologized profusely. I told her I needed some time to comprehend everything, and would let her know when I was ready to talk.

It’s been about a month and I am still extremely angry and disappointed with her. We have been friends for over a decade but it just seemed so easy for her to lie to me. I honestly don’t know if I can ever forgive her, let alone ever trust her again. If I am able to, which I don’t think I am, it certainly wouldn’t be any time soon. I have no idea what I would say to her if I did say something. At this point, I am seriously considering just ghosting her and never following up with her to try to repair what she broke.

If me or the children (10 and 13) talk to him it takes a few tries and then he removes one ear bud like hes allowing us to speak. If HE wants to speak to us, it's a different story. Today I had an important doctors appointment. I was planning to go alone, but he kept saying he wanted to go with me. The entire time we are in the waiting room, hes staring at his phone listening to his earbuds and chuckling loudly in a cancer center waiting room. (note: I am cancer free for one year, it was a checkup). When I was called back to the room, the nurse asked him what he was listening to and he said ""oh I'm just waiting for a call"". She gave him a funny look but kept working on my vitals. I was annoyed and after we got home and I tried to talk to him once again and he didn't hear me I said ""This isn't working for me, is there a way you can set a time limit to how long you have those in your ears? Imagine if I walked around with something blocking everyone from talking to me from morning till night?"" He got angry but yanked them out and said ""FINE.""

1399,Not the A-hole,"I (27F) and my roommate (23M) rent from our landlord (60M) and are both on the lease. Recently my roommate started dating a woman (19F) with a kid (toddler). 

Both the woman and the kid are really annoying. I'm childfree and dislike being around children. This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

Best thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway. Apart from that business is completely normal. I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. I saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. I lied and said I was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

Roommate's girlfriend HATES me and thinks I'm being selfish. Thinks that the baby needs to come first. She has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks I should be responsible for childproofing the house. I told her to take it up with the landlord and that I wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

Today I was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that I'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". Am I really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house? The way I see it she should go find some other place or if she can't afford one a shelter somewhere.",2810,17940,0.92
1400,No A-holes here,"BF and I were at my father's wedding reception, and my entire family and dad's friends were there. BF been dropping hints all day about a surprise he had planned and he kept putting his hand in his trouser pocket, but when his hand was out of his pocket I saw something that could have very easily been a ring box. Then at one point he took a deep breath, finished his drink, and started to stand up. I stood up with him, grabbed him by the elbow and dragged him into another room and said ""if you're about to do what I think you're about to do, then don't tell me, just don't do it here and now."" He said it was meant to be a surprise and I said this wasn't the place to surprise me.

He then showed me the ring and it's my (paternal) grandmother's engagement ring, which he couldn't have had without my dad giving it to him. He then told me that dad and my stepmum had already approved his plan of proposing tonight, but I'd sort of put him off proposing tonight as it was no longer a surprise and I'd explicitly told him not to literally seconds ago. I had no idea they'd approved it or I would have just let him get on with it, and I'd have said yes.

1402,Not the A-hole,"Obligatory “on mobile” disclaimer 

So for some background, I live in a rented house with my younger sister, my mother, and my grandmother (mom’s side). My mom left my dad about half a year ago and my grandmother was “kind” enough to move into a new house with us, while paying 1/2 the rent and utilities. She brought her old, mean cat with her. 
Recently, my gma agreed to us adopting a dog. I and my mother both knew she hates most dogs, but we kept our hopes up and started fostering this sweet dog named Sadie. Now she’s still a puppy, but mostly trained. She also has kennel cough and red mange. (This is all important I swear). 
Sadie is well enough to get fixed and for us to adopt. Mom drops her off at the shelter, and we both go about our day. Gma suddenly texts my mother that she despises the dog, feels trapped in her room because she can’t stand being licked on, jumped on, and sniffed at. She hates how uncomfortable her cat is and says that we’ll get bored of her anyway so what’s the point. She says she’ll stop paying bills if we keep her. My mom is devastated, and starts bringing up points of why we should keep her (teaching me responsibility before I go to college is the main one). Mom texts me all this while I’m at school, before I have to be in the car with gma. I cry for a long time. 
I get into car with gma. I barely speak and am obviously upset. She gets extremely pissed, blares music, and texts my mom “FUCK YOU!”. When we get home, she goes into my room without me knowing to take pictures. She sends these pictures to my mother. Calling me disgusting, trashy, and lazy. “If you want to teach your daughter responsibility start here!” I’m extremely hurt by this. Extremely. She’s a narcissist and sees no wrong in what she does. So, the next morning, I leave a note on my bed that simply says “Fuck You :)”. No harm in it if no one comes in right? Apparently wrong. My friends and family (for the most part) are agreeing with me because they dislike my gma, but my coworkers thought I was way out of line and should apologize. I was kinda thrown off, because I assumed I was in the right. I feel kinda bad now, as she is literally moving out because of the note... sorry, it’s a long one.

1407,Not the A-hole,"So I (21F) met this girl “Kay” (19) last year at college. We became friends because we both are vocal performance majors at our university and we had a few classes together and had church jobs together. 

When Kay came into school last year, she had just gotten out of a 7 year relationship, and not even 2 months later she starts dating this guy named “Jay” (20) who’s literally the textbook definition of a SCRUB. He wasn’t enrolled at our university so she snuck him into the dorms by having him run and jump into her window. He lived with her in the tiny dorm with a golden lab and smoked cigs and weed constantly. He steals her money from her church job to buy drugs and booze. He likes to grab the dog by it’s face and blow weed smoke on him and it’s just gross. The list goes on and on but I’ll leave it at that for now. 

So Kay just got her own apartment this summer and when I moved back into the dorms I wanted to visit. When I went to visit, the apartment was absolutely disgusting. 

The moment you walked into the apartment, it REEKED of cigs.There were holes in the carpet because Jay ashes on the floor, dishes piled in the sink with food on them, holes in her bed because Jay also ashes on the bed, and clothes were thrown all over the house. Tbh I was super uncomfortable but I still wanted to hang out with my friend so I tried to keep my cool. 

Then the dog started jumping on me and then Jay throws a pack of wipes at the dog hitting the dog in the face super hard making the dog cry for about 2 minutes. After that the dog took a massive shit right in front of the door and no one was moving to pick it up. Kay eventually got up, not to pick up the poop, but to spray it with Lysol and go back to talking to me. Jay was just sitting there on the couch smoking a blunt and ashing on his pants not concerned with what his dog just did. 

At that point I couldn’t take it anymore. The smell of dog poop hit me in the face so hard that I was trying not to gag in front of my friends face. So I made up an excuse to leave. I got up and said “hey I’m going on a beer run I’ll be back” and Kay goes “okay” and I left and never returned.

She texted me and asked where I was but I made an excuse and said I had to talk to my mom in the phone for awhile. When she realized I wasn’t coming back she was a bit hurt, but I couldn’t handle going back to that apartment. So AITA?",20,29,0.84
1408,Asshole,"We've been married for 6 months now. Whenever I call him my husband, I get a huge ass reaction. They go ""MARRIED?! MARRIED???!"" like soulja. Then they start asking me a lot of questions and I don't blame them. It's always a huge deal, you know bc of the whole young marriage thing. They make comments about how young we are and everything. It's so much easier to refer to him as my boyfriend. All my friends and fam know we're married. I tell strangers and the kids at camp he's my boyfriend. He's all over my social media pages, I love him and I'm not ashamed.

So, I volunteer at a day camp and it was the last day. He wanted to come down and meet the kids. The kids (aged 13-17) asked if that was my boyfriend. I said yes, and he said that he's actually my husband. They went ""HUSBAND?"" in the soulja voice. I said ""I wasn't trynna hide my husband from the camp, I was hiding the camp from my husband"". Everybody laughed, but my husband. Then some of the girls called us ""goals"", and that's another reason I don't call him my husband. I don't think that they should be married in a few years. Especially not to the dumb boys they're dating now. We're the exception and def not the rule. I have a lot of influence over them (the older girls especially) and I don't want our relationship to be the standard they set for themselves.

In the car, he asked why I called him my boyfriend. He thought it was a slip, but I told him I wasn't. He asked if I always told people I'm his boyfriend, and I honestly told him I mostly do. He thought I was ashamed of him or being married to him. He wants to tell everyone in the world that I'm his wife and loves being able to say that. He was really tight about it.

**EDIT: We talked ab it again this morning and I apologized for everything**

**I hated like I was being grilled by total strangers. I hate making my husband feel hurt even more. For him, it wasn't about a title. It was about me downplaying the place he has in my life and feeling like I'm not proud to be with him**

**It's hard to tell people ""no""/say boundaries, especially when the person in question is much older. I realized it was an incredibly immature thing to do.  Part of being mature means learning to say no and stand your ground. I'm trying harder to that. Until I get there, I'll deal with all the reactions I get when I call him my husband. Things are good again**

**Also: We didn't get married to access his trust, I only found out he'd have access to it after we got married. We got married because we are committed, love each other and want to spend the rest of our lives together. We just get more time with each other. We also talked about him buying me gifts all the time and how it makes me feel. He said it's just how he shows love and I let him know that I feel loved by him every-time we talk.**

1409,Everyone Sucks,"Background Info: In my history class we recently got a group project of 4 that makes up 80% of our grade. 

Now here’s the tea, me, two of my friends and one other girl (Who I’ll call L) had to join to make it 4. The project was assigned Wednesday and L got sick on Thursday causing her to miss school on Thursday and Friday.

Now here’s the important part, the project is 100% online meaning she could’ve done it at home but she said she,” Didn’t feel up to it”. Our teacher said when talking about the project he said if one of us doesn’t do our part that person would get a failing grade if we tell him. 

Today I stayed after class and informed the teacher that me and my friends (We all agreed to it prior)  think she is dodging work. My teacher said give her until tonight to prove herself,and we even previously made plans to get on the project at the same time, however the log is blank with her name written nowhere on it. 

I guess she overheard our conversation with the teacher and decided to send some of her friends to call me and my friends assholes. Even my parents think I’m in the wrong.

Ex: him not seeming to care (I was in a car accident all he responded with is ""alright"", him ignoring me for two days because he was ""busy"" when in reality he was just playing video games , etc). But yesterday was one of the biggest fights we've had because like the title suggests he called me another girls name over text.

It started off very simple with him texting him good morning me saying the same thing back, both of us asking each other how we are and what we were doing and if we had any plans. Then the communication just cut off for about two hours and he suddenly text me ""ur cute btw ;).""  And to me this didnt seem very suspicious maybe a bit weird but not suspicious. So I say ""thanks ur not so bad yourself"" and this is where the shit show starts. He responds with ""no problem [girls name here] 💕💓."" Obviously taken aback I say this girls name with a question mark and he starts to explain himself and that he was thinking about her while texting me so he got our names mixed up. I thought this was a bs excuse and told him this and he said that ""I can't really take back what I text so I'm not sure what you expect me to do"" and then proceeded to leave the convo after about 30 more minutes of back and forth arguing. Now at this current second I can't help but wonder if I was overreacting and should have taken his word for it. So reddit AITA for how I reacted?

1413,Not the A-hole,"I work for a company that’s a really small team of 8 that provides entertainment to hotels and special events. Needless to say, the work atmosphere is really nice and a lot of fun. 

We sometimes enjoy pranking each other, my boss included. It’s not something we do every single day, but it’s just good fun and it’s brings in some chuckles, especially on those tough days. 

Anyway, a few days ago, I asked him if he knew that you could fit a baby hippo in your hands. He thought it was ridiculous, of course, so I sent him [this image](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hairless-guinea-pigs-baby-hippos-6-5cc024fe4d98c__700.jpg) of a hairless guinea pig. The dude was so pumped about it and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Before I could tell him it was a joke, he moved on to work related stuff, so I kinda forgot about it and thought that he would too. 

Fast forward to yesterday, he had a meeting with a client that was an affiliate with a massive potential client. If we got them and if they were happy, they’d use us for this massive event. 

Anyway, my boss, for some reason, tells one of the guys at the meeting about the hippo thing. The guy didn’t believe him, so he showed him the image I sent him, and the guy said that it was a hamster and that his kids had one once. I think he meant guinea pigs, but I digress.

So my boss comes back from this meeting, he’s furious at me for this because it made us look like morons. The guy he brought this up to was some high up dude that worked for massive potential client. 

I asked him why he even brought it up in the first place, but I suppose the fact that I was a bit bewildered at what I thought was a comical scenario (that he even brought this up at all) didn’t go down well with him, so he reprimands me in front of the team and gives me a lecture about there being a time and place to joke around and to be serious. 

I agree with what he’s saying, but I was also under the impression that at the time I told him about the hippo thing, it wasn’t totally inappropriate. It’s not like I’m the office prankster that does this all the time, or that I set him up to bring it up in his meeting. 

I feel like he’s just mad at me for embarrassing himself, but if I’m the asshole, I’d like to know. I’ve already apologized to him for telling him that, I didn’t feel like I needed to, but did it just because it obviously upset him and we’re pretty tight knit so it sucks to have bad friction in the office. 

Anyway, what’s your call? Was I the asshole?

Edit: just also wanted to add, we don’t know if we had a successful pitch, so I’m not sure if this affected our chances or anything. We’ve just got to wait for/follow up in a few days and see if they want to proceed with us or someone else.",57,300,0.95
1414,No A-holes here,"So before the story, here's some context that is essential. I (21M) am ethnically Indian even though I've lived my life in the U.S. and because of my parents being first generation immigrants, I have had a healthy mix of both Indian and American cultures in my life, which I am thankful for. My girlfriend (20F) is an extremely beautiful white American with blonde hair. We both met and are still in college in Northern California.

So, onto the story. For our two year anniversary, we decided to do a weekend trip to LA to go to Disneyland, something saved up for since we're still college students. 

Here's where the issue begins. Throughout the day at Disney, every time I walked past another Indian couple or group, I would be getting nasty stares. Fine, whatever, I love her and she loves me so I'm not going to let a few looks get inside my head too much, but still, it wasn't the best feeling in the world.

When we were in line for one of the rides with a longer than normal wait time, we had an Indian family right in front of us. There were the couple, and their two children, a guy who seemed to be high school age and a girl that seemed around middle school. 

Immediately, the wife noticed that I was holding my girlfriend's hand and shot me a look. I was kinda getting used to it at this point, but then she decided she wanted me to be an example to her children.
In Hindi (which I speak) she immediately went onto a rant about how I was what was wrong about Indians in America now and that she couldn't stand it. I noticed the boy was kinda worried and embarrassed and asked her in Hindi about what if I understood her, to which she said ""anyone like us that dates white women is a failure to our parents and can't speak Hindi"". At this point I was visibly upset, and my girlfriend noticed and asked what was wrong. I didn't want to get into it, especially because we've faced situations like this before and it leaves us both feeling shitty, something that I didn't want to take away from our trip. So I let it go.

Later, back at our hotel, my girlfriend again asked me why I seemed so angry in that line, and after bugging me for a bit, I calmly explained it to her. She got upset at me that I wouldn't tell her, and thought that I didn't want to bring it up to her because I was embarrassed about dating her. She's quite upset with me at the moment, and I'm really wanting to explain it was because I didn't want to ruin our day at Disney, but she said she just wanted some space right now. I really love her and I don't know if I'm the asshole for not telling her about it originally instead of waiting till she kept asking to finally tell her. My friends think I should've told her right away, but I was just trying to make our (personally for us) rather expensive trip a good time.

TL;DR: I, an Indian, and my girlfriend, a white woman, were racially abused in line at Disneyland in Hindi, and I didn't tell her right away what they were saying.",225,1169,0.95

I have a good relationship with my MIL and my SOs family. However, in my opinion they tend to overstep their boundaries at times. I try to be as honest as possible but if it’s something I can avoid confrontation on, I do.

Lately though I feel since being pregnant my emotions may be getting the best of me? My MIL bought a crib for her house for MY baby. She didn’t say she was buying a crib, and it’s in her teenage son’s room. I feel bad for my SOs little brother and it bothers me immensely that they bought a crib without telling us.

To make matters worse it’s a used crib, and it looks like it sways. I didn’t say anything the day I saw it but the more I think about it the more anxiety I’m feeling about this. I did tell them the day of that we were buying a pack n play with a bassinet so there is no need for them to have a crib like this. But honestly I don’t want my baby in that crib at all and it doesn’t seem like the crib is going anywhere.

While I’m not planning on visiting their house for at least a few months, I feel really uncomfortable because I do want them to be a part of my baby’s life and I’m sure they would be happy to provide childcare as needed, but I can’t help but feel that if they’re doing this now, that it may happen much more often once the baby is born and beyond.

Today I went out to pick him up lunch even though I wasn’t going to get anything because I thought it would be nice. While I was out, he called me to inform me I hadn’t properly flushed the toilet and that there was still poop inside of it.

As you can imagine, I was mortified. I am so uncomfortable with pooping at his house to begin with that I used to wait until I got home to poop even for weekend-long stays. I told him I didn’t mean to do that and that I was sorry. The toilets at my house are much more powerful so it’s just a habit to barely press down on the handle. I’m highly aware of that and 99% of the time I check to make sure everything has flushed when I’m at his house but obviously today I forgot.

He proceeded to emphasize how gross it was that I did that and that I need to “figure it out.” I told him it was extremely embarrassing for me and I would never do it on purpose. Then he proceeded to text me a picture of the toilet after he had half-cleaned it and it was still dirty. I was so embarrassed that my stomach dropped and I immediately deleted our text conversation so I didn’t have to look at it.

I told him I was upset with the way he handled the situation and he says it’s not a big deal and that I’m overreacting. I cry when I argue which is a huge flaw but I try my best to stay calm. I couldn’t keep it under control because I felt like he really wasn’t considering my feelings or taking me seriously. 

Plain and simple, my feelings are hurt. I feel like he (more than I) turned a small situation into a larger one and now he’s making me feel like I’m overreacting.

Obviously, all these things done by someone of full cognitive ability is nothing short of pure evil. My dilemma is I’ve never met the guy. I don’t know his level of functionality and what he is capable of being responsible for when it comes to his decisions and actions. My mom, while she has her disabilities when it comes to learning, paying bills, etc. she is more than fully capable emotionally and empathetically to be responsible for her actions and she’s the sweetest person in the world for it. But, as stated I don’t know my dad and I want to give the benefit of the doubt and just say he was pushed into something he couldn’t comprehend or handle. But, then the human “son without a dad” side of me wants to think of him as a horrible monster who hurt me and my mother terribly. 

I just discovered this community today and this has poured out of me. Please let me know what y’all think. Thank you all for reading this. I appreciate your advice and support. 

TL;DR: My mom and dad are both mentally handicapped. My dad beat and starved my mom while she was pregnant with me and then signed his rights away before I was born. I never met him so I don’t know the severity of his disabilities or if he can even be held accountable for his actions.

1426,Not the A-hole,"Okay so here’s a little context. It was my younger daughters 19th birthday two days ago and I learned just learned that next week she made plans with her girlfriends to go to a night club to celebrate (the drinking age here is 19 so this will be her first time). My 19 year old is a bit introverted and shy and is pretty new to the party scene. I also need to mention that she’s never had a boyfriend and I am pretty sure she is a virgin. My older daughter who is 24 is very close with her and she’s where I get all my intel from. 

Anyway, a few hours ago she told me that the birthday girl has made plans with her 5 girlfriends, who want to take her out to a club to “get f’ed up and get f’ed”, and naturally this would be her first time doing either of those things I get immediately concerned. Before my older daughter even finishes telling me the whole story my husband appears out of freakin nowhere and yells “she wants to do what now?!” Neither of us expected him to overhear us so she instinctively and quickly leaves the room.

He immediately begins protesting about how stupid of an idea the whole thing is and while I don’t completely disagree with him, given that this will literally be her first time and what she expects to happen might not necessarily be what will actually happen. But still, she’s 19 years old and I don’t think it will be appropriate for either of us to interfere in her private life. My husband mentions that he’s gonna talk some sense into her but I immediately shut him up by telling him that hes not in the position to control the private life of a grown woman. To which he angrily replies, “so now I’m not allowed to give my own daughter advice?” And I told him to just stay out of it. He makes just about the maddest look I’ve ever seen him get, says he’s going for a drive and leaves. 

Am I an asshole for keeping my husband from interfering in her plans or is there some rationality about wanting my daughter to make her own decision about whether or not she wants to go through with it?",181,51,0.83
1427,Not the A-hole,"Basically I live with my brother and when he does laundry he *always* leaves his clothes in the dryer. When he needs something from there he goes and gets that article of clothing and gets the rest. He only empties the dryer when he has another load of laundry to do, so it is perpetually full of his shit. His bedroom is near the laundry room so I guess he figures it's his personal clothing storage.

In addition, he doesn't have any baskets or anything. So when I go to laundry and all his clothes are in the dryer I have to either tell him to move them (if he's home) or lug the pile of clothes into his bedroom and throw them on his bed myself. He *does* actually have two laundry baskets but they're in his room full of ""clean"" clothes, since he never actually puts his clothes away.

After going literally years of never opening the dryer and finding it ready to use I told him the next time he left his stuff in there I was just pulling it out and dropping it on the floor, and that I was tired of bringing it to his room for him. He laughed and thought I was bluffing.

Sure enough, I went to do laundry last night and the dryer was full of his stuff. I opened the dryer, pulled it all out, and dropped it right on the floor of the laundry room.

He got home and had a fit because he was about to go on a date and now his clothes were ""dirty"". Our laundry room has a cement floor that's mopped regularly, it isn't dirty per se, though it can be dusty and have some bits of lint or something. Anyway, he's upset that I dropped the wrinkled clothes that had been sitting there for hours on the ground just like I said I would and now he's acting like a bitch about it. He called me a lazy piece of shit for not wanting to constantly move *his* clothes.

Am I in the wrong here? Was there another way I could have handled this?",18,29,0.86
1428,Not enough info,"Me wife and I have always worked 2-3 part time jobs for 6 months so we could travel for the next 6 months. 


When we had kids, we cut back on the travel once school started. However, we maintained a 6 months on, 6 months off work schedule.


During the 6 months, we work a ton which means we rely on school, daycare and a part time nanny for our kids during these 6 months. When we take off from work they have 6 months of uninterrupted time with us. We coordinate it with their summer break so we have as much time with them as possible. My wife and I also don’t quit/start working again at the same time so the kids usually get about 8 months of no childcare needed. 



My mom HATES that we live like this. We don’t rely on her for childcare but she thinks it’s terrible that we spend 6 months working so much. 


So reddit AITA for working a lot half of the year so we can have the rest of the year off?


Edit to add a rough idea of our schedule 



Our schedules vary year to year and they aren’t exactly consistent. I’ll try to put one together that makes the most sense.


We work mon-thurs(or Friday if the job will let us do full time) 9-5. We never work Monday nights, that’s just always been our guaranteed night off.


We flip schedules each week for our night jobs(usually serving positions)


One week I will work Wed and Fri night while she works Tues and Thurs night. The nanny doesn’t work this week since we are able to swap. 


The next week we’ll both work Wed and Fri so we can have Tues and Thurs off as a family. On wed and fri of this week, we only see the kids in the morning. 



We usually work an early morning breakfast shift at a restaurant on Saturday and Sunday. The kids are with the nanny as soon as they wake up and we return home anywhere between noon and 3pm(one of us is usually off no later than 1). If we don’t have any plans or our older one is at a sleepover, we might pick up a Saturday night shift.


Kids are 6, 4, and 2.",48,49,0.92

1430,Everyone Sucks,"Our young daughter has been taking a medication that has made her lose quite a bit of weight. Her weight has been below the “underweight” BMI for some time, and we’ve been worried about her. It’s been a goal to add quite a bit more calories to her diet, and put some weight on her.

Though we’re both very concerned, my wife’s been the much more vocal one, talking to her friends a lot about the issue and bringing it up concernedly throughout the day. She’s even made some posts in our community Facebook group talking about our daughter’s weight issue and asking for advice on the situation. 

Personally, I dislike this a TON; I feel that posting such private things on social media is trashy and a violation of our daughter’s privacy. Frankly, I’m not even okay with her talking to friends about it as much as she does.

But here’s the bizarre thing - it seems like every opportunity to give my daughter a high-calorie meal or put some weight on her, my wife shoots down. She often turns down my daughter’s requests for extra food, seconds, or to get a large instead of a small or medium. She’ll still enforce the “no hour before dinner” snacking rule as vigilantly as she did before. And she’s continued to take away treats/dessert as punishment when she misbehaves.

The cognitive dissonance has flabbergasted me, and the last straw was on Friday. My daughter, after her first week of school, was supposed to get a large milkshake at a local ice cream place. I was really enthusiastic about this, as it was a terrific opportunity to add weight to our daughter. But I was unhappy to find out, upon arriving home, that my wife had not taken her to get the shake, as punishment for some misbehavior at school that day that her teacher reported.

I got furious at her. “So you’re going to starve our daughter as punishment for acting up at school? What type of shit mother are you?” I told her that she must be “stupider than a rock” if she thinks that she can take away my daughter’s meals/treats and think she can put on weight.

I angered her the most by accusing her of deliberately trying to keep our daughter underweight. I emphasized how much she has been venting to her friends about our daughter’s weight and putting it on social media, and said that I now think she just likes the attention and sympathy of having an underweight daughter. “Munchausen-by-Proxy’s what they call it, those fucked-up mothers that make their kids sick for attention; and you’ve got it in spades,” I said to her. “You sick fuck.”

My wife has barely spoken to me since the incident, and I have yet to apologize. Though I don’t literally think my wife has Munchausen, I feel she deserved the rage she got. I’m not the sort of spineless husband who will make an apology he doesn’t really mean just to keep the peace or get back into his wife’s good graces; I’ll stand by what I said and not back down.

Now, being honest I like the cat. She's sweet to us, but also terrorizes our current cat. They don't get along. With her being a stray, we also have to get her spayed and get her shots up to date. My roommate is now asking us all to split the bill for it. We all *like* the cat, but as far as I know none of us were asked about keeping it. I don't want to pay for anything besides food (Because my ferret and our current cat eat the same stuff so we switch off buying it). I told her this as much, and she got pouty saying how it was everyone's duty because we all like the cat, we pet the cat, we play with the cat.

1438,Not the A-hole," 

I got home yesterday at around 6:30 PM and found my roommate, who is a very good friend, had invited over. But there's more, she had brought her 2-3 year old boy who was pretty adorable. Now keep in mind that I am a parent myself of a 3 year old boy and a 5 year old boy, so I'm VERY protective of kids so I might be overthinking things, but I don't think I am.

When I got there they had the kid sitting in the family room watching childrens shows, but the tv was muted and she had her music blasting really loud instead. now this music was, in my opinion, music that a 2-3 year old boy shouldn't be listening to for at least 10-13 more years. As an example, when Korns ""yall wanna single"" came on, she goes omg I love this one and turns it up even louder, to the point where we can barely hear each other talk.

Now I want to point out that my friend was pretty drunk at this point so I don't think he even realized anything was going on with the child because I know he wouldn't have been ok with it either, having a 2 year old and a 3 year old himself.

Around 8 PM I went and hid in my room cause she annoyed me, and for the next 2 hours I would say about 90% of the time this little boy was crying, and she either ignored it or would scream at him to shut up. He then went quiet, and about half an hour later I heard them go up to his room. I went out to see what happened to the boy and I saw him curled up in a little ball on the floor next to the couch in just a diaper. The ceiling fan above him was on and he was freezing to the touch, so I put a blanket over him but otherwise didn't want to move him.

I went over and I'm doing the dishes for about 10 minutes when I hear him wake up and start crying. I sat there for about 30 seconds to see if she was going to come down and take care of him, but when she didn't I went over to him and told him everything was gonna be ok and put my arms out to see if he'd let me pick him up, and he basically ran right into my arms. I rocked the little guy to sleep and held him for probably 5-10 minutes because I had a sneaking suspicion that he doesn't get much physical parental cuddles from mommy and all kids need that. I then laid him on the couch and put the blanket back over him.

WIBTA if I called CPS? the reason I haven't yet and the reason I have been going back and forth in my head all day is because...well I've read and heard way too many horror stories about the system, and wonder if he would really be better there. I also know that she got full custody and if she was a BETTER option for that child, the dude must have been a piece of shit. (granted the system doesn't always work in that case, my kids are with my ex wife most of the time and she is almost as bad as this woman was)

needless to say I wasn't able to sleep much last night. 

Please help, I'm torn.

1439,No A-holes here,"So recently my girlfriend of 1 year got mad at me and heres why (We are both 24 years old), Ill try to explain as simple and understandably as possible.  Basically we were spending a weekend at my parents house and looking through old memory stuff of me when I was a child, pictures, memorabilia, etc, but also there was a bunch of old tapes home video stuff dated from the 2000s.  after doing alot of digging, we found some videos with no labels on them and began watching them with my gf, I didn't really remember what I had recorded, the videos were from the late 2000s and were pretty random dumb shit I did during sleepovers with friends.

&#x200B;

But one of the videos was different, It was dated from 2007, when I was 12 years old, and involved me and my friends (sidenote I do not talk to or hang out with these friends at all anymore, and haven't seen them in probably 8 years) during one of our many sleepovers, playing halo 3 on xbox online, all gathered around the TV in the basement.  In the video my childhood friends and I were basically being the stereotypical troll edgelords into the microphone, saying alot of slurs and profanities, shouting at other players in game, trolling behavior, that kind of stuff.  My girlfriend at first thought it was funny and cute but then on the video I and my friends said the N-word on the video her attitude changed.  

&#x200B;

After the video she was noticeably less talkative and receptive, I asked her if she was upset at me or anything and she gave a relatively short answer and was like ""Its just really shocking to see you saying such heinous things.""  and also ""there were other people in that game who could have heard you and you could have been very hurt""  Its important to note that I am not anything like I was when I was a dumb kid, I would never use any such offensive languages as an adult or even teenager.  I tried to explain to her that I am nothing like I was when I was a 12 year old, among other things but she still didn't seem receptive

So thats the situation, please leave judgement with explanation as I do want to understand and I am open minded to your thoughts on this situation.",96,89,0.93
1440,Not the A-hole,"My sister was caught stealing money from my father’s room by my father. She was lying to him telling him she was looking for his insulin since he struggles with diabetes. His insulin was sitting right on his bed counter and he pointed that out before he cussed her out. I left the house with my father because we had to go an take care of some financial manners regarding my car. We returned a few hours later and we saw luggage bags filled by the door. My sister came out and told us she was moving out with her boyfriend. She didn’t try to apologize about anything..

A little background on my sister: She just graduated from high school and has taken no initiative to do anything with her life. She doesn’t have a job, a bank account, or any type of ID/drivers license. Her main source of income was begging from my dad and stealing from him. She’s his favorite child so she always got stuff from him.

Anyway, other family in the house tried to convince her not to leave and if she really wanted to leave to go into the military or college, which she denied doing. 

I visited her and her boyfriend a day ago and she seemed extremely happy and told me she’s never coming back home and if it doesn’t work out with this guy, she’ll just ask friends to take her in. I tried telling her shes making a big mistake but she cut me off saying I didn’t know what I was talking about and she’s grown so I need to back off and mind my business. It was overall very awkward.

Earlier today, she called asking for money, food, and female hygiene products. She said her boyfriend’s family doesn’t supply much. I went and bought the products but I didn’t give them to her. They are just sitting in my room. I know this assholish but I feel like she made this bed in a way.

1442,Not the A-hole,"My SIL is due in 3 weeks and I've managed to avoid seeing her in-person since March. I didn't attend her shower this past weekend (but we did order her $500 worth of baby stuff). I'm working through it with a counsellor, but I have a lot of built up anger/resentment revolving around my own repeated second trimester miscarriages. My SIL never acknowledged my pregnancies, my hospitalization during them for high risk issues and then my losses at around 18 weeks. My husband received one text from her on our second loss - and that was it. There's been a whole lot more water under the bridge since then, but that's the crux of it. My disdain for her volatile, shitty behaviour has only increased.

It's futile to say anything because my SO's family constantly see my SIL as a victim. It's literal decades of unbreakable codependency with her parents - her mom is very similar with the martyrdom traits. She lives with them now, so we basically have zero relationship with SO's parents because SIL is ever-present and very territorial over her relationship with them. And once baby comes, that will be another awkward barrier. I have zero plan on what to do when the baby comes, as I can't avoid forever.

Here's the catch though: I am extremely good Aunt to my brother and sister's kids. Like the best Aunt. And my in-laws know this about me and I believe they fully expect me to be the same. I do not avoid kids; just SIL's kid it seems. My bro and sis have been all-stars through the my recent rough years, so that could be a telltale sign why I feel comfortable with their kids. 

AITA for not being able to withstand maintaining a close relationship with my soon-to-be nephew?

1445,No A-holes here,"Obligatory ""I know how the title sounds"". No throwaway since bf doesn't really use Reddit.

I've been in a lovely relationship with ""Jim"", who is in the military and stationed in my area, for about a year. We're very compatible and have had discussions of our future, namely bc he is being deployed overseas starting next March. However, he'll really be leaving in October to go to school for training before going overseas. 

Jim has had his dog ""Buck"" for about four years, and  Jim loves him more than anything. He's a wonderful dog and very well-behaved -- doesn't have accidents inside, doesn't bark, etc. When Jim went to basic training for 4-5 months, he had his parents take care of Buck, but when Jim came back, Buck wasn't in good shape (according to Jim). I can say that whenever we've visited Jim's parents (6 hour drive from me), Buck always gets fleas, but even besides that Jim's parents aren't the most reliable. But they don't abuse Buck, from what I've seen, and they love him even if they don't have the resources or total willingness to take the best care of him.

So Jim asked if I could take care of Buck starting in October when he leaves. Initially I said yes, because I love Jim and Buck, and I want him to be well treated. My campus doesn't allow pets unless they're for disabilities, but I talked briefly to my roommates and they seemed willing to share a space with Buck, provided he doesn't interrupt their sleep or studying. However, today when I met with my psychiatrist (to see if she could sign off on Buck being an ""emotional support animal"" -- I have depression and anxiety) she told me that she didn't think it was a good idea for me or Buck. I have a ton of responsibilities this semester (classes, applying to grad schools, taking the GRE, working two part-time jobs on campus) and winter is when my mental health does poorest, so my psych thought Buck would give me a lot more stress. And after we discussed it, I agreed with her -- I don't know how Buck will act once Jim is gone, and I can't 100% guarantee he won't be disruptive to my roommates.

I called Jim to tell him this and let him know that he'd probably have to leave Buck with his parents for ~8-9 months (until I know where I'm going to grad school and can figure out my schedule, pet-friendly housing, etc). He got quiet, and when I asked if everything was ok, he snapped ""yeah, I guess I'll just have to let Buck suffer with my parents."" He wasn't responsive to me trying to discuss the situation further -- he kept insisting it was fine but clearly sounded upset/mad. So now I'm in a dilemma: I don't want Buck to be neglected, and I don't want Jim to worry about Buck while he's gone, but I also feel I need to look out for my mental health and future outside of Jim and Buck.

tl;dr: I agreed to take care of bf's dog while he's deployed, realized it'd be too big a responsibility for me, now bf is upset that the dog has to go to his unreliable parents. AITA?",49,28,0.79

While this gives the adjoining back yards an ""open"" feel, I value my privacy. Installing a privacy fence is allowed within the local laws and ordinances. 

I don't mind paying for the whole fence, and my mind is made up about getting it. I don't see the point about getting their opinions on something that I'm still going to do, but some of my family disagrees.

1454,Not the A-hole,"My coworkers and I have been on a pretty stringent schedule lately and don't have much time to ourselves. We work Monday-Saturday. Recently one of my coworkers decided to plan a trip to our local pool on Sunday (our one day off). Everyone from our little group was invited but I declined. I figured I would use my Sunday to relax by myself without the hassle of driving to and from the pool and seeing the same people I see all week. So I end up not going and I keep getting shit for it the entirety of the next week about how my ""productive"" Sunday could have been just as productive if I had gone to the pool with them and done my own personal stuff afterward. I explained that me deciding to have alone time and saying that I simply ""didn't want to go"" didn't need anymore explanation when asked for my reasoning when declining the invitation. 

Fast forward to this past weekend, the same coworker planned the same trip and invited me again. I opted against going again in order to have some ""me"" time. Once again, I was asked why over and over. I finally blew up a bit and said ""is it too much to ask for some alone time??"" 

I feel like this coworker is mad at me. 

Just to give a bit of backstory, my coworkers hung out a ton before our schedules changed so it's not like I have a track record of declining invitations to outings with them.

1457,Not the A-hole,"I am the groom and now husband (married for 3 months)

Wife's parents, MIL and FIL , offered a deal: They will help pay for the wedding , in exchange that they will give the various business opportunities (photographer etc) to clients of their small mom-and-pop consulting firm. Wife and I accepted.

For reference, MIL and FIL are extremely nice and generous people who never start trouble or arguments and always give tons of presents on every occasion.

During the wedding, the photographer employed by the photography agency was rude. Examples [do not fit in the 3k character limit]. This was corroborated by multiple guests and by bride. I didn't like it but I was ready to just let it go.

Anyways. The wedding was successful.

A few days after the wedding, I wanted to see the photos. I asked wife, who reported they were ""not ready yet"" and ""still editing"". This seemed a little strange to me, because for my proposal photos (for which i hired an independent highly-reputed agency) they came out pretty much right away via a file-sharing link where I could get all of them immediately. So in this case, i asssumed some delay: I shrugged and went on about my business.

About 1 month after the wedding, I had less patience. I went to the web site of the wedding photography agency, and saw that they were only sharing a few ""preview"" low-res photos. I posted a question in their ""comments/questions form"" asking for the full set in digital format.

No response for 3 days.

I then sent an email to whatever email addresses I could find on the web site, repeating this and asking why there was no response.

No response for 3 days.

Finally out of patience, I copied FIL and MIL on another email to the agency addresses, repeating the whole story and expressing dissatisfaction. I requested some kind of expected work completion date.

The agency still did not respond. however, FIL responded and said to me that I ""can't ask them rude questions like this"".

Intimidated, I stayed quiet for a while.

Some 2.5 months after the wedding, there is still 0 communication from the agency.

During a vacation with wife, FIL and MIL, wife brings it up, expressing her dissatisfaction about all this.

At this point, FIL becomes full-blown angry. He says, and I quote, to me (groom):

""You messed up by sending that email! They give us [large amount of $] business! The agency owner's wife was so upset by you! The contract said that there was to be NO CONTACT by the wedding couple!!""

I say, ""That sounds very strange. I had no idea that there was any such terms in a contract of service for photography. Moreover I am not aware of ever having interacted with the agency owner's wife or the owner himself.""

Again, wife and I relent and drop the subject because it seems to cause so much anger and be un-resolve-able.

To this day there remains no sign of the photos. :|

So a few days ago, we found a huge leak in our water pipe, and have been keeping the main water line off, unless we need to shower and what not, until its fixed. Not only is it expensive to keep on, but the leak goes straight to our neighbors back yard, which sucks.

So today we turn it on at 6:30 am. She falls back asleep and now its 7:30, water still on. I go to her room wake her up. She starts school at 8:30. We live about 20 minutes away. Now its 8:20. I go and see what's going on, and shes just sitting in her room, putting on shoes or something I say let's go we're late. She says 5-10 min. I go to wait in the car. 

She finally comes and I am irritated at this point and tell her that I will not be giving her rides if I have to hold her hand for everything. 

She gets mad and asks how I'm even holding her hand. I get pretty mad at this point and angrily explain.

1461,Not the A-hole,"Going to try and keep this short! Recently, I switched from pursuing a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology to pursuing a M.S. in Environmental Science. There were many reasons behind this, but the biggest was that I was completely burnt out in my previous program. I only joined the program because I couldn't find a job with my B.S. in Psych. Ever since I joined, however, my parents have been bragging to everyone that they have a daughter who's getting a Ph.D.

When I switched, I didn't tell them (I told them 2 days ago, right after my first semester started). There were a lot of reasons behind this. One, I wanted to make sure I started successfully and had gotten everything figured out. Two, I knew they would disapprove. Their favorite insult for me since I was a small kid is ""tree-hugging liberal hippie"" and they adamantly don't believe that environmental science is a legitimate field. I actually wanted to pursue that as my undergraduate degree, but because they took out Parent PLUS loans for me and threatened to cut me off if I switched to that path (\~10k worth over 4 years, if that matters) I didn't.

I let them know 2 days ago, just to keep them in the loop. They went absolutely nuts on me, saying that I should have informed them so that they could change my mind. There was also a lot of talk about how I have absolutely wasted my life (I'm 24 right now), that I'll never get a job, that I've turned into a nutjob, etc. I tried to reason with them that I had my reasons for hiding it, and that I had only just started the program. But everytime I've tried to talk to them since they refuse to respond to me, and my sister has told me that they keep complaining about it at home.

AITA for not telling them about my program change?

1463,Everyone Sucks,"Basically when I met my girlfriend she had this best friend who was literally attached to her hip. It was pretty much a relationship without sex - He'd even ask to do stuff like sleep on the floor in her room because he was 'lonely'. They had known each other for a year but both been in relationships up until about a month prior to me meeting her, when my girlfriend broke up with her ex. He was in a 4 year relationship.

One night they're out for drinks together and he tries to kiss her, she pulls away. He tells her they have an undeniable chemistry and that he'll break up with his girlfriend so they can be together. She tells him she doesn't like him in that way. He breaks up with his girlfriend, tries again, and fails again. Apparently he was gobsmacked that my girlfriend didn't feel the same way.

At this point, a bunch of stuff happens including him skipping uni exams to spend time with her and him 'accidentally' taking ecstasy pills instead of flu tablets in an attempt to stop my girlfriend going to my house. Me and my girlfriend were rocky over these months and he was always her shoulder to cry on, he would tell her how the relationship is clearly not going to work and we sound toxic for each other. As this is going on his ex is messaging him and he's ignoring her.

Things stabilized for us. At this point he asks ""So you guys are proper serious now?"", we say ""yes"".

By some massive coincidence, the two of them stop being such good friends, he starts being cold with her and trying to make other friends. I do feel bad for her over this, because it can't be nice for your ""best friend"" to do this to you. 

He and my girlfriend met up for the first time in about 2 months (they've not been living together as it's been summer break). He told her that him and his ex are finally back together. And that he's not told her about anything that he's done, anything at all.

I couldn't believe it, I feel so sorry for this girl. It shouldn't be his choice that it's ok to live with a girl he was and most likely still is in love with. He's literally living with the girl he tried to cheat on his girlfriend with, the girl he says he's never had a better connection with and the girl he broke up with his girlfriend to try and be with. And she has no idea.

In my opinion his girlfriend gets to choose if what he's done is okay, whether he deserves a second chance and whether she's comfortable with him living with the girl he threw away their 4 year relationship over.

My girlfriend agrees that the guy's a complete prick, but that I need to keep out of it and that she'll be really angry/upset if i say anything, because it could completely fuck up her living situation for the next year.

We both took a fixed amount of spending money, which we spent, and in the airport I had ¥1000 (£7.71, $9.44) and he had ¥800. We both planned to buy some sweets or food in duty free to take back to share around at our offices. Looking around we couldn't find much within our budgets that would work for an office worth of people. We were both fine with this, bringing food offices after holidays isn't a requirement, its just something we thought could be nice.

In the mean time, he found a small toy of a Ghibli character he liked for ¥800, I pointed to a bigger one for ¥1800 and offered to give him the extra ¥1000 for it. He was super happy with this and right now the toy is sitting proudly on our bed.

We walk to the gate, and as I pull out my phone I find an extra ¥1000 note that I must have missed earlier. There is a tiny shop right next to the gate, so I look through and there are boxed of 26 chocolates for ¥303, I buy three boxes in different flavours. I got back to him, let him know that I'd bought some chocolates, and they had more, he replied that he's all out of money so can't do anymore shopping.

So we fly back to England, and spend a few days recovering from jet-lag over the weekend. On the Monday (which is a bank holiday) I start getting stuff ready for work on Tuesday, and I put the chocolates in the fridge, because its warm. He spots them and says that because I have three boxes and they each have 26 chocolates he would like one to bring to his office, I said yes and asked him to let me decide which box he could have. I took a bath and thought about it, and then I went back to him and said that I don't really want him to take in any of the boxes to his office, because I bought them for my office.

Right now he is upset that he won't have anything to bring in, I pointed out to him that yesterday he was fine with not bringing anything for his colleagues, and he said that was because yesterday he didn't have any other options.

I have an employee (this is her last week) we'll call her V who is incredible, she's going to be a loss to the company but she's following her dreams and I couldn't be more happy for her.

She absolutely tore this patron apart stating he was sexist and patriarchy etc. 

So I sent V a text since I'm off site today, if she could please take it down, although it doesn't have his last name on it, his first name is, and our sheets are pretty recognizable as ours even though our brand name isn't anywhere and if she's uncomfortable with our patrons let me know and I can fix the schedule so she doesn't have to finish out her last week.

1468,Not the A-hole,"TLDR: My 96 year old grandpa, who recently broke his hip, took a hard fall and hit his head really hard. He is on blood thinners for some recent blood clots. When I found him his head was visibly bleeding a lot. He was at risk for having a bleed in his brain. He wanted me to just help him up and help him to bed. He couldn’t afford the ambulance ride and was adamant about me not calling anyone. I called 911 anyways and they told me not to move him. So I refused to help him off the floor until paramedics came in a few min.  Should I have just respected his decision and helped him to bed?

Okay so I’ll start off with a little background. I am 19 years old and I am adopted and was raised by my
Great-Grandparents. My grandma is 81 and my grandpa is 96. I live with them still and am their primary caregiver. My grandpa broke his hip about a month ago. He has been using a walker around the house but can’t move like he used to.

Last night I was in bed and heard him fall in the living room hallway. He tripped over a dog toy and fell forward and hit his head very hard on the edge of a table. When I found him his head was visibly bleeding a lot and his arm was bleeding. I was worried about his hip and I was worried about his head. With him being on blood thinners I was worried he could have a bleed inside of his head and we wouldn’t know it. 

He angrily told me to not call anyone and to help him up. He said he couldn’t afford the ambulance bill. I called his other daughter 8 times and she never answered. I called 911 and told them what happened. They told me not to move him because I could injure him. This pissed him off completely. He was screaming at me telling me to go to my room and shut up and that if I didn’t he’d kick me out. Then he was upset because I wouldn’t help him up.

The paramedics arrived and he was nice to them and they told him exactly what I was afraid of. That he could possibly have a bleed in his brain because of the blood thinners and he needs to go to the hospital and get his head looked at. He agreed but of course he blamed me and thinks I shouldn’t have called. 

His head ended up being fine. I just wanted to be safe rather than sorry. I didn’t want him to go to sleep tonight and just not wake up. But ultimately he is an adult of sound mind, so should I have just let him make his own decision? Did I make the right call? AITA?",63,31,0.84

So I've (22F) been seeing this guy (22M) for about 6 months now, official for 2. Lately he's started to suspect me of cheating because I'm unavailable to hang out Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'm not cheating, I just have krav maga those nights and don't want to tell him.

Bit of backstory, when I was a teenager my mum's friend told me about some story she read on the internet about a woman who took self defense, but didn't tell her new partners. She wanted to keep is as a kind of secret weapon, just in case. And apparently it paid off one day. The guy attacked her, and she beat the crap out of him. (keep in mind, this is all some internet story). My mum's friend went on about how it's good that women kept it a secret, because the guy might've attacked her with a weapon instead. Anyway, for whatever reason this really stuck with me, so I started doing krav and never told anyone. No one knows I do krav, except my krav friends.

So the guy I've been seeing is great, and it seems really promising. But I've only known him for 6 months, which I think isn't that long. I really like him, but I dunno. I've only known him for 6 months. And it's not just him I'm keeping this a secret from. It's everyone. 

But yeah. Recently he's noticed I can never hang out on krav nights, and that I never answer my phone between certain times. He asked me if I'm cheating, to which I said no. He got upset, said he didn't believe me and went home.

The thing is, I like having my ""secret weapon"". I'm fairly confident this guy isn't abusive, but people surprise the shit out of you. AITA for not telling him about my krav?

She’s the typical favorite-aunt, lots of bonding, etc type of person. Aunt has 2 kids, who are our cousins, that we’re not especially close to, but we spend a fair amount of time together now that we live 40 minutes apart. When we moved up, the older cousin and his wife were expecting, and they have since had their kid. 

At some point, wife apparently tells aunt that we’re planning on naming our baby Evelynn if it’s a girl, after grandmother. Aunt is excited. Yay. 

Then, the older cousin and his wife have their kid, and name their kid Evelynn. To our knowledge (and coming from aunt, as well) they didn’t really have a name picked out ever, and went with what they thought would be best the day their daughter was born. 

I don’t have a problem at all that they named their daughter Evelynn, after all, Grammy Eve was their grandmother too. My question is this, would we be the buttholes if we went ahead and named our daughter Evelynn too?

1475,Asshole,"My husband is deployed for two years. I was offered a promotion that essentially involves 10-12 hour days with a ton of traveling for the next two years. This would come with a lot more money and the ability to easily relocate and scale back after the two years. 

My husband urged me to take the promotion, as we currently live in a terrible area in a terrible school district and thus would change our lives. We would finally be able to move to our dream area, have an actual house with a garden, and give our daughter the idyllic childhood we never had. My husband would also be retiring from the military with a PENSION, so we could even provide a stay at home parent.

But currently with this and his absence, I cannot take proper care of our four year old daughter, so we've decided that she needs to live with her aunt and uncle for school (pre-K and kindergarten).

I (24F) am currently having issues with my mum (63F) over some petty shit. Sometime last year she brought up to me the topic of me sometimes having a sour breath. As in bad breath. She tought it could be some sign of a throat infection or possibly cancer. I told her it was ridiculous then and that any normal person who spends the whole day eating and leaving their mouth closed for the majority of the day (office job) would have a slightly bad breath at the end of the day before brushing their teeth for the evening, which is when I usually see her in person. 

To be sure I did ask my dentist at my next appointmemt if he noticed bad breath or anything of the sort and he said everything seemed normal. I asked other people and she is the only person saying that. she insists that my stepfather has said the same thing but if he did he probably just agreed so she would shut up and not turn this into some kind of fight which is something she would do. Maybe all those other people were just being sensitive but I think my dentist would've said something. The topic just kinda never came up again for another year which just goes to show that she was just being dramatic imo. 

Now over a year later she messages me asking me all these random questions out of nowhere like if I often feel nauseous or if I pee alot despite not drinking alot or if I am tired alot. I live quite the unhealthy lifestyle functioning on barely 5h of sleep a day so yeah I am tired sometimes but the other things... not really. Then she brings up a slightly sour bad breath again and how it could be a sign of a special kind of diabetes. How she just saw it in a documentary or a report or some garbage. 

A few weeks ago I had my blood tested for unrelated reasons and the only thing my doctor mentioned was a very slight lack of iron but nothing that should get me worried.  Everything else was perfectly fine. She told me to just get it tested again in half a year and include red meat in my meals more often. So I asked my mother if she was serious and I basically said ""I really do not wanna talk about this with you again. I just had my blood tested. Do you think if I had diabetes this would just go unnoticed? You are literally the only person who is saying this."" Just to be sure I did directly ask my boyfriend. He is not one to sugarcoat things and he would get most of my bad breath considering we smooch each other alot. He said he didn't notice anything unusual at all. Yet more proof that my mother is just imagining things.

Now my mum is acting like I insulted her great ancestors simply because I told her to back off and stop bringing this up and making up illnesses. She said ""Wow, you worry about someone you love and this is how you're rewarded."" 

So AITA for telling her off or was my reaction not completely unjustified? Maybe she really was just worrying.",25,29,0.86

1479,Asshole,"Using a throwaway and on mobile. I wrote this fairly quickly, so apologies for any errors.

My husband and I have three children, 10f, 14f, and 17m. We are a pretty athletic and active family. My husband and I both have coached soccer since we graduated college. All three of our children play soccer competiovely, and the older two also play for their high-school. Combined, they also play basketball, tennis, and track. Needless to say, we are all extremely busy during sports seasons.

My 14 year old decided she also wanted to try out for high-school cheerleading, which was new for her. She made the squad and is really enjoying it so far. And thankfully, most of her cheerleading will be on Friday nights for football games so she can do both her fall sports without much overlap. We are a part of a small school district, so we all very much encourage sharing athletes and playing multiple sports. The only issue is that Fridays for the past few years have been the only evening my husband and I can really see each other and spend time together, and so we don't plan on going to every single football game to watch our 14y/o cheer. We will go to every competition and quite a few home games. We went to the last two games and enjoyed our daughter cheering and having fun, but there will be some Fridays that we want to spend at home. My daughter thinks that since we go to every home and away game for other sports we should also come to every home and away game for football to watch her cheer. This is where I might be the asshole, I don't think just cheering at a game is the same as a cheerleading competition or a game that she, herself, is playing in. She got angry at my husband and I when I told her we aren't going to be there this Friday. There were tears and door-slamming and she accused us of only caring about soccer. While we both coach soccer, my husband and I have been extremely supportive and encouraged our kids to do whatever activity or sport that makes them happy. 

AITA for not wanting to go to every football game my daughter cheers at?

EDIT: I didn't tell her that I think her regular cheering is not as important as competitions or games. I told her we have had quite a few long weeks in a row (true) and we were going to stay in this Friday, but would make the next one. Sorry I wasn't clear, I can see how I worded it to sound like I explained my thoughts to her.

EDIT 2: sorry because people keep making the same suggestion to skip away soccer games. I am the girls head coach, and I can't miss soccer games except for emergencies. My husband does the same for the boys and we typically play on Mon/Tue/Thur. We do occasionally miss winter/spring sports events that my other kids play, not just my 14y/o.

UPDATE: I was home with my 11y/o who was sick today, and when 14 y/o came home from school a little bit ago she actually apologized and we talked about everything. We sat down with the football schedule and we talked about which games she really wants us at. Thanks everyone for your comments, though some of you seem a little crazy lol. Fall is an extremely hectic time for all of us and I want to make sure my children feel loved and heard. I think I've just been really craving alone time with hubby because we've had a really rough few weeks, and I brushed off my daughters wants too quickly. I'm going to make sure we all communicate better as the season progresses.14 y/o and I are soon leaving for the soccer fields because we have a big rivalry game tonight. Thanks again everyone!",359,2179,0.95
1480,Not the A-hole," This happened a few years ago, but I was recently reminded of it and it got me thinking again.  I was working in retail. There was a new girl hired in our department who went through the training and  joined the sales floor, and then started calling in sick and missing shifts regularly. 
 Our manager kept us informed of her reasons, which all seemed to be valid. She was pregnant, but having complications,  then in the hospital, then home recovering, then sick with something else. I went out one Friday night for a friend's birthday and ran into her at a bar. We chatted a bit ""Oh, how are you doing? We miss you at the store...etc."" She tells me she's feeling better and will be back tomorrow. 
 Next day Saturday rolls around and we are doing our weekly all store meeting. Manager says ""Oh, sorry guys you're down 1 again today, she called in sick again."" I turn to my ""friend"" next  to me and say innocently ""Oh that's too bad. I saw her last night and she said she was feeling better and would be in. Guess she's still not feeling good enough to work. I hope she isn't back in the hospital."" Later I'm called into the managers office and grilled. Where did I see her? What bar? What exactly did she say? 
 Later that day, I'm in another department and this one guy starts giving me shit for being a narc and getting the girl in trouble with management. ""Oh, remind me never to go out drinking with you! You'll narc to the bosses!"" I worked at this company for just under 3 years and this guy gave me shit the entire time. 2 years later everyone had forgotten this girl except for this guy who still brought it up. ""Oh it's the guy who got a pregnant girl fired!"" 
  She wasn't fired over this BTW, and did come back for 1 or 2 shifts a few weeks later but was eventually fired under a month later and I'm pretty sure this incident was one of the reasons. Am I the asshole here? Should I have just kept my mouth shut?",26,51,0.85

1482,Asshole,"My girlfriend and I are about to go travelling together for 6 months. There are some vaccinations which are required for the countries (Vietnam, India, Cambodia etc...) we are planning on visiting, and some which are optional.
I have spent $600 on a number of compulsory (as well as some optional) vaccines but chose not to get the optional Rabies Vaccine due to the high cost ($350). My girlfriend did get the rabies vaccine and has on three occasions told me she would prefer if I got it too. 

On the first occasion, we discussed the risks and benefits and I politely explained my reasons for opting not to which she seemed to accept.

She brought it up for a second time and offered to pay for the vaccination herself. Due to the inconvenience associated with the vaccination schedule, and my knowledge that her paying for my vaccination would take a fair chunk (~3%) out of the money she worked hard to save for this trip over the last year, I politely refused for a second time.

On the third occasion (today) she told me she has been worrying about what would happen if I got bitten by a rabid animal and that she would really like me to get the vaccination for her peace of mind. I responded that I genuinely appreciated her concern but explained that I had made my decision on the issue and felt that her repeated attempts to cajole me into getting the vaccination against my wishes were making me feel uncomfortable and controlled.

Was it unfair of me to describe her behaviour as controlling? I realise that probably wasn't the best word to use but I do feel that her (repeated) efforts to convince me into getting the vaccination demonstrated a lack of respect for my right to make the final decisions about my own life. 

thanks

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses - really interesting and helpful. I gave my gf a ring just now and apologised for called her controlling and that I realise it was just her way of trying to look after me. We're gonna split the cost of the vaccine and she seems happy I reconsidered.

EDIT 2: I am actually a doctor and my girlfriend is a pharmacist so we are both very aware of the risks/benefits of the vaccine. For people who are unaware, even those who have had the vaccine still require post-exposure prophylaxis to avoid developing rabies although the course for the vaccinated is simpler and more widely available (see https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/styles/handbook_figure/public/fig_rabies_terrestrial.png?itok=JqFBrHIH )

1483,Not the A-hole,"My (20m) brother (23m) is a dating a guy (also 20) who used to be in my class in school. The kid is ftm trans and has been transitioned for a long time (9+ years). The guy has presented fully male for as long as I've known him and you can't tell he's trans at all. He's around 5'9, has a jawbone to kill and grows a decent about of facial hair. However, he has not told my brother he is trans. In fact, the only reason I know he is trans is because there was a rumour going around school about him being trans, and I asked him directly when they first started dating, in which he confirmed he was but he hates talking about it. 

He and I had a conversation in which the bf said that he saw no need to tell my brother he's trans, as it's not like they're ever going to have biological children together, and he hasn't had to come out since he was like 11 as he has always been lucky enough to pass for male very well. He has had bottom and top surgery. He is also covered in tattoos, and his scars are very hard to see (I saw him shirtless at a graduation pool party a couple years ago). 

I know it's not my business to tell my brother, but he made it clear he is not going to tell him. I feel like this is important knowledge medically, and because I just feel my brother has a right to know. I don't think it would change my brother's opinion of him whatsoever, but I know he might be upset that his bf didn't tell him himself.

1485,Not the A-hole,"I am not a great writer so please forgive me if I make mistakes with grammar and all that. 

Basically I have been doing JiuJitsu for 2 years now. I'm a blue belt and may even make purple belt super early if I do well in tournaments over this next year and keep practicing five days a week. I love it and finally feel like I've found ""my"" thing. One of the classes I go to I'm sort of like an unofficial instructor assistant because it's almost always new white belts in that class. 

About 3 weeks ago I went out on some dates with a guy that I sort of hit it off with. He's very busy and since I train so much we haven't gotten to see much of each other but I really thought he was cool. He asked if he could come watch me at JJ and I said he could probably do a free intro class if he wanted. This was on Saturday. 

So it was all new people and dating-guy wasn't really into it which is fine and there was one other guy with about 6 girls and women. However my instructor was trying to teach an technique where you transition from mount into an arm bar. Basically what you have to do is press really hard with both hands into a persons chest which allows you to swing your body to the side while grabbing their arm to put between your legs. 

The other guy was working really hard but just not getting it so I was watching him and what was obvious is he was afraid of ""copping a feel"" during the chest press and if guys were in the class he'd be having no problems. I told him to come try the technique with me  and after a few times it was obvious that's why he wasn't smooth into the arm bar. I told him ""it's ok if you touch my boobs, I want you to learn the technique."" So he started being a little bit more open to the chest press (and he didn't really touch me beyond normal rolling and sparring) and he did a good white belt version of the arm bar. 

But this really pissed off the guy I am dating. He said that it was disrespectful to me but it was also disrespectful to all women to allow ""hicks"" like that guy free reign to my body. I told him that wasn't even close to what was happening. He said I just don't get it because he's been a progressive all his life and I'm just trying to play ""catch up"" to the boys. I asked him what the hell that had to do with anything. He said hopefully when I graduate college I'll understand as much as he does. I told him I didn't appreciate him talking down to me, he told me not to be so disrespectful to myself and other women. 

I told him to just take me home and I haven't seen or heard from him and don't know if I will but the scene was so weird it just keeps playing through my mind over and over again.

I mentioned how a co-worker's husband spent 6k on an engagement ring and I was like ""yeah, I want to go under that."" My gf looked up the average price of a ring and said it was about 6k and I believe my words were ""yeah, you're not getting that,"" which I admit probably stung but wasn't what I meant.

Then, to compound all this, we got to talking about weddings and I talked about how much money they are and how I didn't want to blow through all my savings just for one day. Then she said ""You know girls plan this stuff since they're, like, 8, right?"" and I said ""Yeah"" and then she went quiet.

She cried off and on all day yesterday and it completely ruined both of our days. At night she said some very scary things and it seemed way too overboard for what had happened.

1490,No A-holes here,"It would be after the actual wedding. My twin brother and his girlfriend are getting married in Paris on 31/8. Me and my girlfriend of 3 years are taking the eurostar there on 29/8, as are a lot of our family and mutual friends. After the wedding, on 1/9 the newlyweds are heading to the South of France for their honeymoon, but me, my girlfriend, my parents, and a few friends have decided (separately) to stay a couple extra days. Me and my girlfriend don't leave until 5/9, our friends leave the day before, my parents leave the day after.

I've asked her about proposing and she said she'd love for me to propose, and she'd say yes, and we agreed to a public proposal. She loves cliches and thinks Paris is really romantic, but she doesn't think I'll propose any time soon (I asked in a way where it could be any time).

I want to take her to the Eiffel Tower on 3/9, just the two of us, and pop the question. I want to do it on that date specifically as our friends and family will all still be in Paris, and she's said she would want to tell them as soon as it happened.

However, this would mean doing it literally 3 days after my brother's wedding. IDK if that's the best idea, but the only reason we can go to Paris is that my parents are paying for everything, IDK when we'll next be able to go.

WIBTA?

EDIT: I asked my brother and he just said ""your proposal, up to you"" but IDK if that actually means he's alright with it. It kind of reminds me of that line in Jurassic Park ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn't stop to think if they should""

Also: my girlfriend and I got together in Paris. We went with some friends (including the ones who will be in Paris on the date), at some point on the first trip we got drunk and admitted we liked each other. We went there as friends and left in a relationship, and had our first date at a cafe near the Eiffel Tower. Admittedly not the most romantic story but it's ours, and proposing in the same place feels right. If we'd gotten together back in England I'd still have gone wherever we had our first date to propose. My brother and his bride have never been. I know they're getting married there but if it's anyone's ""place"", it's ours. Didn't want to say this in case people think I'm trying to reclaim it or some shit, but now people are saying it's my brother and his bride's place, so doing anything there would lose significance to them, and while I know we can't ""claim"" a city, if either couple gets Paris it's just not my brother.

For everyone saying we're already engaged: I asked my girlfriend if when I propose she'd want a public or private proposal and if she'd want it to be a surprise. She said it was my call. I want to take her back to where we got together to propose, so my choices are either the Eiffel tower or a room in a youth hostel, and the tower feels like the more romantic option.

So this is where I'm at: my daughter has PTSD and ADHD. These two don't mix together very well in her case, and she has a lot of behavioral issues. I've tried to help her but this year she's decided to quit her therapy AND medication because she ""can't afford it"". My parents (her grandparents) have offered to help pay since I can't, but she won't hear of it and currently takes out all of her issues on me.

She doesn't get physically aggressive, but she has threatened me, called me all sorts of things and refuses to get along with my boyfriend or ""let"" him stay over. (Much like a toddler holding their breath until they get what they want, she refuses to sleep when he is around, which makes all of her issues worse.) When I stay over at his house she blows up my phone with really upsetting messages and voicemails. She seems very controlling towards me and finds ways to ""punish"" me when I don't do what she wants.

I've tried many things, be assured of that. This is really my last resort. I feel that maybe the ""real world"" would give her some perspective. However, my mom says that kicking my daughter out now will only make things worse, and everyone I've discussed this with seems horrified that I would even consider kicking out my own child, but they all think she's ""very well behaved and sweet"".

1498,No A-holes here,"Hey you fine folks,

Super weird question but I honestly can’t figure out where the higher moral ground is on this one. So for starters, my boyfriend (27), myself(23), and his family which consists of his mom, dad, and brother, are currently on vacation to visit some of his family which also happens to be the same province my family live in.

The first week we were here, we visited his side of the family. We rented an RV and parked it on the road outside of my boyfriends cousins house and that’s where we slept. The second week, my boyfriend and I drove across the province with the car he rented. His family followed close behind in the RV. All was fine, now we’re visiting my family and it hasn’t been going smoothly. We rented a Ford Fusion hybrid, and to be blunt, that thing is fucking tiny in the backseat. There’s five of us, and the brother and dad have very wide shoulders. Only one of them can sit in the back at once or else they would all be squished like sardines. And his brother likes to sit in the middle and *spread his legs open as far as they can go*. Fortunately for me, I was the middle man in that sardine can all for six hours on the road today. We took a road trip to go sightseeing and I was absolutely miserable. I was squished up against the door and my right leg was stuck up on the door step(thing) and it made my back ache for hours because I was so uneven. I felt this was a bit unnecessary, my boyfriend rented the car and it’s my home stretch so I wanted to be in the front seat but I didn’t kick up a fuss because it’s his family.

So here’s the dilemma, on Wednesday, we are all driving back to the original location to drop off the RV and head to the airport. So this drive will consist of me and BF in the car for 8 hours, and his family in the RV where they can get up and move around and stretch their legs. Once we reach the place to drop off the RV, the three of them will hop in the car with us and drive two hours to the airport. Now I want the front seat, plain and simple. I know this is so stupid, but this past week has consisted of non stop road trips where I’m either stuck in the hump seat in the back or squished to the window. I’ve been miserable. So should I say screw them and let them be the sardines so I can enjoy the last hour? 

My defence: they were just in the RV, they can move about as freely as they want and even get up and get food. I’m in one seat sitting on my butt for hours on end and I do not want to get in the back for another two just because they’re hopping in. And my BF did rent it and I’ve paid for most of the gas.

Where I understand I should get in the back: it’s his family, and the men are broad shouldered. His mom is tiny and she “loves being between her two boys!” And it’s only two hours. Suck it up and be a miserable sardine.

Once it tried to escape and fell in our garden and they came looking for it. It could have easily died by that fall. The balcony is filled with poop and urine. Sometimes no one pays attention to it for days. It is only fed and talked to intimidatingly.

1501,Not the A-hole,"My (23m) girlfriend (24f) and I have been dating for a little over a year now, and recently we went to her best friends cousin's birthday party. I'll name the best friend Adam. During the party there was a bunch of family members dancing. My gf and I got up and joined, and while we were dancing all together with Adam and his family members in a circle, Adam took my girlfriend's hand and began dancing with her, spinning her around, etc. 


This made me upset at first but I quickly realized there was just a large cultural difference between Adam and I. Adam is Hispanic and my girlfriend and I are Asian. However Adam did this multiple times throughout the night, sometimes when my gf and I were dancing just the two of us and holding hands Adam would come along and take my gf and begin dancing with her which made me pretty uncomfortable. My girlfriend seemed to be enjoying herself and so I only spoke to her after the party. 



I said that seeing her dance with another person while her and I were dancing  made me uncomfortable, but I understand that Adam and her are close (they've been friends longer than 6 years), and that there's a large cultural difference between us two. I mentioned that the way we were raised differently ended up with us having different opinions on dancing with other people, but there's nothing wrong with that, it's just our cultural differences and the way we were raised. I also said if dancing with Adam really made her happy then that's totally okay, I just want to let her know it makes me uncomfortable, she can do what she wants. 



We both got upset during the conversation and she asked if this means that I don't want to go out with them clubbing. I said, if Adam will abruptly take my gfs hand from my hand and begin dancing with her then I'd rather stay home, I'm just not comfortable with that. This made her upset. I made sure to clarify that I'm not saying she's not allowed to dance with Adam, she can do whatever she wants, but I just wanted to let her know that it makes me uncomfortable, again, because of our different up bringing, not that there's anything wrong with Adam's culture or whatnot.

Later on she told me that she mentioned to Adam that I got upset over him dancing with her at the birthday party. Adam said that I shouldn't be jealous of him dancing with my gf because he's gay. I told my gf that sexual orientation has nothing to do with it, I couldn't care less if he were straight or gay, trans or a woman, or even a unicorn. If anyone takes my gfs hand while I am dancing with her that will make me uncomfortable.

My gf told me that this is making me seem like a jealous possessive boyfriend but I disagree.. Namely because I didn't say ""you're not allowed to dance with anyone else!"" I simply said if she wants to dance with Adam at the club that's fine, since it makes her happy and I want her to be happy, it's just that I will just stay home because that makes me uncomfortable.

I think my mother has done enough to help my uncle, like lending him money, giving him my father's old car,  paying his socil security money. And she didn't tell my father and me every time she gave him money.

This time, my father and  I  strongly rejected and she has been so mad at me.  And my uncle is mad at me as well. Both of them think I am so selfish. I have enjoyed all the good education resources and no letting his daughter to have the same thing.

Am I the asshole?

I absolutely know education is very important for a child. So I have suggested my uncle or his wife to rent an apartment in this city,  so they can take care of their daugter.  Nobody can replace parents' roles. But they just said no.  

My parents are not young any more. Why they have to take this responsibility?  Especially my father is disagree with this. He deserves his own leisure time.",25,64,0.92
1504,Asshole,"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we’re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven’t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what’s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the “secrets” I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying “Just don’t let mom find out” The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out “I cheated on my wife...” At first it didn’t register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife’s travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They’ve both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he’s just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I’ve always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it’s the right thing to do, especially because I’ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it’s none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don’t want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don’t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she’s a close friend. WIBTA?

Edit: I’m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it looks like I was wrong.

1505,Not the A-hole,"Last winter, we had major weather damage due to an ice dam leaking through our roof, attic, and our ceilings. The water damage also seeped into the wood flooring. My MIL who owns the house has been planning to get the damage fixed under home owner's insurance. She was trying to figure out how we were going to schedule movers, painters, carpenters (to re-polish the flooring), and insulators all within the same timeframe.

I don't know what goes on with planning all of this stuff since it's not my house, but I can imagine it's very stressful. We knew nothing  about this stuff. We had many months to plan it out, but financial constraints and taking care of my Wife's other Mom who has late stage alzheimer's adds a lot of pressure and anxiety. We didn't want to do any deep house work until it was official.

It was about 2 months before the birthday and we were still getting estimates for all the work that needed to be done. We've been going through dozens of contractors to find the right ones who would do it at a fair price. Finally, we got everything but the painters and insulators. It's now 1 month before the birthday. We were pressured to find the right ones and we found them after two weeks. Now we had to get the painters, carpenters, insulators, and movers all to work within the same time frame. The insulators are being estimated after the attic is clean. This all took another week as we had to wait for a response from each one. 

We finally had a reno date (excluding insulators) starting one week after the birthday. My MIL is taking care of my other MIL during the week so it's hard to do work when I am not there to help since I work full-time and my Wife is also playing caregiver during the week. We had two weekends to clean out a large attic and store our belongings in the basement. We decided to make a polite statement that we would not be able to make the party due to time constraints. We apologized. We also have gifts for our niece to give at a later date. We just couldn't fit it in the timeframe, it felt impossible.

My mother got a whiff of this and decided to text me this:

""Karma is a b***, I hope a bunch of people don't call you and cancel coming to your wedding the day before. Now you know why we bet if you will show up or not.""

I was so upset and frustrated beyond repair. She's still never apologized to me for it. She thinks I'm in the wrong even after explaining pretty clear that we have so little time to move our things. Hearing this from my own mother made me feel like I was nothing to her and I honestly wanted to cry. If she had said it like ""Hey, I know you are busy, but I think it would be really nice if you came out to see your niece's first birthday and it's really important to your sister that you'd be there."", that would have been an appropriate response. 

My sister was okay that we didn't make it of course. She's definitely not the kind of person to be upset about that as we have been there for her other daughter's birthdays. Am I the butthead?

EDIT: I call her my Wife because she basically is and we're getting married next year in case anyone was questioning my choice of words.",32,27,0.91

1507,Not the A-hole,"I've spent the last eight years attempting to finish my undergrad. Half of that time I was severely mentally ill and spent a lot of time in hospital for physical ailments - meaning I failed and had to repeat units. A year and a half ago I was stabilised, returned to uni and have been SMASHING it. This is my final semester, I'm just about to graduate despite all this hardship. My academic potential was realised and I believe in myself enough to pursue further studies. Like I'm actually smart enough to go for it. It's also pretty much the only way I can begin my career in microbiology research. My mum, however, is not happy about it. 


I moved back home a year ago after suffering severe financial difficulties, my family seemed really happy to have me home. Since I began talking about my ""bright future"", she's been very vocal about her disapproval. Some choice phrases, verbatim: 

- ""Caatko, you're almost 30  and you have nothing to show for yourself"". I'm 25

- ""You know I'm proud of you, but you need to start working and being a proper adult""

- ""Are your grades even high enough to be eligible?"". Her academic transcript looks MUCH better than mine for the above reasons - pretty vocal about that too

- ""Even your little brother has his shit more together than you"". He works full time in a factory doing metal work and bringing home $800 p/w


Needless to say, I'm crushed. My pride has taken a beating, but not enough to want to give up. I've *never* given up on myself, even when things got really dire and saw no way out. When it comes to getting what I want, I'm stubborn and will ruthlessly pursue it, damn anyone else. Except mum. 


I love my mum, so so much. She's my world. I know she wants what's best for me. But I don't want to fall out with her and get kicked out of home again over this. 

What say you, Redditors?


*EDIT*:I live in Australia, where our uni fees are covered by the govt until we earn over $55K p/a. Then a portion of our tax is taken to pay for it over several years. As for myself personally, I pay board and help with food costs with my student payments from welfare.


*SECOND EDIT*: Thank you all for your encouragement, reality checks, different perspectives and your advice on alternate/adjuntive pathways. It means a lot that you would take the time to comment. I'm gonna sit down with my mum and get everything out in the open and see if we can't figure out the way forward. Watch this space.


*CONCLUSION*: I was meant to add this a few days ago. Mum and I sat down and discussed things, addressing all the points made below. We agreed that, if I do get into masters, I would actively search for part time jobs relevant to my field. Her main concern is my mental health, but conceded that I've been doing so much better since I got stabilised. She told me she'd be proud of me, no matter what. We then had a good long hug and lemon meringue tarts. Life is good. Thanks again to all of you ♥",71,78,0.9

1509,Not the A-hole,"For context, my mother is an emotional abuser, a manipulator, and a professional victim. She emotionally abused myself, my brother, and my dad, and did it all so she could be taken care of and get what she wanted in order to feel good about herself. My brother and I got the greatest portion of the abuse, and everyone in my family (my dad, aunt, and mom's mom specifically) seems to have decided that it was too difficult to hold my mom accountable for her behavior, so they pretty much did nothing to stop her. In essence, they allowed her to abuse her family.

I am moving back to my hometown in a few days, and my parents are getting a divorce. My dad has finally had enough of my mom's behavior, and is leaving her for another woman. I understand his reasoning quite well, but the way he is going about it is not appropriate. My grandmother (mom's mom) decided to message me and tell me that, when I get home, I shouldn't be ""mean"" to my mom, and to not put her at fault for the divorce, because my dad is the one that is leaving her and he should have acted to prevent my mom's bad behavior. 

Apparently, in my family, holding people accountable for their abusive behavior and defending oneself from said behavior is considered being ""mean"". I told my grandmother that I refuse to not hold my mother accountable, and that if she wants to point fingers at my dad for his cowardice (both for leaving my mother and for not stopping her behavior), then she needs to recognize that everyone who saw my mom's abusive behavior but did nothing (like her) are complicit in my mother abusing her children. I explained that while my dad's actions are shitty, he is a victim of her abuse too, so I don't blame him for wanting to leave her although I DO hold him accountable for the way he's doing it, and for his part in not stopping her in the first place.

At some point I made it clear that if anyone wants to point fingers at my dad, then they need to recognize that they were just as cowardly as he was, because they saw her abuse and did nothing. She insisted that they weren't cowardly, to which I responded ""Well, if you all saw what she was doing, and did nothing, then what DOES that make you?"".

She didn't like that, and flipped out on me. Honestly, I don't feel bad. This whole situation is filled with people blaming others for their behavior, but being unable to recognize how they played a part. Me calling my family out for their hypocrisy and cowardice feels right, but I wonder if I'm being too hard on them. After all, I know that my mom can lash out and throw fits when she is criticized, so I understand why they didn't intervene. At the same time... they pretty much stood out of the way while my mother traumatized myself and my brother, so fuck it. But, let's hear from you. AITA?",111,988,0.95
1510,Asshole,"Okay I know it sounds bad, but hear me out.

So there's this popular meme (mainly spread from stan Twitter) that a group of friends and I find really funny. It's a short video from this Indian reality TV show of two sisters yelling at each other ([link for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM76nAN6SLo), watch or the rest of the post won't make much sense).

A few days ago, my friends and I were sitting at lunch. One of my friends knocked down a water bottle or cup or something so I went, ""PoOJA wHAt iS tHIS bEHavIoR"" with a heavy Indian accent and the other girls basically quoted the rest of this video (all with Indian accents) and we all laughed. Another girl, we'll call her Amber, overheard this. Amber's not really in our friend group, she just happened to be sitting with us for lunch that day.

Amber is Indian, and was really pissed at all four of us. Me especially since I started the joke. She said it was extremely offensive to mock accents like that, especially since none of us are of Indian decent (three of us are white and one of us is black). She basically said the joke was racist and we were ignorant for making it. She was also being very condescending when she said all of this and was yelling.

I told her she was blowing it out way out of proportion. We had no racist or mean intentions AT ALL. Just making fun of a funny video that happened to have Indian accents in it. I told her it was wrong for her to call us racist, due to the fact that we would have mimicked the accents if they were the Kardashians or a valley girl instead. And it wasn't like we were just randomly mocking someone's accent or making an Indian joke, we were literally just quoting a funny video. We told her it was just a joke, but she said it wasn't right for us to joke about things like that.

Amber was extremely upset. She left, and later we found out she blocked us on all social media. We saw her in class the next day and she wouldn't speak to us and neither would her friends. Apparently to her and her friends, we're racist and toxic and I think that's absolute bullshit.

We're really pissed that Amber's spreading rumors like that, especially since we're not anywhere CLOSE to racist, to be completely honest she was just being sensitive. We quote the video all the time in class now (Amber's within earshot) and it's sort of become an inside joke now for us to say it whenever she's around.

If Amber had just walked up to us and respectfully told us that she was uncomfortable with our joke, we would've definitely stopped quoting it in front of her. But no, the girl had to yell at us, call us racist, and turn all her friends against us.

TLDR: Me and my friends quoted a meme video from an Indian reality show and happened to use Indian accents, an Indian classmate overheard and called us racist, we had an heated argument, and no longer speak to each other.

Who's in the wrong here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: After reading every single comment and reply, holy fucking shit I'm a bitch. You guys really gave me another perspective and I feel like absolute shit. I actually find this really ironic, since I'm the type of person who shits on the white boys in our school who constantly say the n word in front of black classmates. But here I am. I now realize that the joke we made WASN'T cool or acceptable with the accent and I will make sure to apologize to Amber tomorrow. She definitely won't forgive me but I'll try my best to make things right with her. Thanks to everyone for commenting, I really am the asshole.",414,327,0.82
1511,No A-holes here,"Okay so for more info... about a year ago my mom pulled some strings and got me a pretty well paying job with friends of hers.  The catch was that the schedule was over night. But my mom was able to keep my son during those hours and it was only part time but I was making enough to support us on 3 nights a week.  It was a sacrifice but a good deal.  

Well as the year progressed I was promoted a couple of times and got a decent pay raise and a  lot more time at work, putting us square in the “comfortable” category but meaning that my child is having to sleep with relatives 5 nights a week.

My son hates this.  Yes most of the time it’s grandmas and he has his own bed there.

But he really hates it. He wants to be at home with his own mom, where he belongs. 

He has gotten to where he is begging me to get a new job and telling me over and over all he wants is more time with me.  

(If it matters I’m a single mom, my son lost his dad and siblings a few years ago because of divorce and abuse long story.)

So yesterday as my child bearing his soul again that he hates when he can’t stay with me I made a decision and I turned in my 2 weeks notice at work.

I found another job.  It will be a lot less money.  But my son and I will be 100% together outside of school and work, and those shifts will happen at the same time. Every dinner. Every bedtime. Every evening is ours. 

My mom said ITA because a. She got me that job. B. I’m giving in to the wants of a 7 year old.  C. I should put financial security over emotional security.  D.  I’m not acting like a parent.

So I work in criminalistics and forensics. My job is very tideus and you can't allow yourself to make any mistakes. There are no do overs.

So basically this new girl ""Sandra"" started at our laboratory 2 weeks ago. She works in the same field as me. Now Sandra might be very smart but she has not shown it in the 2 weeks. She has misplaced several [evidence] items, has girgiten to sterilize tools before moving on to the next item etc. I have tried to be patient with her and told her that she needs to ""wake up"" because her clumsiness could cost us a case. She began to cry and I just left it at it.
 
So today it happened. We had a case and needed to sort trough various DNA items. One of them was a cloth that was bloody. So basically you can't leave that shit out for too long or expose it to radiation for more than a couple of minutes. And what did she do? She exposed the evidence to more than 20 minutes of radiation. The evidence was not valid anymore.

I lost my shit on her and basically told her what the title says and went to put in a complaint with our ""supervisor"" who understood my frustration. But later some dudes of my office accused me of being territorial and that that girl os just new so we should give her more leeway. AITA?

1516,Not the A-hole,"I work as a busser at a restaurant. Recently two customers have been coming to our restaurant. One, an older lady, and the other, someone I presume to be her son.

They’ve come in 3 times that I’ve worked and each time the lady vomits at the table. She’ll vomit on the plates and in her napkins. Each time, they leave without telling any staff that she vomited. The first few times I touched vomit without gloves because i had no warning. Now I wear gloves because I know what to expect.

I assume she has some physical disorder that makes her vomit after eating as well as a mental disorder, but her son doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t direct her to the bathroom or clean up after her. He just watches her.

1520,Asshole,"This is something I've been thinking about for months now and I need some help. I apologize for how messy all of this is.


I have a friend who I've been close with since junior year of high school. He is a musician and a member in a pretty mainstream band and is currently touring. While I've (obviously) seen him less and less over the years due to his success, we do still talk on an occasion and I see him when he's in town. I am honestly nothing but happy for him and I want nothing but the best for him. But I'd also like for him to be a good friend and I feel like that's the exact opposite of what he's doing.


I'm getting married in October. I asked my friend shortly after I proposed if he would be one of my groomsmen, and he agreed. Official invitations went out early last month, but my wedding date has been publicly known for over a year and a half due to its significance. He knows and has known the day I'm getting married since then. 


In mid-May he told me he didn't know if he would be able to be in my wedding because of touring. I was pretty upset then but he said he would try to figure something out. I won't pretend to know how far in advance he would've found this out, but he told me before the tour was officially announced so in my mind I had at least a little hope that he would still be able to be in the wedding. We texted back and forth a few times after that in the weeks following but never about my wedding, and he fell off a bit due to work.


Then last month the tour was officially announced and my wedding date is one of tour dates. I was LIVID and called him and left a message asking him to call me as soon as he could. He called like two days later and when I confronted him he told me that there was nothing he could do and that this was a sacrifice for both of us. I pushed him more and he got extremely short and shitty with me and said that he ""didn't have time or energy to deal with this right now"" and hung up. 


To be honest I'm mostly upset that he didn't tell ME before the tour was officially announced that he absolutely 100% would not be able to make it. I texted him a couple weeks ago and asked him one more time if there was ANY way he could still make it and he replied that he was sorry, but no, it just wasn't possible. I haven't spoken to him since. 


I understand how busy and stressful his life must be, and I also understand that sacrifices sometimes need to be made, but this just has me feeling really shitty about myself and our friendship. I feel like I matter way less to him than he does to me. I was at his wedding and pretty much nothing would have prevented me from attending it, and especially not work. I don't want to lose his friendship but I also don't want this to be the first of many times he lets me down.

1521,Not the A-hole,"My boyfriend and I had a somewhat petty argument tonight about his subway sandwich. He was returning home from a work trip and he’s been gone for 4 days. He was very tired and earlier when we were texting he said he would like subway for dinner. 

I went to subway and got our food and went home and a couple hours later he came home and after he showered and changed he went to the fridge to get his sandwich. 

Then the argument started. So I knew it would be some hours before he came home so I had them put the...idk toppings? Ingredients? Whatever—On the side. Tomatoes, pickles, banana peppers, mayo, and chipotle in cups. I did this because I knew the sandwich would become soggy if they put it all together and it sat in the fridge for hours.

He gets pissed and mid sentence just leaves the sandwich on the counter and leaves the house without a word. He comes back about 20 minutes later with another sandwich. 

So I said it was very rude of him to just walk out like that and very childish to waste gas and money on another sandwich when he already had one. He then goes on this long rant about how he “you didn’t get me a sandwich you got me ingredients. You may as well have gone grocery shopping.”

I have to admit thinking about this now after we both have calmed down, it is rather funny. His main source of frustration was the mayo and chipotle sauce because he said no matter how much he scoops those little cups he’ll never get all the sauce out and then his sandwich will be dry.

I said that 1. You got a tuna sandwich so it can’t be dry and 2. We have mayo and chipotle in the fridge. He said it would not be the same and that going to subway isn’t just buying the sandwich, it’s also paying to have it assembled. 

We have apparently had this situation before and he said he’d asked me before to not do that and to just have them put the sandwich together, but I do not remember this.

Looking back now, this is rather comical but still he was legitimately upset with me, and I with him earlier. We didn’t talk after the argument until he kissed me before falling asleep. So I’m sure this was just a typical argument but I’m also curious about if I was the asshole in this situation.

**EDIT: okay a couple things, and please excuse my English as it’s my second language. The first thing is that I did actually forget and after talking this morning this has happened relatively frequently where he’s told me he doesn’t like this. To add, I also have a history of thinking my way is always the best one. All of this plus his fatigue with work builded up to his frustration.**

**I must say that the leaps to conclusions of my boyfriend being abusive or having some not known psychiatric disorder are quite hysterical to me. This is the type of arguments couples have. We made U.K. before bed, laughed this morning, he admits he was immature by not calmly explaining what was wrong, I admit I am forgetful and that I should be less controlling about certain subjects.**

I ask where to (lately he's been selling things on fb marketplace so I didn't know if it had to do with that). He says to go hang with his friend. I explain to him that it's not fair of him to just leave me with all six kids, by myself, while he goes out, and that I feel like he should wait until a kid free day. He tells me he will wait until they're in bed in an hour, and I tell him that's not the point. So after some discussion, he stays home. 
Just now we were talking about it, and his point is that it's easy to take care of them, especially when they're asleep, and he needed to get out. I tell him it isn't about whether it's easy or hard, it's that is unfair to leave me home and that I would like the courtesy of him at least asking me if I'm okay with it and not just assuming that I will be, and that I would never go out to have fun and leave him home with all six kids by himself. That the nights we have them we shouldn't be out drinking and hanging out, that people can come here or we can suggest waiting until a day when the kids aren't here. He thinks I'm being unfair because he doesn't often try to get out of the house, I think he should compromise and do it on a day the kids aren't here, because we have plenty of kid free days. I also don't think it's unreasonable to expect him to ask me if I'm okay with it, maybe explain why he needs it that day, and not just spring it on me. We aren't arguing about this, it's just a discussion we are having that we can't seem to agree on. I get where he is coming from. I told him I will never tell him not to go out with his friends, that I only ask that he do it on nights we don't have his kids, because I'm his fiance, not his live in babysitter. So, am I the asshole for not wanting him to go out, when I knew he had a bad day?

Edit- I just want to expand on this a little. This definitely isn't an argument between us, and I don't think he's the asshole in this at all. He very rarely wants to go out anywhere because he prefers staying home. I just don't know if I was wrong to have him stay home just because he didn't ask first, that it wouldn't have changed my night in any way to tell him it was okay. I told him no out of the principal of him not asking me if I minded, and I feel like I may have been the asshole solely because I was stubborn about that.",96,279,0.92
1527,Not the A-hole,"I had some older relatives visiting from overseas and decided to order delivery for their last night in the United States. We opted for a pricier Japanese restaurant and ended up with a check around $143 for five large platters of sushi. When prompted online to tip the driver, I decided to simply round up to $150 because I didn’t think that driver tips were supposed to scale with the price of the food. We ordered relatively little food by volume, and sure enough, our food arrived in a fairly standard sized paper takeout bag. 

Nonetheless, our courier confronted me and asked for “the rest of the tip.” I explained that I placed the tip online rather than in person, but he complained that it was “less than 5%” and that most people tip at least 15% on “such a large order.” Despite his disdain, I wasn’t going to give him $20+ for delivering a single bag that would typically contain $20 of food, so I just apologized and said that I don’t have any cash.

1531,Asshole,"(It should be noted that this incident happened long ago - if this post receives too much attention, then I'll consider removing it.)

A friend of mine (we'll call him Chris) randomly invited me to attend his church along with several other students from our dorm. Both of us are African-American southerners, but the residential hall we resided in was overwhelmingly white/Asian (if I were to estimate, 40% Asian, 50% white, 10% black). Naturally, I assumed that my friend's house of worship must be predominately black - in an effort to avoid unpleasant experiences (i.e. fainting in the pews/speaking in tongues), I told him that I would prefer not to attend a Pentecostal church. At first, I felt relieved when Chris informed me that the church was Presbyterian, but further questioning revealed that the church was in a section of town not known for having a sizable black population.

After a tremendous amount of effort, I eventually got him to admit that the church in question primarily catered to first-generation Asian immigrants - specifically, Korean-Americans. To be perfectly clear, we share many of the same mutual acquaintances - however, we had very different approaches to dealing with racial/political issues. I politely informed him that walking into this ethnic enclave as a black man might be especially hazardous, but Chris entirely dismissed these concerns on the grounds that he was an invited guest of other (presumably Asian) students. When I continued to raise questions about what sort of treatment he might be subjected to, Chris insisted that nothing of concern presented itself in his prior visits. (Again, he's a nice guy who is arguably too naive to notice prejudice even when it's glaringly obvious. Doubtlessly, many of the parishioners are conservative, older Korean Americans - a population not generally known for possessing enlightened attitudes about blacks.)

The discussion continued for about 10-15 minutes with absolutely no progress made on either side. Chris continuously claimed that ""bringing everyone together"" was his goal, but I challenged him to explain what cause was being advanced by unnecessarily endangering himself and venturing into a hostile space. (Certainly, uniting various cultures is a noble goal but not a possible one without an established structure or the expressed consent of other parties.) Eventually, I just decided to terminate this argument by saying ""we'll have to agree to disagree on this one"" - there were no hard feelings between us afterwards and no references to the Korean church incident in future conversations. (Obviously, my stance remained unchanged so I didn't join him.)

AITA?

EDIT: Because this post has garnered so many responses overnight, I feel compelled to address a few issues of importance. I am not disagreeing with my overall judgement, but I do think it's necessary to provide some clarification....

&#x200B;

1. This subreddit applies a real double standard to perceptions of danger on the basis of identity. In many other posts I've seen here, users are often advised to ignore ""political correctness"" if doing so is necessary from the standpoint of personal safety. However, my concerns are being dismissed as invalid and irrational without further examination. If you think I'm the asshole, then that's fine - honestly, I personally have doubts about whether I handled this in an appropriate manner. Even still, I wish there was more of an effort to comprehend my perspective rather than flatly rejecting the risk altogether.
2. I absolutely deny in the strongest possible terms attempting to ""sabotage"" or ""manipulate"" my friend. He is a good person with whom I simply disagree about certain racial matters - believe it or not, but you don't have to despise everyone whose opinion differs slightly from yours. I never said that I completely denounce coalition work or efforts at promoting racial unity - again, we have the same goal and distinct ways of reaching it. Why would you deliberately misinterpret my post by imbuing certain passages with (non-existent) malicious intent? For example, ""different approaches to dealing with racial/political issues"" was not intended as a euphemism for anything - period.
3. I never specifically used the word ""racist"" in the same sentence with Korean-Americans. I merely stated an obviously true fact - that many Koreans (especially the older generation) are not particularly fond of blacks. I'm sure the reverse is also true to an extent, but even assuming unequal power relations in certain environments, it's unclear whether I could definitively categorize either as ""racism."" There is indeed a strong sense of mutual enmity between our communities, a fact easily confirmed by reading news articles or academic studies. And no, I wouldn't say that \*all\* people of a given group possess the same attitudes - nor would I seek to question anyone's commitment to their religious faith.
4. The whole ""argument from hypocrisy"" tactic is extremely cheap and very overrated. ""How would you feel if this were done to black people?"" is an idiotic question because I experience far worse things on a regular basis (and it's entirely out of my control). Am I really expected to be more empathetic to everyone else than they are to me? Is that a fair moral standard?",89,53,0.69
1532,Asshole,"(update below)

I live in a congested city, so every morning I take my dog to the cemetery where he can walk in the grass (with a leash) and pee as well. My dog never poops in the cemetery, since he never poops in the morning. So yep, pee only.

Anyway, the cemetery was pretty much empty, I would never intrude on any event. I'm walking my dog and this guy comes up behind me and this was pretty much our interaction:

guy: I hope you know your dog is not allowed in here. (which I didn't know, because I see dogs here ALL the time with their owners, as well as people jogging, etc)

me: we're just walking

And then he started following for at least a minute so I snapped ""if you don't like it you can call the police on me"" and he kind of muttered something and then left.

AITA? It didn't occur to me that one of his loved ones could be buried there, but it's not like I was letting my dog shit on the graves or anything.

edit- I don't let my dog piss on actual graves. I really don't even like to walk in front of them. There's a lot of grass and benches so he pees there, right near the path. Whenever he walks near them I pull him away.

**UPDATE:**

**I got a lot of YTA's, but idk ya'll I'm gonna keep walking my dog in the cemetery.

The thing is, his sister saw me getting just chicken and made a comment in her language about how I was only getting chicken to her mom. I didn’t understand her at the time, but my bf told me what she said and her comment made me feel really uncomfortable. It made me feel like she was complaining about me to her mom. 

I don’t really eat a lot of stuff at their house because I already feel like I’m free loading. My boyfriend sided with his sister because that was the way he was raised i guess.

I was having lunch with my cousin. Im a 26yo male. We are really close, and while we were talking the topic of sex came up. The conversation went kinda like this (not word for word) 

Her: I wouldnt have sex before marriage, do you think thats weird?

Me: I dont, i think its a personal decision and if thats what you wanna do then do it. 

Her: What are your thoughts about that? Be honest.

Me: What i think, is that when youre dating someone, youre basically doing an audition to see if youre compatible enough to maybe start a life together. To be completely sure, you should know each other really well, in all areas, and sex is a huge part of a relationship. Getting married to someone that youve no idea what their sexual preferences are, or performance or whatever, is a big risk. I wouldnt like spending the rest of my life or a substantial amount of it with someone that im not sexually compatible. On the long run i think its not a smart move. So, i think sex is really important in a serious relation.

Her: I see. What bothers me, is that if im upfront with someone that im not interested in sex, they inmediately lose interest, so it makes me feel like i need to put out even consider being in a relationship.

Me: Youre not doing anything wrong. Youre just telling it like it is with you before even dating. However, i think that going in a new relationship with limits already established in your head might not be the best strategie. How about just going as far as youre comfortable going. If its just holding hands then thats it, if its sex then well, you make the decision. 

Are you not doing it because you dont want to? if so dont.

Are you not doing it because you fear what your parents would say? Youre 19, i think youre old enough to know if you want to have sex and for your parents to understand youre an adult.

Are you doing this because of your beliefs?
If so, i cant really say much. If you really wanna do it but would feel bad because of your beliefs, i personally dont think you should stop living your life.

After that, i went home, chatted with my mom (who i trust immensely) and gave her a really concise take on the conversation. Focusing on what i said without mentioning anything she said.

Anyways she called me a prick because im telling her stuff that goes against her families beliefs and that i shouldnt have said anything. And that if my uncle/find out theyre gonna be pissed.

1547,Asshole,"So me and my boyfriend are currently in a very long distance relationship with him being in China for school and me in California. This means I only get to see him every 3-6 months. We had been planning on him coming to California over winter break for 3 weeks to spend time with me. Then in the beginning of February for the Chinese New Year holiday, he’d go on vacation with his family to some tropical place for a week or two. That had been the unofficial plan for the past few months since nobody had bought any tickets or made reservations yet. 

Last night, my boyfriend informed me that his parents had realized that to take their tropical vacation during Chinese New Years would be a lot more expensive than if they took it during Christmas break. I don’t know how long they had known this, but they just told my bf last night that they’d now be going on their tropical vacation in the beginning of Christmas break. 

They gave him two choices: 1. He can go with them on their vacation for a week-ish, then fly to the US to spend time with me for 1.5-2 weeks. Or, 2. He can skip their family vacation and just go to the US to see me for the full 3 weeks. 

After telling me this, I told him that this was a very unfair position to put me in. Either I tell him to go on his family vacation and I lose time with him but his parents are happy, or I tell him to come spend more time with me but his parents are upset and he loses a nice tropical vacation. I decided to just be honest and I flat out told him I didn’t want him to go on his family vacation, and that I wanted him to come to the US for the full 3 weeks like we planned. Am I an asshole for doing that? He said he did want to spend the full 3 weeks with me but he also wanted to make his parents happy and go on a fun vacation. 

Some important information I’d also like to add:
-The place his family is going to (Malaysia), they’ve already been to last year, same resort and everything, so he isn’t missing anything new. 
-They just went on a family vacation together at the end of July in France. 
-The last time I saw him was before his family vacation in France for 3 weeks. 
-I’m seeing him again for a week in October, then I’d see him again in December, then the next time I see him wouldn’t be until Spring break or maybe even Summer.

Edit: I forgot to mention that he currently lives with his family in China so he sees them everyday and does things with them on the weekend. Also, for those two weeks in February when his family was originally planning to go on vacation, he’d still be spending time with them, just not in a foreign country on a “vacation”.",52,46,0.79

Hi Reddit. I’m ready for any and all opinions. Here goes. 

I adopted a dog a few months ago. I also have a screened in back patio area with an in-ground pool. I would love to leave my dog outside for an hour or so while I do housework, but wasn’t ok with doing so until I knew the dog could swim. 

My dog has never shown interest in said pool, however, if she falls in while unattended, she could drown. That was my reasoning for putting her leash on her and gently guiding her into the pool last night. She wasn’t fond of it, but swam one lap, made it back to the steps, and got out. 

In my mind - that’s all I needed to know! Dog never has to get into the pool again. I just wanted to make sure 1. She could swim, and 2. She knew where the steps were if she was to fall in and I couldn’t get to her. 

A close friend told me I was basically “abusing” my dog by “forcing my dog” into the pool. In one sense, my friend is right. I basically did force my dog into a pool she didn’t want to be in in the first place. 

My opinion is I did it for safety sake, bc now I can leave her outside for a bit without worrying.

When she gets home from work, she takes all her clothes off and walks around naked for a while before getting dressed again. She also does that before/after taking a shower, and doesn't even close the door when showering (and we have a clear shower curtain). She also doesn't close the door while using the bathroom, which isn't as bad but is still annoying because she gets mad when I walk out of my room (the bathroom is directly across from my bedroom, so that's the first thing I see when opening my door) and see her sitting on the toilet! It's too bad there's nothing she can do to prevent that...

1556,Not the A-hole,"This is pathetic but it’s been an ongoing issue since my son was born. He’s 16 months old, husband is in the military. That does pertain to this situation. 

We just moved and are staying with family while we are house hunting. Usually I would put my son in his pack and play outside of the bathroom with the door open so I can keep an eye on him while I shower. I can’t do that here because it’s a house full of family and it wouldn’t be appropriate.
My husband is here for the weekend, he’s been staying close to his job 65 miles away. 
We both need to shower. I’ve been taking showers every three days strictly because it’s so Inconvenient for me to shower. I always have to ask a family member to watch our son while I shower. They’re happy to help but I know they’re busy too so I just feel bad no matter what having to ask for help and needing the help. Some days  I try to get up early before my son wakes up to shower but he usually will wake up half way through my shower, then I have to really rush and it’s just been so insanely inconvenient for me to just do the very fucking basics to take care of myself. 

My husband announced during lunch that he was going to shower immediately afterwards and then go get a haircut. He has to have his haircut a certain way for work and he’s due for one, fair. That isn’t anything new. I told him I had been planning on showering after lunch too, I asked if I could shower first, then him, then he can leave for his haircut. He declined that. I then asked if I could shower after him and he declined that and said I’ll have to wait to shower once he gets back from getting his haircut. Keep in mind I have to ask for his help and go with whatever he offers because one of us has to watch our son while the other one showers. 

I’m pretty pissed off about this because I always have to shower last or at the end of the day, I have to put off showering for when it’s convenient for everyone else. He never offers to just watch his own son so I can do the basics, like I stated before. But when he needs to shower he gets to no questions asked. And now he’s relying on our family to help me out but I feel like since he’s in town right now, he should be helping me parent our kid and we shouldn’t expect others to help if both of us are here. 

Anyways, AITA for wanting to shower? 
For clarification, we’re in the process of moving and have been uprooted for over a month so my son has been totally thrown off his schedule making him super clingy to me. It’s been a nightmare and I really just want to fucking shower without having to basically ask for permission and plea my argument as to why I need to.

Update: I got to shower. Thank god, but this behavior from my husband is concerning. He prioritizes his needs before mine because his income is our sole income. I respect that and try my best to accommodate that. But it really hinders what I am able to do for myself because he doesn’t offer the same help when I need it and he is around to help. 
I signed up for some online college classes when my son was 6 months old thinking I’d be able to manage both taking care of my son and school. I was wrong, I wasn’t even able to sign into the student portal and find my first assignment without my son waking up and me having to stop several times to tend to him. I quickly realized I wouldn’t be able to go back to school then and dropped the courses. My husband picks on me for that but he fails to realize I dropped the courses because it would have been a burden on all of us, I would have needed his help with our son for me to get the work done and I knew he wouldn’t have been reasonable with that. 
I plan on going back to school now that my son is older but it’s really hard to imagine how that’s going to work when my husband can’t even help with our son so I can shower. 


For those who are asking why I won’t let my son cry it out, normally I would but since we are staying with family that won’t work. They work and go to school and we all need our sleep. They’ve been so accommodating to us that I can’t take advantage of that kindness.  Please know that normally I would have my son cry it out because I need to shower and so does my husband.

This isn't a big deal to me, but can be to my older siblings. It can be annoying because to them, when they were raised, taking only meat or only one ingredient from the pot threw off the balance of ingredients and would be taking away chicken from everyone else who would eat after.

My gf them gets upset saying no one's ever told her anything like that before, it's never been a problem in her past etc. I try to be understanding and say maybe it's because she's a single child and stuff but she's adamant I'm wrong for bringing it up. 

Am i the asshole for trying to slightly change her behavior so my family won't judge her?",130,392,0.92

1560,Not the A-hole,"   My wife and I just told our parents that we are pregnant. This is both sets of parents first grandchild. We told my parents and then hers. Both were super excited.
   Her brother is in college and still lives with her parents. So we told him as well. He said cool and then started talking about how he got 1000 views on a TikTok and kept interrupting my wife and mother-in-law while they were talking about the baby and how excited they were, to tell us about his TikToks. He was trying to film one while we were all talking about the baby, and was blasting music so no one could hear. 
He kept getting mad when we wouldn't watch his new TikTok or whatever he's trying to show us. My wife even made a comment about him ""not being the center of attention"" and him not handling it well. It really irritated me because my wife and in laws were so excited and he made it all about him.

But whenever she gets a cold I have to take the day off work, like she is such a hypocrite and I this is driving me to the point of considering divorce. 

I told her I will walk to places/ take public transport if she doesn't want to compromise. She started crying and saying she doesn't like to drive when she is by herself. I am refusing to budge here, she literally does not take me seriously, and tbh I am fucking sick of it.

1562,No A-holes here,"This isnt anything major that I did, but my sister thinks I shouldnt have said anything. Anyway, on to what happened...


My mom loves to abbreviate things, she thinks it is fun. She also loves to golf. She says things like ""You have a BO"" (meaning birdie opportunity), ""FISA"" (meaning F__ I'm Still Away), and a few others as well as a bunch that have nothing to do with golf. 


For those of you who don't golf on a regular basis, knowing your distance from your target is important on every shot. I recently purchased a laser range finder which you can use to find the distance to any target. Well, in turn, my mom keeps saying to me ""Give me the D"", ""I need the D"", and various other versions of that which dont sound as salacious. 


My mom is in her 60's, she has no clue what ""the D"" is in modern youth culture (it means ""the dick""), but it was making me a little uncomfortable and was really awkward when she said it when we were playing with other people.


The other day when I was playing with my mom and my sister I asked to to stop saying that and informed her what it meant and sounded like. My mom was a bit embarassed and was fairly quiet for the next 20 or so minutes (she is NEVER quiet), but after a couple of holes everything was back to normal. 


After the round my sister came up to me and said I shouldnt have said anything and should have just left it alone. I thought I picked a good time because she wasnt around anyone but her own kids and was trying to prevent future awkwardness. AITA?",275,2110,0.97

1565,No A-holes here,"So, I'm a 31 year old male. I've been married 3 years to my wife, and we've been together as a couple 8 years in total. We've had our normal couple ups, and down. But, definitely more ups than downs. Never anything super serious that would tear a relationship completely apart. However, we both would not ever say in a million years we are perfect people and that's totally fine.

So, for reference my sex drive has always been much higher than hers. But, it was never a big deal we always made sure each other were always happy and obviously after 8 years we figured out how to make everything work. So, 2 years ago her side of the family had a big upheaval with some pretty heavy strife attached. I don't want to get into details, but sex slowly began to fade away because of the all the family issues she was dealing with. I tried talking to her about it and we went to several therapy appointments. But no amount of talking and understanding can get you going when depressed and I get that.

About a year ago maintain my sanity I pretty much gave up any type of ""self help"" when it came to a ""release."" And, stopped watching adult content. Basically killed my sex drive so I could I could help her through things and not be on edge all the time.

Six months ago her sex drive came back, and it was super sudden. Sex just wasn't a thing that was on the forefront of my mind anymore. So I started having *a lot* of ""performance issues."" I'm in great shape, eat well, hydrated, etc etc. It's not an underlying condition(went to the doctor). Doctor gave me a prescription for Viagra he basically was like, ""this stuff with help you get out of your head.""

Took the meds and boy it felt like I was 18 again. Not that it just helped me not ""lose it"" but it made everything feel like 10 times better. Like I don't even know how to describe it. It worked through I ended up not needing it, but the thing is on date nights and nights I knew we would have sex I would pop one and not even just for my own pleasure she would admit bed time fun had a unique fun-ness when I took one.

A few weeks ago everything came to a head she asked me why I was still taking the meds if I'm ""better"" now. I told her it just makes sex feel better for me. And, don't take me out of context that as I hate fun time without it or that I don't find her incredibly attractive. Apparently she thought I was just finishing up the old script whenever she saw me taking one(I don't make a big deal about taking it or announcing it so it's rare she sees me take it) and didn't know i kept my monthly refill going all this time.

She was incredibly upset that I still ""needed"" it to perform. And, just couldn't see it from my angle as it was just something that made me feel *really* good when I took it. Basically saying I'm addicted and needed to find a way to have sex without it.

Am I wrong here? I think it would be on the levels of being offended if my wife wanted to use lube saying I should be good enough.",33,60,0.92

My sister is 25 and although I could type for days how her life has failed to launch and why, I'll just leave it at she lives at home. She is diagnosed with BPD and it's ""cousin"" Histrionic Personality Disorder and has been as long as I can remember. 

I am supposed to for leave school out of state on Thursday and after this morning, I really don't ever want to come back. I have scholarships, I can work to make room and board and my grandmother said I could ""borrow"" money from her (she really means give because she'd never let me pay her back). I guess since that is my plan my question is WIBTA if I just stay in my room and avoid my family until I leave on Thursday?

The incident this morning: I enjoy Bikram yoga and every Sunday there's an early bird class that starts at 8. I was getting ready to go and my sister came in and told me ""Yoga is bullshit."" I told her that I didn't want to argue with her and her opinion wasn't going to stop me from going. She then said ""if you want to be a ignorant piece of shit, fine go."" I told her to please just don't talk to me and let me go. She then said ""you started this."" After dealing with this crap for all my life I should have known better but I asked ""how did I start this Angie?"" She said that on Friday I had asked my dad to bring me Wendy's home and I should know she can't eat Wendy's because she's diabetic and even the smallest amount of fast food in the house is ""soda trigger"" for her and she had 3L of coke yesterday and it was my fault. I asked her why she's not mad at my dad for getting me the food. She said that's not the point and threw and empty L bottle of coke at me.

 I tried to leave but my mom heard the commotion and tried to pull this crap ""you're sisters, we're going to work this out"" and made me sit down and miss my yoga class. I was so disgusted because while they did tell my sister that I can't be held responsible for her drinking 3L of coke, they kept repeating to me that I need to recognize that my sister has BPD and we as a family need to love and support her even though she can be hurtful sometimes. 

I faked an apology just to get it over with, but I've been hiding out in my room all day long and unless it's to get food or go to the bathroom or go to my friends goodbye party on Tuesday, I want to stay here. I don't care if I say goodbye to my mom or dad, I don't care if I ever see my sister again. I just want to stay in my room.

1580,Not the A-hole,"Last weekend, there was a bachelorette party for my friend, Becca, who is getting married. Becca had a great time! We all did. 

It was a three night affair, and a male stripper came the last night we were there. Becca’s good friend, Anna, got really into the stripper. I don’t know Anna very well- we’ve only met a few times, but she’s nice and we get along great. Anna is engaged and getting married sometime this winter (haha I don’t know the date honestly). We’re bridesmaids together. 

Anna was even more about the stripper than the bride. When the stripper got naked, so did she. She was basically shoving her boobs at the guy. She licked whipped cream all over him. Etc. Which, you do you boo! She did mention to me her fiancé probably wouldn’t be ok with it. I chuckled awkwardly. Please note that everyone was well aware of the stripper coming and in agreement - it’s not something that was sprung upon anyone! Another bridesmaid (neither me nor Anna) arranged the stripper. 

Last night was Becca’s wedding. The wedding was beautiful. At one point during the reception, I was (drunkenly) talking to Anna, another friend, and Anna’s fiancé. The other friend couldn’t attend the party so we were all recounting our tales and laughing. I was very drunk at this point. I said “and then Anna took her clothes off! You should’ve seven her with the stripper!” Something to that effect. 

Ummm... Anna’s fiancé goes “a stripper?!” Turns out he didn’t know a stripper was coming at all. 

Last I saw them, they were in a VERY heated conversation. :/ I apologized and Anna said “well now [fiance] is ready to call off our wedding so fucking thanks.” She is really upset. I feel bad. My husband said it’s not my responsibility to uphold and remember her lies, especially when I’m drunk. My mom disagrees and says I should’ve been more discreet.

1581,Asshole,"This happened yesterday. I got a funnel cake at the county fair and the plate that the funnel cake was on had a crack in the middle of it. My ice cream topping was leaking through. I didn't realize this until I had walked back to my table and sat down with my family. Once I noticed it, I went back right away to the funnel cake truck and asked for another plate. Here is how the conversation went...

Me: Can I get an extra plate please? The one my funnel cake came on had a crack in it and the topping is leaking through

Employee: Let me check

\*Turns to speak with someone\*

Employee: Sorry, we only give plates to paying customers

Me: I was just here five minutes ago

Employee: Where's your funnel cake?

Me: At the table with my family

Employee: Can you bring it back, so we can make sure it's one of ours?

Me: Seriously? Can you give me a napkin at least?

Employee: Sorry, we get a lot of these requests from people and supplies aren't free. We only give them out to paying customers

Me: I understand, but I was just here five minutes ago

Employee: If you bring back your funnel cake, I can give you a plate and napkin

I was holding up the line at this point and didn't want to continue arguing with this ridiculous employee. I was pissed off when I got back to the table with my family and explained to them why I had to take the funnel cake back. When I returned to the truck, I ended up waiting in line another 5-10 minutes before getting to the window. By this time the funnel cake was cold, all the ice cream had dripped out, and I certainly didn't feel like eating it anymore. The employee recognized me right away, which I found ironic because she didn't seem to before. She said to me, ""Oh yeah, that's definitely one of our funnel cakes."" As she turned to grab a plate and napkin for me, I dumped my entire funnel cake on the counter in front of her and said, ""That's okay, I don't need it anymore."" She stood there in shock, and I just walked away.

I picked up an elephant ear (fried dough) from a different food truck on my way back to my family, and they were happy with the alternative. My wife asked what had happened. After telling her, she said that I didn't have to embarrass the employee like that. I told her the employee could have just given me a plate, or even a napkin at least, instead of having me walk back to my table and bring her back the funnel cake as proof. Plus it was 80 degrees outside and having to do all that extra work didn't help improve my mood.

So AITA for how I handled this situation?

ETA: For those of you saying it's company policy, my observation is this was a husband and wife operation with no ""corporate"" management. Someone in the comments assumed the employee was a young minimum wage worker. She was in her 50s, both her and the other man in the truck. I didn't want to make assumptions, so I used the term ""employee"", however my bet is that this was a husband and wife team and could have used discretion. To answer another question, the funnel cake was $11.",458,870,0.92
1582,Everyone Sucks,"First, I am a proxy-poster for a friend and coworker who doesn't have a Reddit account, and has been evaluating whether or not she has made a mistake in this situation. This friend, let's call her Jane, has been dating her fiancé, let's call him John, for \~10 months now. John is not a citizen in America, so Jane has been explains the conventions of American engagement to him once they had agreed that they were ready to move forward with their relationship. I do not believe that they collectively receive a lot of money in income, as they are in their early 20s in college and working part time. She told him that the rule of thumb is that one would spend approximately 3 months salary on an engagement ring, but confessed that she doesn't need an expensive engagement ring. She guided his hand in the process, as John had requested that she show him what variety of ring she likes. Jane confided in some coworkers that he was struggling to understand her instructions with regards to the style of ring.

Fast forward some time, and he proposes to her and the ring was both beautiful and conformed to the style she had showed him. One week later, after having washed her hands she had noticed that the ring had contorted and had lost its form. Fortunately, John had a warranty on the ring so in no time she was wearing a ring again. Not too long after that, the new ring had lost its center diamond, and this compelled her to ask John how much the engagement ring had cost him. Evidently, he had only spent less than 200 dollars on the ring because he had thought that they all looked the same so he merely bought the cheapest one.

Jane was not pleased with this, though she had acknowledged that she told him to not spend a fortune on the ring, she thought that he could spend little more than 200 dollars considering he actively trying to buy a new car for himself, and a number of other things (that I cannot remember) much more costly than a 200 ring.

1584,No A-holes here,"I don’t have anything against him as a person. However, I am concerned that my daughter (21F) does not know what she’s getting into with this relationship and it frightens me that they are talking seriously about marriage. 

Her boyfriend (I’ll call him “Tom”) has a genetic disease that causes him to have extreme muscle weakness and limited motor skills. 

I’m not a doctor so my understanding of his disease is that of a layperson, but I do know the following things. He is wheelchair bound. He needs help showering and even using the toilet. She literally has to hold him up on the seat the whole time he’s using it or he will fall over. Also, the limited use he has of his arms means that he even has to be spoon or hand fed. And obviously my daughter will be prepping and cooking every meal. Anyway, as you can see, his limitations are extreme and, as far as I know, he is not ever going to get better in this regard.

They hardly ever go out on real dates as Tom prefers the comforts of his home. A date to them is my daughter wheeling him around in the park or at the mall. On the rare occasion when they do go out to eat or something, my daughter has told me people generally assume she is his caretaker and they get tired of correcting them. Tom is also very small (particularly his legs), and people frequently mistake him for a child. 

My concern is that my daughter is living the life of an old woman nursing an aging husband. Yet they are both in their twenties! My daughter tells me they can have children but I imagine it would have to be via artificial insemination. I haven’t asked too many questions about that because she gets uncomfortable, which I can understand.   

What I do know is that they will never be able to live even a semi-normal existence as a couple. Up until a year and a half ago Tom lived with his mother, who was his caretaker. Since he and my daughter have gotten an apartment together though, my daughter has taken over bathing, feeding, and toileting him. Her only break seems to be when she goes to class, during which time Tom has a day nurse that stays with him. 

I know that some people may think I’m an awful person for feeling this way, but I can’t help but feel concerned about what my daughter is signing up for. She is a sweet and gentle girl but I worry that she is also a quite naïve and idealistic. I don’t think she’s considered what life will be like for her years down the road when her 20s are behind her.

Throwaway account for privacy reasons. 

Background: my wife and I are at her cousins wedding which is also like a small family reunion. I love my wife's family as they are all super informal, booze and weed flow pretty easily and everyone is really focused on having a good time. 

The cousin's wedding was yesterday and they had it really early in the afternoon with the reception equally early (my wife's great grandmother really wanted to come and see everything but she can't really stay up past about 7 due to some medication issues) so with that my wife and her sister (who is essentially her best friend) had been drinking all afternoon. Since the reception ended so early, everyone under 30 went out to the bars.

My wife and her sister were absolute ""white girl wasted"" and were putting on a spectacular show, complete with stealing peoples drinks, lots of woooooooos and ""dirty"" dancing.  No one really seemed to mind and most everyone found them entertaining. 

When we left my wife's sister saw a lamp post and said something like ""I always wanted to be a stripper!"" and ran and tried to spin on the post. My wife thought it looked like fun so she ran over but got right in the way as her sister was swinging around they smashed into each with a huge thud. At first I honestly thought they were hurt so I went over to check on them and they were giggling. Somehow their skirts got hiked up so they were both on their knees and elbows giggling furiously with their white butts for the entire street to see as they struggled to stand up. When I walked to them they were like ""my butt is showing he he he, your butt is showing he he he"" and I distinctly heard my sister in law say ""maybe I'll finally get a boyfriend if they see I have a nice ass!"" 

I was like ""okay"" their fine and then the image of them smashing into each other just hit me and I started absolutely laughing my ass off and wishing I would have been filming it. I helped them both to their feet and helped them stumble to the car. I swear they were laughing and giggling the whole walk but they both passed out in the car. I helped them inside our Airbnb and for ease put them both in the king size bed. 

This morning I woke up to this text ""you are such a fucking asshole for laughing at us and not helping us last night. I am furious with you and don't want to see you until we leave. We are getting something to eat. DON'T try to find us."" 

My wife has never spoken to me like that and it was so out of character for her (or her sister) to not see the humor in an event like that. I don't know if she's just sick and hung over, if some one else told her she should be mad or if she thinks something far worse happened than it really did. Maybe she's just embarrassed?

My MIL, SIL and her two small children came down to visit for a couple of days.  We have two small children of our own, so we have annual passes to several institutions around town we frequent to keep our kids occupied, one of which is the aquarium.  The pass is around $175 and we buy the additional family add on that allows us to bring family guests for an additional $50.  A day pass is around $30.  We have taken family to the aquarium in the past using our pass.  However, our pass had expired and we were going to buy a new one, plus the family add on option.  Now I wasn’t there for the conversation, I was at work, but my wife asked her mother and sister to contribute to the cost of the pass.  I’m not sure how articulately my wife explained that their contribution would be less than the cost of a day pass (she asked for $25 each which would cover the cost of the family option), which of course they would have to buy if we didn’t get another annual pass plus the family option.  They didn’t think they should contribute. They thought it would’ve unfair, because if other people come down, they would be able to take advantage of the pass free of cost.  My wife folded, and paid for the annual pass plus the family option.

I have put on a bit of weight in the past year and, unfortunately, most of it has gone to my stomach. Since this has happened, I have found that my boyfriend likes to grab, touch and jiggle it. While he is doing so he often laughs and remarks that he thinks that it’s cute. I should note that, when I complain, he says that I am beautiful and he loves my body, he just thinks my fat is cute and funny.

I have asked him to stop several times, especially when we are in public (like when he grabbed it today while we were on a walk) and he often apologises but then does it again. I do not think he means it maliciously, he just doesn’t understand why it makes me self conscious! 

Additionally, when we were on a trip recently a man on the tram offered me his seat. We could only assume that he thought I was pregnant!

Today I (16f) decided to look at my kindergarten yearbook and discovered again that they had let us do our own signatures. Everyone else was fine and normal “child scribble” of handwriting and then I realized mine looked pretty different. My Ds were backwards in my name and the Ns looked more like Ms. This kinda concerned me also due to the fact of remembering all the times I was talked to throughout (K through ~5) school about the differences of letters and which way they’re supposed to face. (I still have some moments where I forget which way letters are supposed to go) 

So I called my mom and asked her if I was ever diagnosed with dyslexia or ever checked out for it. She said “yeah your father and I were concerned for a while but never got it checked out.” Which definitely got me thinking. I’ve also been struggling a lot with mental issues and this is starting to piss me off. They haven’t considered taking me to any sort of specialist for any of things I have mentioned.

When I say this stuff to her she says I’m disrespecting her. That I’m brainwashed by the internet. That I’m young so idk what I’m talking about anyways. She gets mad at me when I call her out on it and the rest of the family is like her. So I get teamed up on. Me and my brother both call her out on it but we’re just met with resentment from the rest of the family. The reason I think I’m the asshole is because she’s old. She’s from a time where racism was normal and ik I’m not gonna b able to change her views so should i just shut up about it ? Should I just ignore it and be like ‘ok’ when she says anything racist? So am I the asshole for calling out my elderly grandmothers views even though it’s upsets her and stresses her out?

EDIT since everyone keeps asking ima just put it here: If someone is driving bad she’ll assume they’re a black person.
If food is messed up she’ll say ‘stupid niggers messing up everything.
She always talks about how she wants people of color to get out of America because they don’t contribute and are lazy.
She has told me many times if I date a black person she will view me differently forever. 
She thinks people of color are gross and dirty.
She thinks slavery should still exist.

Idk if I said everything because this has been happening my entire life so can’t remember every time she said something.

Oh yeah and I’m dating a caramel guy and she takes every opportunity to talk trash about him when the whole family is around(when they can gang up on me and make fun of me because of his skin color) I don’t say anything cuz I’m bad at speaking up for myself. So maybe should I stop being a little bitch? And fight the power ?",60,36,0.83

1595,Not the A-hole,"So let me preface this, I don't agree with what happened as I believe recreational use of marijuana should be legal. 

I've been living at my current complex for about a year, it's a very small complex where everyone is cramped up together. So smells travel quickly.

We have a group down the hall that always constantly stink up the hallways, and subsequently my apartment, with the skunk smell of weed. I've initially left messages asking them to try to filter it better or at least do it somewhere else. We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.

After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.


Smells persisted.


Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.

So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.

They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.

The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.

AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell? I tried to tell the officers I didn't want them arrested, just to be spoken to to stop or go elsewhere to do it.",288,271,0.87

1597,Asshole,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've known this girl for about half a year now. We met via a popular augmented reality game. At first she seemed like a quirky person, but polite. Once she got acknowledged in our local gaming community (we all share a mutual communication channel, and are split into multiple city regions), things started to go downhill. From what I could observe, she's been actively trying to pull attention to herself, like talking about his partner or her depression on public channels with around \~500 daily readers (everyone from the same city), or generally being passive-aggressive to people (either new or old players) in our local group for no particular reason.

At first I thought she genuinely needs help, so I tried to be as supportive as I could. I let her vent out when she wanted to, told her everything's gonna be alright, and gave some advice on how to improve her life (long story short, she's a NEET dependent on her boyfriend). We talked about her ambitions, how she would love to do things other than playing video games all day long. Naturally, the first step would be to find a job, and this is what I told her. That was around two months ago. Today, she's still not working, still saying her life is miserable. Nothing changed a slightest bit. I must admit, I grew tired of listening to this. I am not going to let an energy vampire suck off my good mood on a daily basis.

On several occassions, she said she has the Asperger syndrome. Like, casually mentioning it. A few days ago, she went on her regular venting talk and said she's got Aspergers, and this prevents her from communicating well with other people. At some point I snapped and straight out asked:

>Do you have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist? If you do, then feel free to keep talking. If you don't, then don't self-diagnose yourself over Wikipedia, because you're just using this terrible disease as a wild card to get other people's attention. This is toxic and disrespectful to people that actually do struggle with the disease.

I realised I fucked up, as she started to tell me I am in no position to talk about her life because she knows better, that I am the Know-It-All, and in general that I should go fuck myself. She's left our mutual convo and haven't rejoined ever since.

I asked our mutual friend about it, and received a response, which basically say: ""she just needs to vent out, rather than seek help, and you trying to share your POV will not bring any good, as every day you are becoming more and more arrogant towards her as you keep pushing"".

So, am I the asshole, or am I just being guilt tripped for calling her out on her bullshit?

Edit: To clarify, she herself admitted she does not have a formal diagnosis. When I called her out on it, she said it's because private health care is something she cannot afford, that she has no idea where to find a doctor, and similar sort of excuses. When I told her to get a temporary job in order to pay it off, she said something similar to ""my disease is mine, and it's none of your business"". But it is a fact that I said that before learning she does not have a diagnosis - I just assumed she doesn't. In the earlier events of her saying that, I just said that I don't think people should say that without a diagnosis from a professional, and she never said she actually does have one.",53,74,0.87

Background:

I am 20F. My grandfather is 86 years old. He lost his wife (my grandmother) just under 2 years ago and has been going downhill ever since. He has suffered from medical issues in the past but has recovered and is now considered healthy for his age. However, he is starting to lose it mentally. He recently lost his license due to his declining vision. He can still take the bus and occasionally can get rides from family/neighbors. Understandably he is lonely and miserable most of the time. He is extremely rude, yells at my mom and uncles if they are not available every moment of the day, complains nonstop, and is just generally difficult to be around.

The issue in question:

I went with my mom and grandfather to the hospital for his scheduled MRI (a follow up procedure to his aforementioned medical problems). In the car, he randomly told me I have a nice figure. I said thank you and changed the subject.

We got to the hospital and were walking to the MRI section. The corridor wasn’t wide enough for 3 people side by side, so I walked behind my mom and grandfather (she was helping him walk). He turned around a little and said “Where’s [my name]? Why are you behind us?” So I said I can walk in front, and passed them and led the way.

When I was walking in front of them, he said to me “You know, you have a nice figure. You have really nice legs.” I was uncomfortable and jokingly said “Yeah, and I have a really nice butt too.” His response was “Yeah, I was looking at that too.” (He did NOT say it jokingly.) My mom then said “Dad! That is so inappropriate!” And he seemed dumbfounded as to why that was inappropriate, saying “I was just giving her a compliment!” I felt so uncomfortable and creeped out, and kept my distance from him for the rest of the visit. Since then I have not gone to see him and have had minimal contact with him.

AITA? I know I brought up my butt as a joke, but the fact that he was staring at my ass makes me feel so creeped out. Am I overreacting?",34,125,0.99
1602,Asshole,"So I work in retail (more specifically, their customer service center). I get it. It sucks, it's just a job while I go through college. It makes money.

&#x200B;

Anyways, the reason why I'm asking is because I am a male. There have always been movements for empowering women to be comfortable with their bodies, and I am all for that. I don't mind women publicly breastfeeding; however, I don't mind when it's out in a space where I am not put at unease due to it being a massive spectacle and I don't have to work with the person. 

&#x200B;

A woman that I work with (late 20, however looks very young... I do not know her personally that well, but we have spoken before for a very short amount of time) has an arrangement with her husband that he will bring the child when she is on break, and she will go up in the middle of the break room, he hands her a massive pillow to rest her back on, and she throws a small blanket over her head so that she can feed the child. She feeds the kid for about 5 minutes, hands the kid back off to the father, and then will typically try again after a few minutes or she will just take the kid while the father eats. The father doesn't work for the company, he just brings the child on her breaks. He seems a bit anti-social or something similar as he always seems shifty when someone who works at the company tries talking with him, but he will make conversation every now and then. 

&#x200B;

We have a conference room that women typically go into if they were to pump or normally feed their children this way, however, she chooses to do so in the middle of the break room while other people are attempting to relax for a short while before going back to work. 

&#x200B;

If it were just me being uncomfortable, I wouldn't want to bring it up with management... however, after speaking with quite a few people (pretty evenly split between males and females), they also said that it made them uncomfortable. There are times where you can hear the child attempting to latch and you can hear the suckling on the skin, and you can hear the child whimper and cry. All we want is for her to breastfeed in the empty conference room where she already goes to pump. It just seems that, because I don't like to be too close to someone, I will take an open seat away from another person, and then she will come and sit down in that open seat next to me every single time I'm on break. If not EVERY time, at least every other. It's daily. 

&#x200B;

I talked with my girlfriend about it and she said that it is the mother's choice, and it shouldn't matter to me. 

&#x200B;

So reddit, WIBTA if I went to management with this issue because myself and others are feeling uncomfortable with her breastfeeding openly in the break room?

Edit: Alright I hear y'all. I could've done without some of the harsh words... but the point got across. 

No she isn't showing her tits and it is a natural thing. I found it awkward that the husband would show up just for that and then leave afterwards, but it's still not my place. Yes the gossip was unnecessary, but everyone gossips. There's been shit said about me too, but that doesn't give me the right. 

tl;dr: I hear you.

Edit 2: I've agreed with those who have opposed me and I've come to terms that i was in the wrong... and yet. These comments have become very toxic.

1603,Asshole,"Excuse bad English. About 3 months ago my 10 year old daughter begged me to let her learn piano, and  wouldn't take no for an answer. Since piano is too expensive I got her an electronic keyboard and signed her up for 6 months of keyboard lessons. The deal I made with her was that she was not allowed to give it up before 6 months and to practice 20 minutes a day, she agreed without thinking.


It turned out just as I expected, she got bored of it after 2 months and asked to stop the lessons. Ofcourse I turned it down and reminded her about our deal. She then started to make excuses to skip practice from time to time, often requiring me to remind her to practice extra time to make up for the times she skipped.


There is an upcoming school trip for my daughter and she is looking forward to it, it is a 3 days 2 nights trip. I told her that she can only go if she cleared the keyboard practice time she skipped previously. I can give her a break by not counting in the 3 days school trip, but even so she still has to practice the keyboard 1 hour a day to clear them all before the date.


She threw a fit after I made it clear that if she could not clear the practice time, she would not be going. My husband said that since we've already paid for the trip and she was looking forward to it, threatening to cancel it over keyboard practice is too harsh. I think it is an opportunity to teach her a lesson through, AITA?


Edit: For info, the trip is in 2 weeks time and would be 11 days of 1 hour practice. Since we paid for the trip we will be letting her go regardless, but she doesn't need to know that. She will be practicing under the impression that she may miss the trip, that gave her quite some motivation to do it, since she only practices about 1-2 times a week nowadays. She has accumulated 23 days of missed practices, minus 1 to fit the 11 day schedule.


Edit2: When I say we will be letting her go, it means that she will be practicing 1 hour a day till the set date, there is no actual chance of going back on our word because like it or not she will be going through this. Also, she wants the trip so badly that she get on with it thinking its her choice to make.",466,942,0.93

1605,Asshole,"I have three sons with my ex - 13, 18 and 22. My ex is a deadbeat mom. She has no job aside and lives off a trust fund even though she tells people that she makes her money from selling her shitty art.

We've been at odds over money and our kids ever since we split 10 years ago. She tends to indulge them and sets bad examples. 

Right now, her trust fund has tapped out and she has been living off credit cards. I refuse to help her or my eldest son. My eldest has no job unless you consider smoking pot, playing video games and playing music a job (he, like his mom, thinks he's the next great artist so he needs to be focused on his music and not work). 

My problem is with my middle boy. He had planned to go to college but decided not to go, but got a job instead. A dead-end minimum wage job. His job is 30 miles away and had no transportation. I was going to let him learn the hard way and have him come to me for help. I would have helped him get something better paying and get a Yaris or something.

Well, my ex went out and bought him a BMW on credit. They can't even afford to put a half tank of gas in the damn car so they hit me up for $60 a week. I refused. My son knows what's up. I'm not financially taking care of his irresponsible mother's bills. This is why I don't have a relationship with my eldest because I won't supplement his income while he tries to become the next Kurt Cobain or Eddie Vedder. Of course his mom just says I'm the asshole.

My middle boy is upset at me. I would shoot him cash here and there to make sure he can eat. Since he feels like I'm the asshole, then I should act like one and cut him off. Let him go hungry. Literally. I have zero financial obligations to him, my eldest or their mother.

My youngest lives with me full-time so he's very well taking care of.

TLDR: Ex wife's trust fund ran out of money and now she's broke. Won't change her spending, especially with our kids.

1608,Everyone Sucks,"My mum is in a wheelchair. She has mobility issues due to a bad leg and had surgery in March for this which she is still recovering from due to some complications. She has a bendable brace on at the moment and can walk with aids but uses her wheelchair for big days out. She is also cutting back on drinking heavily, no hard spirits, usually just beer.

This weekend is my towns Pride festival. I go every year and this year I marched with a group of people from my work. My mum usually goes with a friend but no one wanted to go with her this year so I said she can come with me but I'll have to push her around the march in her wheelchair first. She agreed so I brought her.

The march was fine, I pushed my mum around in her wheelchair. She seemed to enjoy the march, having her picture taken and waving at people as we walked past. My SO goined us after the March. 

We went into the festival and headed to the bar for some drinks. My mum has a cider with me and my SO which I dont mind as she doesnt get bad with cider. I do tell her that she probably shouldn't have any alcohol due to still recovering from surgery but shes an adult and I'm not her babysitter. 

I then take her to the toilet. She takes a little while in there, after we start walking around the stalls. This is when her behaviour starts to drastically change. She starts to try and stop the wheelchair with her hands, drags her legs along the floor as I'm pushing the chair, I ask her to stop and she starts shouting at me and screaming that she can do what she likes. 

She starts to push people in front of her as we are going through the croud, shouting ""If I could walk I'd walk behind you, but I cant so MOOOOVE"". Even though there was plenty of room in front of her. 

At one point she asks a medic on a stall how to do CPR, and when hes showing her on the dummy on the floor she shouts at me ""See, I told you I'd get him on the floor"" and laughs. 

I take her to the bathroom two more times and by the third time she seems extremely drunk but we haven't been back to the bar.

Shes making a show of me, shouting at me over nothing, calling me names, asking my SO inappropriate things and making them feel awkward and embarrassed.

I eventually tell her I'm taking her home after about 4 hours of her acting like this. She screams that I'm the one that wants to go home and I can go home by myself. So i left her there, in the middle of a park in PRIDE, and went to watch the acts on the big stage with my SO and a few people from work that I bumped into again. 

A few hours later while heading home I tell my SO that I feel guilty for leaving her and was worried about her getting home but I couldn't find her in the festival and our phones had died. 

I did see her as i was getting close to her flat and i approached her, took her inside and took her bags up to her flat so at least I knew she got home safely.

Husband is way more outgoing and social and thus has more friends and has told a lot of them about pregnancy and about our plans of getting married.

My close friend texted me and told me she now needs space from me to process that I got married without telling her and that she “got the wind knocked out of her by finding out on an envelope.” I explained to her that we basically told no one and did not want to make a fuss about it because right now us getting married is more of a legality, insurance thing. Our main focus is our baby and the celebration around that. Husband and I are attending a wedding in two months of a friend of his and two months after that a friend of mine is also having a wedding so as to not take away the shine of those longer relationships/ engagements/ long planned weddings we just didn’t want to announce that we eloped.

Bear with me on this one..

A few months ago my dad bought a new car, out of the blue, because it was cheap, he didn’t need a new car nor could he really afford it but he did it anyway. So I assumed he had sold his other to cover the cost..wrong!

He has kept this 10 year old car, on the drive, not moving not starting it up, for about 6 months with the promise it would be given to my sister (19) when she passed her test. 

That would be great and all, except my sister hasn’t shown any interest in driving at all since she failed her theory test. She’s on a low wage and can’t afford lessons, which makes me question if she could even afford to run the car.. I understand that she will eventually want a car when she can drive but from the looks of that’s years off. 

The car now doesn’t start (I just tried to move it off the drive so I can park mine - for context we have a 2 car drive and 3 cars, mine, dads and this shitty one, so one of us always has to park on the road). It’s just collecting dust, losing value and is just generally in the way - I can’t even wash my car because the hosepipe only reaches the first parking spot which the shitty car is in. 

To be honest the car would only be worth about £1k, which is actually money my dad could really do with as he’s currently separating from my mum so we’ve gone from a 2 income house (supported by rent from me) to a 1 income house and I pay more rent.

Sometimes I will light a vanilla candle after cooking, just to try and make it more pleasant, he then started to associate it ith food. I then discovered that I could not cook anything, light the candle, and then he would bitch piss and moan about curry smell. I.....may have had too much fun with that one, I lit candles every chance I got, so when he came home after I do he would get pissy.

Fry some garlic and ginger in mustard oil, ""that stinks"" fair enough

Toast some sichuan pepper corns ""ew what is that"" its....just some spices

Cook some onions ""what the fuck is that my eyes are watering"". This one was the last straw, because this dudes loves cooking onions on furnace level heat for his snags in bread.

Now I dont cook these things every day. My brekky is a cup of tea, an apple and raisin bread and my dinner is just spag bol.

After seeing the increased pile, I said I wasn't going to do all her cake dishes - I don't know why I think it's unfair that I do all the sudden extra dishes, I guess I'm just childish. 

She said that's fine, they'll get done tomorrow. 

My sister has an early start. Unless she's doing those dishes at 5am, I think she's just leaving them for mum or me to do in the morning. There's no way my mother will be able to just let them sit there all day.

So WIBTA if I just did the original dishes, left my sister's dishes, and basically let her get in trouble?",17,46,0.9

1620,Not the A-hole,"My ex and I had a really ugly break up. We haven't talked in a while, but some of my friends still follow him on instagram. Recently, someone told me that he got into a really minor car accident that he was laughing about on his car instagram. In the post, he stated that he had had a seizure while driving resulting in some minor damage to his car. I don't think he has any intentions of reporting this accident or reporting the cause of it. 

I don't know if he's changed, but when we were dating, he was an awful driver. He'd regularly go 140MPH on the freeway to scare me as a joke. He swore up and down that he was an experienced driver and that I needed to trust him. He did not have any seizures when we dated, but I know they were an untreated childhood issue that had the possibility of coming back. When we dated, he had a seizure scare and refused to go to the doctor because he didn't want his license revoked. 

WIBTA if I reported him? I know it's not ""my business"" anymore since we're no longer together, and honestly, I'm not sure if me doing this is partially out of spite for how awful the relationship was or not, but I'd hate myself if something like this happened again and someone innocent got hurt.

Edit to add that me saying he went 140 to terrify me as his idea of a joke was to give you an idea of what kind of person he could be. He was abusive, and I am terrified of any retaliation that could come out of this tbh. I know I am a coward for not doing this previously, but he was and is still someone who terrifies me. I'm not doing this purely out of spite, but I am unsure if some spite might (keyword: MIGHT) be part of my motivations to report him. I will either be filing a report to the DMV or calling the nonemergency number later today.",46,78,0.9

1624,Not the A-hole,"Quick backstory: I’m adopted. When I was 16 I met my biological mom. When I was 17 she told me she was pregnant and asked if I wanted “it”. A few days after I turned 18 she birthed my sister. Being 18 I did not feel comfortable taking on a newborn, especially as the sole caregiver; so I had to pass on raising my sister. She was adopted out to her biological dads sister. It was an open adoption.  Before my sister was 4, both her dad and our mom were dead. Her adoptive mother decided at that point that she was not going to tell her she’s adopted and that none of the family can see her. At our moms funeral I met 2 other sisters I had never met, and another brother. Our youngest brother was also there, but I had already met him. Sadly, we have another brother who passed away at 10, and 2 more siblings who are as lost as can be. (Police reports say they suspect that our mother sold those two on the black market -yeah, she had issues. That’s why we were all adopted out. All except the one who died at 10, actually.)

Present day: My baby sister turned 18 in early June and has no idea she’s adopted. I’m her sister and she has 2 other sisters and 2 brothers out here, and we all love her dearly and want to have contact with her. I did find her on Facebook and sent her a message wishing her a happy birthday, but I did not tell her the truth of who I am or how I know her. She hasn’t responded- probably because nobody responds to some stranger telling them happy birthday (especially when the birthday is not public on the profile, and she has never met me before.)

My question: will I be the asshole if I send her a second message saying (basically) “Hey. You are adopted. I am you sister. You have 5 more siblings who want to meet you. Sorry your mom didn’t tell you, but you’re grown up now and we want our sister back.”

???

EDIT: Since every single comment has said to talk to her mother, I need to make clear that this has been an ongoing conversation with her mom for 14+ years. Her mother will never tell her. Also that in an open adoption the adoptive parent has no right to keep that a secret. I absolutely refuse to never meet my own blood in person because some lady illegally decided she’s not allowed to know who she is. Also, in my last conversation with her mother she stated I could tell her whatever I want if ever I see her again, (implying that I won’t) so there is that.",104,195,0.88

1627,Not the A-hole,"Me and my friend (25F) go to the cinema a lot. She also uses her phone a lot. I rarely see her without her phone in her hand. She even uses it during films - we nearly always sit on the back row & she hides it in her bag so there's no glare but it's so annoying that people can't go 2 hours without checking their phone. I've never told her to quit it because she's quite literally my only friend and I'm too much of a wallflower. I know people are going to say ""YTA"" for this alone and I totally accept that. 

But this happened yesterday - I always drive us to the cinema, her house is en route (which is about 20 mins away). We are almost there, film is due to start in 10 mins and she realises she left her phone at home. To drive back for it would definitely mean missing the start of the film. I said no, it's too late. She said she needed it. I said we are seeing a film, she can go 3 hours without it. She said we could go back and get it and rebook the film for an hour later. I didn't want to do that. She admitted she's started talking to a guy and I feel a little bad because she's had a rough few months in the dating department.

Eventually she conceded and we saw the film but she was a little salty with me afterwards. I do feel quite bad and I admit to drive back for her phone would have been simple. The movie was a new showing so we could have booked a later showing easily. So AITA for not driving back?

1631,Asshole,"So obviously this is about a lot more than just the jokes but I wasn’t sure how else to title it

For context, I (20f) have a Jewish mom and an Irish catholic dad, and my siblings and I were all raised Jewish despite having a distinctly Irish last name. I’ve worked at the same coffee shop since I was 15 and get along great with my coworkers. We recently got a new hire, she’s around my age and has an obviously Jewish last name. The other night she overheard my coworker and I joking around, something about him not trusting Jews to count the tip money, (something we joke about frequently whenever I count my tips that he knows I’m fully comfortable with).
She looked upset and told us we were both way out of line and that we would be upset if she started openly bashing our religion. I politely told her that I was Jewish and would never joke about a religion/culture I wasn’t a part of, when she cut me off and said “you’re Jewish? You’re last name’s —” then glared at me. I explained my parents situation even though I didn’t really feel I owed her an explanation. Her response was essentially to tell me that it didn’t matter because no one could tell I was Jewish and so I don’t have to face the same kind of anti-semitism she does, basically that I don’t count as a full Jew and so I don’t understand how offensive Jewish jokes are. This hit a major sore spot for me as my mom was the only one in her family to marry a non-Jew which was looked down upon, and as a result I grew up very insecure about not being “Jewish enough” for the rest of my family despite a fully Jewish upbringing. She also went on to say she had lost family in the holocaust, something I could “never imagine”. This is when I interrupted her and started to go off and while I don’t regret it I do feel that some things I said may have crossed the line which is why I’m wondering if I need to apologize. 

I informed her that my great grandma had lost all 7 of her brothers in the holocaust and while it was horrific and traumatic it happened decades before I was born so I don’t go around throwing It in peoples faces like it’s a personal trauma for me. I basically told her that losing family in the holocaust doesn’t make you any more of a special or valid Jew and that if she wanted to spend her time feeling oppressed by dumb jokes then that was fine but I plan to continue having fun with my coworkers in a way that I don’t personally feel harms anyone. The thing is if she had asked me to stop making Jewish jokes because it made her uncomfortable then I would have, no questions asked. However her rudely questioning my Jewishness, telling me I haven’t experienced anti-semitism and basically just making me feel like an important part of my identity doesn’t actually belong to me made me lash out. I feel bad about the whole situation and will definitely talk to her about it next time we work together but I’m wondering how out of line I was. Thanks in advance for any advice!!
Edit: the store was empty at the time, we don’t joke in front of customers
Update: thank you everyone for the comments, I’m planning on talking to her today and apologizing and in the future will make sure to keep the jokes out of work!",578,1348,0.92
1632,Not the A-hole,"Since I could be really aware of things, about age ten, I started to realize how terrible my dad is. 

When I was in middle school, he had begun cheating and sexting women from Vietnam. This has continued for the past ten years since I was 10 and has spiraled into video chatting and even some financial support from him. He has been caught many times and has not stopped not does he intend on stopping. Around the same time, he started emotionally abusing me and my brother. Occasionally he would physically abuse us. He's the reason why my brother has developed anorexia and is malnourished and influence my brother to think 130 lbs at a height of 5'7"" (me) is fat.

Recently, I learned he is the heaviest financial burden on my mom. She pays for his bills more than my college tuition (which is saying something since I go to a private institution). She has paid for his insurance, debts, and the multiple car accidents he has been in. He eats food she buys and prepares. He doesn't help pay for any utilities he might use in her house. More than once, he has taken my mom's credit card to pay for things (once he even refuse to return it).

Now he is jeopardizing my brother's and my education. In order to pay all the debt and accidents off, our college savings my mom has been putting away since our first birthdays was used.

This man has not once taken any responsibility in anything he's done. In the years he has been taking from my mom and has never willingly given her anything (besides kids and even that was a ploy to have someone support him later).

1634,Not the A-hole,"We're both in our 30's and it's not that her kids are terrible. They're mostly well behaved but the younger of the two likes to (harmlessly) mouth off a bit. The last time I saw them he had said something ridiculous and while his father was lecturing him he said ""it's okay because (my name) laughed"" and my friends husband tone changed and we had to all sit there awkwardly while her kid got lectured. I felt bad because I don't know how to react to kids saying mildly bad stuff. (I forget that ""dumb"" and ""stupid"" are considered bad words)

&#x200B;

Even worst is that these are considered our ""girls night"" together since her husband works till later in the evening she is stuck with the kids (don't even get me started on recommending a babysitter because I went down that road). Also, I guess years of being a mother has trained her to knock back a few drinks and still be in full control while I knock back the same amount and the lines of being a responsible adult in front of children and hanging out with my girlfriend become blurred. It's not that I'm acting beyond inappropriate or drinking until I can't stand but I swear more often without noticing. I feel embarrassed after but she assures me it's fine since her kids hear worst on their online games.

I still feel strange going out to basically co-babysit her children until her husband gets home and even when he does, the kids still hang around us the entire night.

1638,No A-holes here,"We've got twins, Sara and Syed.  They're 14 and entering High School this year.  For clothes shopping, I decided I'd just give them some money and let them buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  I told them both I'd give them $300 now, and another $300 for Winter.  My idea is they're old enough to budget and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  They can spend the money online, or at the mall, whatever they want.  

&#x200B;

So they both said they wanted to go to the mall and I went with them.  I wanted to just let them loose, but my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  We had a few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  Figure out what you NEED, and what you WANT.  Find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  Then go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  

&#x200B;

Syed took my advice well.  He went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that he wanted.  He bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair of Vans on clearance for $30.  He had money left over so he bought a video game.  

&#x200B;

Sara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought what she liked.  All of the prices were reasonable so I didn't say much.  She actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) Syed did.  But Sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything she needed.  I told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed somewhere else?  She said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that wouldn't help.  I said oh well, thems the brakes.  You gotta budget better and prioritize.  She'll get more money in a couple of months.  She was unhappy.

&#x200B;

When we got home Sara cried to my Wife   She complained that its unfair her and Syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to clothes than boys.  She points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear, while Syed paid $0.  I actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and underwear that I paid for personally, separate from the $300.  Why does a 14 year old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  Obviously she already has underwear, and I'm giving her more money in a few months.  I would just buy her more underwear if she really needed it anyway.  

&#x200B;

Both Wife and Sara insist that Syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.  But as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching accessories.  Its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending enough to put them on the same social level.  I'm not sure if thats true.",2088,4162,0.95

I have to go online and pick up any open hours. Or so this is how it should work, at least. I opened our scheduling portal and noticed that there is an opening shift on a Saturday in an area I never work in at a time I can’t come in. I can’t open on Saturdays as a result of having a Saturday morning class for college.  I usually close 3-4 times a week. I bring this up to Brooke, my direct superior (all names changed here) and she said I needed to talk to Kate as this area I was scheduled in is Kate’s area of management and not Brooke’s. So I call Kate to talk to her about it and she said that this was a “key day” and that I magically needed to find someone to work the shift, switch with me, or call out and that there’s nothing she can do for me. I fail to see how this is my problem when they are not supposed to write hours in for me. The way it works for me is, if the hours are there to be had, I can have them.    To me, missing a day’s pay is ok, missing an hour of class is not because I can make the money back later by working more another time, I just can’t show up at the time they wrote this schedule in for me.",33,84,0.93
1640,Not the A-hole,"Edit:

**Few notes. The brother in law is so pissed off because he is basically the one on hook for the money. The parents fronted the money to the sister because she didn't have $500, and she doesn't work so as a gift the husband was going to pay it back for her incrementally. He is pissed that his wife didn't go to the show, and that I went instead, and that I should pay the parents back and not him.**

**Well, I think it's a little more complicated. See, I never spoke to the sister it was all done through my girlfriend. So she feels responsible. My girlfriend knows and understands that I didn't want to even go to the show. That's not disputed by her. Before this shit storm happened my girlfriend was thrilled that I stepped up and was willing to help. However, now that the shit storm has started her family is bullying her and she is afraid she won't get to see her neice and nephew. So she is pressuring me to repay the money ""because I had fun"" and to make the situation better. However, not only does the family want me to repay the sister they want me to also apologize.**

My girlfriend and her sister had plans to go to a concert for a very popular popstar playing at an arena about five hours away. The tickets were around $500 each. Now, I don't like this popstar's music, and I rarely listen to ANY music at all, and I don't like crowds. If I do listen to music it is heavy metal stuff, not POP. This is all well known, especially since I hate listening to music in the car.

Well, anyway, about an hour before my girlfriend and her sister was going to leave, her sister starts throwing up like crazy. Food poisoning. As you can imagine this threw a big wrench in their plans, especially since my girlfriend's sister was supposed to drive because my girlfriend is terrified of driving.

My girlfriend asked some of her friends, but since it was an hour or less before time to leave no one said yes. Well, my girlfriend and her sister are both devestated, so I chimed in and said I would drive my girlfriend to the concert which is a 10 hour round-trip drive, and said I would even give her sister $100. I offered the $100 because I felt really bad for her sister because they are not very well off and she saved up for these tickets. Well, the sister said yes and even thanked me and I didn't think anything of it. We went to the concert and believe it or not I actually had a little bit of fun, mainly seeing my girlfriend so happy. Not because of the show, more like despite it.

Well, the next day I get a text from a number I didn't recognize that said, ""I heard you had a great time at the show you piece of shit."" I was pretty dumbfounded, and it turns out it was my girlfriend's sister husband. He said, ""How does it feel to take advantage of someone vulnerable to get what you want, sicko?"" and ""You been dating Haley for two years now and my entire family hates you and now we don't have to pretend.""

It felt like I got punched in the gut reading it. So, naturally I immediately called my girlfriend and told her about the text messages, and I could tell she had been crying, and she said she has been fighting with her family for hours. Her family is insistent that I pay the sister $400 more dollars for the ticket, and to also apologize for taking advantage of the sister when she was desperate. I told my girlfriend that she knows I don't like that popstar or pop music at all, and only agreed to go because I felt bad for them both and didn't want her to miss out, and I offered her sister $100 just to be kind. My girlfriend agreed with me on all of that, but said it doesn't matter because I had fun and that changes things so I should repay her sister.

I feel like I am taking crazy pills. There is too much back and forth conversation between everyone to type it all out, but I have been dealing with this all day and I am exhausted. I didn't think I was an asshole, but now I feel so guilty that maybe I am missing something here. What should I do? Everyone is pissed at me. My girlfriend is begging me to repay her sister. I have turned off my phone.

To be clear, I made it before the show the only reason I was doing it was for my girlfriend, but after she show I told my girlfriend I had fun, so they are telling me the right thing to do is pay back the sister because I had fun.",185,183,0.96

Last year I started dating my girlfriend (32F). My mother is a very strict christian and doesn't approve at all (side note, my girlfriend is trans and you'd think that would cancel out because in her eyes she's a man therefore I'm in a heterosexual relationship... but logic doesn't seem to apply in christianity since I guess that just makes us double gay in her eyes) but since I pay the bills she can't really strong arm me into breaking up with her. 

Recently my girlfriend needed a place to stay because her apartment building was being renovated so I told my mother that I wanted her to stay with us. Predictably she completely freaked out at the idea saying that she would not be having sin under her roof. I reminded her that I'm paying most of the rent and living expenses but she refused to budge saying that it would be a bad influence for my sister (who is very comfortably straight anyway).

The conversation ended there but I wasn't just going to leave my girlfriend hanging. My mother being as controlling as she is had the lease be in her name even though I'm the one actually paying for it. So I talked with my girlfriend about the situation and we decided to just find a new place together. We also agreed that my sister could live with us for free if our mother lets us.

I brought up the new plan to my mother. She did not take it well at all. Asked me what she was supposed to do. I told her that my sister is welcome to stay with us but she would have to figure something out for herself, or she could decide to stop choosing to be homophobic (she loves saying we choose to be gay) and let my girlfriend move in. She's since shut herself up in her room and isn't talking to me or my sister. I told my sister what was going on and hugged her and promised she'd always be welcome to stay with me if I end up moving out.

The current plan is: If my mother doesn't budge I suspect she will end up homeless and I will then be able to call cps to make sure my sister ends up with me.

I moved the wet load into the dryer, to separate it from who's ever belongings were on top of the dryer and then did a load of my own laundry in the washing machine. The cycle normally takes about 30 minutes, I went downstairs after 40 minutes and nothing had been touched. I need to dry my clothes but need to move the load from the dryer to do that. The floor is gross, the only free spot was on top of the dryer, on top of the other person's wet load of clothes. That's literally the only surface in the basement that's not the floor. The washing machine has a lid on the top so putting it there was not an option as I'm doing another load in the washing machine.

However, halfway through the summer Roommate A picked up a cat from the shelter while he was back in our hometown without consulting either of us. Roommate B and I were at the apartment when A and his cat arrived. It soon became clear that Roommate B was very allergic.

He has offered partial solutions (paying for allergy meds, keeping his cat downstairs and paying extra rent, etc.) but I don't think any of those options really fix the root of the problem.

1648,Asshole,"I'm 18F and moving out to start my freshman year at college later this week. Tonight my college conversation with my father became more of a one-sided lecture about what I should do so he'll approve of me lifestyle. It ended with my dad looking me in the eye and saying very emphatically, ""No tattoos.""

Background info: I'm a feminist and very pro-choice. I believe in everyone's right to control their body, whether that be getting an abortion, their tubes tied, or even just a tattoo. My body, my rules, my control. My dad is the opposite. He was raised Catholic and is pro-life. The vibe that I get from him is that he thinks sometimes it's necessary for people in power to control others' bodies ""for their own good"".

After he told me that I would not be allowed to get a tattoo, I said, ""No promises. My body. My choice.""

My dad said to that, ""It's God's body.""

He and I went back and forth, me telling him that it's my body and I make the rules and him reiterating that he would not allow me to get a tattoo. Finally he said, ""Remember that I control the finances, specifically your finances.""

I asked him if he was threatening to pull my college tuition if I went against his wishes and got a tattoo. He said, ""I'm not saying that. I'm just reminding you that I control the purse-strings and I make the rules."" I asked him to tell me directly that he was not threatening my tuition. He would not give me a straight answer. I took that to be confirmation that he would pull my tuition.

This has me feeling very icky. It's demeaning and offensive, even over something as trivial as this. But I like tattoos! And why shouldn't I? I'm not talking about big, gaudy sleeves, I just like the tiny minimal black-ink designs that many of my friends have. I have an idea for one I think would be hard to regret. I'm a grown woman about to move out, and I'm also pretty smart. I'm responsible and smart enough to not get something I'm going to regret and to really think it over first.

I hate that my tuition comes with certain controlling stipulations from my father with whom I clash all the time. What else is he going to use the money to get me to do/not do? I get that he earned the money, but in my opinion it's disgusting and controlling to not pay for his child's education because she does something he doesn't agree with. I would rather pay myself and go into debt than take money that comes with strings to police my body while I'm not under his roof. I'm going to a private school with tuition that totals around $60,000 per year. I got scholarships, so my total is around $18,000. I might go into debt if I pay for it myself, but it won't be a terrible amount.

Am I the asshole? My brother said I am because my dad is paying for my college and I should stick to whatever conditions he puts on the money. I think it's gross policing of a grown woman's body, but I'm curious to hear what others think. I accept whatever judgement I receive. Thanks for the help.",137,47,0.72
1649,Asshole,"A bit of scene setting before I get to the point. My wife and I both work full time. We have two sons, 12 and 10. Two weeks ago we got two puppies. Things are hectic. 

As the end of the summer nears and my son’s friends return from various summer trips, my son asked my wife and me for a sleepover this coming Wednesday. Wife deferred to me and I said no. 

See, my wife is working late on Wednesday. I am working normal hours meaning I’ll be home around 5;30. We have a nanny but she expects to leave around the time I get home. Kids would already be at our house when I arrive. So I’d be in charge of 5 kids and two puppies until my wife got home (earliest 7 PM but almost certainly more like 8 or later). Even for a couple hours it’s a two-parent thing or chaos will take over. 

So as soon as I say no, my wife and son start bargaining with me about why it should be fine to do Wednesday, it’s not that big of a deal. Ends with my wife saying “you’d can’t just be a parent for one night?” implying, of course, that I’m not any other nights. This is important because to me, my decision was made in the name of good parenting. They can have the sleepover another night. 

So anyway, now my son thinks I’m an asshole, my wife only wants my opinion when it agrees with hers. The ways they’re both treating me ha me wondering if I’m TA here. Am I?",40,72,0.9
1650,Not the A-hole,"I work full time and go to school so he can work part time while he's in school. I didn't want him worrying about balancing a crazy work schedule and school, as he's struggled with school before, plus I am in my final year and only taking 2 classes per semester while he is in 13 credit hours. 

When we moved in, the expectations were that he would clean the apartment when home since he will only be working 3 days a week, 4 or 5 hour shifts. I work 5 days a week and work 7-8 hour shifts depending on the week and hour budget. I sometimes have to close at work and open at 7am the next morning.

We got into a huge argument today. He stated that if we were going to equally divide finances, he refuses to do any house work because at that point he is, in his eyes, equally contributing. I said that was BS, as he's home far more than I am and spends most of his free time out with friends or playing games, and I expected the house to be livable and cleaned since he spends MOST of his day here. I have been the one cleaning the kitchen, doing laundry, putting it away, moving things around, etc. for the entire time we've been here (even though he's been unemployed), so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't want to contribute cleanliness.

I conceded and said okay, I'll pay half of rent, electricity, and internet, but will need you to pick up more than half of the groceries bc I also have a car payment and health insurance I have to pay for on my own. His car and health insurance is paid by his parents. He said fine, but he still will not do housework. 

I am beyond mad. I feel like all of the responsibility of the house and finances have fallen on me even though we agreed that he'd take care of cleaning since he's the one with more time available to do so. I either suck it up and pay the vast majority of our joint bills, and maybe potentially have a clean home, or work full time go to school and clean a shared living space while my partner sits and plays games.

Tl;dr: I am working full time and going to school so my partner can work part time and focus on his education. We agreed, before moving in, that he would do the housework since he was home more. Now he's arguing that sharing bills is equal contribution and I will have to clean the house if I want it cleaned, even after 40 hour work weeks and my own classes. I'm working so he doesn't have to and now I feel like the financial AND household duties are all on my shoulders.

1652,Not the A-hole,"so I (24f) and my roommate (25m) have been living together for 6 months. 

recently he got a girlfriend who seems pretty nice (I've never properly met her) I've only said hi to her over facetime a few times. 

she recently found out that I dont really wear much clothing around the house, things like super long shirts and no pants or just a towel after having a shower, things like that. 
a couple of times I've wandered the house in a bra and undies but my roommate is normally to engrossed in his video games to watch. 

his new girlfriend dropped him off yesterday and saw what I wear, she has now asked my roommate to tell me to wear ""better"" clothing because she does not like me being half naked in front of her boyfriend. 

I've refused to do that but when my roommate told his girlfriend she flipped out and has refused to visit (I put clothing on when someone visits and she was told this)

she thinks that my outfits are not appropriate to wear around her boyfriend. 

AITA?

EDIT as some people have mentioned it. 

I've been doing this for ages and have wandered around both male and female roommates in my undies.

1653,Asshole,"A few weeks back, around the anniversary of the moon landing, a friend was questioning on Facebook that he has reservations about the film footage of the moon landing.  I, and others, asked if he was serious. I did not suspect any elaborate satire, and his SO made a rolling eye emoji as a comment.

After mulling it over, I decided it was just not worth it providing Google searches supporting the moon landing (he's a grown ass man) and unfriended him and his SO, who was collateral damage to avoid awkwardness.

Today, he messaged me, saying he valued our friendship and was sorry he caused offense, but didn't know why. I told him the reason why, told him I did not suspect it was satire, but let me know if I was wrong.  He hasn't responded yet.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: he just responded.

*To explain, it is somewhat satirical. When I took my Media and Communications course in my first year of my degree, we discussed Noam Chomsky and manufactured reality. Our prof posed the question: did the moon landing really exist—outside of what we have seen only in a photograph or video, can we actually verify this event occurred or are we simply following suit with the blind mindset of society, a manufactured reality. In the end, I couldn't answer the question with a definite ""yes, the moon landing occurred"". I am no flat earther by any means. And sure, I believe it is possible that the moon landing happened, I cannot say for sure that it did, especially with all the propaganda that emanated from the United States over the last century. My comments were an attempt to look at things outside of the photograph and video. I wasn't there when it happened. I wasn't even alive. But it has made me question everything I ever learned as a child. Residential schools, for example. We never learned anything about First Nations affairs in school, other than ""the Indians"" existed. I thought residential schools were special boarding schools. Nope. 
At any rate, I am so sorry my comments were so alarmist.*

1655,Asshole,"I (20M) have an irrational fear of people knowing that I am shitting. A fear which causes me to hold it in longer than usual, resulting in Godzilla sized mudpies when finally released.

Office shits are the worst and I loath the idea of them, but last week I went ahead and did the deed, knowing the possible outcome. It was a triumphant bastard if I've ever seen one. Started at the bowl and rising way above the water line. 10/10 clogger, but after 6 flushes and with 5 minute reloads I realised I was making no progress and missing out on work. There was no toilet brush there to poke it away, and I wasn't going to ask HR for plumbing advice. 

With my heart pounding I made a beeline for the exit, resumed my work and prayed nobody noticed my absence and that the next guy could flush it away..

About an hour later I heard someone chatter about a blockage - my adrenaline started rushing. An office wide email was immediately sent around to address the situation and mentioned how junior members of staff had to clean it up. Now the whole company knew and I couldn't have felt worse. I hate that people are labouring over my mess and moreso I hate the idea of people eventually figuring out I'm the one responsible, so I kept quiet.

I work data entry for an insurance firm, so people in this office are usually bored out of their fucking minds, but this conversation caused a buzz like I've never seen before. Speculation on who did it and hilarious eye witness descriptions have been the topic for days and show no sign of dying down. I initially kept participation to a minimum - overwhelmed with anxiety, but now i've started to settle into a weird sense of pride and joined in the banter. Even though no one likes to admit it - it's caused the biggest boost in office morale I've ever seen and the workplace has never been happier. 
Banter is at an all time high and I often hear roars of laughter from across the room on mention of the ""situation"". 

I know it was a terrible thing to do, but it worked out quite well honestly and I'm overcoming some personal fears in the course of it.

1656,Not the A-hole,"So it's been a fuppin awful week, hell it's been an even worse summer.

Two months ago my brother Paddy passed away after a short and brutal fight with cancer. 
My brother was raised Catholic but in his adult life was an atheist and specifically said he didn't want a priest when he was dying. 

But when it came to the last hours of his life My dad decided he was going a ""message"" and not wanting my old man to go out by himself when his sons dying I volunteered to go with him. When we pulled up at the church I was shocked but I knew my dad was a Catholic and thought okay he wants to pray. Fair do. 

So I'm sitting waiting on my dad and 5 mins later he walks out talking to a priest. 

He had decided to bring a priest to the house and organise a full Catholic funeral for my atheist brother. When I realised this I made sure to tell the priest my brother was an athiest and didn't want a Catholic funeral.
The priest said he understood and would come to the house to pray with my father anyway.

He was a lying fuck.

And thanks to his little chat, I missed my brothers passing by literally 1 minute. 

This of course rubbed me the wrong way but my brother had just died so I said nothing and just went about the motions of the next few days. Catholic wake with praying, full mass and Christian burial. Fucking everying my brother didn't want. But it was done and I was in shock so what could I do? 

Now, two weeks ago my other brother Danny, Paddy's twin. Got sick with multiple organ failure and unfortunately passed away yesterday. What are the odds of two twins dying from unrelated illness within 2 months? Who knows.

Now Danny was also an atheist and was upset with me that Paddy was given a full Catholic funeral against his wishes but he was broken after the death of his twin so I didn't want to upset him by going on about it. 

Then he dies and guess what my family has decided all upon themselves? Yeah, to give Danny a full Catholic funeral.

Now I've nothing against people of any faith, whatever gets you through the days is your business. But Catholics especially in my country are the biggest hypocritical cunts to walk the roads and talk the shite.

So I decided to tell my family I won't be attending Danny's wake or funeral. I'll go see him tomorrow morning and pay my respects but I had already sat with him holding his hand for his last week til his last breath. I said my goodbyes and made my peace with the man before he passed. 

Now my sisters and parents think I'm the biggest asshole in the world. My mum even asked me to apologise to my sister for being annoyed today and to not cause any problems at the funeral in front of the extended family.

I had no intention of starting any trouble or arguments at the funeral because I've no intention of going.

1658,Not the A-hole,"EDIT:  So we had an emergency meeting today. The bride, me and her mum. They were VERY supportive and concerned that I was uncomfortable with the dress she had chosen, (turns out another bridesmaid had similar issues) so they wanted to go shopping with me to figure out what I would be happy to wear. I was REALLY touched that they did this. We ended up finding a beautiful dress (that is actually stretchy and a little tight, haha, but NOT bodycon) and all the other bridesmaids loved it. It is very elegant. So we’re going with it. 

I didn’t mention anything to her about her fiancé’s fb post. I’ll just bring that up to him directly. She is not responsible for his actions. 

Thank you SO MUCH for all your support and comments. I’m so very touched. 💛🧡❤️

__________________________________________________

Hi guys, so this is my first post ever. I’ve been a long time lurker and upvoter, but this quandary has forced me to finally sign up for an account. 

A little backstory- my very good friend is getting married next year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was initially hesitant because I’m not American and I wasn’t sure about what my responsibilities would be. I was upfront about my questions and told her I needed some time to research it, which she was completely fine with. She even said she appreciated that I didn’t say yes immediately. In my culture weddings are a very different affair from what I’ve seen the weddings here are like, but I love my friend to bits (we are like family now) and I wanted to be there for her in an official capacity, so I agreed. 

So we’ve been talking about bridesmaid dresses and for the longest time she was very clear that she wanted us to all wear a single colour, but for us to choose our own dresses. Dresses that showcased our own design sense and that we would be able to wear again. We were all in agreement over this- until 2 days ago when she said she’s found the perfect dress for all of us and sent us a link. 

This dress is SO body con that it looks like it’s been spray painted onto the model. Guys. I just can’t. This is SO FAR out of my comfort zone.  I have never worn something like this in my life. I panicked and quickly sent her a few other option that were similar styles, but more forgiving (as a private message, not in the bridesmaid group chat)

She blew up at me and basically said she changed her mind about us having different dresses and has been so stressed about about this and I should just buy a larger size if I’m so conscious and she will lend me shapewear. And that it’s only for the ceremony and pictures and then I can change.

Now I completely understand that this is a box she needs to tick and not think about again. And also that she genuinely loves the dress and thinks we will all look good in it. But I feel like I’m being forced to wear a bikini or be naked. Because that’s how tight it is. That’s just the style. If I buy the largest size possible it’s just going to look awful. As awful as wearing the correct size. 

I’m so torn about this. I don’t don’t want to seem like a selfish asshole, but I draw the line at this. How should I handle it? 

And also, her husband to be updated his Facebook status this morning after my chat with her, saying he couldn’t understand how one selfish person can ruin it all for so many people. I’m pretty sure he’s talking about me and I’m really hurt.",168,806,0.98
1659,Not the A-hole,"I turned 20 today. My plan for a few months has been to go spend the day with friends and then have dinner and cake with my parents later in the day. 

That’s not what happened. My mom asked me about three weeks ago what kind of cake I wanted, and I said “anything is fine as long as it’s not that dumb mermaid or unicorn stuff that I hate.” For reference, my niece got a mermaid cake when she turned 10, so i obviously did not want one like that. So two days ago my mom comes home super excited and tells me to guess what kind of cake she ordered and I jokingly said “i hope it’s not mermaids!” and she got extremely angry and accused me of not being grateful and ruining her plans. 

Now i woke up today and she had made me a shirt with my name and a mermaid on it that she made me wear to dinner, made me put up my own mermaid decorations she bought, and went through with the mermaid cake. She also didn’t allow me to go out with any friends because “birthday’s are family time” despite the fact I had planned to spend the evening with her anyway. 

Another thing I am a bit upset about is the gifts. For her birthday, i got her several things (7 or 8) and took her to dinner/ got her favorite kind of cake. But today, she got me one thing (school related), and complained about how expensive dinner was (i didn’t ask to go somewhere expensive- she picked the restaurant. I literally asked for steak ‘n shake which is like $20 for the whole family.) I’m not super upset about the lack of gifts because I understand money is a bit tight right now, but she literally screamed at me two years ago on her birthday when i only got her three gifts (before i had my current job). 

I am grateful for the dinner and the gift she got me because it’s something i’ll use daily, but I feel like she ignored everything I explicitly stated I wanted/didn’t want to do what she wanted to do. She basically used my birthday as an excuse to try her new arts and crafts equipment she’s been buying (card making and stuff like that) and made me sit at home all day while she did it instead of letting me hang out with my friends. I’m wondering if i’m the asshole because she’s really mad at me for “not being enthusiastic and grateful” but I feel ignored and like I wasn’t listened to.

1660,Everyone Sucks,"This is the first time I’ve actually written on this sub, so please tell me if I’m doing anything wrong. I am on mobile, so forgive my spelling or grammar errors and bad formatting. TLDR at the bottom.

I have quite bad social anxiety disorder and random waves of depression that requires medication to control. I keep my medication in a box marked with the days of the week (I forget what it’s called) so I can keep track of it. I used to keep it in the family bathroom. Unlike my parents and my younger brother, me and my sister don’t have an ensuite but we do have a rather fancy bathroom that my mum likes to keep clean for guests and stuff.

A couple of months ago my medication box kept getting moved. Usually I’d find it in the cupboard under my sink. One night, however, it took me a while to find it. In the process I suffered a panic attack. While the medication isn’t a cure-all, it helps manage my anxiety so it’s not going off 24/7. The last time I couldn’t take it was when I forgot to refill the prescription (hence the box) and I ended up relapsing. I messaged my boyfriend and he managed to calm me down until I found it. I took my medication and left a note stating not to move my medication without my permission.

That very evening it had been moved to my room. To release some of my anger and anxiety, I vented about it online. I didn’t blame anyone in particular, I didn’t say any names, and was very sarcastic.

Turns out it was actually my mother who moved them. She told me I shouldn’t have vented about it and kept it private. I explained that the box was important for my social anxiety (which she didn’t know about until now) but she brushed me off saying she knew for a while. She then told me that she was moving the box to protect me and that those types of things shouldn’t be left out in the open, especially for potential guests to see.

I’m conflicted. I want to leave it out in a place that I only visit a few times a day so I don’t get disensitused to it, but I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle. My mum essentially thinks it’s poison and is now telling me now and again that it’ll disable me if I take it for too long and that I should “get out and talk to people” to get over my mental illness.

TLDR: Mum moves my social anxiety medication without telling me. After panicking I vent about it online (without naming anyone or blaming anyone in particular) only for her to get offended and claim I shouldn’t discuss this in public or leave medication like that in the open.

Am I the asshole? I know I’m not 100% innocent here, but I’m conflicted as to whether or not I’m blowing this out of proportion.",61,127,0.91

1662,Not the A-hole,"Just for starters I really love my baby brother but I grew sick of looking after him every week. This began in the half of my summer break.  My mother works late every day and his dad came home in the afternoons. So as expected I took care of him most of the time. I enjoyed spending time with him and trying to teach him to talk. He also adores me very much that he comes looking for me during the nights in my room. 

However, his father has the end of the weeks off so I expect him to take care of him. But he always puts him off me by being on his phone all the damn time or going to the gym for an hour. He always asks me if I fed him or changed him which reallys gets me pissed off. In the end I'd endure it and took care of my brother again. The only times I have the days off are sundays afternoons when his dad takes his son to go outside. 

Anyways school started this week and it's finally the weekend. I try to start my comic I've always wanted to draw before i got interrupted by my baby brother. I played his cartoon on my laptop so I could start drawing before his dad comes out of the room and tells me he's gonna move the truck. He doesn't come back after an hour or so to eat. Then he tells me he'll be back and leaves. He came back after three hours and I had to take care of my brother during the times he was gone which got me really angry and stressed

My sister's boyfriend came into the room and told me it was sick what his dad and my mom were doing and i should face them so I did. When they both came home I angrily told them I was sick taking care of my brother when it was his dad's days off and the only time I'd be willing to take care of him is when he's not here. I also told him he's not acting like a dad. They both looked pretty angry after I told them.

 I stormed off and heard my mom whispering to my stepdad how he should lock himself in his room with my baby brother so I could stop complaining about how he takes care of him. That statement made me breakdown.

1663,Not the A-hole,"There is a build-your-own pizza place in my neighborhood that I go to a lot, and sometimes use DoorDash in order to place orders ahead of time to pick up. It’s always been established there (and all other restaurants I’ve gone to) that customers who have placed DoorDash orders or called ahead skip the (usually long) line, come to the front register, give their name/info and are given their order.

Just a couple weeks ago, I noticed a new employee at the restaurant who I believe is a new supervisor. He’s an older guy who looks to be in his mid/late 50’s, and to be honest I really don’t like the way I’ve seen him speak to a lot of the employees. He has a sharp tone and a coldness about him I haven’t really liked that much.

The other day, I placed a DoorDash order online and went over at the time it said it would be ready to pick it up. I went to the front register as I always do when I order online, and the new supervisor (who was at the register today ringing people up) pointed at the long line and said sharply, “There’s a line.” I told him I ordered via DoorDash, and he responded, “That’s fine. You still have to wait your turn.”

I insisted that that’s not how DoorDash/order-ahead works, and he just kept telling me to go to the back of the line, speaking to me as he rang up customer after customer. I continued to stick to the front register, eyeing him and refusing to budge. After a few minutes he huffed, gave up and told the first customer in line, “Sorry, hold on a minute.” He asked me for my name and got me my pizza, and scowled at me bitterly all the while.

Was I in the wrong for standing my ground and not going to the back of the line? I understand no one likes “cutters”, but it’s always been policy that order-aheads go to the front since it usually takes like 15 seconds or less to give them their food. Was I an asshole?",153,972,0.97

1670,Asshole,"Background: I live on a relatively quiet street but because of the way the street runs has somewhat limited parking.  At my apartment I have a carport with that can hold 2 cars tandem.  The house across the street has a couple of renters and the landlady has told the renter that the public parking space right in front of the house is ""his"".  I parked there one day and he saw me and asked that I not park there that it was ""his"" spot.  I told him I didn't agree that it was ""his"" spot, because it's a public street and parking, but I said I would do my best to honor his request.  The neighborly thing to do.

On to AITA: The other day I was running around and had to swap cars around and I parked in ""his"" spot and went about doing my thing.  My car did sit there overnight and when I went to leave early the next morning there was this note on my windshield:

Tripp, Please don't park here. You have available parking in your carport.  Please don't force EJ to have to park down the street away from our house. It's really unnecessary and unneighborly.  Karen

Now I have the desire to park there ALL the time as my next door neighbor got a similar note on her windshield because she parked in front of the front gate (still public parking).

So 2 questions here:

1. AITA for parking there once?
2. WIBTA if I started parking there all the time?

EDIT/UPDATE:

While I agree with most people on here the once or twice is not an issue and does not an asshole make the parking there for spite is a dick move.  My primary issue with Karen is the expectation that under any/all circumstances I should not park there and that she and her tenant are entitled to that spot.",34,56,0.89

1673,Not the A-hole,"Ok so recently some friends and I were at a MLB game and it's probably worth noting my friends and I are not American. So at the start they had a military hero of the week or game or something and people stood up an applauded him. I did not. My friends all said I was an asshole and disrespectful. When I told my girlfriend she said the same thing. 

Now to plead my case, I have nothing against the military individual at the game. I don't think any higher or lower of anyone regarding their profession or anything like that. I don't agree with the war for a number of my own personal reasons and the issue I have in this case is the (in my opinion) propaganda phrases like ""defending our country"" and ""fighting for our freedoms"". I hear these things in my own country too. And I think the term hero should be in regard to people who do deeds that help the world and the people in it. These are my own views so please respect them and if you would like to debate them I am more than happy to do it elsewhere. 

So I didn't want to participate in something like this. And from memory about 20-40% of the people around us didn't stand and clap either, they continued eating drinking and chatting with those around them.

1675,Asshole,"My(20m) girlfriend(20f) and I both started making our own sextapes out of frustration with how fake most porn is. My girlfriend was the one who came up with the idea, but she was still a little reluctant to go through with it because she said watching how many girls she knew get exposed and have their life’s turned upside down from revenge porn was horrific. I assured her that I’d never do something like that, so we made our first sextape and it was AMAZING. We’ve continued to do so for the past year and now we have our own little library of sextapes. However one of the rules she made when making the tapes is that she can only keep them in her possession, so all of our tapes are on her phone and her computer. This was fine in the beginning, but whenever I ask to watch the tapes, she has to be with me to insure I don’t send it to anyone or myself. This would be fine if we lived together but we’re both dorming and trying to watch the tapes with her and dodge her roommate means I only get to watch them in a slim amount of time. I’ve become so used to these tapes, that porn doesn’t really get me off the way it used to. So last week while she was in the shower I sent the folder she keeps our tapes in to myself. When she came over yesterday and used my laptop, she found out I sent it to myself, I sent it to myself via email and my gmail is always logged in. We got into a huge fight and I tried explaining the situation but she wasn’t having it. She said that these tapes could ruin her life and that her face is in all of them, and that I betrayed her trust. I told her the tapes aren’t just hers my face is also in them and they could also destroy my life. She said it’s different, that I’m a guy so I wouldn’t be as affected but, I disagreed.

I have it setup to move back up to minnesota to help my grandpa farm and then move on with my life, or stay there and help him long term.

1680,Not enough info,"I own a US based clothing store/boutique. We currently have 5 stores open. Recently, one of my employees had a creepy experience with a customer where the customer looked her up by her name on her name tag — it’s a unique name. The customer began sending creepy messages pretending to be a “secret admirer”. Once the guy was found, the employee came to me to explain what happened. I offered her PTO to recover and asked her for ideas on how to stop this in the future. She said having employees wear fake name tags could help.  
 
After, I talked to my business partners, my wife, and a few other women in my life I decided that starting next week (last week) I would require employees to wear fake name tags. I gave a selection of names, but said they could chose any names they wanted as long as no one at their store was actually named that (including themselves). I required fake for all employees (male and female/common and uniquely named people) to be inclusive.  
 
This was met with a lot of backlash. We had our weekly meeting with the store managers and myself. All the store managers said the employees hated this idea. They didn’t see why they couldnt be themselves at work. There was also complaints that list of names I chose did not include any traditionally POC names.  
 
I told the managers to ask for name suggestions to add to the list, to remind their employees that they could chose their own names, and to tell them the plan was to keep the policy like this for a month and to readdress the policy at the end of the month. I also sent out an email to all employees stating the above and included that I was open to suggestions over email and available to come talk to individual employees if needed.  I opened a way to anonymously email me as well.
 
I got emails. Some were name suggestions. Some legitimate and others were racist names like “bonquiqui”. I got emails complimenting the fake name idea. Others complaining it was SJW BS. Others complained this is a huge cooperate trying to strip their employees of everything, even their names.

I have had this silly idea for an April Fool’s prank for a long time, and I’m not sure if it crosses any kind of line...

1. She comes home after work on or about our late-March anniversary to see me with a bandage on my upper back, excited to show her something I got! My first tattoo!

2. We peel the bandage off, and it’s a tattoo with a heart surrounding her name....with two letters transposed. Only I know at this point that it is a high quality temporary tattoo that I will have ordered.

3. She thinks I’m an idiot because I let it happen and wasn’t able to see the misspelling due to the bandage and due to it being on my back. Also, I think she would generally be a little horrified even to see her name spelled right on a tattoo.

4. April first, or anytime before that feels right (including immediately), or as soon as I can’t keep a straight face anymore (probably immediately if I know myself), I tell her it was a temporary. And then we...laugh about it?

5. This is not in any way a substitute for an actual anniversary gift I will have gotten her.

Anyway, I haven’t made any moves on this. The safety valves on this are 1) the fact that I and not her are the idiot suffering the consequences in the pretend scenario 2) that at any time I can end the joke if I read the room that way.

1684,Asshole,"My wife grew up in a small community and I grew up in several large cities on the east and west coasts of the US. We met at art school - she went for fine art and I went for theatre. In my theatre training we were drilled on proper pronunciation. While I'm not perfect, I think I'm fairly intelligible.

My wife is an outstanding artist, and expresses herself visually in ways I couldn't comprehend being able to. In some ways I'm quite jealous of her abilities. She has a good vocabulary, too. She's taught me words and drawing techniques and I've attempted to use them in my daily life.

However, in her community, she picked up one of the regional traits we were ""warned"" about in speech classes - the i / e substitution. Basically, she'll pronounce words like ""pillow"" as ""pellow"", while she prounounces ""pen"" as ""pin"", and ""lemon"" as ""limon"".

On its own, I find it endearing. But, we have a kid. Our kid is starting to pick up the same substitutions, pronouncing ""milk"" as ""melk"", ""pen"" as ""pin"", and it drives me up a wall. I have no ethical issue with correcting my young learner, but I've also tried to extend that to correcting my wife when I hear the same idiosyncrasies.

Then there's just plain old terminology. Today she asked if I could barbecue up some hotdogs and hamburgers. To me, BBQ is a specific style of meat prep, with sauces and low heat and particular meats. You don't barbecue a hotdog, you grill it. So I corrected her - for clarity. Of course, I've now been banished to my office and am typing this up for a public consensus.

Show me the way, the truth, and the light, dear experts.

EDIT: She also spells things the way she pronounces them. She reads prolifically, but she was never taught to look up spelling and so she writes stuff phonetically- really tough when she puts a shopping list together and I have to text her photos of the list with “what’s this say?” and it’s supposed to be “cauliflower“ or something but it’s spelled in a way I cannot understand.

Also, she gets on my case about doing math in my head. Often, I can’t add two two-digit numbers in my head, and she things I’m joking when I say I need a calculator.

Edit 2: For the curious, she’s from the San Juan Islands in NW Washington State. I’m from Seattle. Geographically, they’re about 90 miles apart. Other people on the island do not talk like that, but her mother does. Her father is also from Seattle and doesn’t have the speech pattern. I’ve lived in Boston, SoCal, Chicago, and the Florida Keys, and have been around plenty of American dialects, which, when it’s regional, I don’t have a problem mentally parsing because I expect it in context. Since we’re both from the same area, it’s unexpected and 98% of everything we say to each other is the same dialectic.

I have a flat western American dialect and so does she. We both went to public schools and the same college of art in Seattle.

She’s still an artist, but I am now a computer scientist, and have developed a sensitivity to ambiguity.

Edit 3: she asked me to barbecue for a party, so I started putting a shopping list together and it had ribs and wings, and she says, “no, just hotdogs and hamburgers“.

Edit 4: thanks everybody for the feedback. I think it’s safe to say that I’m the asshole and should curb the corrections. While a few of you sympathize, and while I maintain it isn’t regional or dialectical, there’s probably no changing her pronunciation, and she likely can not hear the differences.

Cheers!

UPDATE: Now that I've been unbanned (for being argumentative, thanks) I wanted to post an update. I've taken the asshole label to heart, and it's really changed my outlook on my biases and what is normative to me vs. what's socially acceptable. I think I held on too much to my former lifestyle, and I have come to terms with the fact that her little idiosyncrasies are among the reasons that she is endearing to me. I won't be suggesting alternate pronunciations anymore.

Additionally, I am putting my own upbringing into another perspective. I was corrected A LOT, for various things, spelling, syntax, and pronunciation among them. While I believe they were important corrections that helped make me who I am today, and I also believe my folks corrected me out of love and desire to see me succeed, that's not how I come across when I do it to my wife. 

So, thanks. I don't know that Reddit is a common place to fulfill therapy from strangers, but I definitely think this post will serve me and my loved ones well, far into the future.

1687,Not the A-hole,"My question is just as it sounds. My boyfriend (24M) and I (27F) bought a decent sized house 3 months ago. Before moving in, we settled on a basic rule that no one besides us are allowed to live in our house. If someone is in dire need of a roof over their heads, they can stay for a night or two, but they are absolutely not allowed to be bringing in more than what they will need for that short amount of time. We have space for more people, but we have a child and are also very introverted. 

The reason I’m questioning this is because within the last 3 months, 2 different people in different situations have asked to live with us for “short” amounts of time. When I’ve said no, explained the reason, and said they could stay overnight and I’d help them make other arrangements, I’m met with less than pleased responses, and I generally feel horrible about it afterwards. 

It’s not that I don’t want to help my friends and family, but every single time I’ve known someone to let someone move in for a month or two, it’s always turned out to be 6 months to a year. At least one person in the situation always gets upset at the arrangement, and it never, ever goes as planned. There’s always a ton of resentment from one end or the other, and it’s just something my boyfriend and I have mutually agreed that we’re just not willing to put our family threw.

I understand that this means that if the roles were reversed that people wouldn’t allow me or my family into their homes either, and if it were me, I feel like I would completely understand that they would have a similar rule. I, of course, hope it never happens to us and I have all the sympathy in the world for people in that tough spot, but does it make me the asshole for having the rule that no one can move into our house?

Edit: I think my question more is about having a true rule about situations such as these. When I say we do, even in passing, it’s usually met with, “You have a RULE about it?” and a disgusted look.",38,85,0.9

Now Sawyer is a funny and smart guy himself, but also quite the introvert and very picky about his friendships; and he just doesn't particularly like Sarah... he doesn't hate her, he just doesn't want to be friends with her.

Even though it's never been outright said, Sarah is quite aware of this. And because I'm the main link between the two of them, for the last two months a frequent subject of discussion with Sarah is ""Oh OP, I just want Sawyer to like me! Has he said anything to you? I don't even want to be super close with him, I just want us to be friends! Why doesn't he like me?"" I usually just went the ""I'm sorry Sarah, I don't know what to tell you because I can't really share how he feels and I can't force him to tell you. I think you just have to roll with it"" route.

But yesterday, I was having a really bad day. I decided to hang out with Sarah to try to cheer myself up; and, lo and behold, there she goes again about Sawyer. And I just couldn't take it.

""Sarah, I don't know what you want me to tell you! He doesn't want to be friends with you, okay? Can you just put your ego aside for a second and understand that you can't always get what you want?

I've also been flying to the east coast a TON to help my parents through my dad's treatment and my mom's shoulder surgery. For full disclosure, we are splitting the cost of the wedding between my parents, my fiance's parents and my fiancee and I.

I have never been to a wedding where the parents of the bride and groom have their own private dance. However my parents didn't have a big wedding and given the past year I wanted them to have a ""first dance"" like experience. I'm a singer, and I even arranged with a local musician to arrange my dad's favorite song and record me singing.

It was supposed to be a surprise, but my mom just assumed it was standard and told my dad about it. He still doesn't know about the recording, but I specifically told her it was a surprise, and a gift and not to tell him. I'm sure that message was lost in a bottle of chardonnay as she has been drinking very heavily lately. She has done functionally 0 to help me plan, which is fine, but I just needed her to help me manage my Dad.

Now my Dad is acting super entitled about this dance. He doesn't like where I put it in the schedule because our guests will be eating dinner through the programming so we have time to party.

The podcast was his idea and he's more or less the main host, but I'm the co-host and we both appear on every episode, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with other friends. But about a month ago, Mark brought in his girlfriend, Meg, and she added absolutely nothing to that episode. We were discussing the Phase 4 of MCU films and during our conversation, Meg just randomly interrupts and asks ""Is Batman in the MCU?"" The whole episode was just her asking really dumb questions like that and Mark had to explain to me that she doesn't really follow movies as close as we do. I asked him why he even brought her on, and he said ""She wanted to be on, so I said yes."" I even told him that our podcast would benefit from having guests who are more knowledgeable on movies and he said that he'll try to explain that to her.

Ever since then, she's been on every episode we've done and our podcast has been taking some heat for it. Comments have been left telling us that she's detrimental since she rarely knows what she's talking about and she always interjects with comments and questions that make no sense. For example, a few weeks ago we were talking about Hobbs and Shaw and Meg kept referring to Idris Elba as Chris Rock. We kept having to correct her and she said ""Didn't a movie with Chris Rock just come out?"" We had no clue what she was talking about and it was really frustrating. Whenever she's not making stupid comments, she's always interrupting with some non sequitur, like one time when she randomly asked if soup counts as a drink while we were discussing the new Zombieland 2 trailer.

But a couple of days ago is when things got ugly. Me, Mark, Meg, and a couple of other friends were on the show and we were suppose to be giving our thoughts on Ready or Not, but Meg seemed to be upping her interrupting, non sequitur game. I was trying to give my thoughts on the movie, but Meg was taking selfies and kept asking Mark what she thought of them. I was really trying to control myself, but she just kept interrupting me with questions like ""What's this movie even about?"" and ""Are we ever getting another Titanic movie?"" It reached a point where I was trying to talk and she interrupted by asking ""Have any of you guys ever been to Paris?"" I lost my temper and shouted ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" at her. And while we were still recording, Mark yells at me to not talk to her like that and I started yelling that I'm done with the show. 

I stormed out and called Mark later, telling him that I'm no longer going to be part of the podcast if he keeps bringing Meg on. I explained that she's affecting our views, but he said that she keeps asking to be on and he doesn't want to say no to her. I reiterated that I'm going to quit if he keeps letting Meg on and then he accuses me of ruining our podcast and that I'm ""going too far.""",776,8989,0.92

1697,No A-holes here,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about ten months now and we’ve only met a couple of each other’s friends during that span. One of my friends invited me to his house for a day of board games and video games, which we do once every couple of months. Normally it’s 4 of us guys and our girlfriends, I had never brought mine so I thought today would be the perfect chance. I invited her and she agreed but the day before she asked for details on the day.

I told her it would be a long day with about 7 other people, usually these hangouts go from 2-10pm or so. My girlfriend has pretty bad social anxiety, which I fully understand, but to me the best way to deal with it is to go to frequent hang out sessions to get comfortable with folks. She thought it would only be a couple of hours and told me she doesn’t think she can take 8 hours of socializing. I said that’s quite alright, feel free to leave whenever you would like, we’ll just have to take our own cars there. She got upset and felt that I should leave with her. I told her that that was silly and we can just make up an excuse that she needs to leave early for another commitment. She hated that idea and was adamant I should leave with her, she didn’t want to lie to my friends. I tried to reassure her that my friends are all super chill and very welcoming, and since we’ll be playing games it’ll be an easy way to bond and get to know my friends quickly.

1699,Not the A-hole,"Fiance ""John"" and I are getting married in a month.  We need some perspective on something:

John has a friend that he's known for 10 years, ""Ralph."" They started a business together with another guy a couple years back.  Pretty quickly, Ralph became destructive and toxic, and a pattern of behavior developed where he would cause problems in the company so that he could then solve the problems and look like the savior. A number of people struggled to work with him, and his immaturity caused a lot of problems in the workplace. He would try to act like the ""protector"" of John, while simultaneously going behind his back and creating divides against him.

John is non-confrontational, so this all just slowly ate away at him, but he carried on. 

In January, Ralph and I went out for drinks and he started talking shit about John--to me! He did it in an underhanded, manipulative way, and a lightbulb went off for me that Ralph was a shitty person. I told John when I got home and let John know that I was not going to have Ralph as a friend in my life. I was OK with whatever relationship John wanted to have with him, but I was all done. I didn't initiate contact again with Ralph and the next contact I got was shortly after this, when invitations to our wedding went out. Almost immediately after getting the invite, Ralph RSVP'd ""decline,"" with nothing else--no note, no ""sorry I can't make it,"" nothing. Shortly after, Ralph got in a spat with some people on the board of the company and flippantly resigned, while writing an email to the board and top people in the company essentially blaming John for all of his grievances and basically saying he had no faith in the company and could have done it all better. It was a rollercoaster. 

3 months passed from this, and I got a text from Ralph randomly asking if I wanted to grab a drink. I replied letting him know that I did not want to see him and that I was really hurt by everything he had done and pointed out the declining RSVP and his behavior around resigning as the last straw; I made it clear I didn't want to be friends, and wished him well. 

John came to me the other day and said I should really ""invite"" Ralph to the wedding. I reminded him that we did invite Ralph, and Ralph declined. He said he knows, but that he has a feeling Ralph is upset about losing our friendship.  I have a feeling that John wants Ralph there, because he brought this up. While I don't want to stand between Ralph and John's friendship, I do feel a bit protective over John and like John is forgetting how shitty Ralph treated us both and is making excuses for him. John sometimes does this, and then repeatedly gets burned by people. From my perspective, Ralph caused all of this, and I've done nothing except set a boundary. I refuse to reach out to re-invite Ralph.

1700,Not the A-hole,"She's getting married in December and she and the groom (30m) want me as a groomsman. They had us go to get suits and the idea is that all the groomsmen and bridesmaids wear different shades of light to medium blue and the groom wears navy. They found a suit shop that sells suits that are identical but come in all different colours. Their son is in a baby blue one, his older brother in slightly darker shade, then his cousin in a slightly darker shade than that, then me in a darker shade than that, and his best man is in a normal shade of blue, with the groom in navy, so it starts really light and gets darker until you get to the groom. I have to admit it looks cool when you get the full effect. It's all a really delicate colour scheme that I cannot be the one to mess up, and as the suits have to be identical aside from the colour they all have to be bought at the same place, and it's just too expensive.

Just the jacket and trousers come to about £240, the shoes are another £100, the waistcoat is around £75, the shirt is £55, and the tie and pocket square come to £25. This outfit, (which I will never wear again after this as it's really uncomfortable) costs more than double my entire wardrobe. The store also charges extra for tailoring, which I think is a rip off when I'm already being asked to put nearly £500 towards a suit. I've also found out they want to do a destination bachelor party (Vegas) and we're all expected to pay our way.

I don't have this kind of money, simple as. I found a suit online that wasn't exactly the same but looked a lot like it in the right shade of blue and asked my sister if this would work, and she blew up at me, saying it was her wedding and she needed me in uniform. I said I couldn't afford it and she said she wouldn't pay for it, when I never asked her to. Our parents asked why she was mad at me and I told them, and they're on her side, saying that I should just buy the suit, but I literally don't have the money. I am barely scraping by, my account is in overdraft, and I don't even have money to buy food this week, I'm having to wait until next Friday, which is payday, and live off what's in my kitchen already until then.

I think the right thing to do at this stage is to say to my sister ""I'm sorry, I can't afford to be a groomsman"" and bow out. They have a few months to replace me and I'd still go, in the suit I already own, as a guest, because while I would love to be involved and standing at the front while my sister gets married, I literally can't afford to. I've said at the wedding that I'd look after my nephew so I am going, but I don't want to look like a dickhead or a brat throwing a tantrum so I need to know before I do anything if this would make me look like an asshole.",110,527,0.97

1703,Not the A-hole,"Context: 

Live with three other roommates. They are all good guys, and for the most part we all get along. However, one of my roommates (who I’ve had the most problems with in the past) recently got a girlfriend and she is over CONSTANTLY. Like I’m pretty sure she has stayed at our house like for a 7th night in a row. She always stays in his room with him at night, but now she is also using our bathroom. She even has her own shelf for things she keeps in the bathroom. 

I find it annoying because we never agreed for a fifth roommate, and she’s here basically just as much as everyone else. So recently my other roommates and I have realized that we need to talk to our roommate about this situation. The conclusion I’ve truly come to is that either she needs to stop being here so much or she needs to start paying some rent.

1704,Not the A-hole,"I know it seems pretty now, and my cousin was never bad to me growing up. In fact we've been friends most of our life but things went to shit in our relationship when she choose to side with her cousin (not my family) over me and my wife for a disagreement over business services.

My wife hired my cousin's cousin (a decorator) company based on her recommendation. My wife does event planning and needs to have good reliable contractors.

Immediately, this woman provided horrible service. Not showing up to a site visit without any explanation, over promising and not remembering what she promised, holding back on giving estimates or quotes.

My wife was stressed dealing with her and wanted to fire her but I told her just stick it out and I'll try to get my cousin to talk to her.

My cousin did but apparently it went the other way, all her cousin did was bitch about my wife and how controlling and anal she was.

I explained to my cousin the truth, even sent her screen shots of unanswered emaild, calls, texts, some outright lies etc.

At the day off the event the decorating she was supposed to be doing was so plain, and not what she agreed with my wife, but my wife kept it in and actually went and got more decorative stuff borrowed for the event. In the end, my wife and her worker did a really nice job.

Later during the event, the 'decorator' came in with my cousin and was taking food, free drinks and then taking pics of the decor (to probably use in her future portfolio). This pissed my wife off immensely as she was tired and frustrated, she told the decorator that she wasn't a guest at this event and that she needs to leave. She told her she'll return all her materials tomorrow, but will sue her if she uses it in her portfolio.

This angered her so much that she began to take down get decor during the event and caused scene. Security eventually escorted her out.

My wife returned the materials the next day but later in the week was hit with an invoice for her remaining 50% fee. My wife refused to pay and that's when my cousin got involved, calling her all sorts of names, spreading rumours about her, leaving bad reviews of her business online.

My wife took them to court and won.

Now I've not spoken to her since. As far as I see it, she chose one cousin's side over another and I will not forgive her for that especially given how wrong they were.

She tried to freeload of my wife and use her. I haven't forgiven my cousin for so quickly siding with her too.

Now my mum told me she has multiple sclerosis and asked to see me. She's bedridden and lonely.

I don't want to go. Her betrayal is still fresh in my mind and it hurts knowing how didn't have my back and then started spreading rumours.

It sucks that she had MS but just because this has happened doesn't mean she deserves my forgiveness. In 3 years she's never reached out and apologized so why should I?",221,930,0.97

1706,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway~A bit long winded, but, here we go. 

I recently got engaged to the man of my dreams in April 2019. Set to be married in September of 2020. Even before we got engaged, my fiancee and I agreed that we were going to keep it on the smaller side and only invite our close friends/family. Now, I have four other siblings that I'm not close to. I only ""talk"" to one and that's putting it lightly. I've chosen not to invite the remaining three and only invite the one that I speak to. My mother wasn't particularly pleased, but, she understood at the time. 

We already went through bullshit with his side of the family due to the fact that I didn't want to invite everyone from his side of the family, which would be an additional 60+ people to our list. My fiancee and I had already had a list of everyone he wanted to invite on his side of the family and mine. It was a huge thing where we eventually compromised on inviting a large portion, but, not all. They essentially threatened to not help pay for the wedding, so, I felt a bit bullied into giving in. 

Flash forward to the past few weeks. My mother has had a falling out with the one sibling I speak to and now wants me to invite one of the one's who I have literally no relationship with. I've told her no many times and to please be civil and respect my wishes. Today, she threw the fact that we are inviting my fiancee's family to the wedding (though it was a different scenario in my opinion) and said she isn't coming to the wedding unless I invite him. 

At this point, I'm over all of it. I haven't been able to enjoy being engaged because it's been family drama and I'm not even looking forward to planning the wedding. We have planned a large portion and most of everything has been paid for out of our pocket. I suggested we just cancel the damn thing and elope to my fiancee and he agreed.

Shes been doing really well, improving a ton and making much faster progress than anyone there, (she knows and wants to get better but is still really mentally fragile). A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

A few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like ""Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

I eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend.

1709,Not the A-hole,"Background: a little over a month ago, I made reservations for my birthday at a fancy restaurant that holds a Sunday brunch with two seating options, either 11:30 or 12:30. This was the only date that worked for me as all my weekends are booked henceforth. 

This week my mom, with whom I usually have a great relationship with, informed me that she won't be able to attend the brunch that's happening in two weeks. She explained that she got a series of tickets to our local theater and the first show of the season is at 1PM on that Sunday. She tried to see if we could reschedule, but I reiterated that I wasn't available for the next month. 

I made a joke by saying ""well the show must go on"" and stated that I'd  be going with everyone else who was invited (my spouse's parents, my aunt and my cousin).  She didn't reply but she seemed caught off-guard.

At this point I was annoyed with her more than anything. This had been penned in for some time and there's the added salt-to-the-wound that for the last five years, I've been hosting great birthday parties for her and my dad at my house. 

I feel like I'm being a little entitled about this, because my mother doesn't owe me anything, but I've been taking my distances since the exchange happened. I was planning on inviting her over for some cake on my birthday, but I'm not feeling like it right now.

1710,Everyone Sucks,"Sliced cheese is a favourite snack and breakfast food for my sister (21F) and I (20F).

Yesterday the sliced cheese that we had at home got over. I ate the last slice. When I got home in the evening my sister accused me of eating her share of the sliced cheese. Apparently for the past two weeks she hasn't been eating breakfast at home (I didn't know this because I leave the house before her every day) and so I ended up eating more than my share of the packet.

She said that for each packet we buy, half of the slices belong to her and half belong to me. I disagreed, having always seen the cheese as a replenishable good that didn't necessarily belong half to me and half to her. She said it wasn't fair to her because now that she wanted to snack on sliced cheese, she'd have to wait until our next grocery run.

Eventually I backed down and went to buy some more sliced cheese, and agreed to divide the packet into two so I'd only eat from my pile. Still feels a bit ridiculous to me though. AITA?

HUGE. we found a 10 hour screening that showed the first 4 movies back to back. naturally, we decided to go. the theatre was mostly empty, except for this one couple and their kid a few rows down. this kid would not stop crying for a goddamn second. i ignored them for the first hour, then made some annoyed coughs that they heard, but ignored, and finally, i went up to them and asked them if they could either calm the kid down, or leave with him. they were rather rude about it, saying they were entitled to the theatre as well, and that we should deal with it. 

they were probably accustomed to the sound of a child crying, and seemed to be having a good time, but i was miserable, unable to enjoy the movies. so, i started bawling loudly as well, right until one of them shot a dirty glance at me, took the kid, and left.

1713,Not the A-hole,"So recently my fiance bought me an engagement ring, which sounds fine except I had told him multiple times I didn't want one and he spent 3k on it when we're meant to be saving up. He decided to show me a picture and ask what I thought without telling me he'd already bought it, and I answered honestly (not knowing he'd already chosen that ring) and he's been mad at me since.

It's been about 5 days since that happened and he's been mad at me for all 5 of them. I've tried to apologise and smooth things over but no luck. Then this morning he basically said to me that me not wearing the engagement ring he bought me made him feel like I didn't respect that he'd proposed, like nothing had actually changed in my manner to reflect that I'm engaged. I told him he's proposed twice now and I've accepted both times wholeheartedly, as well as told everyone I knew and already begun wedding planning, so I am very aware I'm engaged, and he has no intention of wearing an engagement ring at all so really I could say the same about him. He asked me to compromise by coming to the jewellers and seeing if there was an engagement ring I would wear, and if there wasn't he swore to never bring it up again.

I went with him, he returned the ring he chose , but not before trying to get me to agree to wear it again, and I pointed out another ring that I said I would willingly wear as a wedding band, not an engagement ring. I did try to be a good sport about it and actually considered the rings they had and if I'd wear any of them as an engagement ring, but nothing stood out to me and I just really don't want an engagement ring.

My reasons for not wanting an engagement ring are: any ring, especially the one he chose, is just going to be really clunky and get in the way and bother me. I would only be wearing an engagement ring as a placeholder until the wedding, because I don't want to stack the rings after the wedding. Also I just don't see the point as the wedding bands are the important rings and we're meant to be saving up.

We went to a coffee shop to discuss it and I repeated that I didn't want an engagement ring. He responded that he wanted to get me something for the engagement so I suggested a necklace or bracelet or something, but held firm on no ring.

He then said ""I don't know what the point of proposing was if you won't wear the ring, wish I'd never bothered"". He raised his voice as he said this, and slammed his mug down, which drew some attention and someone asked me if everything was alright, to which I replied ""it's fine, my boyfriend and I are just disagreeing"". He left.

I feel like a bitch. There was no need for me to call him my boyfriend, and it was only after he left that I remembered what he said about me not acting like he'd proposed, so this was probably the worst thing I could have said, but I was hurt by what he said before that so I just snapped.

1717,Not the A-hole,"My roommate's girlfriend stays the night 1-2 times per week.  Usually she comes in the evening, stays over, and then he leaves for work early in the A.M. while she kind of stays and leaves when she pleases.  Or she stays until he gets home and they spend some more time together.

So he usually leaves for work at around 5:00am, while I get up at around 6-6:30am and make my breakfast and start my day.  His girlfriend usually sleeps until like 10-11am, so I'm up doing stuff while she's still sleeping.  

Since she's been staying over, I've received numerous texts from him while he's at work about how I need to be quieter while making breakfast because she's still sleeping, how I need to remember to put the toilet seat down for her, and that I'm being too loud in the morning.  I'll wake up, 'be too loud', she'll text him to complain and he'll text me.  It's ridiculous.

I'm not banging pots and pans trying to ruin her sleep.  I'm simply going about my day.  If I'm listening to music or watching Netflix on my phone, I use headphones.  It's a small apartment with paper-thin walls so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do..  Wait 5 hours until she wakes up before I do anything? 

**My thoughts on this issue are as follows:**  She doesn't live here and has never once actually talked TO ME about these things.  She'll simply text her boyfriend and he'll send long texts about how he's 'told me many times'.  Honestly, I don't care how she feels.  She can put the toilet seat down herself. (I've received a few long messages about how I 'once again forgot to put the toilet seat down').  I live here and pay rent and if she doesn't like it she can go home (She drives to and from.  She's free to leave whenever).  But he seems to think that he's justified in his complaints about me not tip-toeing around her while she's over.  IMO he needs to just tell her straight up that she has no right to complain about these things.

**EDIT** Okay guys, I'll put the damn toilet seat down.  And the lid.  But it's because I want to.

**EDIT #2** Alright it looks like we're kind of torn between putting it down and leaving it up, for a variety of reasons ranging from *""She's a strong independent woman""* to *""poop particles EVERYWHERE!""*.  This is getting interesting.

**EDIT #3** Thanks for the responses.  I read them all and learned a lot about bathroom cleanliness above all else, and going forward I will put the toilet seat down habitually, both so that the poop particles don't get everywhere and because it just looks more aesthetically pleasing to walk into a bathroom with a closed lid.  Yes, ***a closed lid***.  Ladies (and gentlemen, but especially ladies), observe the status of the toilet seat before you squat to avoid either falling in, or sitting on a closed toilet seat lid.  Anyway, this was a journey and a half.  Furthermore, I'll speak up and tell it like it is next time I get complained to about my conduct in my own place.  Consider this a successful Reddit thread.

1718,Not the A-hole,"A few years ago I was living with my mom and brother at a place with a decent sized building attached, which we used for storage. It was mostly unorganized at the time, but my brother and I each kept most of our things in separate corners to better keep track of it. One day I was getting ready for a camping trip and gathering supplies from the building when I came across a box with a nice fur blanket in it. Since it wasn't in my brother's corner and looked like something my mom would have bought, I assumed it was hers- especially because it seemed to be worth 100-200$. She had told me before that I could use any of her things from the building on the trip, so I took it with me and used it over the weekend. I was probably an asshole for not making sure it was hers before I left, and when I returned it she said it was my brother's. I let him know right away and apologized.

At this point it might be relevant to mention that we don't have the best relationship; lots of drama from the past, though we've always been on speaking terms. In any case, he got very angry and started yelling at me. I don't remember the details but he was basically saying that I ruined it, should have checked before I borrowed it, stuff like that. It's important to mention the blanket wasn't dirty or damaged, but I offered to have it dry-cleaned since he thought it was. That only made him seem more angry, and he immediately took it to a trash bin outside and threw it in. I didn't want it to go to waste so as diplomatically as I could, I asked if I could keep it if he was just going to throw it away. That made him explode, and he yelled versions of ""no"" before leaving. In hindsight, I can kind of see why. Either way, later on I snuck it out of the trash and hid it in my room. 

I've only used it once since then, it didn't quite feel right so it's been in storage at my own place ever since. I don't really know what to do with it. I'd like to keep and use it, but I'd only be able to with a clean conscience.

My mom is not able to work, she has major health issues, meaning she doesn't have her own fixed income. My aunt would be the one to give her money, or buy us food. But when that runs out we'd have nothing.
One night, I was not feeling well. My mom was cooking dinner in the kitchen while my step father was watching tv. When dinner was ready my mom came to get me, so I come out of my room we start eating and my mom turns to me seeing I'm really not feeling well, she asks if I'm ok and I told her ""no I feel like shit""

My step father said ""well you look like shit might as well feel like shit too"" and started saying how the food tasted bad. 
My mother never ever defended me, she never said anything to him at all, even told me she never heard a word he said yet he was sitting right there. All because she was trying to protect him. 
The next day I called my aunt and had her come get me, because it was not a situation I wanted to be in. And from there I had made arrangements to move to Quebec because I have family here. 

I had stopped talking to my mother for a while because it was no fair to let her daughter be treated that way (it's not the first time she's had shitty boyfriend's treat her kids like shit).
 December of 2017 my mom called me even though we hadn't spoken for about 6-7 months and told me my grandma had passed away. I wasn't super close to her but I figured I'd stay in contact with my mom because I love her and it was a hard time for her then. But since I've been in contact with her it feels like she's trying to guilt me into moving back in with her. Or have me and my boyfriend move to Ontario, and every time I tell her I'm not interested in doing that because I love it where I live.
She always gets really emotional and starts making me feel like shit about even have moved here in the first place when it was her fault.

If me and my boyfriend ever fight she always wants me to just pack up and move back to her but I just don't want too.  I just don't think it's fair to me to have her try to pressure me into moving back home after all the things thats happened.
(She did break up with my step father a couple months after my grandma's passing. Which I am very happy about. But that doesn't mean I wanna move back there when I have a perfect life here.)

So tell me please WIBTAH if I told my mom to just stop asking me to move back home?",18,91,0.96
1722,Not the A-hole,"Ok so about 3 months ago my Step-Dad got this puppy Rambo who’s adorable 

Everybody was against it because we have an outdoor dog Mia who’s mine and an indoor dog Ringo who’s the Family dog but we sucked it up and let him get the dog 

He was a shit owner, he bragged about his dog and how beautiful it was and how it was strong but didn’t take any responsibility for it 

I fed him 

I walked him

I played with him 

I cleaned his shit 

I even bought him a couple toys and let him share my dog Mia’s Toys 

So he’s basically my dog, I love him. And now My Stepdad wants to get rid of him because he doesn’t have time for him!? I told my Stepdad to  legally just give the dog to me so I can have him

He said that is too much work for me to take care of 2 dogs.... IVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS!!!!!!

My mom says that since he legally owns the dog and he bought the dog, that is his decision, fucking serious?! Who cares he never took care of Rambo as much as I did, so I cursed both of them, fuck them I mean this is so selfish and stupid 

I mean what’s more important, who legally owns the dog, or who takes care of it? AITA?",44,63,0.89

1725,Asshole,Our sons are 6 and 9. They're usually calm until my husband riles them up with this wrestling play. They go pretty hard at it. Like my husband will throw them hard into the couch. My concern is twofold - one or both will get hurt and not even know it or my husband will get hurt. It's not unusual for them to be laughing but a day later they'll have bruises and my husband looks like he got into it with a cat. Also sometimes my husband does this when they go to bed and he tucks them in. It turns into another wrestling match and it's just like put them to fucking bed already. I did bring it up and he just says that kids can take a ton of punishment and boys need to get that energy out. Well take them to the park or have them do yard work.,384,1133,0.91
1726,Asshole,"Using a throwaway for this. My (24F) friend (22F) has it really difficult recently. I will call her Linda for simplicity's sake.

Linda's explained she's behind on rent (about $4k for two months?), got a sister practically emotionally dependent on her, her mother's in a bad state of mind as well, and on top of that she's battling a sort of subsidiary type of narcolepsy. She currently lives with her boyfriend in an apartment but it seems they will have to move out as neither of them can afford it anymore. 

To offer some sort of help, I managed to get Linda spontaneously hired at my workplace (fast food restaurant), and she was to come in for her first shift a few days ago when I received a phone call. She was on the train heading to work but was having a panic attack, barely able to formulate words through the crying. 

I've had panic attacks in the past (not as strong as hers, however) and I always found it helpful to focus on other things and basically try to ""forget"" the attack, taking control of it this way, so I attempted to engage her in casual conversation. She didn't directly say she wanted to turn around and go home, but I sort of expected that was what she wanted me to advise her to do.

It's the decision I made here that I need help on deciding whether it was an assholeish thing to do. 

From previous personal experiences, I always found myself even more saddened and feeling defeated if I let my panic control me enough to give up halfway. So I convinced her to at least come all the way to work since she was already commuting there, so I could see her (I had a shift that day too) and send her off after talking some face-to-face. Linda mentioned she felt it was a waste of money for that bus ticket since she barely had enough to buy food, but I reassured that I'd pay for it.

So Linda shows up, looking wrecked, I hold her and she cries for a while. I fetch some food we've bought for the employees to eat and sit down with her to talk. At one moment I have to leave to help out in the restaurant and as I come back she's reapplied makeup and is looking better. I tell her she can consider starting her shift later or go home, it doesn't matter much, and after a while of me being out working I receive a text that she's decided to head back home. Later that day she barely manages to answer my text in return, only reassures she loves me very much and says she'll respond full-length tomorrow instead as her sleeping syndrome has hit her hard after the emotional stress that day and I'm guessing she fell asleep early.

I compensated for the bus tickets, of course, but I'm wondering if I should be more apologetic to her. 

Did I push her too far? I explained everything very briefly to a friend who doesn't know her, and he said I was in the wrong for making her come all that way for nothing. However I'm worried she would've been even more saddened to head home mid-panic attack, probably feeling like she let me/the workplace down by not even showing up.

1730,Not the A-hole,"For some context, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 1/2 months and she just had a birthday two weeks ago. Some more background, we have a mutual friend who she has known for about three months, and I've known for over a year. 

I have been telling my gf that this mutual friend is obsessed with her. He constantly showers her with compliments, is consistently the only person he ever asks to come to his, wears a piece of string that she gave him like a trophy, and tricked her into going on a date with him where he her how he feels. She tells him that she is dating me, we just recently decided to be official, and she is happy. Anyway, he goes on vacation, so I dont hear about him for a while.

So, this mutual friend just came back from vacation and asks gf if she wants to hangout, he says he got her a gift, nbd, you buy your friends gifts makes sense. However, when she gets there, he has gotten her 7 gifts, 4 pieces of jewelry, a handbag, and a stuffed animal, and a particularly expensive necklace. Totalling around $300-$400. This already is making a bit uncomfortable because nobody spends that much money on ""just a friend"", but to add to that he got all of his other friends, including some that he has known for years, one small, cheap gift.

In my mind, those are red flags. I told her that I didn't think she should accept all of those gifts, due to how he is treating her now and what he has said in the past, I am convinced those cant be just a friendly gift. I asked her if she would pick one gift to keep and kindly return the rest to the friend, just so that she is treated like he treats the rest of his friends.

Anyway, when I asked her if she would, she got kind of offended. She said how much she talks about me to the friend, and how the friend is just being really nice because it's her birthday, and how she thought I was just being paranoid and looking to much into it. She said she wasn't going to return any of the gifts, and I told her that I would feel much more comfortable if she did. She hung up shortly after that.

Am I looking too much into this? Should I be bothered by this.

P.S. before people come in saying that I dont love my girlfriend and should break up. Dont. My girlfriend and I are very happy together. I am not worried about her cheating. I am worried about the friends obsessive behavior that she isnt acknowledging or doing anything about.

1731,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the awkward title but I wanted to be clear it wasn’t just me and one other party.  

My wife and I were out to dinner with her sister and her sister’s husband. We went to a place that’s well known for its okay-ish pizza and having a lot of beer on tap. 

It’s been a couple years since we’ve seen them so I was unaware “Greg” had quit drinking. 

The waitress took our drink orders, everyone got waters and I ordered a local seasonal beer. 

His wife and mine both reacted angrily and he looked pissed off. I asked what the issue was. 

“Greg quit drinking a year ago!” His wife said

“Okay, and?” I asked 

“Your ordering a beer is temping him!” She said. 

I looked at Greg, then at her. “So? All he has to do is not order one. It’s not my problem.”

I got a bunch of angry glares. 

My wife accused me of being an asshole for ordering a beer around someone who doesn’t drink. I told her I have coworkers who don’t drink and none of them make a fuss about most of us ordering beer when we go out after work. 

She tried the argument that it was “her sister’s husband” in this case and not a coworker. Since I’m closer with those coworkers than Greg, I told her that was an invalid argument. 

“If you had a problem with alcohol, you shouldn’t have picked a restaurant that uses the number of beers on tap as a selling point.” I added. 

I had two beers during the meal and was treated to the cold shoulder. 

Later at home she told me I should have been more supportive. My (slightly a-hole) response was that it wasn’t my responsibility to cater to his made-up needs or to compensate for will so weak he couldn’t even sit at the same table with someone drinking a beer.

I nod and say yes, I want the chorizo. She gets frustrated and passes me off to another employee.

I again ask for chorizo. This one actually understands and tells the other that it is the sausage that I want. She says well I asked her and she kept saying chorizo. I says yes because that's what's on the menu. The lady taking my orders says, yes, but it's just sausage. They just call it that because it's spicy. 

Anyways, I end walking out because they moved in to another person before I even got finish my order. As I walked out they were loudly complaining that I'm a bad person for arguing. After the fact I realized I could have just said that I wanted the sausage, but honestly they should have known what I was talking about. Aita?

Edit: the second one knew what I was talking about. She immediately picked up that I was talking about sausage. The first one had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. When I said burrito bowl with chorizo, she asked me what flavor I wanted. The only 2 options on the menu was Chorizo and Veggie. I acknowledge that I was definitely a jerk, but I still feel like she should have known that the chorizo was the sausage. I'm not annoyed because she called it sausage.

1733,No A-holes here,"My wife and I have a son who, due to a medical condition, is on an extemely strict low carb diet. He generally does well but at times he feels really lonely and jealous of others (especially when we're out and other kids have ice cream etc.). He's also just starting to get to an age where he feels self concious and worries people will think he's weird because of his food restrictions.

A year or so ago My wife and I were able to connect with another couple who also have a son (similar age) with the same condition and diet. This connection helped my son immensely as he felt so much better not being alone with his restrictions. 

Recently, their son was able to find a medication that allowed him to come off the diet. This is not an option right now for our son. They are understandably estatic for their son and have been sending us all kinds of pictures of him eating doughnuts, candy, etc. We have responded very positively to them and expressed our shared happiness for them BUT we have not told our son as we fear this would make him feel really alone and down on himself for still having to deal with the restrictions.

They are kind people but somewhat tone deaf and sometimes accidentally say some really insensitive things (for example when we got pregnant, they said 'omg are you afraid your next baby might have thr same problems?! We would never risk having a second child!"".

They have been trying to get together with us and keep pushing for it to be around a mealtime, which ive been avoiding for fear that they might have their son eating something really carb heavy (likely thinking that would make us happy to see him be able to eat that way) or might say something tone deaf about our son having to be on the diet still and it would make our son feel really bad.

The reality is, if they dont mention it and dont feed their son something really carb obvious (like pizza, cake, etc.) Our son probably wouldnt even notice and it would be a non issue.

WIBTA if i asked them ahead of time to please not mention their son getting off the diet while we are together and to feed him something not super in our face carb loaded?

1734,Not the A-hole,"My husband and I bought a house for my mother in 2013 so she can move closer to me and our family. She lived there until a year ago when she was diagnosed with cancer. I took her in and she stayed with my family until she passed away two months ago.

Before she passed, my mother told me that she is worried about my younger sister because she doesn’t seem to have any direction in life, and she is easily influenced by other people (especially romantic partners) who often take advantage of her. My mother asked that when she dies I and my husband give the house we bought for her to my sister to make sure that there will always be a roof above her head. My sister is currently renting an apartment with her girlfriend, who I have a strained relationship with.

I am hesitant to do this because I think that if I give her ownership of the house, there’s a very probable chance that she will eventually lose it. There have been multiple instances in the past where her girlfriends (past and present) convinced her to make foolish decisions in order to get money quickly, and she never even questioned them (withdrawing from a time deposit account, selling heirloom jewelry, signing on as co-borrower to loans which proceeds she didn’t use). That’s just the kind of person that she is, when she loves someone she trusts them completely and has a hard time seeing when they might be asking her to do things that are not to her best interests.

My husband thinks that we should just give my sister the house since we can afford to gift it to her and it’s more important to honor my mother’s dying wish. If she loses the house then that’s on her but at least we did what my mother wanted.

Thoughts?

Edit: For those who are saying that I should let my sister live there for free,  the  concern I have with this is that I absolutely do not like her current girlfriend (the same girl who convinced my sister to sell an heirloom necklace our grandfather gave to my sister so that they can use the money to pay off the girl's credit card debt).

If I tell my sister that she can live in the house, her girlfriend will also move in, which I don't want to happen because why would I want someone like that to live in the house I bought for my mother?

1735,Asshole,"Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn’t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn’t even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn’t do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

Grandpa passed away and left a will saying he wants her to stay. He doesn't own the place so this obviously shouldn't be an issue.

At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior.  I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. 

My aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. 

We don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time. My mom shuts it down any time she hears it, but unfortunately she doesn't hear her every time. I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. 

I flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left.

Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it. I'm also beginning to feel like a dick for telling her to shut up.

I might be moving for work in the coming months but where I live, month long contracts are available. She wants to live with me even if it's short term.

Long story short, she's a person I  consider a great friend, but also someone I have mixed feelings for. In other words, when we've lived in the same city, I've come to like her as more than a friend.

Now, said person is not single and hasn't been in the time I've known her. She went straight from one relationship into another.

He simply said, ""okay"", and changed the subject. Due to the facts that 1) we usually have excellent communication 2) he's never done anything major without consulting me first, and 3) he didn't seem at all serious about getting a motorcycle, I considered that the end of the discussion. He didn't mention the motorcycle again for several months.

Flash forward to two days ago. He randomly showed up at my house (which is 40 miles from his btw) *on a motorcycle* he'd bought the day before. Of course I freaked out and said that he should've, at the very least, told me he'd officially decided to buy one before doing it so we could talk about it. I also said that he shouldn't have bought it at all, considering how terrified I am of them. His response was ""you can't control me, it's not up to you"". He straight up told me that he's ""aware of how bad my fear is but he won't sacrifice something he really wants just for my peace of mind"".

This turned into a full blown fight that's lasted three entire days now.

Now, my husband and I have graduated and we have good jobs so we bought kind of expensive furniture. While I would like for him to go to my apartment, I’m afraid that he would bring me bugs since he goes to many different places every week, he has brought bed bugs before, and he doesn’t shower too often. My husband and BIL’s relationship is not the best right now (since he stood us over & never apologized) so I don’t see why I should risk getting my furniture infected. My BIL is really dirty and I’m not sure if I would feel calm at our apartment.",90,533,0.95
1749,Not the A-hole,"So this is the second off of a story I have. I’ll post the link for the first one at the bottom of this post 


My grandpa left my and my sister $50,000 each and left my mom absolutely nothing. My
Mom thinks My sister and I should pay her 10,000 each because she got nothing. I genuinely feel like she was wronged, especially since my grandfather left over $2,000,000 to charity and gave us basically chump change compared to that amount... 

So here’s the thick plottens: a few years ago mom bought me a car and took it back, for full details see previous post. She told my sister (not me) that if I didn’t pay her she would cut me out of her will (she has a vast amount of property as well) and that it’s because I screwed her out of money for the car. She doesn’t know that I know that she said that, but it royally pissed me off because I feel as though I owe her nothing from that situation. 

My sister is mad because she too has to pay my mom $10,000 and she feels like it’s because of the car situation. 
Now I have every intention of paying her the money simply because I’m trying to stay on her good side until she passes away, but She definitely neglected me during my childhood as she was always working, and she always gave my sister newer nicer stuff and gave me second hand stuff and hardly ever punished her, but I got punished all the time and I was always made to work the weekends on their houses as a kid mowing lawns, cleaning houses to get them ready for the new tenets, etc. etc. I didn’t really mind the work part, but I hated it because she was always there telling me to go faster or go slower or that I was doing it wrong. 

 But my sister never had to do any of that. 

So, let’s just say I decided to cut my mother off after I get paid and don’t give her a dime, will I be the asshole if I do that?

1753,Not the A-hole,"I live on the second floor of a smoke friendly apartment. My downstairs neighbor recently came upstairs and asked me to please get an ash tray. The floorboards are a little weird on the balcony so I guess the ash was falling into her patio. I apologized to her and let her know I do have an ash tray but will be more careful moving forward. 

I started to get nervous about smoking up there so at night if I’d have a cigarette I would go downstairs to the communal outdoor BBQ area and smoke there, but was informed by the management that that area is smoke free and was asked to only smoke on my balcony or off property. I obliged. 

I started to be careful to make sure the ash falls only onto the ash tray and even would dump out the ash every night at the end of the night. Where we live it’s very windy so I didn’t want the ash to blow away onto her patio. I have guests over sometimes, and some of them smoke. I ask them to make sure to use the ash tray and be careful but admittedly, I don’t always go out with them so it’s possible they’re not as cautious about the ash. It is very windy at times so it can be hard to control the ash. 

Today, I was walking to the parking lot and my neighbor was walking around and I said hi. She immediately started to yell at me. She called me a dumb cunt who pretends to be nice but am really a stupid whore. Imagine my shock when this 50 year old little lady was cussing up a storm like this. I told her I’m so sorry and what happened. And she told me she has been having ash fall on her patio. I told her I’ve been very careful and I’m sorry. I pointed out that nearly everyone who lives here smokes and maybe it’s from another unit. She wouldn’t have it and was basically screaming at me that I’m an evil whore and her cat is sick because he ate ash. I apologized again and started to walk away but she kept yelling. This was really humiliating as everyone was kind of watching. I do feel bad if I got her cat sick but I maybe smoke 3-4 cigarettes a day so I’m not even sure how this could be a huge problem. 

AITA?

1754,Not the A-hole,"I (26F) have an older brother (32M) whom I don’t always see eye to eye to. We had a bad relationship as teens, but it has gotten slightly better. He is a dad now (2M, 6monthF). I try my best to have a good relationship with them, so I visit them when I can when they are with my parents. I’m able to see them like this every 2 months or so. When I’m with them, I take them to the playground, sing songs with them, read books, etc. I also help my parents feeding and cleaning them and putting them to bed.
Yesterday I took a picture of the baby girl, that wasnt able to sleep well that day, but fell asleep against my chest as I sang her to sleep. She looked really cute. I shared this picture on our family app, which includes 8 people (parents, brothers 1&2, me and our SO’s) and said something like “busy all day with playing, now finally sound asleep”. Brother shares a lot of pics with his kids, so I thought he’d like the gesture. He didn’t. When he came to our parents, he took me aside. He told me he meant no harm in saying this and didn’t want to feel like he was attacking me, then he went on to explain that that photo was highly inappropriate. That only mothers can hold their children like that, that his wife doesn’t like it, and that he doesn’t want his kids to “grow up like huggers”, because his wife and he arent like that.

A family friend has offered up their home to host and the guest list just seems to get bigger and bigger. This causes concern about where everyone is to park, as it’s in a residential area with narrow roads. There is a LDS church house one block away with a whole lot of parking. With the wedding being on a non-sabbath, it’s highly likely the lot will not be used. So we figured it’d be a perfect solution. I’ve been to a number of LDS weddings at homes where it’s pretty standard to park at the ward house then walk to the home. Still we figured we ought to ask permission first and I volunteered to handle that business. This is where the little quandary happened. 
I just planned on asking to use the lot for a wedding. I am an ex-member but have many current member buddies/family still. When talking about it with one they were adamant that I need to make it clear it’s a same-sex marriage when asking, just to give him the full picture before agreeing. I know the couple would be hurt to find out they were denied because I mentioned they were gay in my request...so I’m really not sure what to do. Both of the couple grew up Mormon and actually hold that part of their history close.

1757,Not the A-hole,"So long story, I'll try make it succinct and clear. This had all happened over a week or so and now it's blown up and I'm pissed but I want to know if I'm overseas

So I (30F) have an old PC I've had for 10 years. Hubby (33M) got some parts and wanted to use it with our tv as a media centre type thing. I said yea but don't go deleting things or making big changes.

First thing he does is change my desktop background. It was a photo from our wedding  I asked him to change it back and he jokingly found one of my and our pup. 

He then asks me to go over the folders to check there isn't anything super important as he's transfered everything to a hardrive cos he wants to wipe it and reboot it. I was reluctant. I am an amateur photographer so have loads of photos from shoots, also a teacher so I have lots of school documents and work. Anyway I checked and all was good.

Hubby goes out and I want to use the computer to play a game so I turn it on. He's added a password and got rid of xp and put windows 10 on it. The username is also his name. I msg him and say not cool. He gives me the password. I'm pissed because I gave an inch with this computer and he's run a mile, changing everything and putting his name and a password on it. The next day I tell him calmly how I'm annoyed and he makes excuses that it's a shared password, it's better with windows 10 blah blah blah.  

I'm annoyed as to me, it's the principal of the matter, mostly the password locking me out if the computer. He said I was asleep when he did it. I said he should have messaged it to me or something. He said he just didn't think.

It came to a head today when I borrowed his card reader to do some photos stuff and he said that borrowing a card reader without asking is the same as what he did to the computer. I said it's not as I'm not changing or doing anything to the card reader.

1760,Not the A-hole,"*Disclaimer: This happened in Canada where tipping is expected in most restaurant service jobs.*

I went out yesterday with a group of friends and at the end of the night, I paid up my tab of $22, using $42 (two $20s and $2)

Before I could get a work out about what I wanted for change the bartender said ""so you want an even $20 bill eh? What about my tip?"" 

A little surprised, I said  "" Uh nah man, just a $10 and two $5s."" Once I had the change back I said ""But anyone who demands a tip won't get one from me"", and walked back to my table.

*Note: At this bar, servers and bartenders seperately pool their tips and the cook staff take percentages from each pool.*
I previously had this knowledge so I left a larger tip for the server instead. 

My friends think I am TA for not tipping the bartender. One friend in particular is incredibly upset with me, as he is a former bartender and told me they depend on those tips to survive, even if it means haggling customers.

As a tourism industry worker, I believe tips are earned through hard work and good customer relations, which is why I did not tip the bartender. 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for not tipping my bartender after he said he deserves one?

**Edit: As per info request:** I had intended on tipping the bartender with one of the $5s, as I can be a little generous when intoxicated. 
Most of my interactions were with the server, with only 1 drink order coming from the bartender. When he asked for the tip, it threw off my customer relations way of tipping and I thought the server deserved more for being more polite and doing more work for our table.

1762,Asshole,"Dating for 1.5 years, both divorced with our own kids. We do not live together. Kiddo is 9. I've spent a ton of time with him over this last year +, but I feel like the kid has always held me at arms length because his mom, the ex wife, is a horrible, vindictive narcissist who belittles me and my boyfriend to this kid, and has made it very hard for the kid to just feel normal and happy about his dad being in a relationship.

As more background... Ex wife has repeatedly texted boyfriend that the kid tells her we're disgusting cause we kiss in front of him. She's told boyfriend that he's a horrible dad because he's too focused on his girlfriend (me) and it's obvious because we kiss each other in front of the kids. Furthermore, boyfriend had a very hard time standing up to her /establishing boundaries with her. It took him a very long time to realize she's full of shit, and even today, he second guesses himself when she hits the right nerve (cause the harassment texts are quite routine, and she's always finding a new way to tell him he's a horrible dad).

Today, kiddo tells his dad that he's uncomfortable with me coming to his sporting event this weekend as planned (and as I've done many times before), because one, mom will be there (and lord knows she's been very ugly about these situations in the past) and two, he's uncomfortable that we kiss in front of him and his friends.

Boyfriend texted me and says.... When you come tomorrow, we can't kiss as much.

My gut feelings light up. Which I'm learning to listen to.

I know this is cause of horrible, vindictive mom.

I say... Wouldn't it be appropriate for you to talk to him about being uncomfortable with this, acknowledge his feelings, but then let him know that we're gonna continue to be us because kissing someone you love is natural and normal? Furthermore, mom shows absolutely ZERO affection in her relationship (she's newly gay, but isn't out yet to the kids, they have no idea that moms live in, sharing a bedroom ""friend"" is anything but that), wouldn't you like your kid to learn from somewhere that affection is a good thing? Plus... We all know this is coming from the ex anyway, cause she makes it so damn hard in this kid... Why can't we just be us?

He says... I know it's coming from mom, I just wanna take it easy on him.

I'm hurt. I'm hurt that yet again, the ex is in the way, and now she's dictating, through her kid, when I can and cannot touch my boyfriend.

I'm considering just skipping the game. WIBTA?

ETA:

You all make very valid points. I appreciate you not taking it easy on me. I came here for feedback, and I definitely got it. Thank you.

A few things, in no particular order:

1. This isn't one sided. BF is just as affectionate with me as I would be with him.

2. We certainly don't make out in front of the kids. At previous kid events like this in the past, if we arrived separately (we live a ways apart and sometimes things are in the middle), I'd greet my boyfriend with a peck. Something along those lines. Or if he went to the concession stand, and he handed me a snack, it might also be with a peck. That's what we're talking about.

3. The kiddo certainly has it hard. There aren't enough reddit words to describe how hard this kid's life is. He has a little brother, too, that he feels responsible for on some level, so this is tough. I have no interest in making it harder for him.

4. I know I'm sensitive to affection being demonstrated, as none was modeled for me in my childhood, and I feel like I'm worse off for it. Maybe that's why I need help here... I don't know.

5. I also know I'm sensitive to the ex' involvement in our relationship. It's been a constant struggle for us. It's gotten better, by miles, but my heart races when her meddling influences us somehow.

6. I have a therapist, and I ask her all this stuff too, and she won't take it easy on me either, but that appt is a few weeks away yet.

7. I considered skipping to just ease the stress on the kids, and because that was kiddo's initial request anyway. Not because I can't resist touching my boyfriend, but because maybe it's easier if I just stay outta the way. Boyfriend pressed a bit to find out why kiddo didn't want me there, when he'd previously been excited about it, and had asked me to come to other events in the past, and that's when he got the ""cause mom will be there too (she was not at a number of events I was at last winter, so he didn't have to worry about us crossing paths), plus... Kissing."" We've honestly had a hard time deciding which things I should go to and which I shouldn't (I really am invited, by the boyfriend), because according to mom, I'm not allowed at any event, ever, regardless of boyfriend or kid wishes. 

8. When were at the same events, we do not sit together. Mom does not acknowledge me, hasnt said two words to me, really ever. There isn't any sort of blow up or anything, but certainly the kids pick up on the tension. I don't attempt small talk with her as I feel that might make it worse for all involved. Maybe I'm wrong. At these things, I'm thrilled to sit with my bf, or on my own if he's coaching. I bring gum and sunflower seeds and cheer for them. The kids will come chat with me and ask if I saw that play or whatever, but only if mom isn't there (she misses a fair amount of stuff). If mom is there, the kids steer very clear of me. 

9. I know that I have a tendency to just disappear when I'm hurt. I'm not saying it's healthy, or wise, but that's an old vestige that I guess I'm still working on.

I can still accept judgment though, thank you.",70,50,0.79
1763,No A-holes here,"I just moved into a new place. I have five roommates. Two people, two chinchillas, and a turtle. The chinchillas have their own room which is right next to my room and is actually slightly than mine. In the room they have two separate cages. This turned out to be an important detail but I’ll get to that later. My roommate, who owns the house, had spoken with me various times about how it would be awesome if I would watch TV or read in there in order to get the chinchillas socialized to people. I hadn’t done it once since moving in and I was beginning to feel guilty about the chinchillas becoming antiaocial. So I figured that instead going to library, I’d do my homework in the chinchilla room and kill two birds with one stone. Well, I let the chinchillas out of their cages and they immediately started fighting so I grabbed one of them and put him back in his cage. The other one wouldn’t go back into his cage so i called my roommate for help and she freaked out pretty majorly.

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I’m 17, Dad is 43, and father’s wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple’s therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father’s wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father’s wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father’ house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying “The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,” and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say “Don’t mess with her,” with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn’t have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years’ worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father’s racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn’t my father’s child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn’t even deserve any respect from me because she didn’t respect my mother’s marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven’t talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don’t mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn’t have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

1765,Asshole,"Hi,

Am I the asshole for asking my wife to ask me to do chores around the house instead of automatically doing them. I will fully admit I am bad at taking initiative as far as chores go. My first tasks that come to mind are cooking, bills, grocery shopping, etc. I don't automatically go to vacuuming, laundry,or general cleaning. I am asking that she just has to ask me to do them and I will get them done or at least start them before she gets home from work. She works father away from home so I am usually the first home. 

This is something that we have talked about before and I always ask her to just ask me to do them and I will try to take more initiative to get them done. She got really upset that she has to ask me to do them.

Today during my work (I work alone in the Café) a family of 15 people came inside the cafe (4 adults and 11 children) and only ordered 1 coffee that's it. The kids were playing around, crying, making noises and leave garbages everywhere. They were all eating stuff from the outside, and drinking some stuff they bought at the grocery store. They all went to the washroom, everyone no exception. I had to put 2 new paper roll in the bathroom be wise they were taking so much of it. I had to replenish the big water contenant 2 Times because they were taking so much from it. After 20 minutes I was a little on nerve and one of the kid was touching the water contenant and dropped it on the floor. After that, the mom just went to me and ask for more water in their bottles (bought outside of our coffee shop) without apologies for the water on the floor. 

At this point I was angry and told her that I was not going to give her free water anymore. She started to say that we have really bad customer services and that she was always well served in other restaurants. I told her that we are not a restaurant but a self service coffee shop and that the way the whole family was acting since their arrival was really unrespectful. After that she claimed that she had the right to have free water and I told her no. She quit the coffee with all her family saying that they will all tell this to my superior.

1770,Not the A-hole,"My brother and his ex wife were a mess. He confided in me that he was having an affair and I advised him to break it off. He didn’t listen and soon after that, he told me that she had slept with another man. The he found out she was pregnant. He wanted to stay with her until they could do a paternity test. As far as I know, he did not end his affair.

They recently performed a paternity test as part of the prenatal tests and the baby is the other guy’s, which wasn’t entirely unexpected. The point here is that my brother knew this could be another man’s child and stayed with her with this knowledge.

Since the breakup, my brother has taken to trashing his ex to everyone who will listen. We live in a small town and his ex is being harassed for committing “paternity fraud.” I understand that he’s upset, but he’s ruining her life. I asked him to stop, but he insists that she actually committed paternity fraud, even though he knew about the cheating before the paternity test (something he leaves out when he tells this story.)

We had a family dinner and my brother was talking to my uncle, who is also his ex’s boss, and he was talking up what a horrible and untrustworthy person she is. I stepped in and said, “this isn’t entirely true, he knew about the cheating before they even knew about the pregnancy and he was aware the whole time that the baby might not be his. They also cheated on each other so it’s really better for everyone that the toxic shit show is over.”

I said fine so I went to eat and as I was leaving I remembered that the car we had uses a spare tire.  After googling I found that you need to replace them ASAP and can’t go on the highway as it’s 65 mph standard instead of the recommended 40 on the spare.  I tell my dad he tells me to call ignore google and to drive the car.  I say no and also we have another car that’s perfectly fine that we could drive but which I’m not allowed to.

1774,Not the A-hole,"I think I might at least partially be an asshole in this situation so I'm opening it up for discussion.

Thanksgiving last year my now-husband and I announced our engagement and our intention for a June wedding. A few weeks later my BIL and SIL announced the pregnancy of their first child. My SIL is still very young and she grew up very spoiled. She's still very self-centered but since her pregnancy she has started maturing. Despite our personality differences she and I have grown sort of close. I was genuinely excited about the baby.

My mom wanted me to have a wedding shower so I picked late May. I sent out invites for May 19th. About two weeks before my shower my SIL sent out invites for her baby shower-for May 19th. My husband's relatives who I had invited and who had RSVPed my shower skipped her shower for her's. SIL showed up at my shower in the last hour wearing a white dress, a tiara, and a pink satin sash over her chest.

Husband and I picked June 8th for the wedding. We had everything set up, everything paid for, a church and a minister, reception hall. It was all set and ready to go. About a week before my wedding SIL announces that she scheduled her c-section for-June 8th. She's not ill nor is the baby at risk, but SIL has a placenta condition that makes vaginal birth dangerous. My MIL and FIL told us that if they had to choose between the first grandchild and our wedding they'd choose the baby. Then his grandparents, his three aunts and two uncles and several cousins all said they wanted to be at the hospital for the baby. This family is incredibly close-knit and babies are a big effing deal for them. Then a bunch of their family friends got wind that these relatives weren't attending and backed out as well.

One afternoon right before the wedding SIL came over and asked if I was upset. I sort of went off on her. I didn't yell or use physical violence but I did cuss. Basically, this is what I said, ""yeah, I'm upset. I'm fucking mad. You've been an asshole to me lately and I don't know why. You stole the day of my wedding shower and now you're stealing my wedding day. One day, one day out of the mother-fucking year I want to be the one who's in the spot-light and now I can't. And it fucking hurts. I've put so much work into this goddamned wedding. (Husband) is upset and doesn't want to have a wedding anymore, just the court house. You've stolen my day and the excitement. Yeah, I guess you could say I'm fucking upset. Get the fuck out of my house. Good luck with the baby.""

SIL safely delivered a baby girl and both are doing well. My husband was still hurting and didn't meet the baby until she was three weeks old. I have yet to meet the baby. My BIL text me recently and called me a ""fucking dick"" and told me to suck it up and come meet the baby. I'm not mad anymore but I am hurt. I don't blame the baby, I just don't want to see BIL/SIL.

AITA for going off on her and refusing to go meet my new niece?

ETA INFO: Wedding was June 8, SIL due date was June 14. BIL said the doc wanted to do the surgery on June 12 but SIL insisted on the 8th. It wasn't an emergency c-section, she had no complications due to the condition and had known it would be a c-section since month 5. I had already informed everyone of my due date before that point. Save the Dates had been sent out before she scheduled her surgery.

ETA INFO: Regarding her shower date and mine; I asked everyone close to me if my dates conflicted their schedules. SIL said the dates both worked for her. Up until she actually sent out her invites she was telling everyone she was throwing her shower the first weekend in June.",239,716,0.97

I (18M) have been with my GF (18F) for over two years.

I'm a pretty serious competitive swimmer, so I started shaving my legs about a year ago. GF told me that she liked how my legs felt during sex, so I kept shaving them and moved on to basically my entire body (arms, legs, armpits, genitals, etc.)

We're both active Redditors, and few days ago, my GF saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ct8w0a/aita_for_not_shaving_my_legs_for_work/) about a woman being asked by her boss to shave her legs for work. She thought that was ridiculous (I did too) and told me that she was going to stop shaving to ""protest this sexist bullshit"" and ""help get rid of the expectation that women need to shave.""

I must admit, I was kind of annoyed by this. I thought her reasoning was terrible (and, let's be honest, I much prefer the feeling of shaved skin on shaved skin). I wouldn't have any problem with this if she, say, thought it was too much work (that shit takes a long time). I just didn't want to support her pointless ""protest.""

We went back and forth for a few minutes, and it ended with me telling her that I'd stop shaving down as a protest against stupid arguments. Swimming's in the off-season right now, so it's not going to affect my performance

She hasn't spoken to me in over a day. I also haven't shaved in over a day.

1780,Asshole,"Backstory:

Getting married on a Thursday, rehearsal is in a different state (my home state) on a Saturday.

The reason for this is that I’ve always wanted a small wedding. I believe it should be about me and my husband and something that makes us happy and we are NOT big part people. We don’t like crowds and I believe large wedding would make it very stressful and that’s not what we want. 

The wedding would be literally just us, his mom, my parents and my 4 brothers and my sister in law. 

The main reason for this is because I have a MASSIVE family. Both of my parents have 8 siblings and they each have an average of 5 kids. Some grown with children (I legitimately have 75 cousins) I see them all at least once a year (two families I see only once every 5 years of so because of distance), but since if I invite the aunts/cousins that I’m close to, id have to invite them all in order to keep peace in the family.

so I decided to do a large reception where everyone is invited to celebrate our marriage but a small ceremony where his mom can come (she is sick and cannot travel so we are getting married close to her home) and both of us are comfortable enough to have fun and actually enjoy our wedding.

However, I was wondering if it would be rude to make a registry even though none of the people at the reception are invited to the wedding? 

Like we really don’t need the things but don’t want people to be flying blind and receive 4 blenders. 

So WIBTA to not invite people to the wedding but invite them to a Facebook group about the reception and the registry??",48,57,0.84
1781,Asshole,"i don’t know where to start but i guess i’ll start by saying my husband and i have been trying to fall pregnant for nearly 5 years. i had twins at 20 (the father is not my husband) and after that i was told it would be hard to fall pregnant again (because of some other issues i had, as well as issues with my twin pregnancy). the twins are now 12 for info. 

about a year ago we decided to just stop and look at other options. ultimately we decided against ivf etc. and go down the route of adoption. we put in our papers and everything and we were selected by a pregnant teenager with twins. it was surprisingly fast how we got picked (according to our lawyer) and we were so over the moon as well as my older twins. 

last week we found out i’m pregnant. i’m almost 22 weeks so we found out very late. i wasn’t on birth control because of horrible side effects and the doctor told me i should be fine. 

the twins are due in nearly 10 weeks but the doctor has told us that he will likely want to induce her nearing 32-35 weeks. if we cancel the adoption now i could not imagine what this poor teenage girl would go through. we talked to our lawyer and because of some law things that she probably will not be able to put the twins up for adoption until after they are born now. once the twins go up for adoption it could take up to a year for the twins to actually be taken off her. she has no baby equipment, anything etc. to prepare for these twins.

1782,Asshole,"Last week I organised a romantic dinner for me and my gf at a fine dining restaurant she's always wanted to go to. She was excited, the only problem was I hadn't worked out how we were going to pay for it. 

We have joint accounts, and budget our money together including some 'splurge' for each of us to spend how we want. The cost of the dinner was going to be more than what I could cover with my splurge alone, so I suggested we maybe go halves or something. This upset her because she believed as I was taking her to dinner I should pay. I didn't press the issue then because I didn't know what to do.

Later that day we were out having lunch. Knowing I wouldn't be able to use my splurge for the lunch and the dinner, I said ""if you pay for lunch, I'll sort out the dinner."" She agreed and we had lunch. I thought I'd pay for the dinner with the credit card and sort it out later.

Well looking at our budget later I realized that as I stroke of luck, due to the fact we pay our loans monthly and budget half the repayment every fortnight, there are actually 3 pays before the next loan repayment. Excellent, I can use some of that money to pay for the dinner. The rest can just go onto the loans as an extra payment.

We went to dinner a few days later, had a great time, all was good. Cut to the next day and I was browsing a shop on my phone and mentioned something about my splurge. 
""But you don't have any left""
""Yeah I do, because I actually found a way to cover the dinner"" I explained my budget magic.
""Oh so you make me spend MY splurge on lunch and then don't pay for dinner?""

Lunch cost $35, Dinner cost $250. There's no way my splurge could cover the dinner and she knew that. I'll admit I didn't think about offering to pay her back for my lunch, but it wasn't through any malice. (I have since put all my splurge back onto the credit card to cover most of the dinner payment). She got very angry at me for making her pay for the dinner without her consent, and is saying that I'm sneaky for getting a free lunch and not paying for her dinner etc. I don't think there's anything wrong with using our money to pay for our dinner, but believes now that the romantic dinner doesn't really count as me doing something nice for her because I paid for it out of our joint money.

1785,Not the A-hole,"My stepdaughter Mia is 13 . I’ve been in her life since she was 3, so she’s always known me. She was raised to call me Ben. She has an AWESOME relationship with her bio dad- I mean, AWESOME. Her parents split up mutually, and there was never any bad blood. she’s always encouraged Mia to stay close to her dad. We all live super close by and it’s basically up to Mia on any given day where she would like to stay so she is in close contact with everybody. 

My relationship was always set in stone that I wasn’t a parent- I was/am just the partner of her mom. This was discussed by my wife, and Mia’s dad when I entered their lives. As such, I don’t discipline Mia beyond what an ordinary adult would do, I am there to be a present force who loves her, NOT to be a parent. It works very well for all of us and she is a loved little girl.

Lately she has been calling me dad. I was surprised at first, very surprised in fact, and first I was proud and happy. Then a few days ago I got a call from her actual dad and he sounded upset. He said he’d had an argument with Mia over something silly- she was pushing strong boundaries and she cussed him out, he appropriately disciplined her, and she told him he was a shitty dad and ‘I’m her real dad anyway’

I had a sit down with Mia with her mom present and spoke to her about it. She tearfully admitted she wasn’t sure if she felt that way. When we asked why, she said because he is strict and I’m not. She might love me, and I love her, and she might have disagreements with her dad, but she is also a complete daddy’s girl and they two are thick as thieves. 

I told her I loved her, but asked her not to call me dad please as that’s a special title for her bio dad. My wife also doesn’t want me to be called dad. I jokingly said she could call me her personal advisor if she liked, or her very own humble assistant, and she immediately brightened at that. 

News of this has got to my MIL, and she called me up telling me it was wrong for me to tell Mia that she shouldn’t call me dad, and that I’ve ‘ruined her trust in me’ and other pretty strong things such as ‘I stopped a little girl from expressing her opinion’ I don’t know what to think.

I’m so humbled by the gold as well guys, thank you so much. What a fucking awesome thing to wake up to. 

I also want to point out that Mia ONLY called me dad to spite her father. She has since admitted she’d rather not call me dad.

I looked through the Young adult fiction section but couldn't find it until I saw that it was in a separate section labeled ""Teen Girl Fiction."" Now in this teen girl section there were almost all of the more popular books about gay boys that there are. Love Simon, Carry On, Call Me By Your Name stuff like that.

I did a little double take, had my inside ""bruh..."" moment but bought the book and left no questions asked.

I just think that it's uncool for them to market these books as only for girls. Especially since that would probably leave most gay kids feeling ""like a ""girl"" if they bought it."" (my gay friends words on the matter) It just feels to me like it's sending a wrong message.

I wouldn't be yelling at them or demanding anything I would just try to politely ask if they don't think that it's a bit unfortunate to put those books there instead of the regular Young Adult section and that having them in the girls section sends the wrong message.

Is it actually sending the wrong message? Am I overreacting? Is it just my inner disdain at the rabbid fangirl fanbase of gay relationships? WIBTA if I asked the employees if they can move those books to the YA section instead?

We got into a pretty heated argument which ended with me telling her that I’m going to call the towing company. She moved and gave me many nasty looks. 

Am I the asshole? I realize that it was her daughter in the accident and she wanted to be with her but it made no sense to me that the police would tell her to park in the 314 spot in a private lot while there were at least 6 open spots on the street.",64,637,0.95
1800,Not the A-hole,"I bought a house (a duplex) 6 years ago. I lived in the larger unit with my girlfriend, and rented out the smaller unit. About a year after buying the house, I got a fantastic job opportunity out of town and decided to move. My girlfriend agreed and was very supportive, but decided to stay in our hometown to finish school. She was going to move back in with her parents. 

At this time, unknown to my GF, her parents were splitting up, and her mom was looking for a new place to live with her other two daughters, and conveniently, my GF. She is a super sweet lady, and I was in a position to help her out, so I offered the now vacant unit in my house to her at a discounted rental price until she was able to save enough to find a different place.

This was about 5 years ago now. I think she has struggled to save, and with the real estate market being as crazy as it is, she is still there. I don't blame her because I know it is very difficult to save and get approved for mortgages on a single income. 

With the real estate market booming in our city, the house has gained a lot of value. My GF is now my fiance, and we are starting to plan our wedding and our future. I am thinking about selling the house so we can pay for the wedding, honeymoon, and afford a larger single home for us and our future family. If I sell the house, my MIL and youngest SIL are forced to move, and I don't think they can afford it...

Some of my friends say I'm an asshole for doing that to her, but others say ""do what you want, it's your house."" It's my future MIL. My fiance is very much on the fence about it as well, but she knows it's ultimately my decision. I wish my MIL would just realize what is happening and find a place on her own.

WIBTA for selling my house and negatively affecting my MIL's living situation?

INFO

My fiance doesn't want to put her mom in a situation that she can't afford, but she also wants to be comfortable and have the things that selling the house would allow. She's very conflicted and is leaving it up to me.

I do plan on talking to my MIL about our plans before listing the house. I would never blindside her like that.",33,69,0.95

1802,Asshole,"When I'm upset (either mad at someone or just sad) I get quiet and withdrawn. Since I'm normally very outspoken and active, it's very obvious when I'm upset.

I have a friend who lacks empathy. Idk if she's on the spectrum or a high functional sociopath or what, but she definitely doesn't react right to certain situations. She usually handwaves by claiming shes just being rational and logical, but she can be very heartless at times.

Sometimes she'll say incredibly hurtful (but maybe rationally logical) things. It's not always directed at me, but even seeing her talk that way about strangers is upsetting. I get upset and avoid being around her for a while, but evetually get over it after a few weeks. Sometimes she'll notice and reach out asking if she upset me and apologizes.

That doesn't always happen, and over time it feels kinda hollow. Like she's frantically trying to memorize ""rules"" of what not to say and modifying that particular behavior.

After a while she's started to say I'm trying to emotionally manipulate her and forcing her to apologize, or gaslighting her or whatever. To me I just can't stand being around her til the memory of what she says had faded. I don't need her to apologize. I don't think she's capable of changing and it's probably not fair for me to expect her to change.

AITA for acting this way?

ETA: Since people seem to think I'm blocking or ghosting her or ignoring, examples of me being ""quiet and withdrawn"" are:

* Not feeling like waiting 2 hours in a line to buy her shaved ice. Normally I'll be happy to wait in line and hold a place for everyone, but instead I say something like, ""sorry, not feeling up to it today"".

* Turning down an invitation to do an escape room and saying something like ""hahah sorry, can't do it this weekend"". If I'm mad at her, the last thing I want to do is be locked in a room together playing cooperative games.

* Not wanting to go indoor skydiving saying ""Ugg, really not feeling it. I've done it before, not the biggest fan"".

I guess since we usually go out and do fun shit together every other weekend, it's pretty noticeable when I turn down activities. But tbf, I've also had to pull back because I'm busy with work, sick, or just on my period and not wanting to leave the house.

Why I don't just tell her I'm mad right then? Because she will argue with me for 1 hour+ as to why I'm wrong, and what she says is perfectly logical and reasonable. It ends up with either me caving and saying I was wrong to be mad, or her apologizing for upsetting me. I don't want to have a fucking argument every time we have a disagreement of opinions so is easier to just shut up and back off for a while. 90% of the time she doesn't even notice I was mad at all. The 10% of the time she notices its because it last for 2 weeks, and that usually means I'm mad enough to argue back. Maybe to her, since she only notices when I'm super angry, it seems like I'm forcing her to apologize 100% of the time. To me, I'm only asking her to stop 10% of the time.",33,45,0.92

1804,Not the A-hole,"Our firm occupies multiple floors in a high rise building, and I use the elevator multiple times a day because my department spans several floors. There are these two “bros” in another department I’ve run into many times. Usually the interaction is limited to a nod. They’re kind of a hybrid New England “Chad” meets Jersey “Bro” with a dash of homophobia. They’re the type who are probably book smart at SOME subjects but really got through life because of their parents. They’re so unaware of their surroundings that one time I was in the elevator with them, they were behind me, and one of them pointed out my pants to the other guy to make fun of the patterns, but I was able to see their reflections on the elevator’s metallic doors. 

So yesterday I had the misfortune of sharing the elevator with these two again. Except this time, they were talking about their weekend plans and how one was planning to impress a “chick” because she seemed like the she could “bang like a Bangkok stripper”. I assume she’s asian because they started doing the Full Metal Jacket sucky sucky five dollah and me love you long time schtick. I turned around and told them to keep inappropriate conversations out of the work place. And they just ignored me. 

Anyway, they might have thought because I’m male it was ok to talk like that at the workplace. I reported them to HR today. I’m thinking about shooting their boss an email as well to let him know I’ve reported the two bros, what my concerns are, and that they may need disciplinary action and sexual harassment training. 

My co-worker thought it may be a little drastic because that’s how those two are. But I disagreed. 

TL:DR: Two guys were having locker room talk in an elevator and I reported them to HR, and maybe their boss.

Edit 1: Thanks for the constructive feedback. I’m definitely not informing their boss. HR notified me that they will follow up with me and advised me to keep this confidential.

Edit 2: Some have asked/suggested I’m a woman or a heterosexual man. I’m an out and proud gay asian man. Lets put the silly speculations to rest.

Edit 3: Some here have very strong opinions. Please refrain from sending me any more private messages with tired homophobic insults like “f*ggot”. Lets keep this cordial. Thanks.",719,2219,0.88

1807,Not the A-hole,"As some background, my in laws (both in their 50s) are generally really great people. They've always been very kind to me and welcomed me into the family with open arms. So a few months ago my husband (32m) and I (29F) started making plans to travel to Europe for 5 days and asked if they could watch the kids for 3 days, then my mom and sisters would take the kids for the other 2 days until we got back. This was going to be first time that we were away from the kids for more than a day since our oldest child was born (4 years ago). They said yes absolutely, they'd love to have them. We followed up two more times before we booked anything to confirm the dates would work for their schedule (we had made arrangements for them to watch our youngest child earlier in the year so we could attend an event that was a pretty far drive away, and they backed out last minute). They said yes, that they had already requested the days off etc. So, we spent 3k on our flight, hotel, etc (90% of which is nonrefundable). Then about a week after we booked everything my MIL called and said they could no longer watch the kids because ""two people had already requested that time off at work"". I was quiet for a minute and said that we would try to find other arrangements but that it would be difficult given that my family live so far away, etc. She said sorry and a short while later we hung up. I talked to my husband and said that I thought it was very inconsiderate of them to agree to watch the kids and then back out after we had given them multiple chances to say that those dates wouldn't work or they weren't comfortable with that. He said he agreed and that he would talk to them about it and let them know how we felt. It's been about 2 months now, so I asked if he had a chance to talk to them about it. He said no because he felt like that was going to be a really awkward conversation to have with them. So, Reddit, WIBTA if I tried to find a constructive way to tell my in-laws how we felt and that it's totally fine if they don't want to/ can't watch the kids but that we need them to stick to the commitments they make?

Edit: I forgot to mention my family live 6 hours away, so they aren't really an option for watching the kids.

2nd edit: I probably should have been more clear on the IL time off thing. Turns out they hadn't actually put in the requests yet (even though they told us they did) and when they went to do it after we booked tickets there were too many people who had requested off",32,37,0.93

1813,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I were planning a trip to Europe for next summer, we have been there twice already and were in the initial planning stages.  About a month ago, she went to dinner with a couple we are friends with, I was not able to attend.

When she got back, she was very excited and told me ""Amber and Chris are coming with us to Europe!""  I was super pissed.  She made what I considered a very large decision without even asking me.  I like Amber and Chris, but I really don't want to spend two weeks traveling with them.

So we had a big fight, mainly because she didn't ask me before making the decision.  In the end I gave in because I did not want to be the Asshole.....

Fast forward to last week, Amber and Chris are over doing research on what to do in Europe (mainly in Paris and the rest of France).  It becomes super evident that they are different travelers than we are.  We are constantly on the go, 16 hours a day, seeing as much as we can.  They were looking forward to sleeping in, going to a cafe then wandering to an Art Museum.

After the the tenth Art Museum they mentioned (nothing against them, one or two are ok, but thats all) I had had enough, I pictured my hard earned vacation being ruined by people who I didn't want to vacation with in the first place.

I then, very politely, suggested we travel separately and maybe meet up at some point in Paris for dinner.  I explained that we seemed to be on different pages about the trip and would have a better time doing our own thing.  We havent made any reservations at all yet, so this would be easy to do.

Well, it didn't go well.  Amber and Chris were offended and said that they were just not going to go.  My wife was super pissed off saying I am just mad about not being asked in the first place (shes not wrong, but the differences in travel goals were a part too) and stated we are NOT going to Europe at all now.

1814,Not the A-hole,"My parents divorced when I was 13. I was born into a very wealthy family, but everything I had ever learned or thought I knew changed after said divorce. My father intentionally ruined my mother's life during the process ( Scheduling court dates and not showing so mother would have to pay attorney fees, etc.) Eventually my mother owed so much money to her lawyer she had to sell the home she won in the settlement and move back in with her parents with us in tow.

When I graduated university I asked my father to attend the ceremony, but never got a reply. A few years later when I was starting my business. I would send him messages every few months, but would almost never hear back... when I would it would be some random comment about the day I was born or some unrequested life advice. As I got older I decided to start a business and asked my father if he would loan me $5000 for 2 years while I got started. No reply. When I got married, he received a handwritten invitation from my fiancee and me but never bothered to let us know if he was coming or not. He did not. I could go on, but let's just say every major milestone in my life was celebrated alone. Birth of children (two he has never even seen) to major tragedies... he has never been there. I clawed my way up from nothing by myself while he is an heir who has never wanted for anything.

About a year ago now, I started receiving more than one message from him a quarter. Typically anecdotes about my childhood, political views, a congratulatory email regarding the birth of my 4 year old with their name misspelled (a completely different name), and an invitation to visit him 2k miles away whenever I'd like.

1816,Not the A-hole,"Backstory: My girlfriend and I live together with 3 other roommates. Due to the constant in and out of people, I bought a bunch of 6 foot iPhone chargers and charging bases to plug around the apt. The main one I use is a charger near the tv that has 4 inputs in the base so I can also charge my phone. 

While we’re pretty similar in a lot of ways, her and i are opposites when it comes to charging things. Anytime I sit down I plug in my iPad or phone (i have a flip phone for daily use and have an iPad mini in case I want to read news/watch YouTube/ iMessage people) and try to keep things charged all the time. Meanwhile GF routinely goes to work with her phone at less than 20% and lets it die, or will occasionally plug it in when it’s at 4%. She rarely plugs it in when she goes to bed. I tease her about this but have also had slightly more serious convos asking her not to do that Bc I’ve had to call Ubers for her before Bc her phone was dead and she had no way to get home.

A month or so ago, I went to use the charger near the tv and it was gone. I asked her where it went, and she casually told me she took it to work Bc her phone was dead. I part laughingly, part seriously, told her that I really didn’t want her to do that anymore Bc it’s a serious pet peeve of mine and bought her a charger to keep in her bag. 

Fast forward to last night. I was extremely tired after work, to the point of which both my gf and roommate asked me if something was wrong Bc they thought I was upset or something (I genuinely wasn’t, I was just extremely tired) and I went to bed early. GF stayed up late Bc she had her first emt ride along at 7 am today and she was very nervous and was studying. 

This morning, I got up started doing the dishes while listening to Philip deFranco on on my iPad. There’s no charger in the kitchen, so my iPad was getting pretty low. I went to the living room to plug it in while I was in the shower, but the 4 input charging base was gone, the cord was just sitting there. Guessing what had happened, I iMessages gf asking if she had taken it. She replied that she had used it to charge her phone in her room so she could have an alarm in the morning Bc her phone was almost dead, and forgot to put it back. I asked her to not do that again and reminded her I spent money on extra chargers so I’d always have a charger handy. She then told me she felt very attacked, and told me I was valuing my convenience over her necessity. Over the course of the convo she apologized but was upset I was mean and hurtful in how I asked her not to use it again. 

Initially I felt like I was absolutely in the right, but now I’m questioning if I was too mean when asking this, and if I really was prioritizing my convenience over her necessity. I’m attaching the convo for more context. Am I the asshole?

1818,Not the A-hole,"Here’s some backstory: 

When my mom moved to the states from the Philippines she promised my uncle that she would pay for my cousin to attend school. My mom figured that by sending my cousin to private school and college, she would be able to get a really good job and take care of her parents. And they wouldn’t have to depend on my mom forever. In the Filipino culture, it’s pretty much expected that the children take care of their parents. Especially the oldest sibling. 

Things got sketchy when my cousin kept asking my mom for more and more money. She claimed that they were for books and what not. My mom got suspicious so she personally called the college and found out that my cousin had not paid two semesters worth of tuition. She also found out that they lied about the tuition cost. Obviously, my mom was pissed so she cut them off. The funny thing is she was almost done with nursing school and my mom had a job lined up for her already. 

Fast forward, that same cousin asks me for money all the time. The thing is I already send money to my uncle who my cousin and her kids live with. The money I send covers food and some extra things they need every month. But she’s begging me. I understand that life in the Philippines is tough and I’m better off than they are but I just feel like she made her bed. My fiancé thinks we should just send her money because she has kids and they don’t have a supportive father and maybe she will stop asking for money for awhile. Idk though. 

My cousin does have a job but I’m sure it doesn’t pay very much. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting to send her money?",19,44,0.94
1819,Not the A-hole,"Of course if it were as simple as the subject line the answer would be yes, but there's context.

My boyfriend and I live together. A few years ago, I moved here from out of state and met him. We moved in together about a year later and have been together 3 years.

Since I moved, I haven't made many friends. I'm out of college and work from home, so it's hard to meet new people. Every year around my birthday, I get really depressed now because back home I used to have huge parties to celebrate every year, but now I know like 4 people other than my boyfriend, and not super well. 

This year I decided to try to have fun anyway. I talked to my BF and set up a facebook event, made plans to go to a restaurant I like here, and invited everyone I know in town.

Everyone declined my invite. It was crushing. I was devastated and it really made me feel like I had no friends here at all. I wound up canceling the event and cried almost every day for the next two weeks, often sobbing on my boyfriend's shirt over it. I felt totally rejected, and every time he'd just try to soothe me by telling me how much he cares and that we'd do something ""just the two of us"" instead.

On my birthday, we went out to dinner together. I ruined my makeup, crying at dinner over the situation despite trying not to. It was painful.

When we got home, we opened the door to find my friends waiting, yelling surprise! The reason they all canceled on my event? My boyfriend had told them to, so he could do this instead.

The party was fun and all, but I feel betrayed by my boyfriend. He thinks I'm crazy and that the positive of the party I got should override any pain that I went through before it. I think he watched me sob my eyes out for two weeks over a problem he created, knowing the whole time he could tell me the truth and fix everything - and instead had me thinking everyone I know here hates me.

I have to regularly remind him if he has everything before we leave. If I don't, we usually have to go back. It's been like this for 9 years and has only gotten slightly better.

A couple nights ago, we met some friends for dinner and drove separately since I was going straight from work. When I arrived at the restaurant, I saw my husband's car in the parking lot. I walked past it on my way to the entrance and saw that the driver side window was rolled all the way down. Right smack in the center console in one of the cup holders was my husband's wallet. Anyone could have swiped it, so I grabbed it and threw it in my purse before entering the restaurant. Fast forward through dinner and it's time to pay the check. My husband realizes his wallet isn't on him and goes to his car to grab it, except it isn't there anymore. He can't figure out the last time he saw it. I told him we'd worry about it later and that I'd cover dinner. My husband spent the next day looking for his wallet and had even cancelled his cards. Then this morning he said he couldn't find his wallet and that he was going to the DMV on his lunch break to get his driver license reissued. I finally told him I had his wallet the entire time and explained how and why it was in my possession. He was totally pissed and called me a jerk for being childish just to prove a point.

Today we had a giant fight about it where she basically called me ungrateful. She said that since she spent money raising me, she shouldn't have to pay me back and that I should be paying her back. She shoved $200 in my face and said ""Here. Take it. Don't ask me for anything else. I hope it was worth it.""

1825,Everyone Sucks,"Update 2: I told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. Yes, I told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, I had to crack the whip. Let those two eat each other alive. They deserve each other.

Update 1: This HILARIOUS. My son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my DAY. I was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. I can react in so many ways...


His mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

We have 50/50. She requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. 

Punish him when he's on their time. 

I have no problems with him when he's with me.

I refused.

I already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

Also, I don't want to set precedent where I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


Edit: Update: My son called him a ""freaking asshole."" My ex calls him the same thing when they fight. Her words, not mine. He learned it from her, not me.

I came home from work about 2 weeks ago and there is a queen sized blow up mattress in the middle of our living room. Our small living room where everyone gathers to socialize and usually eat and play. We have two kids, 9 and 10, who have friends over all the time. 

I asked him if he would please put it down during the day or slide it out of sight at least. He agreed but has not kept up with that. I often see him or the kids just lounging on it during the day to watch tv/play Xbox. 

We had a conversation about that. He said he is comfortable and does not want to walk up the stairs each night yet. I completely see where he is coming from and asked him if he could compromise by getting a smaller mattress like a twin size that would be easier to put up in the morning. He refused saying it’s not that big of a deal. 

It’s a huge deal for me, I do not want a bedroom in my living room. His foot is almost healed and he still does not want to get rid of it, now saying that if he wakes up in the middle of the night upstairs and can’t go back to sleep he will come down and try to sleep there.

I had mentioned to my 3 bridesmaids that I had found a really well known hair and makeup artist to do all of our hair and makeup for the day of at a good price. It works out to be $150/ per person for both hair and makeup, and I had done a lot of research to find that this is a decent cost. My friend turned around and told me that was ridiculous and that she will just do her own hair and makeup for the day of, which has frustrated me. The other 2 girls agree this is a decent price and are fine with it.
I feel like its important to note here....this is NOT her first time as a bridesmaid she has been in 4 other ones which required her to get her hair and makeup done. Money is also not an issue, as she has recently received an inheritance from her grandfather. She also isnt a fan of traditional weddings and doesnt see the point of a lot of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with it. If I was confident that she could match the general looks of the other 2 women, then I wouldnt care if she did it herself, but doesnt own any hair or makeup tools, and I would know as I see her weekly.I feel like this is her trying to throw her weight around and that because I've known her since we were tiny tots, she assumed I would let her do whatever she wanted.

It makes us uncomfortable when she does that because there is really no right answer. What are we supposed to say? “Yes”? That would be rude. And I feel saying no would be a bold faced lie for obvious reasons, and so that in and of itself would be insulting. Also, we don’t to make her feel bad because weight is such a sensitive issue, but we also don’t feel like we should have to be put in an uncomfortable position. Especially when she refuses to eat healthy or exercise. So when she starts saying stuff like that, I usually ignore her. 

To make matters worse, she’ll try on an outfit and ask for feedback while criticizing her body the entire time. And no matter what I say she has a problem. If I tell her an outfit isn’t flattering she gets an attitude. If I tell her she looks fine, she says I’m lying. It’s so frustrating.

1831,Asshole,"So this semester I started taking a intro web design class. Despite attending 3 classes though no one has any clue what to fucking do for the class. This is where J comes in. J is a 60 something guy who is the professor for the class. He's some industry guru who made a lot of money in web programming and he let us know that right off the bat.

&#x200B;

The problem with J is that he spends the who lecture time trying to be ""hip"" and impress us by being funny and making ""radical"" comments. He starts each lecture by pulling a desk to the front, taking his shoes off, and connecting with us. He then proceeds to just stand there and ramble about stuff that is vaguely related to the topic while not teaching us anything. Wednesday he spent over 25 minutes letting us philosophies on how we should layout a web page despite the fact he hasn't taught a single html tag in class.

&#x200B;

The worst part by far though is the work load. For the next 14 days we have various small irrelevant things due and almost 4 chapters of reading. Despite being a web programming class, tonight we have to write a page paper pretending to ""advertise"" our website. The thing that pissed me off though is that he never announced any of this in class or though the announcement channel. Last night we had our first reading and first project due (4th day of the semester). We had to build a simple site in html despite the fact he never announced that 2 chapters of the book were due or the project in class. This morning when we came people were complaining and he told them ""tough luck"" and to pay closer attention to the due dates.

&#x200B;

As class was getting started people were still complaining so he announced that he would reopen it for tonight but I raised my hand and told him that it still does not make it right because he has yet to teach us anything about html. He then told me that it's my responsibility to read and learn and that he wont be repeating what's said in the book because that is ""not his job"". He then said that the book will teach us and we are supposed to come to class with that knowledge.

&#x200B;

Most of the kids in this class are freshman with only 3 or 4 seniors like myself filling the credit requirements. I have never had a class like this and every programming teacher i've had at least introduced us to the languages before and I told him this. He got defensive and told me that this is preparing me for the real world. So I stood up and with everyone looking at me told him ""Well, if the real world will consist of a out of tough old man who is more concerned about being cool than setting the people below him up for success then I might as well give up now. If it isn't clear i'm dropping this class. You're a clown and i'm not sticking around for this"" and walked out.

We took it to the vet to see if it was chipped, which it was not. We fed and washed it. The next day we went to the vet to get it checked out. The vet indicated the dog had been loose for some time as it was underweight and had intestinal parasites which gave the dog its inflated looking stomach. I gave the dog its first set of vaccinations, and had it treated for the intestinal parasites for which we set up a return appointment because it needs to be treated again in a couple weeks.

I’m the only non-white person on my team at work. I’m Asian and my last name is one syllable and starts with an X, which I understand confuses some people with regards to pronunciation.

I have been at my job for 6 months now, and my colleagues still continue to mispronounce my last name. Yesterday, while correcting them for the 500th time, I was told by one of them that I shouldn’t be so hung up about the pronunciation, and that’s it’s just a name.

But then, I realized, that all of my colleagues have learned how to pronounce each others’ last names, despite everyone’s last name having multiple syllables and complicated spellings. None of them have a name like “Smith” or “Johnson” - they’re all names that most wouldn’t be able to pronounce on the first try.

Now, I made a concerted effort to learn everyone’s names and they literally don’t give a shit about mine. So I called them out and said that they seem unwilling to learn my name because I’m different from them.

I was at my sister's wedding when my cousin Sam who is 18 and wants to study CS, and his parents, came up to me to ask me for advice about school.

They wanted to know what kind of computer an and other supplies I'd recommend, and I said that I've been happy using my 2012 MacBook Air throughout all of college and grad school; it was tiny enough to throw in my purse or small backpack and go to class, and it was reliable as anything.

 And I'd recommend always looking for a PDF or digital copy of books before spending hundreds on paper copies. PDFs can be searched through way easier, marked up without losing value, etc. I also recommend getting durable notebooks like Moleskine brand, and taking good handwritten notes. Because I still find myself referring to my notes from college at work sometimes.

Sam said something about how Mac Airs aren't powerful at all, how they're more of a fashion laptop than a practical one. Which came off as kind of rude.

His dad asked about the computer, ""don't you need something more powerful for programming?"" And I was like ""Nah, programming is really just writing text to a file. And as for running code; normal undergrad projects aren't gonna be resource intensive enough to be a problem. Unless you're writing hella inefficient code."" 

Sam was like ""You're still using that old mac for your Master's?"" And I said yeah, I code on there and then compile and run on a separate server that's for computer vision processing.

Anyway, later that night, Sam came up to me, mad at me for having inadvertently talked his parents out of buying him the top of the line Alienware laptop he wanted. He was supposed to be getting a laptop as a ""going to school"" gift and he wanted that one.

So I guess when I talked about using a ""shitty"" laptop for school, and doing fine with it, it convinced them they didn't need to get him the Alienware laptop. 

I feel kind of bad for not realizing what was going on.

AITA for the advice I gave my cousin and his parents about college?

Edit - 

A lot of comments are arguing that a high-spec laptop is needed if he's doing game development. He's not, he's starting a bog-standard CS undergrad degree.

1838,Asshole,"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for two years. His mom recently bought a house in our town with her boyfriend to be closer to her son (my bf). I first met her about 6 months ago when she moved into her new home. 

Recently my bf had his wisdom teeth pulled. His mom and I both went to the apt where she cried the whole time that “her baby” was going to be “in so much pain”. I comforted her but was honestly confused why she was having such a strong reaction to a routine procedure. He ended up staying with her for a week and I wasn’t allowed to see him during that time. He said his mom wanted him “resting” since he just “had a trauma” (again, routine wisdom teeth extraction). He decided to stay another week and I was getting upset because I wanted to see him. He got his mom to agree to let me come for 30 minutes but the whole time she seemed irritated I was there. I asked him where he was sleeping since she only has one bedroom and he said he was in bed with her while her bf sleeps on the couch. They all seemed to think this was normal but again, I find it kind of creepy for a 26 year old to be sleeping in bed with his mom. I didn’t say this out loud but anyway, he ended up telling me I need to leave bc his mom really wants him to rest. 

He decided to stay ANOTHER week (note: while he’s there he was being spoon fed baby food by his mom because he was “too fragile” to have solid food after the wisdom tooth extraction 2 weeks prior). He agreed to come home (to his house not mine) for a weekend and have me stay over. His mom protested but he told her he’s going home and that’s that. She knew I was staying over and told him I’m manipulative. He said he “wasn’t ready” for solid food so at night when he got super hungry, I made him soup. I didn’t wash the dishes because it was late and we went right to bed. In the morning, I got up to go to work and figured I’ll wash the dishes when I get home (bf was taking time off work to recover). His mom popped in for a surprise visit and lost it that I didn’t wash the dishes and said I’m “no real woman”. He told me this and I finally lost it and told him he needs to stand up for me or it’s over and said his moms behavior is inappropriate. My BF says I’m TA for disrespecting his mom and being a slob.

Everything was going well and we were all pretty intoxicated by the end of the night. I had purposely ordered a large, fairly expensive steak so I could eat a little less than half of it and then save the rest for my dog, a Belgian Malinois (F6). I typically don't feed her human food but the next day (today) was her birthday so I wanted to give her a treat.

I pack up my steak in a box, we leave, and I start walking back to the car with them (there was a DD and I live a walk away so I didn't drive). As we're walking, a homeless man walking by us says ""ay, lemme talk to you right quick"". We ignore and keep walking and then a girl who I had just met that day and I have this exchange: 

Her: Why don't you give him your steak?

Me: I would but it's Bella's birthday tomorrow so I'm saving it for her. Plus, she rarely gets fed human food so she'll be happy to have this.

Her: Wtf, I'm sure your dog has enough to eat. Just be a good person and help out.

Me: Why don't you buy him food then?

She just gives me a glare and rolls her eyes and stops talking to me. The other girl there followed suit and the dudes and I kinda just laughed it off. This morning I was talking to my friend I was with last night about what happened and he just thought it was funny but that I am kind of an asshole for not giving him my food. 

So, AITA?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your responses. I stand by my decision and that decision isn't questioning of my morals. I appreciate the people bringing up the fact that we didn't know if it was food he was wanting in the first place. That's a very good point.

My dog and I ended up slightly ahead of her, following the sidewalk up to the door, and I was faced with a dilemma: Do I hold the door and let her go first—as I normally would, regardless of gender—or do I go first because she's wearing short shorts, and we're heading up a flight of stairs? My immediate thought is that if I were to let her go first she might think I was being a creep, as if I were letting her go first because her ass would be front-and-center all the way up the stairs. Then again, if I just went in first she might think ""where are this guy's manners?"" etc.

So I went with what I thought was overall the best option, which was to walk in first and do that outstretched arm thing to hold the door for her, but still being the one to walk upstairs first. It was a bit awkward, but at least I didn't feel like a creep.

Every single time she says she feels like she is dying, and she demands I take her to the emergency room. I've been driving her every time she asks because, to be honest, I'm afraid of her stressing herself out and causing a stroke or heart attack (she is a recovering anorexic, so she is more likely to experience these things at her age). However, the doctors at the ER now know her well, and they're starting to become annoyed when she turns up convinced she is dying when it's nothing. I can tell from their demeanour, and from the fact that the last few times we've been to the ER they've sent people in before us who had been waiting less time, because they know nothing is really wrong with her.

Last time we went, the doctor pulled me aside and asked that I stop bringing her when she has panic attacks. She is at the stage of her ED recovery that she is no longer likely to just have a heart attack or an organ failure, and they can't ""waste time on a panic attack"". I feel terrible explaining this to her as her symptoms are very real to her, and I don't know if she would be able to calm down without being assured she isn't dying. We live in the UK, so the hospital visits are free, making me feel even more guilty as I feel like we're abusing the system.

Our son, Bobby, is turning 8 in a few weeks. He (like me) is very introverted and shy. He doesn’t like to be the center of attention, he hates crowds, and he’s just a laid back quiet kid. There’s nothing wrong with that, but my family is the exact opposite and they have trouble understanding that different personality types exist.

Bobby doesn’t like parties. And having spent my own childhood dreading my birthday because of the outgoing nature of my family, I have always been sensitive to my child’s wants and I always ask what he would like to do for each birthday, and we do exactly that. Last year I was called an asshole because Bobby didn’t have a party at all, he wanted to go to a theme park, just us three, and we did. 

This year, he decided that he wanted to spend a little bit of his birthday with close extended family, and just have cake and ice cream with them, and then he wanted to go to dinner with my husband and I. Due to some health issues with my grandparents, we decided to have the cake at their house so that they wouldn’t need to worry about going anywhere. Bobby was fine with that, again reiterating who he wanted to attend and that he JUST wanted cake. This was conveyed to my grandmother and she said she understood. 

Today I learned that my grandmother has invited distant relatives and family friends, and has started planning dinner. I called her and said again, Bobby wants only [these people] and just a cake, which I am making and bringing over. She said that it’s her house and she can invite whomever she wants and make whatever she wants and that Bobby just needs to be exposed to more people so he can “come out of his shell”, plus he should be grateful because more people means more presents - which isn’t something my son even cares about. I told her that she’s right, it’s her house and I have no right to dictate who she invites over, and for that reason we will be having Bobby’s party at our house, and I’ll be issuing invites to the people he wants to celebrate with to come have cake. 

The rest of my family is saying that I was wrong to do that, that my grandmother now has to tell her friends and distant relations that its cancelled, which is embarrassing for her, and my grandparents won’t be able to attend since they can’t travel. I told them if she can’t respect my son’s wishes then we’ll have his party somewhere else. Since it’s now the second year I’ve been called it - I’m starting to wonder, Am I actually the asshole?

ETA: when I say my grandparents can’t “travel” I didn’t mean to imply that we live far. We are actually down the road from them, maybe a few miles. But my grandfather literally can’t leave the house, he’s unable to get into a car anymore.",59,345,0.96

Stanley would play with Jim’s dog (70+ lbs). This recent housewarming, other people brought their dogs, too, including my college friend (Steve), who owns a \~4-year-old lab mix (Zima, 70+ lbs), whom I've met several times since she was a puppy and was always sweet. Thing is, the Steve was out of town, so our other common friend (Steve’s best friend, Danny) was watching her – Steve and I been wanting to schedule playdate for Stanley and Zima but never worked out.

Stanley was fine with the other 2 dogs who were already there and are both Zima's size. We distance Zima and Stanley's fine. Jim’s fiance gives the four dogs bone marrows to keep them occupied and everything quiets down. However, after 15 mins or so, another friend arrives with his golden retriever and the dogs, except Stanley, who's with the bone, go to the door. Zima immediately starts acting aggressively with this new dog and people pull her away. As the dogs and everyone retreat to the kitchen, Zima attacks Stanley and grabs his leg with her mouth, trying to hurt him – it was frightening. I was close to Stanley, so I immediately saved him by pulling him out of her mouth while getting bit in the process. Everyone saw and Danny immediately takes Zima home and returns - very sincere and apologetic. Said he doesn’t know why she acted that way; however, at this point, Danny mentions that Steve said Zima got bit by a small dog 6 months prior. Would have been nice info to share before bringing her. 

I had a minor puncture and scrapes on my swollen wrist and Stanley had a cut on his ear and some tummy bruises/minor cuts – nothing too bad it seemed. Luckily, when I took Stanley to the vet the next morning, the tech said he's fine and is just bruised. I also went to the nearby urgent care (since it was a Sunday) to get my wrist checked and everything was okay - they gave me some antibiotics. 

Today, I got the notice from my insurance that I owe $266 (excluding the $100 copay I paid upon arrival) so I texted my Steve and Danny, asking for help to pay the $266, stating it'd be really appreciated since I already paid the $100 copay. They each gave me $130 but are acting distant (Steve never even asked how I'm doing or anything about Stanley. All he said when I asked him if she was vaccinated before the doc visit was that she is and he hopes Stanley and I are fine). Steve didn’t respond yesterday to my 3-person text. 

AITA?

TLDR: Went to friend's housewarming and friend's dog bit my dog and me, leading to a $366 healthcare bill. I politely asked friends (dog owner and friend watching his dog) to pay the $266, after I paid the $100 copay but friends are acting distant.",63,119,0.93

1851,Not the A-hole,"Hey folks, thanks in advance for your input. This situation is making me feel like I'm losing my mind.

After a 2 year relationship with many ups and downs, my ex boyfriend John broke up with me on the day we were supposed to move into a shared 1 bedroom apartment. The rent would have been extremely cheap split between the two of us, but shouldering the total alone would be kind of expensive. Not completely unmanageable, but definitely not ideal for either of our incomes. 

I have nothing against John and truly wish him the best, but living with a recent ex in a one bedroom, even in the most amicable of circumstances, is extremely awkward. I would like to live separately as soon as possible so I can begin to heal and move on. Both of our names are on the new lease, but I offered to move out and find temporary housing as I will be able to move in with two of my friends in January. John agreed to this and I began looking for housing. I have a lead on two reasonably priced rooms in shared houses that would allow me to move in before the end of the month. Both rooms cost about 100 to 150 dollars per month less than total cost of the new apartment. 

I let John know that I had found a few places and would probably be out within the next week or two. Later that night, he texted me that after talking about it with some of his coworkers, he has decided that it is unfair for him to shoulder the full cost of the rent once I move out. He thinks that I should have to offset the cost of his rent by around 200 dollars per month once I am no longer in the apartment, a little over a quarter of the full amount. 

I think that this is ridiculous. I let him know that I would be happy to pay the rent in full if I was the one who would be staying there, but I would not be financially contributing in any other circumstance. Also, before we broke up, I signed a parking lease at the new building that John will not be taking over because he doesnt have a car. 

So on top of the ordeal of moving again, finding a place to store my furniture, and paying for a parking spot I will not be using, he also expects me to help pay for him live alone in a nice apartment while I have to move in with strangers for for 6 months. So Reddit, am I the asshole?",86,47,0.91
1852,Not the A-hole,"tl;dr - I have a long, private drive on property that I own and I go fast as shit on it. Nosy neighbor came to complain that I am endangering others for speeding. Told him if he didn't leave i'd call the police on him for trespassing. 



Full story. 
So I live in a rural area on the outskirts of the city because I like peace and quiet. We recently got a new neighbor over a month and a half ago and the houses in this area are spread out quite a bit and our house happens to have a very long driveway/street which is on our land. This being a driveway, it has no speed limit signs posted or anything. Our driveway out here is fairly long though. It runs from the main road about a mile and a half to our house.
Our driveway is also fenced. Once you drive off the main road and go through the gate, you're on our driveway.

Now, because we have our own private road basically, I treat it how I want since it's on our land and isn't governed by the city/state etc. This road has now laws so I speed up and down it as fast I can for shits and giggles. It has a few turns so it's fun to whip my little MX-5 about in when I go to the store, work or really just whenever I am coming and going because I find it fun and its not hurting anyone. 

Well apparently our new neighbor across the street has noticed my ""dangerous"" driving. How? I don't know. You basically need binoculars to see your neighbors house because my drive is a mile and a half long and so is his. He came over one day after I got done speeding home from work, banged on my door and told me that I need to stop speeding and driving so recklessly and told me that I could hit someone and how I am endangering others.

I told him that it's my street, on my property which I own and that it's not a through street that just anyone can use because it's a private drive. I also told him there are no posted speed limit signs and that I had no intentions of ever putting one up and that I can't endanger anyone since no one should be driving down my street to begin with. (and there is a gate that's always closed unless I open it or leave it open) Further more if someone is driving down my street it's usually planed and I know they are coming. Lastly, it's not like I am driving up and the driveway all day every day. Only when I am leaving the house or coming home. 

He lost his shit and I told him he needs to fuck off and I will damn well drive how I want to drive on my driveway. So he threatened to call the city and get one of those mobile police traps setup that records speed. I told him that they can't put that on private property and if he would like, I would be happy to call the police to come over right now and have him arrested for trespassing.

So aita for telling my nosey neighbor to fuck off and mind his own business? (I get I am the asshole for telling him to fuck off and could have been nicer about it)",142,405,0.95

I was raised primarily by my mom and step-dad. My mom and dad got divorced when I was 6. He was/is career military, and he cheated on her. My mom obviously got primary custody, as my dad was constantly travelling with an unpredictable schedule. She met my step-dad right away, and he's been my daily father figure since I was 7.

My dad isn't a terrible guy or anything, but he's never been an active, involved father. He's never been to a single game or recital or anything, as he was either deployed or living far away. I'd usually spend at most 6 weeks a year with him. Other than that, he'd call me roughly once every 2 weeks or so for a quick conversation. He wasn't at my high school or college graduations, as he was deployed or on work assignments both times. He also suffered from PTSD, which made him outright rude and nasty sometimes.

1858,Not the A-hole,"Tl;dr - got hired for one job, 3 people left, I took on more responsibilities, asked for more money, told no, now I don't want to continue doing extra work.

Ok so the whole story. I got hired based on a specific skill set on my resume (we'll call that Skill A) although I'm highly effective in another (skill B) the hiring team was all but not interested in.

Within the first 2-5 months of me starting, 3 people quit, including my manager. I suddenly found myself being asked to pick up new responsibilities. Now, these responsibilities require skill B, and since I'm qualified, I picked them up without hesitation. I've been doing this extra layer of work for a few months now and decided to ask for a raise based on this. I was told no because ""my skill A wasn't quite where they wanted it to be"". I find this to be an excuse because I have been told repeatedly by peers AND management that I do a phenomenal job and even do better than my predecessor (who I currently make 12k less than he did) and my managers speak highly of me when talking to other employees. I also think it's BS that they aren't even considering the fact that I've taken on additional responsibilities that would usually go to a different employee i.e. someone who had skill B, because A & B aren't necessarily always found in the same person. It would be like having an accountant who also happens to know IT management.

I'm not saying I want to stop doing my job, just the part I wasn't hired for and the part they refuse to recognize and pay for.

1860,Not the A-hole,"So last night I got back to my dorm after working out at our campus gym. I realized walking back that I smelled awful and decided to grab my shower stuff and shower on our floor's bath/shower room. It was empty when I walked in so I went into a stall, closed the curtain, and started showering. Maybe a minute after I turned the water on, I heard the janitor wheel their mop bucket in to clean the bathrooms, which they seem to do at different times every day. The janitor, (female), heard my shower running and yelled for me to get out because she needed to clean. We already didn't have the best relationship because she also told me to leave two nights prior for walking in the bathroom while she was cleaning. This time instead of apologizing I just kept showering and acted like I couldn't hear her.

Maybe another minute later I almost slipped and fell from fear because she started knocking on the wall next to the curtain, telling me I needed to leave right now. This time I told her that I was, ""almost done."", and that I would be out soon. She told me she didn't care and that my RAs would be hearing about this. I take pretty quick showers, somewhere under 4-5 minutes but she made me feel like I had been in there for a half hour. I dried off, put my change of clothes on and walked out.

1861,Not the A-hole,"So, some background.... my 36 year old BIL is planning on proposing to his first girlfriend ever of three months in a couple of weeks. I've known this is his plan for a while, but he called my wife last night and told her about it, as well.

This is the guy who told my wife (now of almost five years) that she was ruining her life by marrying me. The guy who, as I've learned through helping my wife get in to therapy and deal with her childhood traumas, is at the root of her issues because he was mentally and emotionally abusive to her for twenty years. The guy who, when our nephew tells him to put him down because he's scared, says, ""No you aren't - you're having fun."" He's never hit anyone, but he's very controlling and demeaning to everyone in the family.

Side point: BIL has this idea that if he tells me something, I'm not allowed to tell her, and vice versa. (Everyone in the family knows that it doesn't work that way, but we humor him as much as we can.)

Anyway, when he and I had talked about this previously, I told him that I wouldn't be able to go to his wedding three time zones away, because I can't afford it and, given the date that he has chosen, I can't get anyone to cover my work if I were gone - in addition to having no paid time off to use for such an event.

So last night, he calls my wife and talks to her. She gets off the phone, tells me what he had said - all of which I already knew and had told her anyway - but adds that he wants us there and that he will ""make it work"" because it's what he wants for his wedding, presumably by paying for our travel expenses.

Now, I respect that he wants to include his family in his special day. I appreciate his generosy. But when he's already been told that our attendance won't work because of our life and that he can proceed with his plans without me.... AITA for being slightly pissed off about this?",28,61,0.93
1862,Asshole,"  

**Our history:**

My wife and I have been together for 7 and half years, got married last April. We moved from our country to the UK to get better jobs in September 2018, after finishing our degrees. We started living together here for the first time.

**Our personality:**

I am an outgoing introvert (thus I don't like going to social meetings, but when there I am quite outgoing, talkative, but it really drains me down, so I don't like doing that more than once every week, or so), she is a shy extrovert (she likes going to events, but most of the time she sits in silence, except when she engages with 1 person, and has a longer discussion).

I have a hobby (playing online with a bunch of my friends or alone, it depends on my mood), while she doesn't. She used to read, but as she only wanted to read the same few series of books, she got bored by it. I think this comes from our different background, as I was a single child (had to learn how to occupy myself), and she has 3 brothers. She ALWAYS needs to talk to somebody, to engage with somebody, and on the other hand I need some alone time, to let my daily stress go, and reload my batteries.

When we moved in together, I cut back on my play time (from 6 hours daily to 1.5-2 hours and not every day)

My ideal weekday evening: finish work at 5 pm, get home around 5.30, get some dinner together, talk about our days for 0.5-1 hour. After that I go, chill out with my mates between let's say 18.30 and 20.30, or so. From here, we watch a movie together, or anything like that. Change that when there are daily tasks (shopping, chores), cutting time from me-time and together time too. I think I tried to meet here on the middle ground.

The problem is, she is utterly bored and feels alone, when I am not entertaining her. She gets into a really bad mood quite often, saying she hates that this is life: going to work, doing adulting stuff, then watching a movie or walking around in the city a bit. Hence the problem: I need my alone time, but that makes her miserable. If I don't get any of my me time, I get miserable and stressed out. As we moved from our country, she doesn't have any friends. I tried to use meetup to get her into social circles (I went with her a few times), but she doesn't want to go without me. We have a weekly DnD group, which she enjoys. Sometimes I don't really want to go, as I am tired, and stuff, but do it for her.

Right now, we are in a huge argument, sleeping on the couch style, as I can't do it anymore, listening how shitty our life is, how bored she is, and why do I have to play at all...

Am I the asshole here, for wanting her to be more self sufficient, and solve her own problems, just a little bit, without me having to drown in the attention she needs?

1865,Not the A-hole,"I'm an assistant manager in a smallish retail store and had a lady come into the store with her two kids, one was around 10 years old and the other was in a pram.

From the moment they walked in the 10 year old was crying/screaming. Whatever, it happens all the time, it's not a big deal. They go about their shopping as normal with the kid still screaming, occasionally I'd hear the mum tell him to stop but he wasn't having it and just kept screaming. 

20 minutes goes by and they're still there, in the confectionery isle, only now the mum is screaming back at the kid. ""IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP I'M CALLING YOUR DAD"" and ""SHUT THE FUCK UP"" you could hear it clear as day across the store from where I was putting out stock. I could see a lot of customers looking over at them, shaking their heads and talking about this woman and her child, clearly frustrated and upset.

I got called up to assist a customer right next to where all the screaming was happening and after a minute she said to me ""I need to get out of here before I lose my shit."" So I quickly fixed her up, apologized and we went our separate ways.  

A few minutes later I saw the lady go through the checkout and thought ""finally, we'll get some peace and quiet"" but boy was I wrong. Her son had wrapped himself to a pole at the checkout and continued screaming for 8 more minutes. I watched the lady stand there, not moving, not making an attempt to calm/move her screaming child for 8 minutes at the very front door before I'd had enough. 

So I walked up to the front and said ""Excuse me, have you finished your shopping today?"" 
She said ""Yes I have"" 
I sad ""Would you mind leaving the store then please""
She said ""If you can move him I'll happily leave"" and points at her son still hugging the pole. 

Obviously I'm not allowed to touch the kid so I tried talking to him but he just screamed over me. Then a second lady came over (L2 - Lady 2) 
L2 asks the mum if there's anything she can do to help and the mum just started crying. L2 asked the mum if the boy had Autism and she said that he did. 
When I found this out I felt bad because I had no idea of knowing he was Autistic.
L2 said that she herself had 2 Autistic kids and knew her pain and proceeded to talk to the boy, calming him down and eventually leaving the store together.

L2 then posted on her personal Facebook and a local mothers group about how disgusted she was with me and how I deserve to be fired for so grossly mistreating this poor woman with and Autistic child.

I went to the station and asked for this change. The clerk worked out the price difference by hand on paper - the computer couldn't do it - and seemed to be having trouble with it. Eventually she said it would be £300. I was surprised, but paid and got my new ticket.

Half an hour later, she called me and asked me to come back because she made a mistake. I went back expecting to be charged the £700 but she apologised and said it should only have been £80, and refunded the difference.

As far as I knew, his father died 40 years ago.    
    
After calling my dad and sharing this with him, and then him promptly hanging up and talking to his mom, he told me that the man that raised him was actually not his father, and that his real dad skipped town as soon as he found out his mom (my grandmom) was pregnant.  My grandmom started dating someone else shortly after, and that new man raised my father.  Apparently my dad was told this a few years before I was born (about 30 years ago), and he told my mom but said he didn't want to talk about it again.  Besides my parents, only my dad's sisters (my now-apparent half-aunts) knew.  
    
After digesting this and letting my parents tell my brother the news in the next few days, I called my cousins (SEE EDIT BELOW) to let them know that we were actually half-cousins, and also that a large number of other cousins are actually not related to me at all.  In fact, me and my dad have no blood ties to our last name.  Nobody was too broken over it and took it pretty well after the initial shock.    
    
At this point, I was beginning to think of contacting my dad's real father.  I told my dad this, and he was firmly against the idea.  He said he wants ""nothing to do with a guy who left [his] pregnant mom when she was 19.""    In my mind, this is wrong for a number of reasons.  First, people make mistakes, and while it was definitely a bad one, this happened 60 years ago when they were kids.  Secondly, and more importantly, this is my family too.

1875,Not the A-hole,"My English isn't very good, please bear with me.

I have two teenage daughters (14 and 16) who begged me for a dog practically all their life. We recently moved to a bigger flat near a park- I wasn't to keen on the idea of a dog in the middle of the city before.

I am very strict regarding my free time (I don't have much, obviously;) and how I am able to spend it. It's also very important to me that my husband and I can enjoy some time alone together, even if that's not often the case. We both work full time jobs. So I made it very clear that if we get a dog, it would be the task of my daughters to take care of him. My husband seemed to be on the same page with me- we talked about it with our daughters a lot, made it clear how much effort a dog actually is.

We basically set some ground rules, like:

\- no parents dog walking, no feeding, - basically no day to day tasks for my husband or me

\- if my daughters forget to take care of the dog in any way during the first two weeks, the dog will be back at the shelter

Went to the shelter and found a very fitting dog. I explain the situation and that we would take the dog, but only on probation for two weeks and then we decide.

We take him home, the shelter is fine with the probation time.

The first few days are going great. First Weekend:

""I can't walk the dog I've got to go to the mall."" ""I'll walk him tomorrow, but today it's on you."" Guess who walked the dog. I was really upset, because they both left without getting an agreement, telling me ""We'll take him for a long walk in the evening."" They did, but in my opinion that doesn't help the poor dog during the afternoon. He needs to pee.

I also asked them to bath him, because it was part of our agreement that he would get a bath once a week. They decided to sit in their rooms in front of their mcbooks all evening.

It's Sunday, eleven o Glock A.M, everybody's home, but nobody has walked the dog yet. I call for my girls, they show up. ""We walked him very long yesterday in the evening, he can wait a few hours.""

Monday, I bring back the dog after a lot of fighting and screaming with my girls on Sunday evening. My husband keeps mostly to himself during this time.  Come home, husband ice stone cold, no talking, no laughing, finally we have a heated discussion. He basically says we should give the girl more chances, I say I'm not having it. They clearly showed there are not ready for the responsibility. I only feel sorry for the dog, because he thought he had found a forever home. He says it wouldn't have killed us to walk the dog a few times. I asked him if he wanted to keep the dog and why he didn't say so. He says that's not the problem, he just thinks I'm heartless and impatient. I feel very betrayed and attacked.

Girls come home- the dog is gone, as announced. Basically Armageddon. So, this was a week ago and the girls seem to be devastated. They don't even argue with me or mention the dog. I heard the younger one cry in the bathroom twice.

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit. The dog got apparently adopted by a really nice couple without kids. Also, I am not from a country were kill shelters are a thing. I would have never ever done that. 

&#x200B;

Edit 2: I'm confused regarding the bathing situation- many people here said it would dry out the fur of a dog to bath him once a week, but just out of interest I googled again and I still find the information that it is okay to bath a dog weekly, if you only use warm water?",494,1393,0.94
1876,Not the A-hole,"English is not my first language so feel free to correct me.

I was walking back home (near to my flat) when a foreign family showed up and asked me for help. I don’t know where were they from but they were black and this story takes place in middle Europe so they seemed obviously tourists. They asked me how to go to the city centre, get tickets to the public transport and where do they find an accomodation. They didn’t know the city and our local currency (they even asked me what can they buy with that and the cash they had is enough for a hotel room. No it wasn’t.).

I patiently helped them buy tickets at a ticket machine, gave directions to the city centre and assured them that there will be a hotel. They were lost but really nice and I thought why not help them?

But here comes the problem: they wanted me to give them my phone number, so they can call me later for other questions if they are lost.

I was glad to help them but at this point it was enough for me. I saw them for the first time, i didn’t even know them. Anyway, I hate incoming calls, no matter that it’s from a stranger or a family member. 

One of them even hugged me and told me I’m an angel with this lot of help. I didn’t want to hurt them with refusing this request, they were so glad to find someone who helped them in a foreign country. 

Suddenly I had no better idea in that situation so I made an unethical move: I gave them a fake phone number.

I know it wasn’t the best move. Technically I scammed that family. But giving my phone number for someone I met for the first time is too much for me. I was glad to help but I can't carry the burden of everybody on my shoulder.

So tell me fellow Redditors: Am I the asshole for refusing to give my own phone number and giving a fake one instead?

1881,Asshole,"My boyfriend (23,M let's call him B) and I (21F) recently had our one year anniversary and had decided to make something for each other. He made me a clue hunt related to our year together to solve for each destination of the day. He wrote them in the form of poems ( he is not the artistic kind at all) and even designed the cards he wanted to print them on.

B was to meet his friend (let's call her A) 2 days before the anniversary. B and A have been friends since middle school and have even slept together a few times before him and I started dating. I have only had very minimal interactions with A and based on the stories from their friend circle, I don't like her very much. I have made it clear to B that I don't have a problem with them still being friends but I don't personally like her and would like to keep my interaction with her to a minimum.

B decided to invite A along, when they met, to get the cards for our anniversary. But when the print didn't come out right, he even asked for her help in photoshopping it which led to her reading all the poems much before I even knew about them.
According to B, he didn't know Photoshop so he would have to go home and all the way back to get the prints but since A already knew how to, he asked her to help out.

On our anniversary, I told B that I absolutely loved the design of the cards and the poems (they made me teary eyed) but refused to accept them because of the involment of his ex. He is an engineer and has a lot of other friends who could have helped him with the Photoshop and he could have got the cards the next day.

AITA for refusing to accept the cards because of A's involvement in the final product?

Edit: I had made it pretty clear to B that I don't like her or the idea of them being friends but since I don't get a say in the friends he has just because he started dating me, I didn't push it further.

Edit 2 ( I was suggested putting this up here instead of a comment): Before outright rejecting the gift, I had asked B if he would be okay accepting a gift that involved my ex, and he said he wouldn't be okay with it",204,370,0.87
1882,Not the A-hole,"The setup: I’ve known this guy for a couple years and we’ve worked together occasionally. We’ve had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.

I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.

I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” 

He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men’s rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he’s low on cash. But isn’t it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I’d obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn’t the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. 

I call out casually “what do you got to drink?” 

He calls back “Do you like tap water?”

This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he’s serious. There’s nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

I call out, “Yeah, sure.”

He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.

I’m starving. I haven’t eaten since 8am. 

I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” 

He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”

This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. 

Then he asks me to have sex with him.

I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.

I don’t expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (And then they can offer to split the tab)

edit: added a tldr

My mum turned 50 on Wednesday, which everybody understands is a very big birthday. My mum had picked out a lot of her gifts beforehand such as designer watches and bags and me and my dad wrapped them and put them away for her bday, and they both went on a trip to Portugal where they first met) two weeks ago, and during that time I went out with my gran and picked out what I thought was a lovely ornate card I thought she would like after a lot of consideration. My dad tried to get a cake for a 2-3 weeks before her birthday, but the chain bakery we usually get cakes from no longer does cakes, and by the time he found time to look at other places, it was too late to order from them and so he decided to buy a generic £4 cake from a supermarket. No big deal, we thought, me and my dad had that cake for our birthdays earlier that year and the family liked it.

Oh no it wasn’t.

My dad is already away at work and I give my mum her gifts in bed, she says thank you, says her card is lovely. Not an hour later though, she’s crying in my arms about how much she hates her cake and how it’s so insulting considering how much she does for us and she never got a “proper cake”. Okay, I kind of get that. I leave for 5 minutes to make sure my bag is ready for school and she starts asking me why I didn’t tell him to get a better cake. I tried to explain that I thought we all really liked that cake and she said that was insulting and I clearly cared just as much as my dad. She shouted all this at me and it really hurt and I knew the rest of the night would be a bummer from then but I completely misjudged how angry she was. We had a birthday dinner and my family just spent the whole meal in silence, apart from when my dad went to the toilet and my mum told me how rude I was for not asking about the gifts anyone else got her when I got home from school, but I didn’t want to disturb her bc I overheard her crying even when I got home. my dad had to sleep on the couch that night. It wasn’t a good time.

My mum ignored me all of yesterday but  this morning she cried again and told me how much she does for me and my dad and how it really really hurts I never got her anything she didn’t know about, even chocolates or a balloon, and that she thought my card was so ugly and inconsiderate because it wasn’t one of those personalised or handmade cards and I hadn’t taken any time to pick it out. 

Seeing my mum this upset really made me sad too, and I’m really confused because I thought me and my dad made a good effort but apparently not. She says she’ll always remember this as the day me and my dad ruined for her and it makes me sick to think about it

My mother has been making me (16F) feel incredibly uncomfortable due to her lack of respect for my physical privacy.

As a result, she will often come into my bedroom or the bathroom unannounced while either of us is naked and make no apologies. She also gets angry when I lock the bathroom door. The worst part is that if I try to avert my eyes, cover myself up, or tell her she is making me uncomfortable, she yells at me and accuses me of just wanting to make her feel bad.

1887,Not the A-hole,"I'm moving to Boston shortly. Saw an ad for a townhouse. Three people had been living there for a while. **Let's call them B, R and M**. They wanted a fourth person. They were **looking for an LGBTQ friendly housemate**  as one of them was from the community. I'm a straight male, and don't judge people based on gender identities/sexual orientations. Got in  touch, R set up a call. It seemed like the purpose of the call was to **learn about my political views.**  R wanted to learn if I was pro-Modi. For context, I am Indian, R is Indian, and Modi is the Indian Prime Minister. He is notorious for divisive rhetoric. R said that they'd had Indian housemates before that were Modi fanboys, and that they'd had problems as they weren't LGBTQ friendly. I replied, truthfully, that I was neither a fan of Modi nor his policies. Learned the next day that they wanted me as a housemate. I visited Boston over 8/19 and 8/20 to drop off 2 suitcases at the house and check out the room. B greets me at the door. M was a slender woman, seated on the couch in the living room. I'd been told earlier that M had  an M.F.A, and sure enough, she was painting in her book. Nods were  exchanged, but I had no conversation with M. B and I went down into the  basement to stash the suitcases, when I noticed a very cool art studio in the corner. B then took me to the room that I would be renting. Later, when I was alone with B, the topic of managing space came up, I  said something to the effect of, ""**Oh, M, she's got a nice art space set up.""**  B said, ""He, he"". I thought he was laughing. It took my ass ten seconds  of blinking to understand. M's preferred pronouns were 'he/him'. This happened out of M's earshot, but I apologized to B. He said it was cool. We walked back out. I was asking B some final questions when his phone  rang. He had to take it, and he left. I was stranded with M, who was still painting. This is my hobby too. I asked M if I could take a  closer look at his artwork. M says, ""Sure"". I sit next to him to see the book. We spoke at first about technical art stuff, and then about our families. We are vibing well. I am excited about the prospect of having this person as my housemate. And then **I tell M that I messed up his pronoun earlier and said that I did not want that to happen again.**  Asked him how I could ensure this. He said one way was to look at the person's photo and repeat the gender pronoun to practice. Cool, that seems doable. We continue shooting the shit. It's getting late, and B hasn't returned. I ask M if I was holding him up. M says that he's got to sleep. I get up, say bye and leave. Emailed the landlord the next day, on 8/21.

Our knees/shoulders didn't touch when I sat down next to him. Hell, we didn't even shake hands. I am not an entirely clueless person, and would have noticed any fidgeting that may have indicated discomfort with personal space. Didn't happen. The 'shooting the shit' part of the conversation focused on how my grandfather, born and raised in India, wouldn't be able to handle the cold in Boston if at all he came to visit, and about the classes M was planning to organize for his art students in the semester.

Backstory: my brother-in-law (BIL) has been a lifesaver at times throughout my relationship with my husband (helping with rent, fixing our car) with money when we didn’t have any. I will always be thankful for that but ever since our wedding (he was best man) he has been very strangely stepping in our lives with our finances and how we are raising our son (18mnth old)

Example:  We wanted to renew our mobile plans with a different provider to get a better deal with extras and he flipped out saying we shouldn’t do it and he was demanding our new phones so he could take them back to the store for a refund. 

- Teaching our son how to bang his head on the couch (he does this all the time now to deal with his emotions) - this really frustrated me. Also asking why he wasn’t allowed to be alone with my son (like babysitting) and questioning why he sleeps for so long and why he has bottles and shit like that - side note he doesn’t have kids nor a girlfriend. 

Now I’m 5 months pregnant and the other week he was over and so was my best friend and brother. We were all sitting on the couch, I was talking directly to my friend while he was playing switch with my brother - I should add he turned up at our house unannounced and drunk. I was telling my friend about my doctors appointment and how I was informed that I hemorrhaged post -birth and I was scared to give birth again. He started flipping out telling me to go back to the doctors and say that I needed a c-section for this pregnancy and also asking me where my pelvic floor was, telling me how to exercise it and how I was lazy with my last pregnancy and that’s why I hemorrhaged. So I kicked him out and stormed off in a heated rage but not only was he pissing me off and stressing me out he had woken my son up because he was yelling at me. He had the audacity to stick his head back in and inform my best friend and brother that I was overacting because I’m pregnant. I should add my husband was in my sons crib trying to keep him asleep while this was going on - didn’t work. 

Haven’t spoken to him since (weeks ago) and plan to not talk to him or let him meet his new born niece till he apologises to me.

1890,Not the A-hole,"Background: I have a pretty cold relationship with my family. I was sent off to boarding school overseas at a very young age and throughout elementary and high school I would only return to stay with my family during holiday. I relocated back to my home country for university and tried living with them after I graduated, but I seldom interact with them. I have now moved out since the end of last year (as they sold our old house to prepare for my brother’s wedding) and I have seen them twice this year. My father does message me occasionally and I pay them around $900 per month. For where I am from, it’s normal for kids to pay a sum of money to their parents when they start working.

My brother has been with this girl for 7+ years and they are getting married in OCT. My dad informed me and asked me to attend, but I am rather reluctant to go. I have met his girlfriend before as she sometime sleeps over at our house when she is visiting (this was before I moved out). I have nothing against this girl and I think it’s great that my brother is getting married. I just don’t see why it is important for me to attend. 

I told my father that I don’t want to attend the wedding ceremony. Which seems to have sadden my father. I have also discussed about this with my friends and I am getting mixed opinion. Some flipped and said I am cold-blooded, but I guess I never developed a brother-sister bonding with him. He managed to stay quite close to my parents while I always feel like I am not really part of the family. However, if they ever need my help, I would be more than happy to offer any. For example, I upped the amount I pay them per month from $650 to $900 as my dad said they were having a bit of burden as they sold one house to buy two houses, so they can use the help of a bit extra. 

As I mentioned, I have nothing against my brother, so I will explain why I am so reluctant to attend his wedding. Growing up, I was extremely close with my aunt. I had often considered her as my second mother, and she helped paying part of my tuition fee throughout my education. Unfortunately, she took her life a few years ago when I was still at Uni. It really traumatized me, and I still cannot put together why she would have done that. At my aunt funeral, I overheard some of my relatives talking about my aunt, it was very insensitive, and they were making jokes and gossiping about it. Ever since that, I have refused to meet any of my relatives.
Attending his wedding would mean that I would need to meet those relatives again, which is why I am so reluctant to attend. I haven’t replied to my father officially about not attending yet and would like to see what you guys think.

tl;dr : AITA for not wanting to attend my brother’s wedding ceremony as I want to avoid seeing my relatives that made insensitive comments about my late aunt who I regards as my second mother?

We even reviewed our notes 2 hours before the exam but I later learned she was just cramming the material last minute. 

This semester I am taking Microbiology with Pam and Sue is trying to crash the course. The class started this week and we’ve had two class sessions. The first day, Sue arrived almost an hour late and on the second day, she missed the first lecture and showed up only for lab. Since Sue was sitting in front of me, I noticed she was checking her Facebook feed and texting half the time the instructor gave out instructions on how to use a microscope and simple staining. Afterwards I partnered up with Pam and Sue tagged along. I picked up all our equipment including 3 slides and other materials. Since our table was too crowded, I asked Sue if she could partner up with someone else in class because it was difficult having to share a microscope between three people.  She didn’t hear me. I asked her again, she ignored me. Ok. I tried looking for another microscope but the last two remaining didn’t work. Now I’m back with Pam and Sue. Pam and I tried following the instruction handout provided for this assignment and Sue wanted to skip the first half and start with simple staining. I told Sue that would be a problem because some of the skills we learn on the first half of the instructions are applied later on in lab. Again, she ignored me and started with the second half of lab. Now because Sue didn’t pay attention to the instructor at the beginning of lab and she didn’t bother reading the handout in front of her, she kept asking me and Pam the procedures while we were trying to complete the first part of lab. As I try to guide her, Sue makes a mistake on the first stain and she grabs my slide. I told her I specifically brought each of us a slide so she should get one from the instructor’s desk. Again, she ignored me.  Now I am getting annoyed. Sue repeatedly asks us for help and again makes a mistake. Since we spent a lot of our time helping Sue, Pam and I barely had enough time to complete our lab.

1894,Asshole,"So few days back I made a visit to our nearest shopping mall and they have a fried chicken outlet. It's not a big name franchise like the KFC, just a local one that is owned by the shopping mall itself. Tbh it tastes better than KFC.

And you could never find the same employee the second time you visit there. It's mostly students who are working part time and they leave very quickly after a while. 

Anyway I order a preset bucket (fried chicken, French fries, buns, garlic paste, coleslaw and sauce) that is big enough for 4 people. But since none of my family members really liked the taste of coleslaw they had, I requested if the coleslaw could be substituted with more garlic paste. It was a meek guy who must have been a student.

He said it's not possible as it's part of the preset package. I was annoyed but said Okey and went back to waiting at the table. 10 minutes later, he came upto me and asked if he could substitute buns with extra French fries as it was too early and they didn't have the buns.

At this point I got super pissed off and angry. I lashed out at him for suggesting a substitution when he refused to do the same when I actually requested. He was so scared and very apologetic. Few other employees came upto me hearing the commotion and explained that they weren't allowed to change the preset, but he suggested the change without the knowledge of management to manage the situation. 

I calmed down and asked them not to repeat it again and left with my bucket (yup! No bun, extra French fries). But on reaching car, I found that they had forgotten to put sauce in it. I went back and as soon as that guy saw me again, he went white as if he had seen a ghost. I simply asked for sauce calmly and left again without saying anything. They apologized again. 

So AITA here? I was fine accepting their stand that the preset couldn't be changed. But got pissed off and lashed out when the same request was made of me.

Note: As soon as I reached home, I called the shopping mall and asked to transfer the call to the outlet. I talked to that guy and apologized 2-3 times for lashing out. I felt bad because the dude was a very meek guy and was scared out of his shits. And it's not really in my character to be mean to others.

1898,Not the A-hole,"Pretty simple situation. At a local hardware store they have a fish setup. I love watching the little goldfish swim around. I had just left the setup when I noticed a young kid with one of the poor little fishes in his hand. There was an older teenager encouraging him and laughing with him. 


I charged over yelling at the kid to put the fish back but it was too late. The fish was dead. I went OFF on the teenager. The teenager for reference was maybe 18-19 (old enough to know better) and I yelled at him for a solid 5 minutes. He was in absolute shock and an employee came over and said not to worry about it and it happened all the time. I don’t think it’s okay to throw away a life like that.",43,70,0.91

1900,Not the A-hole,So my MIL is going to be retiring next year and has asked if she can help homeschool my kids that I currently do now. Her and I don’t see eye to eye on anything. I have a hard time keeping her at bay with her lack of boundaries. I was asking my Homeschool teacher if it was even possible for her to help. She said she wasn’t sure but she doesn’t see why not but it’s up to me. Anyway she brought it up to my husband and how excited she is to help with a couple subjects. I dread it and I have a system for everything and she honestly just thinks I’m not capable despite state testing proving otherwise. She insist they should be above regular standards because I have all day to teach them. She’s insisted that I probably cheated on their testing. Anyway I know it’s ranting but would I be the asshole if I lied and said the charter said that I alone am responsible for homeschooling my children.,22,37,0.96

1902,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for the repost, mods took down the other for wording.

My wife and I had a relative’s son who is in-law related to me and is around five years of age over at our home the past few days, let’s call him Nick. Tonight was a family dinner night out to celebrate a combined birthday with my sisters son, and my daughter. Nick has spent the last few days with us which is no problem at all.

The evening went along normally, general banter at a typical loud restaurant where even a phone at max volume couldn't be heard, and the kids were mixed amongst the tables. Nick began pushing against the communal table causing it to slide roughly & nearly knocked over all the drinks on top of it, roughly 5 minutes later this happened again and I asked him to be careful along with backing his chair up a little. Roughly 5 minutes after this, it happened again and the push against the table finally knocked over a full glass which the wait staff had to clean. We assured him the spill was fine and not to worry, and reiterated what we said before about being careful; this held up for about 10 minutes until the food arrived, to which a 4th incident almost caused a drink to spill on my sister, who much like myself is not directly blood related to Nick. At that point my sister followed up to the previous comments about being careful, and within 10 seconds of the sentence finishing he knocks & moves the table roughly a solid foot for a 5th time. At that point I did speak/shout rather loud and said 'Nick that's enough' to which he cried presumably out of shock and/or embarrassment. My wife was quite perturbed, but had been oblivious to all of the previous incidents except the drink spill and warnings; all that mattered was the subsequent 'that's enough' shout which I got chewed out a bit for. My sister defended the reaction and tried to explain about the other incidents to my wife- but the conversation hit no middle ground via explanation to which was foreshadowing to my night the after the restaurant; that being said, we agreed to drop the discussion until later that night when we got home.

Fast forward to the end of the evening, Nick calls & tells his mother I'm 'mean' which of course would prompt a question from any parent. Having heard this I offered to clarify what happened and was met with some heavy hostility from both his mother, who cussed me out & decreed I had no right to say anything, even to the extent if her son repeated what he did 20 times... Along with Nick’s father in the background had some much harsher things to say to me that supposedly I cannot post here. They further explained they would never discipline my child in such a manner which caught me by surprise on two fronts. The first being I don't consider that a hard form of discipline especially given the previous incidents leading up to it, and second if my daughter would have done the same I would have expected the same reaction from anyone else for whom she was a guest.

1904,Not the A-hole,"So I room mate with my mom. I’m 21 with a job and buy the stuff I eat and use. My mom is a health nut so she never buys her own cake mixes, cookie dough etc. I buy those things with my small income. I make way less than my mother but she still likes to use up some of the things I buy for myself. I don’t usually complain though I’m not happy about it. Since she’s my mom and cares about me usually she nags me when she sees me eating unhealthy roomie or not still my mom. So as a result I just bake for others. My mom has gotten into a nasty habit of coming in when I’m in the middle of baking something and helping herself to any dough or batter present. This is the third time she has helped herself to a unfinished dessert I’m working on for someone else without asking. The first time was a lemon tart pie for my bf. I have never In my 21 years of life seen my mother enjoy a lemon dessert. My boyfriends favorite is lemon. I come home from work to find the middle of the pie forked!!!! smack dab in the middle damn it!!! and my mom telling me how nasty it was and how it was a good thing she taste tested it for me. Obviously I could not give it to my bf as intended so I threw it out. Second my mom comes home from work and I had just put a new recipe I was working on in the oven so it was still batter and my mom WRESTLED ME as I stood In front of the oven protecting the cake trying to bake from my mom who wanted to dip a dirty spoon that fell on the ground into my cake to taste it!! We wrestled for 10 whole minutes! And today!! Today I ran outta time this morning before work to complete my co workers birthday cake so I put it in the frigid to finish when I got home. I only made 2 cakes out of the 3 I needed. In the middle of work I get a call from my mom asking about the unfinished cakes and I told her don’t touch it, it’s for someone if you want some I’ll make you one don’t touch it!! So I come home to find she used up the rest of my batter. So I went off. I told her I’m sick of her always doing this. I tell you no it’s not for you but you do it anyways I told you if you wanted one wait until I get home I’ll make you your own don’t touch anything. But no you can’t do that and to top it off you can’t even acknowledge that your in the wrong! None of this material is yours and you didn’t make any of it! If you want cake ask or go get your own!! Stop taking my stuff! So she gets quiet and goes into her room. Then I get a text from her talking about strengths, weaknesses, likes and dislikes of a Leo. I’m a Leo.

1905,Asshole,"So my husband will totally see this and that’s fine.  So be it.   My sweet dear husband has gotten on this Kimchi kick and eats it at lunch and at dinner.  I absolutely despise the smell.  It actually effects me so much that it makes me nauseous and gag.  I’m not just being dramatic.  I can walk in our house hours later and smell it in the house.  Our kids complain about the smell.  His skin and breath smell like it.   I will admit, I’ve been complaining about it a lot to him lately because I’m hoping he will not eat it in the house or at least only a few times a week to spare me from the lingering fumes. He just keeps eating it 2 times a day in the house and ignoring my desperate pleas.  It’s great for gut health, he says.  Fine, but he smells from it and so does our house.  I very much like his smell (even sweaty) but this negates it.  I hate that.  My husband usually smells amazing.  Life now smells like stinky feet and vomit mixed.  I understand I’m being a little bit of an asshole for hating it, but I seriously can’t stand the smell of it.  I feel he is being a little bit of an asshole for eating it when he knows it makes me sick smelling it and everyone else in the house thinks it stinks too.  We are currently in bed, all snugged up as usual, and he is breathing on me.  Kimchi breath.  I just woke him up and told him to roll over-it’s so strong. He rolled over but I still smell KIMCHI!  So who is the asshole? Me? Him? Both of us? Neither of us? Can anyone agree it smells absolutely disgusting? Maybe this is a phase and he will get tired of it? Ride it out? Help!  I’m curious what everyone’s point of view is.

**A few have asked me, and the brand he is eating is Nasoya and he gets it from Walmart.  It’s the spicy one.   I know nothing about types of Kimchi (I eat like an 8 year old) but I assume it’s the spicy part that is making it so smelly? 

**I’d also like to add, I’m not controlling what he eats.   I would secretly suffer if it was an occasional thing.  It’s just twice a day and I’m starting to lose all hope of never smelling it.  We have a great relationship and very open communication.  Trust me, I leave laundry for days and it smells.  The man is a saint for living with me at times.   So for those saying I’m being controlling, nah.... just really sensitive to that smell.  I’m not pregnant and neither is he! Lol.

1908,Asshole,"So far everyone in my family is calling me ungrateful and an asshole.

My parents recently bought me an early 2000  Toyota Camry as my ""first"" car for college. I thanked them for the car, but I asked if I can trade it for my mom's 2009 VW Jetta. And I was told no. 

The reason why I want my mom's Jetta is because I repaired the car with the help of my dad after it was in a severe collision. We spent years fixing the car so that I can drive it for myself. The Jetta is special to me because made it a father/son project that we were proud of. 

Fast forward to the present, and I am pleading with my parents to give me the Jetta. But my parents are standing their ground with the only reason why I can't keep it is because it's too fast. 

Now they're calling me ungrateful because I am not appreciating a gift I got from them for college, and that I'm not going to get the Jetta under any reason. I ask my brother for his opinion and he is siding with my parents, so it's a 3/4 opinion against me. 

Am I the asshole?

INFO: we are in the process of getting licence plates and the smog check for the Camry, so in the meantime I'm using the Jetta to drive myself where I need to go. After the Camry is done I will lose the ability to use the Jetta.

1909,Not the A-hole,"As the title suggests. My fiance and I are engaged to be married, and we have started to plan our wedding for next September. I have always wanted a small/intimate/low stress ceremony (my fiance agrees), and we will be paying for everything ourselves. 

My whole life I've had a close relationship with my dad, but my relationship with my mom has been hit-or-miss for a number of reasons. I obviously want them AT the wedding, but I worry that my mom will try to completely take over planning if she finds out, I'll get bombarded with countless emails a day with her ideas, and I'll be guilt-tripped if I don't do things the way she envisions. I have no trouble saying no to her, it's just added stress that I don't want to deal with.

My solution has been to plan without them knowing for now, announce while there is still time to include my mom in minor decisons, but after all the major decisions have already been made/deposits paid, etc. 

I just want our wedding to be about what my fiance and I want and who we are as a couple, without outside influences. But I feel like such an asshole keeping it from them, especially my dad.

I don't have many friends in my life, but I have my BEST friend. We have been friends for over 12 years and no matter what we have stuck together. A little over 5 years ago she moved across the country from me for a man that sje never met and was in prison. Long story short, he isn't TECHNICALLY a sexual predictor, but he was serving time for sex with a minor. He got out of prision and they started their lives together. I wasn't thrilled due to the situation, but supported her. She got pregnant with 2 children while with him. During these few years he got back on drugs and became VERY abusive/unfaithful towards her. She left and came back multiple times (which I helped fund) but always went back to him. Once again, I stated my distaste for the situation, but still loved her. She came back home for good after a pretty good beating of her and the children. She took her two kids (which he does not have any legal right to see due to his past) but she did not file any charges against him. She doesn't even want him to pay child support. I find out (from her) to his concern, they were still together and she just had to stay here for a few months because of her broken down car. Not true. She just bought a new car. Anyway, here comes the seriously messed up part. She had her dream job interview to go to a few states away. She begged me to go with her and I agreed. At first, I was thrilled for a bestie road trip like old times. As the time got closer, she ghosted me and last minute told me she was going alone. Weird, but okay. Today I find out she skipped the interview completely. She went back to him with the kids to ""visit"". She swears she is coming back, but it may take awhile because her brand new car supposedly broke down (the same excuse she gave him of why she was down here so long). To be honest, I am tired of it. I am tired of supporting her and helping her mentally and financially time and time again just for her to lie to my face and put herself in the same exact situation she keeps running away from. A dangerous situation at that.

1913,Not the A-hole,"Hi guys. I have been working at a company for two years and I have only gone to two company outings out of 6 and I have gone out about 10 times in the two years here with my coworkers to drink.

Some people constantly bring up that I dont go out with coworkers or that I dont stay later on fridays to drink with them. 

I have a pretty strict daily schedule like this: I wake up around 5AM to walk my dog, get to work by 7:00AM and leave at 3PM and I go to the gym till 4:30 PM and head home to cook dinner and walk the dog and relax. I live about an hour away from work so I have to account for that. I used to be obese as a child and got fit in college, then gained enough weight to be obese again as in I went from a medium shirt to a small to a large and I’m finally back to being a medium. Fitness is extremely important to me and I always tell any coworker that asks why I dont attend more things with them.

Not only is fitness important but I don’t like drinking. Beer isnt great to me and we work in a city where drinks are expensive and I’m budgeting.

Some background info: I have friends at work and I have best work friends as well. I’m social at work and extremely hard working. I don’t see a problem with keeping my schedule and yet after two years, coworkers still have a problem with me not attending more events.

AITA for not going to company outings and not going out to drink with coworkers?

1915,Not the A-hole,"I’m just reflecting on this situation and thinking that I’ve been a bit of a jerk. A while ago I noticed my boyfriend was always preoccupied. He wasn’t actively listening to me when I talked and he would quickly turn his phone away or lock the screen when I was near. He would talk about his friend a lot but always be vague and never say names or use gendered pronouns. These were all red flags to me as I’ve been cheated on in the past so I kept my guard high. 

I kept an eye on his social media and noticed this girl was posting a lot on his wall and tagging him in cute animal posts and also replying to his tweets telling him how cute he is. He would also like all her Instagram selfies where she was posing and dressed quite sexy. The girl is someone I know as being a long-time friend of his, so by hiding her identity when talking about his friend, I immediately knew something wasn’t right.

I flipped out and confronted him and he told me she was just a friend and that they’d known each other such a long time and that she helped him through a really difficult time a few years ago and now she was going through a tough time so he was just helping her out. I asked how he was helping her and he said, by texting her, listening to her problems and giving her advice, and the reason why he liked all her selfies was because she has self esteem problems and he wanted to support his friend. 

I was so fucking hurt. I had been going through a difficult time at work and with my mental health for months and he prioritised his friend over his girlfriend. I felt like my problems didn’t matter to him at all and I felt like he was neglecting me. I expressed all of this to him and he told me he was sorry and he would stop talking to her. I said that I didn’t want him to stop talking to her because I recognised that they had a good friendship and supported each other, but he needed to step back, recognise why I was so upset and re-evaluate the way he communicates with her. I said that by engaging with her flirty posts (which were public on social media, who knows what it was like in their private chat which I didn’t see!) and liking her sexy selfies, they seemed more romantic than platonic. 

The whole thing cooled down and since then, I don’t think he’s talked to her much. I’ve since felt really silly because I feel like I’ve ruined a long-time friendship because of my petty insecurities. Am I the asshole for being jealous of my boyfriend’s female friends, or was it reasonable for me to call him out on behaviour that I saw as flirtatious even though he claimed it was platonic and supportive?",24,27,1.0
1916,Not the A-hole,"My brother and SIL had a lovely, small ceremony last November in a very picturesque meadow, with my brother’s best friend officiating. It was small, just around 15 people who were mostly family. This was about a 3 hour drive from where we live.

My SIL was pregnant at this time. Last summer, they made a grand announcement that they would “Start trying to get pregnant in September”. My mom asked about engagement and wedding planning, but they shrugged it off and said a family was more important. 

She got pregnant right on their schedule, yay a baby! They started planning this elopement in September, and my brother officially proposed in October. The elopement was beautiful. She had a wedding dress and a photographer, and my parents paid for the reception at a restaurant afterwards, which was very low key. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. She tells me how the priest offered them their anniversary date for the wedding, and how she has ALWAYS wanted a church wedding. She then says they will have to do a reception as well because she can’t just NOT have a second one without inviting everyone she didn’t invite last time. 

She says she doesn’t want to tell her family where the reception is on the invitation (or indicate there is one) because she fears they will not go to the ceremony, which is the most important thing to her, and they will just show up to the reception for the party. 

This is where it starts snowballing. 

· She calls and asks me to be a bridesmaid As soon as I say yes, she lets me know I am one of ten couples in the bridal party, along with 5 flower girls and 5 ringbearers. 

· She creates a group text of all the bridesmaids and includes a link to the $100 dress she has chosen for us

· Her maid of honor creates a group text so we can plan her bridal shower and bachelorette party. The MOH asks if certain dates work, and then casually slips in “BTW we went to the florist and it will be $60 per person for the bouquets”.

· She selected a venue for the reception. It is a hall about 30 miles away from the church. She buys a new wedding dress. 

· She texted me to ask if my BF, who works in the spirits industry, could get her a discount on liquor for the reception. She called him the wrong name. Think, Ben instead of Jason. Not a small mistake. I told her unfortunately he couldn’t, and she should go to Total Wine since they have great prices. She said she ordered 20 bottles of wine for the reception that 100 people are invited to. 

They are already married, why is this “church ceremony” turning into something so big? Am I being an asshole for not wanting to help and wanting no part of this?  I don’t want to spend money on a SECOND wedding when I already paid for a hotel, dress and transportation to the FIRST one.",14,47,0.96

1918,Not the A-hole,"My husband has 3 sisters. They all should be reported but sister 1’s kids are now adults. However I see sister 2 and 3 as grossly unfit. Heres why I think they need to be reported. 

Sister 2 is an addict and has 3 kids. Ages 17, 13, and 10. She also is bipolar which she has been diagnosed but she doesn’t take her meds. She cannot come to family functions unless she is under the influence. It has come to the point now where she and her husband do not have jobs and they are being foreclosed on because they do not pay any of their bills. She spends all her money on her addiction or things that she wants like a pool or a $5000 parrot. I want to report her because she is obviously unfit, I do not know if she uses at home around the kids but I do know she shows up to my in-laws house with the kids while under the influence. So they have to be around it at some point and they are going to be homeless because of her. She also asked my husband for his old juul and vape pens for her two sons both of which are not legally allowed to smoke. I feel as though she is putting them on a path to live the same life as her. 

Sister 3 is a good mom and I don’t think she deserves to have her kids taken away but she has an abusive boyfriend. She gets in screaming matches with him and moves out for a few days and then goes back. She always says she doesn’t love him after each time but she doesn’t want to live with her parents and she is scared to be on her own with two kids and no money. Their daughter is five I know she has witnessed their fights before because MIL was at their house once and had to break it up because the kids were home. He is a good dad but I fear for the kids safety. Especially once they get older I don’t think he would be able to keep himself from harming them. Also their water and power were shutoff when she had her second kid because she went to a concert instead of paying the bills. Shes just irresponsible. 

I have talked to my husband about it and he does not want to because then the kids would most likely end up in the system. He also said his parents don’t want to report them either. His parents would gladly take them in but the don’t have the money or space for five kids and they are in poor health and I don’t think they would be able to take them. Theres also no guarantee that they would be given to my in-laws anyways. 

Do I stand by and let the kids be mistreated so they aren’t put in foster care or do I get them taken away from bad parents but possibly be put in a worse situation by going into the system?

PS none of the kids are being harmed or are in danger to my knowledge. They are just exposed to things that put them in bad situations that would constitute CPS removing them from their homes.",66,32,0.92

I (F27) am part of a group that see each other once a week at a class. The group of 8 all get along super well for the most part and have expressed that we want to hang out and what not outside of the class. In this group is a special needs individual (Brenda F21) who I have gotten the impression that we all tolerate due to rudeness, inappropriate conversations, which is due to her special needs, so we just tend to ignore the 'bad' stuff. Brenda has also implied her special needs are severe enough that she has a 24/7 nurse for safety reasons. 

I took the initiative to plan a party and when I message the group to gauge interest, Brenda immediately starts informing me of allergies, that she will not permit alcohol at the party and a few other things. I got the sense that the group is keen to catch up; except with Brenda there. 

I messaged Brenda privately about these concerns and she then informs me that going to  a party isn't covered under her nurse's contract or insurance and that I as the host, would have to maintain that role and monitor her throughout the party for anaphylaxis reactions, absence seizures, actual seizures and be prepared at any minute to call emergency services. I am technically qualified to do this as I am the nominated first aid officer at my office; BUT it's not something I wish to be responsible for during my own time - especially because from what I understand, this isn't a 'rare' occurrence, it's a ""this happens very regularly"" occurrence. 

I don't want to openly be an asshole and set up a group chat without Brenda to plan this party - I feel that would be way too rude. I'm wondering Reddit, WIBTA for explaining to Brenda that I do not feel comfortable taking responsibility for these issues and explaining that I cannot invite her to this party in this case - as she DOES need someone watching her? The other option is, I intentionally plan the party for when Brenda is away in a couple of  weeks - but that also feels like an asshole move.",280,1607,0.94

1926,Not the A-hole,"My wife and I have lived in the same apartment complex for about 5 years now, and hopefully will have enough saved to move out in 2020. Recently, a seemingly single mother with a daughter that looks to be about 10 moved in and have a very small puppy. One of the rules in our apartment's lease is that you're not allowed to have pets unless they are a service animal or you have a written reasoning from a doctor to have one. Not sure what all reasons qualify for a dog, but a handful of tenants here do.

The problem began with them not putting their pup on a leash when taking it outside, we noticed this happening daily. Aside from that, this dog is *very* small and is almost all black, so when my wife gets off late this dog is very difficult to see. One night after getting home the mom and daughter were outside at their vehicle letting the dog run around, and it started jumping on my daughter and I. I wasn't very enthused. So I went inside and explained to our 4 year old daughter that their puppy needed to be on a leash and not doing so was dangerous.

A few days pass and this same thing happens again, this time my 4yo decides to blurt out to them that ""your puppy should have a leash, it's dangerous!"" as we walk upstairs after the puppy jumping on her again. The mother says something about it just being a puppy and that he doesn't like leashes yet. So after it happening a 2nd time my wife sent a text to the apartment manager about the situation. The next day a note was put on all tenants doors about making sure their pets are on leashes and not doing so is a lease violation. Surprisingly, the new neighbors actually used one for a few days, although an overly-large and cumbersome one that the dog ***obviously*** *would not like.*

Coming home a few days later, the daughter is chasing the puppy around the parking lot as the mother watches. We slow down since it's hard to see the dog, and I'd really rather not deal with *that* happening. We park, get out, and wadda'ya know? Their unleashed dog is jumping on our daughter again. We went upstairs and she told me that she ""hates how that puppy keeps jumping on her"". Well, since they still could not follow the rules and have made my daughter uncomfortable, my wife sent another text to management the next day. We were informed that they would be discussing the matter with the tenant after the weekend.

And now we're caught up to yesterday, where we came home and the mother and daughter were outside at their vehicle with what appeared to be the lease guidelines in her hand, waving them and cussing on the phone to someone. My wife overheard as we passed by a comment along the lines of ""I fucking know it was fucking them!"" and noticed the dirty looks that were being focused our direction. Haven't seen their dog again since then, I'm not even sure if they were supposed to have one (which would not surprise me, they can't even use their own parking spot). We are quiet people who just want to mind our own, AITA?",46,88,0.88
1927,Not the A-hole,"So I  (19M) have been talking with this girl (18F) for most of the summer. I'm going to college soon while she's going to be a senior in high school. I asked her if things were going to happen between us and she said ""no, for now."" That's fine. We kept hanging out once or twice a week and she took a few of my hoodies and a pair of joggers. I'm leaving in a few days and I asked her a week ago if she could bring me them when we were going to hang out. She 'left already' so she didn't bring them. Again, fine, I'll just get them from her the day before I leave. Now she has been very slow to respond the last few days so I can't make any plans with her to get my stuff back because I just stay on sent for hours at a time. Those clothes are really nice so I want them back. I finally just called her and told her that I want my clothes back and that I want them now so can I come over? She gets all sad and said that she wanted to keep them to remember me while I am gone. If we were already dating that'd be fine with me, but we aren't and she's turned me down multiple times when I asked her if she wanted to date. I feel bad for making her sad, but nothing is officially even going on between us and I just want my dang clothes. AITA?

1928,Not the A-hole,"I've pretty much never had interest in getting kids. Despite simply not having an interest to raise a kid, i'm also very concerned about the world becoming much less of a good place to raise a kid in, and i don't like the idea of willing someone into that situation. I'm 20, so i have no plans or interest in getting kids. I'm also trans and i am planning to start hormones in a few months. This will make me infertile, and since i do not want kids of my own, it's not a big deal to me. When i told my mom about that, she immediately asked me to freeze my sperm, and we had an argument over it.

My mom once did like this hand-reading thing which she firmly believed in, then told me i have some creases in my hand that mean that i will get at least 2 children. I told her that it wouldn't happen, but she just kept being all like; ""yeah but it's written in your hand, you're going to *give me grandchildren!*""

This is kinda where the problem stems. She's more excited about getting grandchildren than i am. She recently gave me a box of old books and toys from my childhood and said; ""that's gonna be nice for when i have grandchildren"". Not nice for me. Not nice for *my* children. No, it would be nice for *her grandchildren*. She repeated the hand-reading thing and told me once again that it was still written in my hands that she'll get grandchildren.

She started telling my why i should freeze my sperm. She painted this scenario - what if i'm in my 30's, not being able to get kids thanks to hormones, and not having frozen my sperm. But what if i get the desire to start a family? I would become extremely depressed and sad having wasted the opportunity. according to her. She also suggested i could freeze my sperm and other people could use it, which sounded very weird and unrealistic to me.

Also important to note - and i've told my mom about this too - is that my genitals make me very dysphoric. Both having sex and banking my sperm would make me feel extremely disgusted and dysphoric as it would involve physically using my genitals in a way i am not comfortable with. I don't think she quite understood the seriousness of that either.

In a week from now, i will be visiting them again for my sisters birthday. But i feel like i should do something about this argument. I am now planning to just adress this topic even more seriously, and just simply tell them i don't want kids and it's not up for discussion. I feel as if my mom is being very inconsiderate and projecting her wish for grandchildren onto me without me wanting this. I want it to stop. But maybe i'm wrong here? Given that both her and my sister agree on this topic, i feel like that says something about my opinion on the subject.

I can't really tell if they have a point or not - maybe they do, and i'm the asshole here for dismissing it? I don't think neither of us can answer that, so i'm turning to this sub. Am i the asshole for thinking this way? Will i be the asshole if i make an end to the discussion?",94,138,0.89
1929,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway because I don't want this attached to my work life.

I am a math teacher in a predominately white area in the southern United States. I was at a district function this afternoon and of our two sessions, the first one (interestingly enough) was on ethics. HR had 2 reps that were going over all the do's and don'ts that involved harassment, etc. All the typical stuff you would expect.

One of the teachers from my school was there with me and she had asked me earlier in the week for some resources to support my kiddos on ratios, since they were struggling. She commented today that she really appreciated the stuff I sent her, because her and a much older male teacher were helping the students in a study hall type of situation. Out of nowhere, she said something along the lines of, ""You speak Spanish, don't you?"" I don't, but my last name is Hispanic because my husband is Puerto Rican. He was born in New York and actually doesn't speak Spanish either. He used to speak it as a child, but his stepmother was always worried that he and his father were talking shit about her (she's Greek, parents are immigrants, so she speaks some Greek and no Spanish at all). The joke's on her, because they were, but she banned it from use in the house. If you don't use it, you lose it, so he's forgotten a lot over the years. I did take 5 years of Spanish, from 8th grade to 12th, but I am not confident to hold a conversation since it was 20 years ago. I have never alluded or suggested to anyone that I speak anything but English.

Anyway.

I said no, and I don't remember how she said the next thing exactly, but I was like, ""That's really stereotyping me. It's my married name.""

She laughed and said, ""Well, Mike asked the kids, did she teach it to you in Spanish? Is that why you don't understand?""

I was speechless. I had no response except to say, ""I think that's offensive."" She was like, ""Oh, it is?"" I dropped it after that, but when we were asked to break into groups to talk about some real-life ethical situations, I got up and pulled the HR guy to the side and told him what she said. He visibly cringed when I told him and he said I should definitely bring it up to my principal.

To be clear, I am not offended with the idea of being mistaken for a Hispanic-American. My husband and his family are proud of their heritage, and we have a child together that is also Hispanic. What I am offended by is the idea that I would mislead my students by confusing them on purpose by using a language that they don't. My classroom has lots of students with special needs that just genuinely struggle with math. I feel like these kids have been given an idea about me that I am just there to confuse them, or that I might start speaking Spanish in class and then they won't know what to do in math. Am I being too sensitive to something that is just hearsay, or should I really take this to the next level and get all the powers that be involved? AITA?

1931,Asshole,"I [22f] tend to use a lot of curse/swear words in my vocabluary in regular conversations, especially when it comes to social interactions with friends.   Two weeks ago, in a train station's waiting room, on the phone joking around with my boyfriend, and casually threw in the ""fuck"" and ""twat"", in a jokey manor.

A middle-class looking white man (probably in his thirties) sat opposite and rudely confronted me, and told me I was swearing far too much in front of his 7 year old child, and abruptly told me to swear elsewhere and insisted that I was swearing 4 times, and  how it was ""illegal"" to swear in public. I told him to mind his own business, and that many people in this day and age swear, and firmly told him to get over himself.

1932,Everyone Sucks,"I rekindled a friendship with my cousin (Joe). He had a fiancé (Mary). We haven't spoken since we were kids. Our parents don't talk. My parents now like them, and we all spent a lot of time together.

&#x200B;

His wedding was in 6 months. A few months before, he asked me to be a groomsman I happily accepted.

&#x200B;

My wife was pregnant. Everyone was just as ecstatic as we were. We had an amazing gender reveal party and baby shower. Both events Joe ""couldn't make it"". Mary did attend. The only people she knew were my 3 bother's girlfriends, and I saw them chatting a few times

&#x200B;

A month later, I was with my brothers and their gals. One of the ladies said something bad about Mary and stood up for her. In response, to my astonishment, Mary hated me, passionately. They were reluctant to give details. Turns out that Mary did not like my wife, my Mother, and me. The comments were vile, and it mortified me.

&#x200B;

Conversations with Mary included

* Implied illegal business practices of my Mom
* My wife is an ugly c-word dumber than a bag of rocks
* I am the asshole of the century
* My wife and I should have had an abortion because she felt we are completely incapable of raising a child. We should have killed it now rather than killing it later. This was said at my child's baby shower.
* Cherry on top: they heard the same things from Joe
* &#x200B;

I don't want to mention some of the things that were said. I can't bring myself to type it. I was beside myself. In defense of my wife, she has a master’s degree. And my mother, they don't know a single detail about her work life.

&#x200B;

By now all the wedding formalities have taken place. My tux, wife's dress, hotel, dog sitter, time off work, everything. The wedding was in five days.

&#x200B;

I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. I went to dinner with them but kept a watchful eye on their behavior. Before appetizers, Mary is manipulating my mom into buying her a lavish wedding gift. It hit me there.

&#x200B;

It’s important to the story that I mention my parents, who adored them as I did, invited them on one of our family vacations all expenses paid. My parents fly private.

My mom rebooked a business trip she had to miss. I canceled everything, tried to send my tux back but ended up losing a couple hundred on it. Whatever. The thought of even looking at their faces made me sick to my stomach.

I ghosted him until the day of the rehearsal. They were freaking out that I wasn't responding. ""Sorry, can't make it"" is all I said and the last thing I have ever said to them. I had to turn my phone off from all calls and texts from them and extended family. I got several ""You ruined the wedding"" ones.

1933,Asshole,"So some context: my fiancée (I’ll call her Sarah) are high school sweethearts but she gave birth to our son (Calvin) at the beginning her senior year and my freshman year of college (my school is a state over). We sat down and decided to drop out of our respective schools, and get married, in order to take care of the baby ourselves in an apartment we bought (our parents were against his birth from the very beginning and refuse to babysit him). I had a job at a grocery store nearby and Sarah said she would get a job after she heals up from the birth. She was so happy to have someone at home to help with the baby, and I was happy too but I knew this isn’t the life I wanted. I really wanted to go back to college and finish my education since I want to become a nurse. i know I promised I would stay around to help with the baby, but I feel my education is more important. I want to earn my family more money because we’re pretty low on it atm and college is the only way to do that right now. At first I thought she would be ok with my decision since mothers are a ton better at raising children then the father and she knows all about diaper changing and all that kind of stuff. It’s not like I would abandon her or anything cause I would pay rent for the apartment while I’m at school, I just wouldn’t be with her all the time, except for holidays and such. I thought she would understand, but when I told her she got all mad and started crying because she can’t do it by herself. The whole thing got really heated and I retaliated by saying she was just lazy if she  has to rely on the father for help. I now regret my tone when I said that but I still think going back to college is the best course of action. 

TLDR: me (19) and my fiancée (18) both quit school to take care of our baby. I decided to go back to school (a state over) to get the stuff I need to become a nurse. She got really mad when I told her my plan. WIBTA if I go back to school while she takes care of the baby for the time being?

Edit: I would like to thank you all for your responses and suggestions. 30 minutes of so ago, me and Sarah had a talk and we both agreed that school can wait at the very least a few months, till both of us can stand on our own two feet in terms of finances. Sarah and I have been looking into close by schools that offer a nursing programs and I have found a couple (even though they aren’t as good schools as the one I went to previously). Sarah has also shown interest in getting her high school diploma as soon as she’s ready. As for the sexism thing and me calling her lazy, I realized my ignorance and apologized profusely (she forgave me). In hindsight maybe I was raised in a sexist household or something cause those are the things Ive been taught by my dad as a kid. We have also been looking into parenting classes that are taught for free at our local church which might benefit me a ton. I guess I wasn’t as prepared to be a parent as I thought I was haha.

1934,Not the A-hole,"I have a best friend (Jake) that I've known since the sixth grade. I absolutely love him and he's been my ride or die for the past six years. We bonded because we're both lgbt (He's gay, I'm trans) and were equally outcast by our conservative town.

During middle school, Jake was extremely reserved. He had a near constant bubble of sadness surrounding him. I was sick from school for many of those months due to a severe chronic illness that wasn't under control at the time, which means I didn't see the intense bullying Jake experienced. 

When we were in high school, we steadily grew closer to each other. When I had to leave public school to join an online high school because of how bad my illness was, Jake was one of three people who didn't drop me. He was still sketchy towards me in our early teen years, but in our later teens he made it clear how much he loves and values me as a friend.

Now for present era-

At least once every two days for the past year, Jake has messaged me to vent about problems in his life. Sometimes it's something minor, like worrying about embarrassing themselves at their new uni, to extremely severe. Worrying that he'll never be loved, that his life will never be fulfilling, crippling anxiety related to leaving home for the first time, etc.

Every time he messages me with these problems, I do my best to comfort him and give him advice. I talk him through it, let him rant, provide support, whatever is needed. I admit, having to do this basically everyday has started to grate on me, but hey, he's my best friend and I love him.

The only problem is, he just cant reciprocate. I suffer from an occasionally severe chronic illness and I am also transgender. Both of these things can lead to frustrating situations where I just want to rant and rave and be listened to, but whenever I try to talk about things like the above, I am shut down.

He always answers in one word, usually just ""Yeah"", occasionally spicing things up with ""Hmm"" or ""Oh"". Sometimes even when it is obvious that Im not done talking, he will change subjects, usually to whats bothering him instead. A few times he has even told me that he cant say anything, or that he isn't a therapist. I know he's not good with helping other people, but I feel like the emotional work I'm putting in is not being matched or reciprocated at all.

We just moved out of that podunk town into big, metropolitan college towns. I just began transitioning and my disease is the most under control its ever been. I should be happier than I am, but once a day I am dragged down by my best friend. It's eating me.

He's a really wonderful guy. But I'm starting to feel like I just can't do it anymore. A voice in the back of my head is telling me this is a dickish thing to do because not everyone is good at dealing with emotions and he shouldn't be punished for that, which is why I've come to you, reddit.

1936,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway account because I am not sure if my brother uses reddit .

A little back story my older half brother who I didn’t know growing up and lives out of state recently went through a very nasty divorce that he actually hid from me for about a year. I have heard multiple sides to the story as to what led to the break up but it all basically goes back to my brother turning very cold hearted towards his wife, eventually cheating on her followed up by lots of mind games. I am extremely close to his ex wife and I love her very deeply. Since she is the mother of my niece and nephew I have made it clear to my brother I am not choosing sides in this divorce because of the fact that she’s their mother. Which he supports.

I am getting married in two months and I invited both my brother and his ex wife to my wedding. His ex has made it pretty clear she does not intend to go to the wedding because my brother will be in attendance which I understand. While my brother has recently been pestering me to allow him to take his new girlfriend to the wedding. His new girlfriend is the same girl he cheated with which makes me uncomfortable as well as my other sisters. 

Since I invited his ex wife I feel as if it is rude  to let him bring the girl who he cheated with to the wedding.  I have expressed this to him and originally he understood. But he’s been asking me repeatedly now. Today he gave me an ultimatum that if she can’t go he will not go. I expressed to him that if that’s how he felt about it I would be sad by his decision but would understand but I wasn’t changing my mind. As soon as he saw I wasn’t backing off he took it back and than confessed she is 6months pregnant. This came as a shocker, I congratulated him but said that didn’t change my mind and the conversation was over. One of my sisters says I’m an asshole for not letting her go considering now she will be the mother to our niece or nephew while my other sister says she shouldn’t go to the wedding.

It’s important to note my sisters and I have no issue with meeting her in general, we just want it to be in a neutral situation  not at the wedding. I feel like it’s ridiculous to meet her for the first time at my wedding because of how busy I will be and for whatever reason my brother says we can not meet her prior due to scheduling. I honestly just don’t want wedding day drama.

I've been saving up for a nose job since I graduated college 10 years ago, but with our wedding, buying a house, and having our daughter, it fell to the wayside. Now, I can finally safely afford to have it fixed, and I feel that it's perfect timing because we are relocating at the end of the year for my husband's job.

After that he mentioned he could never date a bi guy and I was asked why?  He gave some squirrelly reply and I said being exclusively attracted to men should not be important. I guess defending bi men made him suspicious and he accused me of being bi and then told me if I was bi we would never work out. This really did turn me off from him. I really did like him a lot before this argument actually I was hoping we would be able to date exclusively because he was really is my type and we have similar interests and he was generally very sweet. Do you know in sims how there is a relationship meter I would say it went from a 60 friendship/80 romantic out of a hundred, yeah it went to like 20/-5 anyways I digress. So then he reveals to me why he can't date bi guys is because  in hs he had a girlfriend and so one day he tried having sex with her and he said he was sick to his stomach and wanted to throw up and  he just started crying and pushed her off of him and ran out the room. I guess the idea of the female form is so gross to him so I started laughing .

Taylor only spoke up when a tv show or a movie was mentioned. Often Taylor’s contributions to a conversation or social outing fell flat on others and she would tend to get ignored. 

Additionally, I was having a hard time adapting to sharing space with her. Her habits annoyed me, Disney music, loud eating, etc. I spent less time in our shared dorm room. I did all my studying in the library and I started going to the gym to escape her.Taylor noticed this. She started coming to the library with me. She asked to join me in the gym. I did not have the heart to say no.

One of my friends was also having troubles with her roommate. We made a plan to switch roommates.That night I went into my shared dorm room with Taylor, intending on sharing my desire to switch roommates.Taylor then shared with me how grateful she was for me, and how she appreciated that I included her. She shared how she was bullied in the past.

I felt guilty. Here she was having a great experience and making plans to switch rooms. I immediately put an end to the plans to switch rooms.I made an effort to be her friend. One of my friends suggested I share something personal with her to give us an opportunity to bond. I shared with her who I was romantically interested in.

About a week later the guy in question asked me out. I came to the dorm room all excited and I shared with Taylor the news. Her response was, “I had no idea! Why didn’t you tell me anything?” Here I went out of my way to include her and she did not remember who I wanted to date.

After the year was up I did not return to that school. Taylor would text me often, usually with movie facts. I usually ignored her, but again I felt really bad. Here she was texting me all the time, and I did not have to heart to completely ignore her.After Taylor finished school, she got a job near me. She would text me often to meet up. I never wanted to, but did anyway out of guilt.

It has now been several years. She is single and has 1 other friend.I continue to meet up with her about 6 times a year. We usually watch a movie. I never enjoy myself.

I have been thinking about our friendship a lot lately. I can’t help but feel like I’m only friends with her because I feel bad for her (lack of social skills, history of bullying), and now out of obligation because it has been so long since we met.

1949,Asshole,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year, hes met my parents and Ive met his mom. Hes a child of divorce and his grandparents played the role of traditional parents in his life, my parents have been together for 20+ yrs, his grandparents are aging and visit a few times a yr from out of state. The most recent visit was nearing its end and we decided (at the grandparents request) that we should have a dinner.

Day of:

Our relationship is somewhat long distance (cities 2hrs away) Over social media I ask the time and suggest a restaurant,... He takes a few hrs to respond to this with the comment that his brother works late so itll be just his grandparents (his g-parents stay w his brother when in town)

I comment to make sure its JUST us, several times (why would the brother join in such an intimate and important occasion for me)

I get a yes, ""just my grandparents""...Im really nervous... Leave work early and start to prepare, unwind/shower... (Im introducing parents to a new family after a separation from LTR of 6yrs)

Two hrs before reservation, he makes it into the city and nonchalantly comments how his brother and brothers girlfriend will be joining.

Our intimate reservation turns into a large party, with no communication to me about it, he even called and altered my previous reservation beforehand he tells me.

I became more upset as the scenario unfolded, I got 6 words in the whole night to my dad, the seating was awkward, my parents speak english OK, but not fluent... His grandparents speak decent spanish, Id wanted to bridge the divide but with an extra couple at dinner the convo turned mostly english and the night got away from me, it was draining trying to keep it together, afterwards my SO apologized saying it was ""just a dinner"" and ""didnt think Id mind"" the extra company..

I felt robbed of my experience and still feel like it was unfair to my parents, ive asked my SO to give me a weekend (when we usually see each other) just to get over it. If I could have cancelled I would, I felt hostage going there and didnt enjoy the experience, I dont even know what my parents and his g-parents talked about,

Am i the asshole blowing this out of proportion? 

His brothers girlfriend was really sweet and mid dinner re seated herself at the end of the table so we could be closer to my parents... She clearly didnt know my parents were meeting the fam for the first time.

It was so awkward, and I dont know exactly WHY this has bothered me so much. Ive asked for space but is it unfair to my SO?

Edit:
Yes my SOs brother is awesome and for further background, after several months of not seeing the g-parents on the night they arrived we all had dinner and said brother opted out because ""he had to work out"" several dinners and outings have happened since (not like it would garner ""left out"" feelings), ? ?

yes this was a major step in the relationship, and yes it is so drenched w cultural pressure, the personal ""feel robbed"" ""held hostage"" is the best way to illustrate my feelings, although I didnt act this way that night and more so my question is about the space.... I feel like im punishing my SO, (which makes me feel doubly bad) but know no other way than to think about whats happened because of the hype my culture puts on this and how casually it was treated, had i known the changes more that two hrs before the rez, again, id reschedule because i wouldnt want to offend my parents (im THAT daughter from super traditional upbringing ""divorced"" and now dating again, im first gen, raised here but not born in US). 

Also, previous to this wed had an opportunity to make this meeting happened and long story short, it didnt because neither of us was ready but prompted by my SO making the comment that my fam was busy. (Yes infront of me without discussing) There are some unspoken things about this and which aggravate the presence of another party who can have dinner with us all at a few hrs notice being interjected. 

I feel its so complicated but as I write this understand its mainly a disconnect between traditions that Ill probably just always battle internally and I do accept TA judgements because these pressures should end and they are so unhealthy for me to carry, wow thanks reddit.",49,56,0.79
1950,Asshole,"Throwaway but I suppose it’s in vain since this is so specific.          
      
My sister and her wife were trying to make a baby in the same span of time that my husband and I were and we are both pregnant now, and about a week and a half apart in our due dates. She’s expecting twins (boy and girl), I’m expecting a little boy.      
       
We all live together so there has definitely been some tension between her and I in regards to our baby showers. We realized we had each planned ours the same day and she told me I could take the Saturday and she’d take Sunday since we had family coming from out of town and that way it’d be easier.       
             
However, our baby showers were last weekend and she blatantly one-upped me in every way. She hired herself and I a DJ, but had way more elaborate decorations and expensive food for hers. She completely transformed our backyard and our friends and family ranted and raved. She had beautiful cheese platters and little finger foods. I couldn’t afford much so mine was a pretty run of the mill baby shower, but she knew that. Seeing everyone speak so highly of her shower was infuriating. They also gave her way more gifts than myself.         
         
I posted on my Facebook— “pretty sad when you feel the need to one-up family just because you’re having one more baby than me”. She came to me in my room and told me that first of all, she didn’t have to get me a DJ but she did, that it’s not her problem that I can’t afford more lavish things, and that she’s having one more baby so her getting more gifts isn’t a jab at me, just a logical fact of having twins vs one kid. I told her that she didn’t need to get such extravagant things knowing it’d make my shower pale in comparison and she told me to fuck off and walked away.         
         
My sister sent me a long text when she was at work saying to give them space and that I’m acting like a brat. My husband agrees that she blatantly wanted to make me look bad since we had our showers a day apart, and it was clear by how much money she put into it.          
      
I think that if youre having a shower the day after your family, you shouldn’t try to do everything in your power to have a better one. Also, I think it’s shitty for family to spend more money on her than myself, twins or not. Am I the asshole here?      
      
TLDR: sister’s wife blatantly one-upped my shower that was the day before hers by having expensive food and boujee decor, and our guests bought her more baby stuff than myself. She thinks I’m being immature but I think this is intentional.",637,1192,0.86
1951,Not the A-hole,"I work for an apartment complex in a program funded by the city housing authority that offers free after school and summer programs for the residents' elementary school-aged children. I’m here 9:30-5:30 M-F, the kids go to different schools and get dropped off at different times.

* After School: homework help, tutoring, work alongside teachers, dismissal at 5:30
* Summer: 10a-5p; instructional time, play, fitness, reading, pool, field trips

The reason I'm having an internal dilemma, in short, is this: She's sending her husband to work for her. During the  last two weeks of the summer program she bailed on me because she ""overbooked"" herself. I didn't understand what this could mean at the time, but I was suddenly in charge of 24 children on my own. She was having an unpaid volunteer cover her class time for her, who left at 2, and her husband would come after that, occasionally, to ""help with monitoring them at the pool"" (read: Instagram). I about lost my mind after day 8 of no supervisor. I've seen her twice since.

Yesterday was the first day of school, and I got a call at 1:30 that was, ""Hey! Is everything ready?"" *Yes. Just have to put the chairs at the tables.* ""Okay, cool, just remember that the first bus is supposed to arrive at 2:40 and that there will be three coming this year."" *Yep, talked to \[mothers\] about it individually yesterday.* ""Amazing! \[Husband\] will be there around X time."" *Ooookay?* ""See you when I see you, bye!""  I asked her husband if there was anything going on because I was concerned, he said, ""Oh, her schedule and my schedule got flipped so you're gonna see a lot more of me around here. She'll do \[our program\] in the morning and I'll be here in the afternoons like, every other day or somethin'.""

Here's where I start to pull my hair out:

* \[Husband\] is not an employee. He is a hairdresser who DJ's on the side.
* He's worked for similar programs and at-risk children in the past, and uses money and toys as bribes for behavior changes. This goes against policy and our personal rules.
* He lies in the library room with the bean bag chairs and stares at his phone.
* We're not allowed to bring our children to work, but he does.
* She's been fudging her time sheets to say she's been here.
* No one from the office has even noticed or asked about this.

At this point I've assumed that she has a higher paying job somewhere else. I've also admitted to myself that this is affecting me negatively.

1952,Asshole,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I'm a technophobe.

I've been at my job for about six months now, and I have a coworker who started a few weeks after me. Even though we've only been there a few months, since we started there she's lost 4 family members (an aunt, a cousin, two grandparents. Her cousin died a week ago). Understandably she's been quite affected by it. She says she doesn't feel like she can take time off because there's too much work to split between the rest of us, which I agree with - we wouldn't be able to cope. 

The result of that is that we have to put up with her morbid sense of humour. For example, she had some chocolate in the office fridge and I didn't know it was hers, so I asked whose it was and she said ""oh, that's my bereavement chocolate, it gets me through the day."" When I asked her about her weekend plans, she said ""probably a few funerals, a bit of mourning, maybe an impromptu phonecall to say someone else has kicked the bucket."" Another time, she was making everyone coffee (I admit she usually ends up being the one to do this as no-one else makes it as nicely) and she said something like ""of course, it should be you all making me coffee, seeing as I'm the one whose family are dropping like flies."" She said it in a jokey way but it made me uncomfortable. I get that she needs to talk about this stuff and is probably trying to do it in the least depressing way but death is death and I don't see why we should all hear about it all the time.

It's worth saying that she's generally really nice and jokey and it's just that sometimes the jokes are too morbid. She isn't death 24-7. It just comes out every now and again and it's like... ok.

She's in bereavement counselling so wibta for asking her not to talk about death unless it's with her therapist?",176,511,0.89

1954,Not the A-hole,"Sorry for format as I'm using a cellphone. And this is my first post. 

This happened about 2 years ago but it had recently come up again and now I'm wondering if I was an ass or bitchy about it.

A bit of background: I had been living with my friend and roommate S for a few years but financial issues sprung up and we each had to move back in with family. I had moved several states over but because how sudden the move was, I couldn't change doctors and such until much later. I had a chemo appointment coming up back near where I used to live and S said I could spend the week at her family's place as I went thru the treatment.

I woke up one morning with both S and I in our pjs, baggy wool bottoms and spaghetti straps for both of us, but I had also been wearing a bra as I would have been uncomfortable without one. S's mom starting complaining about seeing my bra and didn't want her husband seeing that sort of thing and demanded that I change right away. I was super upset and couldn't see what the big deal was since this is the same type of pjs I would wear around my family, including my own dad and younger brother.  And S's dad clearly wasn't paying me any attention until his wife starting mentioning it. 

So I did exactly what she wanted and changed shirts. But she never specified what I should wear so I put on a thin white shirt that clearly showed my bra. 

So, was I the ass?",38,88,0.88

1956,Not the A-hole,"So here in my workplace, people gather up some money from everyone (except for the birthday person) to buy some decorations and a cake to celebrate coworker's birthdays. It's only 4$ per person and we total like 10 people in my department. Just this month, there have been 2 birthdays for which I paid.

So my birthday came and I was expecting the same treatment... but no, no cake or decorations for me. Everyone did congratulate me and wished me well, so they didn't forget it. I'm not one to mind the lack of celebration, specially coming from coworkers, but the fact that I contributed to other people's celebration while not getting the ""favor"" returned does make me feel bad.

So I'm obviously not gonna get mad at anyone for not doing so, but I do want to stop contributing to future celebrations, because everyone gets theirs and not me so why bother? However, if I stop contributing anyone person paying attention can figure out that I might be doing it out of spite, which is probably true, but honestly I don't see why I have to celebrate other's birthday while mine doesn't get any special treatment.

1957,Not the A-hole,"OK I've been dating her for about 9 months. My parents live across the country from me and came to visit this past weekend and met her for the first time. We went out to dinner and she told my parents that they looked so much alike they could be siblings...which in my opinion they don't at all. They both just have glasses and are the same race (my GF is a different race than us) and that's it. Like their facial features look nothing alike. My parents laughed a bit but they definitely thought it was strange. GF decided to elaborate and said they must be like the Lannisters. My parents were unfamiliar with the reference so she decided to explain the incest twins to them. I was shocked but luckily the waiter came around right then so we were able to move on. My parents were definitely embarrassed and I felt embarrassed for them because like what the fuck? She's never made weird jokes before so I was pretty taken aback.

My parents left last night (they were staying with me) and I told my GF that what she said was totally inappropriate to my parents and made them uncomfortable.

I added her back, and found out it was a 29 year old lady that who had known me when I was about 8. She had been interested in my much older brother for a while, but he didn't like her so she married some other guy. She started texting me asking me to have sex with her and all these really, really, wierd personal questions. I finally got fed up with her (as I didnt want to have anything to do with her)and just blocked her on snapchat and Instagram. However, she made sure to tell me before hand she was unhappy with her husband and was into younger guys. I asked my older brother about her husband, he said hes a pretty chill dude he had known for some time. I feel bad for the guy, they have a kid together and I would personally want someone to tell me if I was in his place. WIBTA for dming him and telling him?

1959,Not the A-hole,"Me (29m) and my gf (28f) been together for 11 months. Today we had a talk about a trip I'm gonna have with my sister to a foreign country where cigarettes are cheap.

She asked me to bring boxes of cigarettes from that trip. That's something I can't explain to anyone (I don't use cigarettes and I won't be bringing anything to my own family) and it might be problematic at the customs. I didn't want my family to feel bad (they wouldn't want me to carry cigarettes for anyone) so I refused to bring any for her mother. I specifically told her that it's not about her mother but about the cigarettes. She just said that's disrespectful and told me that she no longer cares about wherever I go or whatever I do. I just said nothing and left.

Then I called her to talk about what happened. She just accused me of disrespecting her mother. I told her that she's acting weird and that's not the correct way to think about what happened. She just expects me to accept her mother's will as a law and obey that, no matter what my stance on that topic is like. I explained that we were gonna pick her mother a present, and I am all the way respectful and thankful to her. (I was sick last week and she took care of me with her mother) She thinks that's the only way to act and she also told me to act as I want. (in a threatening way) At that point I lost it and no longer wanted to talk with her.

She then texted me a long message saying things like that I don't care about her, I don't like doing things for her, I make her feel like a burden, etc. These things don't make any sense for me and I sometimes take care of her personal stuff even though it is easier for her to do it herself.

AITA by refusing her request?

TLDR: I was asked by gf to bring cigarettes for her mother from a trip abroad and I kindly refused. Told her specifically that it was not about her mother but the cigarettes. She still made a big deal about it and we had a fight.

1961,Not the A-hole,"Backstory:
I now have my son full time but at first struggled with being a mother immensely due to my age and my depression that was taking a toll on me after the pregnancy. I had a lot of help from my mother.
My mother has a very different parenting style and due to the fact she helped me out a lot she would kind of implement any decisions she wanted. 

Anyway, fast forward to a year ago. My son was 2 then, and I had him over half the time and had my own place and job where I could support him other than with my mom. Even when my son was at my moms house I was still there, almost like we were co parenting. My mother was having a VERY hard time with me taking my son for more time, insisting that he is not ready to be with me until he is older since he is used to her house and her ways of parenting. My son had showed no signs of having a hard time at my home, and not with me at my mothers house either. I insist that he is ready to come with me for another night, making it 5 nights seeing as he is used to me at both houses and I am the biggest constant in his life. When I insist and say it ultimately not her decision, she says that if I try to take him for another night she will take me to court and have him full time with her. Keep in mind, I have a job, place to live, and have never had any drug use, problems with alcohol, the law, ect. After I told her it was fucked up to threaten that over me wanting my son more, it was not brought up again. I ended up getting my day anyway, she has no leg to stand on in court.

Now, after that big argument more problems have arose. The topic itself is rather silly but the micromanaging my parenting is the main issue here. My mom would give my son fluoride drops that he swallows that increase his chances of not having any tooth decay. I spoke to his doctor and his doctor told me that if he has fluoride in the water he drinks and brushes twice a day there is no need for the fluoride, and that he doesn’t want him having too much. My mother has been insisting that I need to give him these drops. She has texted me every morning for a solid two weeks after I told her I was stopping them to “remember to give him his fluoride” or just a “fluoride” text. I have told her my opinion, and that his teeth are in great condition. She then goes on to call my father to remind me, and then goes on to text my partner saying “make sure son gets his fluoride drops. Daughter isn’t giving them to him and it is very important”. My partner thinks this behavior is crossing serious boundaries and that she really needs to back off, seeing as her behavior is still treating me like a child. He says that I should tell her that she is not going to be able to watch my son if she keeps up this behavior. 

WIBTA if I went through with making a threat?

Edit: I have tried to talk to her about this and many other issues civilly, mostly it ends with her upset and she doesn’t talk to me for a few days, and it just gets dropped. There have been a few other issues that I have just let her implement her view on when he is at her house because it just wasn’t a big deal.

1966,Not the A-hole,"So for a little background, I’m 18 and my cousin is 19 and she’s getting married to her fiancé in October. We grew up together and were practically sisters since we’re so close in age and basically lived together growing up so she decided she wanted me to be her maid of honour. I’ve never been to a wedding before so I don’t know what entails in being a guest let alone in the wedding party.
I was never allowed to dye my hair growing up and my mom always told me to wait until I was 18 to do anything to my hair and I patiently waited 18 years to do anything to my hair and yesterday I dyed it pink (not bright pink but a light bubblegum) 
I posted a picture of it on instagram to get validation because that’s what teenagers do, my cousin is PISSED at me for dying my hair when her wedding is 7 weeks away and she publicly commented on my picture that the colour better fade so I don’t look like a bigger fool, of course my friends saw that someone was being mean and one commented “you’re just jealous” and she deleted the comment and so I DMed her to understand what I did wrong.
Me = me and Cuz = cousin
Me: I know you want everyone to look their best (at your wedding) but it’s really none of your business what anyone does with their appearance.
Cuz: You already look like a fool why make it stand out more.
Me: Why are you being so mean?
Cuz: Congrats on the strawberry shortcake hair :)
Me: no you said something that hurt me I want you to explain how I look like a fool.

with that she’s been ignoring me and got her mom to call my grandma and ask what they all thought of my hair and if it will go with my dress and that my friends were bullying her online.

Her wedding is in 7 weeks and I honestly wasn’t even thinking about it when I dyed it but I understand that she wants everyone to look like how she imagined and that I kind of took the control out of her hands for her wedding so I just want an honest opinion on if I’m the asshole , I’ve never been involved in this whole “wedding” stuff",309,610,0.93

1968,No A-holes here,"Some backstory of the situation. Everyone involved in this situation used to be very close friends. My best man, let’s call him Doug and one of the bridesmaids, call her Suzy, used to be together for 8 years and were engaged at the end of their relationship. However Suzy called off the engagement and ended the relationship out of nowhere. (At least it seemed that way at the time) (also not that it really matters, but Doug financially supported her through high school and college when Suzy’s parents pretty much abandoned her)

Added note: my fiancé(let’s call her Jessica), is good friends with Suzy, hence why Suzy is chosen to be a bridesmaid.

We come to find out that Suzy started dating a close friend of mine and Doug’s in secret, until they finally decided to tell everyone. Let’s call him Chad. And there is some evidence that their might of been at least an emotional relation going on between before Suzy ended her relationship with Doug. 
EDIT: They started dating within weeks of Suzy ending the 8 year relationship/1yr engagement

The break up alone took a toll on Doug, took him months to get to get back to normal, it really broke his heart. When we had to break the news to him about Suzy and Chad, it started the grieving process all over again throwing him into a deeper depression, for which he now is going to therapy for.


Now recently, Jessica and I are engaged. And obviously we talk about our wedding plans. Recently our wedding party got brought up with who’s going to be in our wedding. When she mentioned that she wants Suzy to be one of her bridesmaid, I was a little upset at first due to the fact that I am not a huge fan of Suzy after what she did to my good friend Doug. And I am worried that Doug will not come to the wedding if both of them are there together(it really is that bad) so at first I didn’t want neither Suzy or Chad at the wedding

But I realized that our wedding is going to be both of our special day. So I came up with the compromise that Suzy can come, but Chad is not welcome.

Jessica disagrees. She thinks both should be able to come. The funny part is, before we were engaged, Jessica would always talk about how she disapproves of their relationship and how she can care less about ever seeing Chad again.

Jessica is a very passive, non-confrontational person. Which is why I believe she wants both of them to come, just to avoid having to have the conversation with Suzy.

AITA for not wanting Chad at our wedding?

Over the past 6-7 years or so I’ve failed most my exams and classes or have gotten just mediocre grades with an occasional A. I used to be very smart when I was young but some things happened and depression and anxiety finally got to me, I lost all motivation and hope at the age of 11. My parents are calling me lazy and stupid and that they have no hope for my future and that I have done nothing in return for them after they did so much for me. I can’t tell them that I have mental health problems, if I even cried my mom would scream at me and throw a tantrum and tell me to stop crying and that I’m weak.

1970,Asshole,"First things first, I know I was the asshole for snapping, and I’ve apologized to him for my delivery. HOWEVER I strongly feel like the reason for my question isn’t assholey but he really really thinks it is. 

We were trying for a baby for what felt like way too long. We had our miracle baby Isla 4 years ago and admittedly both of us have fallen head over heels in love with her. We do both dote on her and so do her grandparents. 

My husband is a VERY intelligent man, and has probably one of the most interesting jobs I’ve ever heard of at a large scientific institute in the US. He is an educated man and more than that, he is kind, sensitive, even 20 years ago when attitudes were still backwards he was the same as he is now, which are all qualities that made me fall in love with him. 

He has (as I have) instilled in our daughter a deep love of knowledge and intelligence. However recently for the past six months ish I’ve noticed that ALL he does is talk about about beautiful she is. When he comes home from work, the first thing isn’t ‘what cool fact did you learn today?’ It’s ‘oh my gosh your macaroni necklace looks so beautiful on you!’ Etc. 

I have asked him to concentrate more on her abilities, and her achievements, but he has told me it’s bizarre that I want to stop him from expressing his pride. I just feel that it’s sort of ....letting my daughter down that her daddy praises more her looks than anything else. 

The icing on the cake was when we took her in to work and all of his coworkers were fawning over how cute she is. I would have expected him to praise literally anything else, how she’s taken a mini interest in his line of work, anything, but it never came.",1166,3142,0.9

1976,Everyone Sucks,"I work at a shared office building where multiple companies rent out office space.  There is this gentleman (pig is more like it) that smokes multiple times a day right outside of one of the entrances that is near my office window.  For the last year I've watched this guy smoke in this spot and throw his cigarette butts in the landscaping by the door.  There is no ash tray thing at this entrance but there is signage very clearly posted on the door to ""Please smoke in designated smoking area"" which is less than 100 feet around the corner.  Not surprisingly there is an ash tray thing in the designated area... who'd a'thought?!

If I worked with this guy, I wouldn't be so passive aggressive but WIBTA if I found out which car is his and started picking up his butts and putting them on his car hood/windshield/wedged in any little nook of his car or tossing them in his window?

1977,Not the A-hole,"Ok so I've never posted to reddit before but I just really wanted some advice.

So I've been with my partner for 10 months and I've known my best friend for 12 years. S and P have also been friends for about 3 years as they worked together for about 2. I know that would immediately be flagging YTA but please bear with me.

So recently I went on a date with my partner and we where chatting about previous relationships just casually as couples do. Nothing paranoid or jealous just genuine interest.
Now in the middle of conversation he mentions that hes slept with my best friend - we'll call her P - not long before we met. Now I didn't know that, and to be honest it came as quite a shock. I was hurt as to why P hadn't told me this as she had pushed us to go on a blind date together.

Not to mention that she had actually cheated on her boyfriend at the time with my current partner.   My current partner we'll call him 'S' did have feeling for P at the time and she really hurt him by sleeping with him then blanking him to go back to her then boyfriend.

Now I love P but she is a notorious cheater, she has cheated on every partner she has ever had with either one night stands or friends. 

I know it's awful to say but its P I dont trust not S, she used to have feelings for him (they have been friends for about 3 years) and it's just made things feel really messy. S obviously doesnt have feelings for her anymore as we are very much in love but I know what she can be like with ex partners and one night stands.

I did ask P why she didn't tell me, not in an angry way just like 'oh hey so S told me you slept together how come you didn't mention it?' Just super casual and not making a big deal of it.

Now she got super agitated when I asked her, getting really defensive and annoyed with me. It ended up with her walking off saying she didn't have to explain herself to me. I've tried contacting her but she keeps buzzing me off. This has made me more upset as I feel like there shouldnt be a reason to her being so defensive?

S says that I had every right to be curious and is upset at P for blowing this so out of proportion.


So reddit, AITA for being paranoid when they have alone time?",187,911,0.95

I grab a t-shirt (note my bf wears a mens large and I'm an xs in women's)

1982,Not the A-hole,"I've been a cosplayer for about 2 years, but I suck at sewing. So, when I found a character I wanted to cosplay who wore a pretty intricate kimono, I figured it was a little out of my realm. So, I found a commissioner off Facebook who agreed to make it for me. We discussed details of color preferences, fabric types, and means of payment. I also looked through their business FB and Insta and saw that they specialized in kimonos, and that they had many past commissions that everyone seemed very happy with.

The kimono in total would cost $400 (labor, custom fabric, I thought this was fair), paid I 4 $100 payments.

The kimono should be done in time for a convention in late Sep (I started speaking with them in mid June), but I understood that it might not be done in time. Nbd.

Ffw a week. They reach out to me to tell me that they’ll  need my measurements. I had time that day, so I got everything ready and sent them.

No response.

Another week passes, I send the 1st  payment as agreed. I ask how everything was going. They respond that they couldn't start anything without the first payment, so now that they had it, they would start.

That makes sense.

It's now mid-July, and I've heard nothing. My 2nd payment is due. So I send that over and ask again how things are. They inform me that the custom fabric would take the longest since the patterns were being hand-drawn, and they weren't done yet.

That's fine - I figured I wasn't their only commission so I get it. I ask them politely if it would be okay if they let me know when they were done drawing out the pattern so I can see it before they ordered the custom fabric.

No response.

Early-Aug, I haven't heard from them. 3rd  payment due, sent it - I reach out. They tell me they haven't made any more progress because they were away on vacation for 2 weeks and just got back.

That's ... okay. I mean, it would have been nice to know that they were going to be gone but I guess they're not obliged to tell me that kind of personal stuff. I already knew by this point that it wouldn't be done in time, nbd. There are other conventions. But, I was definitely getting pretty anxious about the amount of money I'm spending, and I have yet to receive any kind of photos or proper updates.

My final payment was going to be due the first week of Sep. I was starting to feel like I was getting scammed. I have no proof that anything has been done, and I'm already $300 in. I reached out again and asked politely if I could see progress pictures. No response. So yesterday, I withdrew my payments (save for the first $100, I let them keep that) and told them I wanted to cancel the commission. They were FURIOUS, as expected. But with the amount of money I was spending on this, and the lack of communication, I didn't want to do this anymore.

They have since blocked me, but before doing so, they put a post on FB warning other commissioners not to work with me.

Am I the asshole for doing this?

1986,Asshole,"Obviously some context and examples are needed, but I generally dislike things that have a message written on them and have told my wife I don't want things like that in the house. For example: 'Live Laugh Love' or 'Keep Calm and...' are super tacky, in my opinion, and have no place in a house. I think that if you're going to hang something on the wall it needs to be something meaningful, but abstract enough that other people can find their own meaning in it. Also, I think they're incredibly lazy decorating, you're basically saying 'I am not worth finding something I *actually* like, I'm fine with a $20 sticker! Maybe the only thing I need to turn my life around is a 4'x8' sticker that tells me ""YOU ARE SO LOVED"""".

I've also extended the rule to the clothes my toddler wears (everyone knows that I'm not putting on a shirt with words on it). And my wife will occasionally show me clothes with generic phrases like 'future heart breaker' or 'daddy's source of constant frustration' written in generic typeface. I'll veto, and she will complain a little, but in general understands my point of view. Basically, I don't want my kid to be used as a billboard for either companies or shitty hot takes. On the plus side, I have a ton of photos where I won't have to explain some stupid meme to my kid when she grows up (""You see, there was this thing called 'The Chive' back before you were born...""). When the kid is older they can decide what they want to wear, but until they're a little older I don't want my kid in it.

Am I the asshole for not being flexible on this? It's gotten to the point where we go to people's homes and she'll point out every example of words she sees in people's decor and poke fun at me. But yes, I am inflexible on this rule, if she wants to build an 'Eat Pray Love' nest (the basic girl version of a neckbeard nest), then she can put that stuff in her office.\]

Edit- The things on the walls don't have to be abstract. Most of the stuff on our walls are photographs or prints of horses or birds. I don't care what she chooses to put on the walls, the only thing I care about is that it isn't a giant word. I'm not unilaterally deciding what goes on the walls, but have a criteria, as does my wife who vetos a lot of what I want to put up too. For example, she won't let me hang up old maps anywhere but my office because 'You're not a sea captain'.

Edit 2 - I see that using the word 'let' and rules were poor choices on my part I'll work on that in the future (sincerely thank you for pointing it out). For the record, my wife can buy whatever she wants and wear whatever she wants (that took a weird turn). I honestly don't see myself as a Martinet (but that's what *all* control freaks say), but I'll introspect on that.",1356,3495,0.91
1987,Not the A-hole,"Background: Steve and I dated for two years and broke up seven months ago. It wasn't a particularly ugly breakup, but we've made no effort to stay friends with each other and I for one don't have any desire to have him in my life. We hadn't spoken since we broke up.

Last night at about 6pm Steve calls me. He says he was in a car accident near my apartment and his car needs to be towed away from the scene. He wasn't injured at all, I did at least ask if he was okay. He asked if he could come over to my apartment and wait for his friend to pick him up, because he didn't want to wait by the side of the road. He was about a 15 minute drive away from my apartment. I told him I was in the middle of something and couldn't come pick him up or have him as a house guest right now. He said I was being unfair and it would only be an hour before a friend could get him. I said no, wait at Starbucks or something. He got huffy and hung up on me.

Later that night I got a text from the (mutual) friend that had picked him up telling me that I'm being really selfish and immature and it's dumb to treat an ex like an enemy. I asked one of my friends if she thought I was being too harsh and she agreed because I wasn't actually busy, I just didn't want to go out of my way to pick him up nor did I want to see him at all.

When I first got there, one of my friends brought some weed, which I partook in. I took about 3 hits from the joint, and didnt smoke any more after that. 

I’m a fairly regular user of marijuana, and I know how I feel when I’m high. I was not high last night, and I felt completely fine. 

However, some of my friends were shocked and appalled that I was smoking when I was planning on driving home.

If I felt high, or otherwise impaired, I would not have driven home. However, I felt completely fine and with a sound body and mind to drive home.

1989,Not the A-hole,"Adam and I have been together about 11 months, we get on great and I love him. He's recently given me a key to his place. I texted him asking when he got off work and he said it would be about an hour and did I want to go wait at his place, so I got to the flat and this was the first time I'd been there without him. I unlocked the door, went in, and his mum, Carol, was there.

Carol was doing his chores. She was ironing mine and Adam's clothes with a stack of folded clothing next to her, I could hear the dishwasher and dryer going, and the kitchen had a few cooking pots of different sauces.

I awkwardly greeted Carol because what else could I do in that situation. She said hi back like nothing was weird about this then asked me to take the folded clothing to the bedroom and put it away. I just sort of went with it. Once I'd done that I went back into the living room and Carol was in the kitchen area. She waved me over and had me hold open some sandwich bags while she poured in the sauces. The dryer and dishwasher finished at the same time, and Carol told me to put the dishes back in the cupboards and I watched her go to the dryer and pull out a mix of mine and BF's underwear, which she then began folding. I asked her how long she'd been doing this, to which she replied ""oh, only since he moved out"".

My boyfriend is 29. As far as I'm aware, he has not lived with her since he was 19. He doesn't have any physical or mental issues that could prevent him from doing this, and he is capable of it since we do these chores together all the time, and he is actually better at some of them (eg ironing) than I am.

I asked Carol what was still left to do and she listed off a few things. I told her that I could finish off the chores before BF gets home, no big deal, and she could leave. She then said something like ""ohh, I see. You want to be alone when he gets here"" and winked exaggeratedly which made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.

She left, BF got home, and he could tell something was wrong. He asked me and I just blurted out ""your mum"". He asked for clarification and I basically said I feel that there is absolutely no reason for him, a 29 year old who has lived on his own for a decade now, to still have his mum doing his laundry, and it's ""weird"". He then (angrily) responded that I don't know their relationship, and she ""needs to feel needed"" and that this is a compromise he made with her years ago to keep her out of his hair. I said that there are compromises he could make that don't involve his mother folding his boxers. He repeated that I don't understand their relationship and stormed off.

I feel like I upset him, and I realised he's right, I've only met her a handful of times and I don't really understand their relationship, so maybe I was a bit quick to take an issue with it.

AITA?

Edit: in order to get that laundry she'd had to have gone into Adam's bedroom. It's not exactly a hazard zone in there but we'd left some... stuff... on the nightstand. Which she would have seen.

1993,Not the A-hole,"I rented an apartment with some friends for six years. We split the rent roughly evenly with me paying a little less because my room was smaller. As years passed and people left, I would do a roommate search to replace them, so I was eventually living with an entirely different group. The rent split stayed roughly the same the whole time and we would split raises evenly.

Everyone moved out last year and I took over responsibility for the lease and the full rent by myself as it was getting late in the game and I wasn't sure I would find three new roommates in time, but I wanted to keep living in the place even if I had to pay for an extra room for a month or two. Because I've been here so long and the raises haven't been significant, the full rent is a nice chunk below market at this point. It's still a good deal for the owner since I've been a reliable tenant and they basically haven't had to lift a finger since I moved in, so they don't want to stir the pot too much.

I decided to sublet the remaining three rooms at market price and found people pretty quickly for each of them, so now the share of the rent I end up paying is much smaller than the others' (less than half). One of them recently found out what I was paying for the place - I wasn't keeping it a secret but I also wasn't talking about it. He asked the owner for a copy of the lease for an unrelated reason and saw the price there, and he doesn't feel it's fair for him to be paying a lot more than I am for pretty much the same thing.

Possibly relevant info:

\* I pay all the utilities and monthly cleaning service, and buy houseware/supplies

\* I do all the posting/vetting/interviewing for new tenants

\* I own all the furniture in the common spaces

\* I make more money than any of the current tenants

While on a romantic date in an expensive and fancy restaurant (wasn't my birthday or something), which was nice, although too fancy IMHO, GF surprised me with an expensive outdoor knife. I was very surprised because I never asked for one or hinted for one, although I did tell her once that I may get one for free from my workplace.

I couldn't see when or why I would use that knife, and although it's a nice and appreciated gesture, I told her I can't accept the gift. My reason was that the amount of money it cost was not easy for her to come by with, and she told me she saved up for it.

&#x200B;

As I have seen the situation, It was either I accept the expensive gift and put it somewhere without ever using it, or tell her that I appreciate the gesture but it's too expensive and I will probably never use it so she can get the money back, while risking the chance she will get offended (which she did...).

1996,Not the A-hole,"Throwaway and posting on mobile

Backstory: I (25M) was adopted by my mom when I was only a few months old and i have 2 older brothers (32M and 36M, her bio sons). I was adopted around 2 years after her husband died. My mom is pretty well off so even though she’s a single mom, we live a comfortable life. 

My relationship with my mom and brothers is amazing. If you ask any of them who their favorite family member is, they’ll all probably say me :) Anything my brothers get, I get too. Absolutely no bad blood over this. 

My other relatives and my mom’s friends are a whole other story. They take every opportunity to remind me that I’m adopted. Like they’re better than me because of it. I’ve been told repeatedly to thank god it was my mom that adopted me or else I wouldn’t be rich. I mean, I am thankful because she’s a  good person and a great mom but they make it seem like I was some sort of gold digging baby. 

I’m pretty introverted and try to avoid any confrontations. anytime they say stuff like that my anxiety goes through to the roof! I am actually relieved whenever they exclude from get-togethers and such. Ngl, it feels really bad knowing your “family” doesn’t want you around but I just ignore them and keep to myself most of the time.


Anyway, I sometimes think my mom forgets I’m adopted. She would say things like I got my love for cooking from my “father” (how??), when her cousin commented how much my eldest brother looked like her husband, she goes “yes! Brother and choseone111 really look like him don’t they?” I could feel their eyes rolling at me. I don’t even want to think about what they say about me behind my back.


So now I’m thinking about sitting her down and explaining that it makes me uncomfortable when she says I inherited anything from her husband because I’m adopted. It’s literally impossible. 

WIBTA if I do this? I love my mom more than anything and I don’t want to say anything that could hurt her feelings.
